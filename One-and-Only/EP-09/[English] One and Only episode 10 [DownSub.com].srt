1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
I really can't bear to

3
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,640
let your father go alone.

4
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,590
You did it for me.

5
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,710
It snows.

6
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,000
And these.

7
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,910
Miss Cui,

8
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,000
you have taken a lot of books.

9
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,520
My brothers said

10
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,030
no one would read these books.

11
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,470
It's fine that I take them away.

12
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,190
These are not enough.

13
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
Your Highness, you're in a good mood.

14
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,870
What happened?

15
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,360
Junior sister's mourning has ended

16
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,750
and she is about to set out to the Western State.

17
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,280
Master just received the letter.

18
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,960
Your beloved disciple is coming back.

19
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,150
Drink.

20
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,560
Are you going to

21
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,310
take away all books

22
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,360
collected by dad?

23
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,240
Feng.

24
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,360
There are some changes in Nanxiao.

25
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,680
I need to go back to Shouyang ahead of schedule.

26
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,360
So I can't escort you to the Western State.

27
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,750
It doesn't matter.

28
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,000
General Cui will protect me.

29
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,870
Don't worry.

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,150
Tell His Highness

31
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,120
I'm waiting for him in Shouyang.

32
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,710
Take care.

33
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,510
He seems to be much thinner.

34
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,070
And he looks blue.

35
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,800
The servants in their mansion said

36
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
the princess often

37
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,830
forces him to marry

38
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,480
those two remote sisters of

39
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,270
the Qi family.

40
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,800
Why do they force him to take a concubine?

41
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,159
Empress Dowager ordered that

42
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,510
the princess must give birth to

43
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,360
a son of the Qi family and the Cui family.

44
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,390
The princess seems reluctant to have a child,

45
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,270
so she came up with a compromise.

46
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,159
How many books do you want to take?

47
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,480
They must be carried by several carriages.

48
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,480
Others might think

49
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
I am sending your dowries.

50
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,480
Load the carriages.

51
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm afraid it'll be too late tomorrow.

52
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,680
Miss Cui can't bear any delay.

53
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,920
She's eager to set out.

54
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,360
After Shiyi left,

55
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,430
the yard is empty.

56
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,390
Why don't you keep her stay?

57
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,190
At her age,

58
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,510
she should have finished her training.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,630
She doesn't need to go back to the Western State.

60
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,159
If possible,

61
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,159
I hope she won't follow our

62
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,560
or Feng's path.

63
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,800
Since her engagement with the royal family

64
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,560
was broken off,

65
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,720
they have been trying to

66
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,190
seek marriage.

67
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,720
She has to go back to the Western State

68
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,040
to avoid it.

69
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,600
Master.

70
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,240
Liu Changshan,

71
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,510
we met last time

72
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,040
in the Taiji Palace.

73
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,720
I admit defeat

74
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,040
to you.

75
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,390
I'm yours.

76
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,750
I won't kill you.

77
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,160
Only His Majesty

78
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,390
can kill you.

79
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,510
What are you sighing at?

80
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,159
I'm thinking

81
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,360
how my ancestors would feel

82
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,510
seeing their descendants

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
fighting each other.

84
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,240
It's tiring to suppress the rebellion.

85
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,950
You'd better think about

86
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,800
whether it will rain these days.

87
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,070
Why?

88
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,270
Does it matter?

89
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,750
If it rains,

90
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,310
march is slow

91
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,240
and you can see Miss Cui

92
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,560
after some days.

93
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,720
If it doesn't rain,

94
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,950
you can see her earlier.

95
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,870
I had a mansion before I became a monk.

96
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,720
I also had my wives.

97
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,270
You can hide it from your disciples,

98
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,270
but not me.

99
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,720
What are you talking about?

100
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,920
You're mysterious.

101
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,750
The Prince of Fengyang is recalling

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,310
his past romantic affairs.

103
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,750
Miss Cui.

104
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,600
Give them some grains.

105
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,190
They've been prepared.

106
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,159
Miss Cui, you go up on the carriage.

107
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,430
I will give them the grains.

108
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,310
We must arrive at the Azure Dragon Temple before dark.

109
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,600
I don't want you to be in any danger.

110
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,310
Thank you.

111
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,480
Thank you.

112
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,800
It's a royal banner.

113
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,600
Miss Cui.

114
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,200
Miss Cui.

115
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,120
General Gan.

116
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,720
How is my master's

117
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,600
suppressing rebellion?

118
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,270
We won.

119
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,000
Look.

120
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,150
These are the treasures

121
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,030
the rebel collected privately.

122
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,200
I'm transporting them back.

123
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,840
Our army

124
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,790
is traveling back.

125
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,030
The generals are eager to meet you.

126
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,120
Prepare some water for the soldiers.

127
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,390
Got it.

128
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,670
No, thanks.

129
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,030
We need to go back to the Western State as early as possible.

130
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,150
You've had a hard day.

131
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,270
Please take care.

132
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,200
Miss Cui, they've gone far.

133
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,840
When we arrive at the Western State,

134
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,080
we can see the royal banner everywhere.

135
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,150
When we came here last time,

136
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,080
this place was in ruins.

137
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,240
Go.

138
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,840
Well, be careful.

139
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,600
We are from

140
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,790
Nanchen Royal Mansion.

141
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,910
We pass by here today,

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,480
and we would like to spend the night here.

143
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,510
Miss,

144
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,630
The temple is renovated under fund from

145
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
the junior Prince of Nanchen.

146
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,910
You may live here as you like.

147
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,870
But it's much shabbier

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,840
than the Western Sate.

149
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,910
It doesn't matter.

150
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,720
Go get some food

151
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
to give it to them.

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,630
Got it.

153
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,670
Thank you.

154
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,600
This way, please.

155
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,510
I wonder if master

156
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,960
once came here.

157
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,030
Buddha bless. Please protect my master.

158
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,200
Hope I can meet him returning triumphant early.

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,630
I want to meet Miss Cui!

160
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,360
Stop!

161
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,790
Miss Cui!

162
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,670
I want to meet Miss Cui!

163
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,320
Take him down.

164
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,870
Wait.

165
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,150
I want to meet Miss Cui!

166
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,000
Who are you?

167
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,150
Why do you want to meet me?

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,670
Are you Miss Cui

169
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,510
from Nanchen Royal Mansion?

170
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,240
Yes.

171
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,630
Yongcheng is being encircled.

172
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,910
Please help us!

173
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,960
Why don't you dispatch a letter of emergency to

174
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,910
the regional princes?

175
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,200
We did, to all of them.

176
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,440
Prefectural Governor of Yongcheng wrote

177
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,630
nine letters of emergency.

178
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,630
Nine persons were ordered to dispatch the letter to areas around.

179
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,200
I'm the one dispatched to seek help from the Prince of the Beihai.

180
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,840
What did he say?

181
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,550
He invited me to drink tea.

182
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,030
He refused to dispatch troops

183
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,150
and said

184
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,030
he did want to help us,

185
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,960
but it was most important to

186
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,510
protect his own fief

187
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,910
in this chaotic world.

188
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,320
What about other princes?

189
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,750
Did they also refuse to aid?

190
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,200
According to the nine persons dispatched,

191
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,390
only the junior Prince of Nanchen and the Prince of Pingqin

192
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,320
did not reply

193
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
as they were out of their fiefs.

194
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,200
Other princes

195
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,840
all refused to help.

196
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,910
I saw several thousand soldiers and horses of the Cui family

197
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,080
at the foot of the mountain.

198
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
I guessed you were here

199
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,600
so I broke in.

200
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,200
Please save Yongcheng.

201
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,240
Cui Shou.

202
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,360
Miss Cui,

203
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,600
we have only 3,000 soldiers.

204
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,870
There are less than 2,000 soldiers

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,440
but tens of thousands of people in Yongcheng.

206
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,000
Even if we have only 300 soldiers,

207
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,120
we can't abandon our people

208
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,200
and peers.

209
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,030
Set out to Yongcheng now.

210
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,320
I got it!

211
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Thank you, Miss Cui.

212
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm going to select a horse for you.

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,510
No, you can't go.

214
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,480
I will follow you wherever you go.

215
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,120
You hide the books in the temple

216
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,390
and pick a horse. You go back to the Western State

217
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,440
and wait for my master.

218
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,270
Tell him

219
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,600
I'm waiting for him in Yongcheng.

220
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,120
Go.

221
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,790
The enemy army has withdrawn.

222
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,720
Miss Cui?

223
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,630
Go into the city.

224
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,030
Miss Cui, why do you come here?

225
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,120
You don't know how to fight a battle.

226
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,080
I met General Yang Shao

227
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,910
and come here to reinforce you.

228
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,270
With you here,

229
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,750
I feel uneasy as I am worried about your safety.

230
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,600
The enemy's reinforcements

231
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,840
are five li away from us.

232
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,480
Do you want to put her into danger?

233
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,870
I've never fought a battle,

234
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,720
but my escorts

235
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,030
are all battle-scarred.

236
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,390
Let's stop talking about this.

237
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,790
When did you come?

238
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,360
Why did the enemy army retreat?

239
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,480
I beat them back.

240
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,960
I set out as soon as I received the message.

241
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,960
Royal Army of Nanchen has never been defeated.

242
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,200
We're not like these weak scholars.

243
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,030
Do you have training at ordinary times?

244
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,320
Why are you so weak?

245
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,440
General,

246
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
why don't you ask

247
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,720
how many soldiers

248
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,440
we had

249
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,360
when we were trapped these days?

250
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,000
You are famous indeed,

251
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,600
but we are not weak.

252
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,200
I…

253
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,630
Generals, stop quarrelling.

254
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,080
Where's Prefectural Governor of Yongzhou?

255
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,840
He died in the battle.

256
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,790
Let's first check the defense of the city.

257
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,550
We're not in the Western State.

258
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,440
Both you and I are not familiar with it.

259
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,720
Let's go up to the city wall.

260
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,320
Miss Cui,

261
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,240
are you familiar with the defense of the Western State?

262
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,360
The Western State is my hometown.

263
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,390
I should be familiar with it.

264
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,150
Be careful. Be careful.

265
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,120
Come on.

266
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,670
Come on.

267
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,320
The defense is too bad.

268
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,360
Call all bowmen up here.

269
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:16,840
Yes.

270
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,960
Prepare catapults.

271
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,790
What do you mean?

272
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,360
Do you want to go against me?

273
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,960
I dare not.

274
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,120
Their army is coming.

275
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,670
Archers, get ready.

276
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,910
Miss Cui, go inside.

277
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,150
It's very dangerous here.

278
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,440
Miss Cui,

279
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,670
please go inside.

280
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,160
Fire up.

281
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,829
Shoot.

282
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,480
Charge.

283
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,270
Master, Tianxing.

284
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,440
No, thanks.

285
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,640
No, thanks.

286
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,790
Has the advisor sent the order?

287
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:55,750
Yes.

288
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,070
Here you are. Eat something.

289
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,880
Don't worry.

290
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,590
Did you really marry?

291
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,440
You must have had

292
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,350
a wife

293
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,880
and many concubines.

294
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,200
Yes, I had some women.

295
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,590
Where did they go

296
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,920
after you became a monk?

297
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,640
They were dismissed.

298
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,510
So ruthless.

299
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,640
Master.

300
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,440
Master, Yongcheng has been surrounded.

301
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,200
Shiyi and General Gan

302
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,240
went there with reinforcements.

303
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,070
Who?

304
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,680
It's Junior Shiyi, master.

305
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,680
Master,

306
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,200
I'll first go reinforce them with the cavalry.

307
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,440
Cavalry, get ready.

308
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,160
Yes.

309
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,240
I'll first go with the cavalry.

310
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,200
Xiaoyu, Tianxing,

311
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,400
go cut off the enemy's route of retreat.

312
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,200
Feng Qiao,

313
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,550
go reinforce us with the infantry later.

314
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,960
Yes.

315
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,790
General Yang, the gate is in danger.

316
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Defend it to death.

317
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,590
Yes.

318
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,550
Quickly. We're the closest to Yongcheng.

319
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,030
The Royal Army is coming.

320
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,790
It's Xie Yun's cavalry.

321
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,680
General,

322
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,000
will we enter the city?

323
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,880
It's very dangerous to open the gate now.

324
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,880
First repulse the enemy.

325
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,590
Xie Yun.

326
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,160
General Yang, open the gate quickly.

327
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,200
If we open the gate,

328
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,070
we can't block

329
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,550
the coming enemy.

330
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,310
Miss Cui,

331
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,590
there're no military forces in the city,

332
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,030
so we can't open the gate.

333
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,720
Do you want me

334
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,270
to leave Xie Yun in the lurch?

335
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,400
General, I'm late.

336
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,030
My leg was broken.

337
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,000
Leave quickly.

338
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,000
Leave.

339
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,200
Let's live

340
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,680
or die together.

341
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,720
General Gan.

342
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,510
Master is coming.

343
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,110
Go kill the enemy's generals.

344
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,310
Retreat.

345
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,200
Retreat.

346
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,030
Xie Yun.

347
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,680
Sorry.

348
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,750
General Gan was killed.

349
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,310
You've done a good job.

350
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,720
It's I who came late.

351
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:44,070
Thank you for saving me.

352
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,790
Gan,

353
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,030
thank you for saving Yongcheng.

354
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,440
How long didn't we meet?

355
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,680
One year and seven months.

356
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,310
During this period,

357
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
the Royal Army went north

358
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,160
and regained 13 cities.

359
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,960
As usual,

360
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,920
I've kept the vanquished generals' seals

361
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,440
for you.

362
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,830
I didn't experience any seizure battle,

363
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,830
so I thought it's interesting

364
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,030
to keep them.

365
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,070
Today,

366
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,550
I know

367
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,240
you've been in various battles these years.

368
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,510
Master.

369
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,270
This general wants to see you.

370
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,480
My greetings, Your Highness.

371
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
Have you helped the city people settle down?

372
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,590
Yes.

373
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,200
I'll go back to the Western State tomorrow.

374
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,270
I'll leave 20,000 troops for you.

375
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,550
I'll also leave.

376
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,550
As a guarding general,

377
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,550
why do you leave?

378
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,830
Do you worry about the city

379
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,880
or me?

380
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
Both.

381
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,480
With His Highness's Royal Amy,

382
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,070
the city will be strongly fortified.

383
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,110
I'm disappointed

384
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,510
about Beichen,

385
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,070
so I don't want to defend the city here.

386
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,480
Miss Cui,

387
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,400
I owe you a life

388
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,790
forever.

389
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
Please take care.

390
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,750
What does he mean?

391
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,110
Prefectural governor died at his post.

392
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,750
Nine people went to rescue him,

393
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,960
but only he survived.

394
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,920
Why did

395
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,000
only he survive?

396
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,440
It's because

397
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,750
Shiyi saved

398
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,510
him.

399
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,200
Since ancient times,

400
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,550
the beauties have liked to marry

401
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,200
the heroes who saved them.

402
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,750
I'm afraid

403
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,750
he has fallen

404
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,110
in love with Shiyi.

405
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,550
Xiaoyu, stop kidding.

406
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,480
I'll go to see Xie Yun.

407
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,720
Send people to keep an eye on Yang Zhao

408
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,350
and see whom

409
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,070
he'll surrender to.

410
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,830
Yes, master.

411
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,640
Why does master

412
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,510
keep an eye on a petty guarding general?

413
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,160
He must have his own worry.

414
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,310
You asked me

415
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,200
to explain the march strategies

416
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,270
south of the Yangtze River to you,

417
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,750
but you didn't

418
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,440
hear a word.

419
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,350
How do you

420
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,350
know that?

421
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,030
I've seen through the mortal world.

422
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,790
Obviously,

423
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,200
you're watching the sand table,

424
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,110
but you're thinking your girl.

425
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,790
Your Highness.

426
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,440
How is Xie Yun?

427
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,440
General Xie,

428
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,030
General Xie…

429
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,830
Go ahead.

430
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,480
I'm afraid

431
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,550
he can't ride forever.

432
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,070
It's lucky

433
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,480
for you to escape with bare life every time.

434
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,000
Feng Qiao,

435
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,440
are you praising or laughing at me?

436
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,440
I've fought hard

437
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,240
and never thought to escape every time.

438
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,750
It sounds

439
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,000
I am only good at escaping.

440
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,000
Let me check your injury.

441
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,440
You must be crazy.

442
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,750
I'm not your enemy.

443
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,550
I'm worried about you.

444
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,270
It hurts.

445
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,920
Shiyi.

446
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,070
Shiyi, ask

447
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,680
Feng Qiao to leave now.

448
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,070
Have noodles.

449
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,030
Look.

450
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,960
This is my good junior sister.

451
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,750
I'll go and ask

452
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,400
whether the monk, a prince of Nanxiao,

453
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,000
has any good medicine.

454
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,030
Maybe he has some miraculous medicine

455
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,550
which can't be found in our place.

456
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,070
No need.

457
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,240
Our medicine is effective.

458
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,750
Don't bother him.

459
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,110
Here you are.

460
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,760
Why do you all

461
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,440
trust this monk?

462
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,960
I think

463
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,550
he, a spy in our army,

464
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,400
is good at gaining our sympathy.

465
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,070
Master trusts him,

466
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:29,920
and so do I.

467
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,960
Why do you all

468
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,550
trust an enemy from Nanxiao?

469
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,230
Does it hurt?

470
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,840
As your model,

471
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,320
I can endure it.

472
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,230
Xie Yun,

473
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,880
do you blame me?

474
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,360
Why do I blame you?

475
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,480
I didn't open the gate for you.

476
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,320
Luckily, you didn't do it.

477
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,670
Though you've read military science,

478
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,360
you know little about the seizure battle.

479
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,230
The gate is of vital importance.

480
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,480
Once it's broken by the enemy,

481
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,110
the city

482
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,280
will be lost for sure.

483
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
What Xie Yun said is right.

484
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,760
Leave us alone.

485
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,030
I'll say something with him.

486
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,400
Why are you standing here?

487
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,880
Master is talking with Xie Yun,

488
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,230
so he asked me to come out.

489
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,710
What are they talking about secretly?

490
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,030
I don't know.

491
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,590
Master.

492
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,030
Go inside.

493
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,670
Shiyi, I…

494
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,480
Feng Qiao, go inside first.

495
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,280
I'll go with master.

496
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,070
Did you make master angry?

497
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,320
I fetched you medicine,

498
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,550
but the monk said it's not that effective

499
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,670
as your bone was hurt.

500
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,190
This medicine is more effective for injuries.

501
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,230
Xie Yun.

502
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,190
If you don't like the monk,

503
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,440
I won't mention him.

504
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Do you like him?

505
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,800
I…

506
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,480
I was kidding.

507
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,230
Never mind.

508
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,630
I am

509
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,150
sad

510
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,760
about something.

511
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,960
Master, what's the matter?

512
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,670
Nothing.

513
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,400
I need a walk.

514
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,230
You're obviously worried about something.

515
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,360
It flashed

516
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,030
through my mind that

517
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,920
you've accompanied me to fight hard

518
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,670
these years.

519
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,030
You're lying.

520
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,030
I failed to live up to adviser

521
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,280
and his instructions.

522
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,840
I failed to take good care of you.

523
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,670
I'll be on duty tonight.

524
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,840
Go back to Prefectural Governor's Mansion.

525
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,070
Yes.

526
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,360
You and your master

527
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,510
are about the same age,

528
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,150
but he has to take his responsibility

529
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,110
as your master.

530
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,630
He blames himself

531
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,710
for General Xie's injury.

532
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,710
Master hasn't come back.

533
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,590
Has he had breakfast?

534
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,480
General Hong.

535
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,710
Master.

536
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,230
Has Shiyi had breakfast?

537
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,670
Yes.

538
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,360
But she had no appetite.

539
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,710
The city has been surrounded for several months,

540
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,400
so there's

541
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,590
no good food.

542
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,550
After going back to the royal mansion,

543
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,710
find someone to make

544
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,000
her favorite dishes.

545
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,230
Yes, master.

546
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,840
Master has been on duty for three days,

547
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,920
and Xie Yun has locked himself in the room for three days.

548
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,150
Yang Zhao, what are you doing?

549
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,400
Freeze.

550
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,510
Yang Zhao,

551
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,440
let go of Feng Qiao.

552
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,550
Shiyi, don't come over.

553
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,630
I only have a request.

554
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,190
Let me take away Liu Changshan.

555
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,550
Why do you want him?

556
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,440
It's none of your business.

557
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,550
Get him to me.

558
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,000
Go get him.

559
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,800
Yes.

560
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,190
Don't come over.

561
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,400
Yang Zhao,

562
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,190
if I had known

563
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,710
you're as cruel as a wolf,

564
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,150
I wouldn't have helped you.

565
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,190
Miss Cui,

566
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,800
I have my reason to save him.

567
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,710
Freeze.

568
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,840
If you don't force him,

569
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,360
he won't hurt Shiyi.

570
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,550
General Yang,

571
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,110
do you come to save me?

572
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,590
Cut the cackle. Go with me.

573
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:06,670
Prepare a carriage for me

574
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,670
outside the city.

575
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,070
Prepare a carriage.

576
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,840
Yes.

577
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,070
Miss Cui, sorry.

578
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,150
As you have no kung fu,

579
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,550
I can leave here more safely.

580
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,000
Go.
