1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,310
I promise you,

3
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,000
the title of Prince of Fengyang,

4
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,430
you can have it, too.

5
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,479
I am now a Buddhist monk.

6
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,120
Come on, as the Prince of Fengyang.

7
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,840
Though you had a tonsure.

8
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,590
You still have a worldly heart.

9
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,039
Let's see, when you take revenge of your blood feud

10
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,479
and then tell me

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,840
if you want this title or not.

12
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,950
I.

13
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,000
Says the Emperor,

14
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,150
all you have to do is to take the edict.

15
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,400
No more disobedience.

16
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,840
I accept.

17
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,910
That's right.

18
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,280
When are you setting off, Uncle?

19
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,750
Tomorrow.

20
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,400
So, when are we going to see each other again?

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,590
Better be never for the rest of our life.

22
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,150
Did I make any mistakes

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,430
so that you are annoyed at me?

24
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,000
The fact that I am back

25
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,190
means something big is going to happen.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
That's why I

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,750
would rather not see you for the rest of my life

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,400
and look to the east towards the Central State from the Western State

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,430
and wish you to become a wise emperor.

30
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,590
I admire you

31
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,840
that you can have a group of talented men and women.

32
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,910
I was wondering if I can have one of your men.

33
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,280
Who is it?

34
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
May I ask the Counselor

35
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,190
to stay in the Central State and assist me

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,080
like you did to lecture the late emperor?

37
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,240
Are you thinking about the Counselor, Master?

38
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,630
Counselor to me,

39
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,400
is like a teacher, a father.

40
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,560
I won't feel at ease

41
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,680
if I let him stay in the capital.

42
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,910
You are back, Counselor.

43
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,840
I am here to say farewell to His Highness.

44
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,120
You want to stay?

45
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,630
Yes.

46
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,360
His Majesty didn't ask you to make the choice.

47
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,470
You still have the chance to think about it.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,030
I know.

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,280
Your Highness is concerned about me.

50
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,480
Back then,

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,829
I was asked by the late emperor

52
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,390
to follow Your Highness out of the Palace.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,510
How time flies.

54
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,310
We have now over ten years of experience of

55
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,600
fighting next to each.

56
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,560
Now that Your Highness can totally

57
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,720
handle the job on your own.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,270
Whether I am there or not

59
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,800
won't make a difference.

60
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,240
Your Highness.

61
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,680
Whenever and wherever,

62
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,070
you will always be my right-hand man,

63
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,870
part of my body,

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,630
You should never get hurt,

65
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,160
nor severed.

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,070
I can now die without regret

67
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,480
after hearing what you said, Your Highness.

68
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,360
His Majesty is still quite young

69
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,390
and there is no one he could turn for help.

70
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,310
That's why I

71
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,390
decide to stay and assist him.

72
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,630
Just like I assisted you before.

73
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,830
Okay.

74
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,800
Since you have made your decision,

75
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,750
I am gonna have to let you go.

76
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,680
Counselor,

77
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,680
remember this,

78
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,120
the Western State

79
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,159
is always waiting for you to come back.

80
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,270
Okay.

81
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,240
I also want to ask Your Highness a favor.

82
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
On that day,

83
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,430
please bury me in the Western State.

84
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,680
Your Highness.

85
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,160
When is your wedding with the Princess?

86
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,360
In three years.

87
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,560
The last words of my father says

88
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,870
I don't have to get restrained by the three-year mourning period for his death.

89
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,160
The sooner, the better.

90
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,120
And so is the Empress's opinion.

91
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,800
When did the Empress want this to happen?

92
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,720
Before I go back to Qinghe County.

93
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,120
She wants the Princess

94
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,159
to accompany me back to Qinghe County

95
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,360
and observe mourning rituals for my father.

96
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,950
Even if we ignore the mourning period,

97
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,360
how are we going to hold the wedding ceremony?

98
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,750
According to the Empress' edict,

99
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,830
there won't be any wedding ceremony

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,240
as the marriage is complete

101
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,390
once the Princess is sent to the Mansion.

102
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,000
You.

103
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I will be going back within two years.

104
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,390
Look how worried Shiyi gets.

105
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,560
Lest His Highness doesn't want her back.

106
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,510
I was thinking about the time

107
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,000
to see if I can pick you up in person.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,040
By then,

109
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,360
I should be in Six Garrison.

110
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,000
The state affairs are more important,

111
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,190
I can go back on my own.

112
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,750
The state and family affairs are equally important.

113
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,000
Even if I couldn't make it to see her off,

114
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,430
General Cui Shou's gonna be my place.

115
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,430
Please don't worry, Your Highness.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,720
Foster father,

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,720
I conducted a divination practice for you.

118
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,510
And the symbol is ominous.

119
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,830
On top of the battle for power,

120
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,120
I wonder whose symbol could be auspicious.

121
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,390
Don't tell anyone anything about the divination result.

122
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,480
Not even His Highness.

123
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,950
What are you doing here, General Feng?

124
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,920
Greetings, Prince of Fengyang.

125
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,120
How kind, General Feng.

126
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,040
We are so special to each other.

127
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,680
Both of our names contain the character Feng, meaning phoenix.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,549
I am nowhere as good as you.

129
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,480
General Feng is a heroine.

130
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,510
The character Feng in my name

131
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,480
doesn't live up to its worth.

132
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,960
Someone's really got a good destiny.

133
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
Born to be the Prince.

134
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,549
And remain Prince wherever they are.

135
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,320
Someone's really got a good destiny.

136
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,120
Born to be

137
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,790
the protege of the junior Prince of Nanchen.

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
And remain a member of Nanchen Mansion

139
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
wherever they are.

140
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,440
That makes sense.

141
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,550
As for you

142
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,440
who are trying your best to join the Royal Army.

143
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,870
I am one of them from the very beginning.

144
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,080
So,

145
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,670
I should admire you, General Feng.

146
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,080
Master doesn't want to be disturbed.

147
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,550
Feng Qiao.

148
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,080
Is Master in there?

149
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,510
He is.

150
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,390
Go in there.

151
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,030
Master is only waiting for Shiyi.

152
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,200
After he leaves tomorrow,

153
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,440
it will take a long time

154
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,030
before she can see him again.

155
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,870
I suggest you come

156
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,150
on another day.

157
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,750
Thank you for letting me know.

158
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,750
Shiyi.

159
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,550
How do you know it's me, Master?

160
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,840
Feng Qiao is guarding outside,

161
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,200
she won't let anyone else in.

162
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,510
You are leaving tomorrow.

163
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,200
Yes.

164
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,150
This is the longest time I have been away from the royal mansion

165
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
since I became your protege.

166
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,390
Yeah.

167
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,750
My mother may fix the date,

168
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,270
but I haven't been home for a long time.

169
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,080
In case there is any delay,

170
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
I am afraid that I can only go back to the Western State

171
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,270
after a long time.

172
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,200
It's okay.

173
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,870
After all what I said,

174
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,030
you only replied with four characters.

175
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,000
As long as you remember,

176
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,320
Nanchen Royal Mansion will always be there,

177
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,080
your brothers and sisters and I

178
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,270
will always be there.

179
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,600
To us,

180
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,360
you are only going back and will soon return.

181
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,030
Let me take you to a place.

182
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,240
Okay.

183
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,360
I need to take Shiyi out of the Palace,

184
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,670
do you want to come along?

185
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,200
I don't see it's proper.

186
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,550
Nobody knows that

187
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,440
you are back in the Central State,

188
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,360
I am afraid we would be compromised

189
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,550
if you bring us with you.

190
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,510
General Feng's got a point.

191
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,600
we can't help being sentimental

192
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,600
as we are about to leave each other.

193
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,240
And I also want to have a further look at the Palace

194
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,790
of the Central State.

195
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,840
Sorry I can't go with Your Highness.

196
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:15,790
Let's go.

197
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,670
Master.

198
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,670
I forgot we are outside of the Palace.

199
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,840
Did you use to come here when you were a kid?

200
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,910
Before leaving the Central State,

201
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,750
I did.

202
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,910
Then I'll take a good look at this place.

203
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,510
Why is filling it with water?

204
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,200
The well respected monks of Baima Temple

205
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,720
has a custom over the years.

206
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,080
Every time when it's the end of the year.

207
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,150
They would ask their disciples

208
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,390
to check the water in there.

209
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,510
If there was a sheet of ice,

210
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,790
they must change the water immediately

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,510
in case the pigeons won't get the water.

212
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,360
That's very considerate.

213
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,270
Pigeons are intelligent,

214
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,360
they love to stay in the temple during the winter.

215
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,240
By the way,

216
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,120
Have you burnt incense here, Master?

217
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,080
Nope.

218
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,440
I am a general.

219
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,870
I have been through blood wars and seen numerous bones of the dead.

220
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,670
I should be the last one to disturb the tranquility of Buddha.

221
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,000
But you protect a lot more people.

222
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,910
Never mind,

223
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,750
from now on,

224
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,440
I will burn the incense for you,

225
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,120
my brothers and sisters.

226
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,630
Let's go.

227
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,200
Let's burn the incense

228
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,480
that you failed do burn when you were young.

229
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,960
Come back.

230
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Do you know how to get there?

231
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,910
Which regional prince just arrived in the capital?

232
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,840
Regional prince?

233
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,120
how can you tell he's a regional prince?

234
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,440
Look at his bearing,

235
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,630
he must be one of the nobility.

236
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,550
If there is such a man in the Central State,

237
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,630
we would've known.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,320
How can we have never seen him?

239
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,240
So, if the prince is waiting outside,

240
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,150
the princess

241
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,790
must be burning incense inside.

242
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,960
I have finished burning the incense

243
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
that you couldn't burn before 13.

244
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,870
Next time we are here,

245
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,200
we can make up the rest.

246
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,600
We couldn't burn too much at once,

247
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,150
that way we are like slacking off.

248
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,240
Sounds good.

249
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,000
We are still in daylight,

250
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,150
where are we going next?

251
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,360
Are we going back?

252
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,080
Why are we here?

253
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,030
It's getting late.

254
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,150
I need to take you back.

255
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,480
Are you leaving?

256
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,720
I still got time to sit for a while.

257
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,510
For how long?

258
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,270
If Wenjun doesn't mind,

259
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,120
I can stay for dinner.

260
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,670
Then let's go.

261
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,390
My lady, you are back.

262
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,750
I am taking one of my friends

263
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,120
for a quick meal.

264
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,150
Let's go.

265
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,440
Go.

266
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,480
Yes, Madame.

267
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,000
Your Highness.

268
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,750
The reason why I am here today

269
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,910
is that I, as a junior,

270
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,910
want to burn a stick of incense in front of the memorial tablet of Mr. Cui.

271
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,480
Please.

272
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,720
I wonder if Wenji would love to

273
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,600
give me a tour around Cui's Mansion.

274
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,150
I don't know Your Highness very well, I am afraid.

275
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,910
Aunty.

276
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,840
Go ahead.

277
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,200
If so,

278
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,510
I will give Your Highness a tour,

279
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,670
please.

280
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,240
Shiyi,

281
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,750
Uncle mentioned about you.

282
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
What did he say?

283
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,670
He said,

284
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,910
he did let you down.

285
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,680
And if he ever knew that he would let you down one day,

286
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,920
he should never go to Qinghe County to see you.

287
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Exactly.

288
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,000
If he didn't want to marry me,

289
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,790
he shouldn't come to see me.

290
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,920
Now that he came to see me, yet he didn't marry me.

291
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,160
How am I supposed to face the Cui family?

292
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,069
For outsiders,

293
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,200
they would think that I was some kind of monster

294
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,069
that made people break off an engagement

295
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,270
with some contact.

296
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,680
He said,

297
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,590
not being able to marry Wenji,

298
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,000
is the only regret in his life.

299
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,400
My uncle was, in fact,

300
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,920
forced to break off the engagement.

301
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,310
The late emperor feared that the connection through marriage between the Cui family

302
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,790
and the Nnachen Royal Mansion

303
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,790
would make the Western State an overpowering state.

304
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,110
That's why

305
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,070
there was a secret edict from the Palace，

306
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,960
forcing my uncle to break off the engagement.

307
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,880
I am not here

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
to beg your pardon for my uncle.

309
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,440
I only wish

310
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,640
you could work it out

311
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,960
and feel better.

312
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,880
Your Highness, please help yourself.

313
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,590
The liquor

314
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,110
is unique to Qinghe County.

315
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,110
Have a taste, Master.

316
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,830
Is it good?

317
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,110
Not bad.

318
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,270
This is called sandfish sashimi,

319
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,400
it's shredded skin of sandfish,

320
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,830
which is also unique to Qinghe County.

321
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,030
You won't see sandfish if you don't live near the sea.

322
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,720
Try it.

323
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,960
How's it?

324
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,070
Not too bad.

325
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,440
I'll see you off at the city gate tomorrow.

326
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,160
See you tomorrow.

327
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,310
I have to go now.

328
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,000
Being a criminal when you entered the city,

329
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,720
yet being the Prince of Fengyang when you leave.

330
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,270
No wonder the people would come out to see you.

331
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,510
What they don't know, however,

332
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,310
is that their beloved junior Prince Nanchen

333
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,750
is now at the back of the convoy.

334
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,240
If there is anything you don't know

335
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,160
in the Palace or on the court,

336
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,720
consult the counselor.

337
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Don't say anything wrong

338
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,110
that would implicate him.

339
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,240
I will make sure the counselor is in one piece

340
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,920
by being next to him all the time and protect him.

341
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,830
I have trained you personally,

342
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,440
don't let me down.

343
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,310
Keep that in mind.

344
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,110
I won't, Madame.

345
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,030
Your Highness,

346
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,960
take care.

347
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,110
Sir,

348
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,000
take care.

349
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,200
Go.

350
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,960
Counselor,

351
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,030
see you.

352
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,070
Let's go.

353
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,270
Where are you from?

354
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,000
Why don't you give way

355
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,110
when you see the King of Taiyuan come?

356
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,830
We are from the Western State.

357
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,440
Master,

358
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
this man is called Jin Rong,

359
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,750
he is a Qihu,

360
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,070
and got the credits for counter-insurgency during the late emperor's reign.

361
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,440
He now has a daughter

362
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,680
who is a concubine in the Palace.

363
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,550
So sorry.

364
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,920
General,

365
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,830
why would you give way to them?

366
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,550
Did you see

367
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,350
the man in white just now?

368
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,400
He should be

369
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,920
the junior Prince of Nanchen.

370
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,720
Your Highness.

371
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,680
Prince Guangling.

372
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,590
General Jin.

373
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,000
Please take a seat.

374
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,790
I saw a man

375
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,400
at the city gate

376
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,270
who looks like the junior Prince of Nanchen.

377
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,510
That's him.

378
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,030
Liu Yuan handed all the troops

379
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,830
to a man

380
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,030
named Qin Yan,

381
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,350
have you heard of that?

382
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,880
Yes, I have.

383
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,310
Some nobody

384
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,590
comes from nowhere

385
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,480
should delude His Majesty

386
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,160
to hand the strong army of the Central State

387
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,680
to him.

388
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,720
He is from the Nanchen Royal Mansion.

389
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,030
Xie Chong, the military counselor from Nanchen Royal Mansion

390
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,440
was also left in the Palace

391
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,110
to assist His Majesty in the future.

392
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,440
We have killed Zhao Teng and Liu Yuan.

393
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,270
Now comes the Xie Chong and Qin Yan.

394
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,000
The son-in-law of mine,

395
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,000
is really simple-minded

396
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,310
and is always influenced by other people.

397
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,880
Your Highness.

398
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,550
Is my daughter in the Palace

399
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,590
having a good time?

400
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,400
She is not favored by His Majesty.

401
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,590
Nevertheless,

402
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,310
with the friendship between you and me,

403
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,400
I will take care of Jinpin for you.

404
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,030
I appreciate it, Your Highness.

405
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,240
I

406
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,640
am counting on you in the future, General.

407
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,720
No problem.

408
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,270
From now on, the Taiyuan Army

409
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,880
will be at your disposal, Your Highness.

410
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,110
Prince Guangling.

411
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,830
My dad finally remembers to see me.

412
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,160
Come on,

413
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,400
let me have a look.

414
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,000
Looks like someone's really mad at her dad.

415
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,880
I don't want this either.

416
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,550
I am only doing this

417
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,000
for my useless son-in-law

418
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,590
to suppress the rebellion everywhere, isn't it?

419
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,160
You help him suppress the rebellion,

420
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,270
he already left your daughter uncared-for.

421
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,880
Since Prince Guangling is here,

422
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,510
we can't talk nonsense.

423
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,790
Shiyi.

424
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,110
Miss Cui is in the mansion,

425
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,880
does Your Highness want to see her?

426
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,880
There is no engagement

427
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,240
and no point of seeing her anymore.

428
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,480
On the day when Xinghua gets married,

429
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,550
I will take her to Cui House on behalf of His Majesty.

430
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,200
and I will see her for sure.

431
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,400
Feng,

432
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,070
my mother's afraid that you may get cold feet

433
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,350
and she lets me accompany you all the way.

434
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,590
Does your brother look like

435
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,160
that kind of man?

436
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,830
Men from Nanchen Royal Mansion

437
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,720
will never get cold feet.

438
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,110
Let's go.

439
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,110
Prince Guangling.

440
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,240
Wenjun.

441
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,350
The Empress and His Majesty got caught in their business and couldn't get out of the Palace,

442
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,720
so, as the emperor's brother,

443
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,110
I will send her to the residence of Cui instead.

444
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,880
Here's His Majesty's verbal instruction,

445
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,350
since Mr. Cui just passed away,

446
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,750
we don't have to hold a grand wedding ceremony.

447
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,110
Everything must be kept simple.

448
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,070
I accept.

449
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Xinghua.

450
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,790
Xinghua.

451
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,350
This is no joke.

452
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,200
Get down now.

453
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,550
It is hard for people to leave their family when they get married,

454
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,550
and the Princess is no exception.

455
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,030
Hope you won't mind.

456
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,110
Understandable.

457
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,070
Please.

458
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,440
What are you burning in the middle of night?

459
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,550
Some confidential military documents.

460
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,070
Military intelligence?

461
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,110
Why are you crying?

462
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,400
I never knew I would marry you.

463
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,480
I have someone I adore.

464
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,200
Do you have someone you love, General Cui?

465
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,960
I'll be honest with you.

466
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,070
Yes.

467
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,030
Tonight,

468
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,790
are you going to pretend that I was her?

469
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,920
You are not her.

470
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,240
You and me tonight,

471
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,720
are not who we really are.

472
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,030
But rather, the prince and general of Northern Chen.

473
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,440
General,

474
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,400
please go to bed.

475
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,680
You have watched the moon for up to two hours.

476
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,960
I miss my elder sister.

477
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,590
Your Highness.

478
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,030
Prince Guangling.

479
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,510
It's pretty late at night,

480
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,000
why is Your Highness not back yet?

481
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,200
Still mad?

482
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,880
Nope.

483
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,830
The day I learned the engagement was canceled,

484
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,750
in desperation,

485
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,270
I embarrassed you in front of everyone.

486
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,550
I owe you an apology.

487
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,110
What is done is done.

488
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,920
Your Highness doesn't have to put it in mind.

489
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,790
If Your Highness is fine.

490
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,830
I have to go now.

491
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,110
Shiyi.

492
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,960
If I get a fief,

493
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,400
and stop being obsessed with princeship

494
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,440
and stay away from the Central State,

495
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,110
will you go with me?

496
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,240
No.

497
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,270
Do you still want to be a crown princess,

498
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,830
and in the future, an empress?

499
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,350
Never.

500
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,110
It has nothing to do with being the crown princess or not.

501
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,920
I have never wanted to enter the Palace.

502
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,680
If you have to choose again,

503
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,880
why don't you

504
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,750
choose someone you want?

505
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,790
How do you know

506
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,200
you are not the one I want?

507
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,510
And how do you know

508
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,640
that I don't want to marry you?

509
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,790
Please behave yourself, Prince Guangling.

510
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,030
When the engagement was made,

511
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,110
I was not born and couldn't make the decision.

512
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,160
What's in the past

513
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,680
is the agreement of our fathers,

514
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,750
not mine.

515
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,510
And definitely not my intention.

516
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,070
From today on,

517
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,110
Your Highness, please forget Mr. Cui's daughter.

518
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
A prince who has no power,

519
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,190
and an imperial concubine who is not favored.

520
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,920
In this Palace,

521
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,280
we are somewhat alike.

522
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,360
What

523
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,440
is the purpose of your arrival?

524
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,630
The crown princessship.

525
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,590
The fact that His Majesty and I being each other’s brother

526
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
doesn’t give me the power to decide

527
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,440
which concubine he wants to favor.

528
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,800
What if you were the Emperor?

529
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,710
My father can help you get the throne.

530
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
While you,

531
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,280
need to repay me with the queen's position.

532
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,590
My lady,

533
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,710
every house of His Lord is here.

534
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,030
They said they want to offer their condolence.

535
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,800
Keep the body in the room

536
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,590
and send the Princess back to rest.

537
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,510
Yes, Madame.

538
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,110
Please go inside and have a rest, Princess.

539
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,800
Only Shiyi follow me inside.

540
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,360
Wenjun.

541
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,510
Wenjun is here.

542
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,320
Sit down and let's talk.

543
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,670
Wenjun,

544
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,880
sorry to hear the sudden death of Mr. Cui.

545
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,360
We made it here

546
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,110
as soon as we learned the news.

547
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,880
Why don't you send someone

548
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,760
to send a letter here first

549
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,070
so that I can arrange people to receive you.

550
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,070
We are afraid that you worried too much.

551
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,590
Wenjun.

552
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,360
So far, in your generation,

553
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,480
only you and Wenji were left.

554
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
Do you

555
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,440
have any plan for the future?

556
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,760
From now on,

557
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,070
I will be in charge of

558
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,670
both internal and external affairs of Wushui House.

559
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,760
Here is the bride-price list.

560
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,400
Please have a look.

561
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,190
Who is this bride-price for?

562
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,630
To you, from me.

563
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,920
The Wushui House can't sustain without a master, not even a day.

564
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,590
This is bride-price list

565
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,840
that I asked someone to prepare overnight.

566
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,230
I thought

567
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,230
it was prepared for the younger generation.

568
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,000
I never knew it was for me.

569
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,920
Shiyi.

570
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,110
Yes, Mother.

571
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,800
Return it to your uncle.

572
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,760
Yes.

573
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,960
If it were for the younger generation.

574
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,480
Two of the three sons left by my brother

575
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,670
remain unmarried.

576
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,030
I can help arrange.

577
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,000
If it were for me,

578
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,550
there is no need.

579
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,070
We are only doing this for your good.

580
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,710
I appreciate it.

581
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,280
As Mr. Cui is gone,

582
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,960
if there was no marriage connection between Wushui House

583
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,960
and the rest of us,

584
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,280
once anything goes wrong,

585
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,400
we are left without proper reasons

586
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,670
to offer a hand.

587
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,550
We have the same ancestry,

588
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,070
if you want to help,

589
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,590
you will do it no matter what.

590
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,670
If you don't want to help anymore,

591
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,000
I won't say a thing.

592
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,590
We are here for your good,

593
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,920
why do you have to turn us down?

594
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,710
What you may not know,

595
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,110
is that before my brother passed away,

596
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,070
he recommended his eldest and second son to the Imperial Palace

597
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,760
and he let his third son marry Princess Xinghua.

598
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,670
My youngest daughter, Shiyi,

599
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,960
who was a protege of the junior Prince of Nanchen.

600
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,670
Be it the Liu Royal family,

601
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,000
the Qi Empress,

602
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,360
or the Zhousheng family in the Western State,

603
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,800
we will be family to each other someday.

604
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,320
If so,

605
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,800
that you insist,

606
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,320
I won't push it.

607
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,630
What kind of bride-price is this?

608
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,880
They are literally here

609
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,880
to rob my family property.

610
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,110
The person who wanted to marry me today,

611
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,440
is called Cui Zheng.

612
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,960
His branch was once the most thriving

613
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,230
among our six houses.

614
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,400
But they offended the emperor later

615
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,110
and in despair,

616
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,320
they had to flee to the south of the river.

617
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,110
That was also the darkest time

618
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,760
for us, the Cui family.

619
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,440
Later.

620
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,760
Your uncle became an official on the imperial court.

621
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,190
And the Cui family

622
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,440
gradually regained its past glory.

623
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,590
And those who fled to the south

624
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,440
have gradually returned.

625
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,480
My uncle is the one who made it possible for them to come home,

626
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,960
yet they want to steal the position of suzerain

627
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,840
after he died.

628
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,070
Glad that he is gone

629
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,000
so he won't be sad about this.

630
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,440
You finally opened your mouth

631
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,030
to talk to me.

632
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,510
My master said,

633
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,710
the Gao family

634
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,360
was always trying to get a chance to destroy the Cui family.

635
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,510
If my mother didn't do that,

636
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,440
not only you and me,

637
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,840
the whole family is going to suffer.

638
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,110
I can't help recalling that night over and over again.

639
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,480
and I regretted.

640
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,110
If only

641
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,230
I could go with him

642
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,400
on that night.

643
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,550
It is really heartbreaking

644
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,760
to see him set off alone.

645
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,150
You did that for me.
