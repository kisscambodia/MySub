1
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:54,552
The sounds of Gongjin.

2
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:10,068
-Thank you.
-It was delicious.

3
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:11,694
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

4
00:01:29,837 --> 00:01:31,130
-Taekwon!
-One.

5
00:01:31,214 --> 00:01:32,965
-Taekwondo!
-Taekwondo!

6
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:57,156
Ms. Yoon Hye-jin! A package for you!

7
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:02,745
This is the sound
of Ms. Yoon Hye-jin, who's from Seoul,

8
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,956
rushing out to receive a package.

9
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,014
Take it.

10
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:23,224
Right.

11
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:24,517
EPISODE 3

12
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,185
You work on Saturdays too?

13
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:30,064
Yes. Jin-seok broke his arm,
so I'm covering for him for a while.

14
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:32,024
That's not very good news.

15
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:35,903
-Don't I need to sign it?
-No, your face is your signature.

16
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:40,283
I mean, a face like yours
is rare here in Gongjin.

17
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:42,827
-Did you diss me?
-Depends on you.

18
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,539
Look who's talking.
Do you think you're good-looking?

19
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:50,251
In Seoul, a face like yours is more common
than gum spat on the ground.

20
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:51,586
Okay. Bye.

21
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,965
It's more common than the squid
brought into the harbor this morning.

22
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,098
"Hi."

23
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:08,561
-What do you think?
-Not bad.

24
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:13,190
"Not bad" isn't good enough
for armor I'll wear into a battlefield.

25
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:15,735
-Isn't it a fellow dentist's wedding?
-It is.

26
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,321
But everyone will be there.

27
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:20,615
They'll talk about
how I opened a clinic here

28
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:22,283
and turn me into a laughingstock.

29
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:25,328
It's going to be a bloody battle.

30
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,873
You dentists are so pathetic.

31
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:31,918
And I'm going to be
the least pathetic one among them.

32
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:34,754
Why don't you go shopping
at a department store then?

33
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:36,839
I wish I could.

34
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:40,509
But the boondocks
have no department stores.

35
00:03:40,593 --> 00:03:41,928
You're right about that.

36
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:48,601
There's only one way for me to survive.

37
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:52,104
Ms. Yoon!

38
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:53,022
Ms. Yoon!

39
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:55,524
-How's this?
-It's pretty!

40
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:58,194
-It's a bit boring, right?
-Ms… Ms. Yoon.

41
00:03:58,277 --> 00:03:59,946
Ms… Ms. Yoon.

42
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,117
What do you think?

43
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,661
A bit too much, right?

44
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:09,121
-Like an awards show outfit?
-Yes.

45
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:11,666
Ms. Yoon.

46
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:14,085
Ms. Yoon!

47
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:16,587
Ms. Yoon

48
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:21,801
Ms. Yoon

49
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,511
Too much?

50
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:25,763
-This is hard.
-Very.

51
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:27,014
Ms. Pyo Mi-seon…

52
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:29,809
This is yours, right?

53
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,395
I don't look rich enough, do I?

54
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:34,230
-You do.
-Do I?

55
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:36,232
-Yes.
-Something's missing.

56
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:37,942
Ms. Yoon!

57
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:40,403
What are you doing?

58
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:42,863
Why do you order so much?

59
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:44,490
There's quite a bit today. Sorry.

60
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:46,659
Come on. Seriously.

61
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:49,996
You order from all over the world.

62
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,331
The US, Germany, England…

63
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:54,166
They're from everywhere.

64
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,670
I just bought some clothes. That's all.
And it's none of your business.

65
00:04:57,753 --> 00:04:59,755
Why do you need so many clothes?

66
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:03,467
A fashion terrorist like you
would never understand.

67
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:06,012
It's all about functionality.
You don't know anything.

68
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:07,930
Good for you.

69
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:10,266
Are you splurging
since you have patients now?

70
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:12,310
How will you save up money to go to Seoul?

71
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:14,270
I'm going this Sunday, okay?

72
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:15,563
-This Sunday?
-Yes.

73
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:17,565
For a very important reason.

74
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:20,359
And these are the last ones
for a while, so quit nagging.

75
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:49,555
Look at that color.

76
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:51,766
It brightens your complexion.

77
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:52,975
-Really?
-Yes.

78
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:55,644
-Do I look okay?
-You look gorgeous.

79
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:56,979
Turn around.

80
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:06,530
It's perfect. Into the battlefield!

81
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:11,035
-I'll get going.
-Okay, see you.

82
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:13,329
Make sure you feed the hedgehog.

83
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:14,288
Okay.

84
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:23,380
They would've been perfect for this look.

85
00:06:23,464 --> 00:06:24,340
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:24,423 --> 00:06:28,511
Due to my carelessness, your other half
is probably floating in the open sea.

87
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:43,526
God, I barely recognize you.

88
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:45,152
Look who's talking.

89
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:49,824
I'm not expecting any packages today.

90
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:52,576
-I know. I have a favor to ask of you.
-What is it?

91
00:06:57,748 --> 00:06:59,458
I heard you're going to Seoul today.

92
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:02,586
-Let's go together.
-What?

93
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,630
They all need to go to Seoul.

94
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:07,550
Ms. Gam-ri needs to give
marinated crab to her son.

95
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:09,552
Ms. Mat-i… What a beautiful hat.

96
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:12,263
Her friend's grandson
is having his first birthday.

97
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:14,723
Ms. Suk-ja's daughter
hurt her back and asked her

98
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:16,559
to take care of her children.

99
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:20,146
-We can go.
-We need to talk.

100
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:23,274
You can't do this all of a sudden.

101
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:24,900
So it's okay, right?

102
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:29,321
Let's go.

103
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,535
-Okay.
-Let's go.

104
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:37,538
It's okay, right? Go on. She'll drive us.

105
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:38,789
Unbelievable.

106
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:44,879
Here.

107
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:52,553
Right. Is the lid shut tight?

108
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:55,055
Yes, it is. Don't you worry about a thing.

109
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:58,517
-New car?
-That's not important.

110
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:00,186
What are you doing?

111
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:02,563
Shouldn't we hurry?
We need to make several stops.

112
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:04,690
We'll talk later.

113
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:32,927
Why did you pack so much?

114
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,553
This isn't a lot.

115
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:37,806
I'm actually worried
that it may not be enough for all of us.

116
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:41,352
You made potato cakes?
These are my favorite.

117
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:42,686
If you want

118
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:46,190
to avoid carsickness,
you need to keep chewing.

119
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:47,858
Dr. Yoon, have one.

120
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:50,736
I'm good. I'm driving, so…

121
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:55,074
-What are you doing?
-Don't talk with your mouth full.

122
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:01,163
Ms. Gam-ri, why aren't you eating?

123
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:04,875
I had a big breakfast, so I'm still full.

124
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,462
Just have one. She made it for us.

125
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:17,096
What's wrong?

126
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:18,806
They're undercooked.

127
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,016
Why is it so hard?

128
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,229
Don't blame me.
You're the one who has fragile teeth.

129
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:26,939
Just spit it out already.

130
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:29,775
Do you have weak teeth?
You should've told me sooner.

131
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:33,237
Gam-ri, ask her
to give you a nice discount.

132
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,657
Shut it. Stop spewing nonsense.

133
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,120
Ms. Kim, you should
come to my clinic. I'll treat you well.

134
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:49,044
-Gosh!
-Oh, dear!

135
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:03,225
-Goodness gracious.
-Are you okay?

136
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:05,477
I could've gotten a heart attack.

137
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,147
I can't believe what just happened.

138
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,150
We should really have
such a reckless driver's license revoked.

139
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,403
Why are you chasing him?

140
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:17,740
He should know what he did wrong.

141
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,160
Don't do it. Don't be like him.

142
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:33,088
Hey.

143
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:35,674
-How could you drive so recklessly?
-Unbelievable.

144
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:38,677
-You could've caused an accident!
-What?

145
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,888
You can't change lanes without signaling.

146
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:44,058
-We didn't crash, so it's all good.
-What did you say?

147
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:46,727
No harm done, so what's the problem?

148
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,274
Don't drive so recklessly,
or you're bound to cause an accident.

149
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:53,817
Don't cause any harm to others.

150
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:57,655
Blah, blah. God, you're making
such a big deal out of nothing.

151
00:10:57,738 --> 00:11:00,157
This is why
they should forbid women from driving.

152
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,075
What did you say?

153
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:03,327
-Hey, watch your words.
-Gosh…

154
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,997
God damn it. What the hell
is that bastard babbling about?

155
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:12,294
You bastard. How dare you run your mouth
like that after what you've done?

156
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:14,713
You son of a bitch.

157
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:16,882
I ought to rip out your lungs and kidneys

158
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:19,802
and jump rope with your intestines!

159
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:21,345
Are you crazy, old hag?

160
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:22,471
I am, you bastard!

161
00:11:22,554 --> 00:11:25,557
-You worthless, little bastard!
-Damn it.

162
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:30,396
You little bastard, where are you going?
Come back here, you asshole!

163
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:34,733
What an asshole.
How dare he run his mouth?

164
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:43,200
You see, my mom was from Beolgyo.

165
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:46,995
-Right.
-I see.

166
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:47,913
Right.

167
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:50,290
What should we do?

168
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:53,877
The potato cakes are all over the floor.

169
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:57,005
-Dear. What a waste.
-There are wet wipes in there.

170
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:58,590
In here?

171
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,179
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED

172
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:07,015
CHUNG-HO
REST AREA

173
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:12,479
FISH CAKE SKEWERS
WALNUT CAKES

174
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:13,397
Want some?

175
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,651
Do you seriously have
an appetite after what you've done?

176
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:20,571
Of course. Roasted potatoes
are the best at rest areas.

177
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:22,406
No, soddeok-soddeok are.

178
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,283
-Want one?
-No thanks.

179
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:27,327
What's taking them so long?

180
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:29,496
I'm going to be late.

181
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,956
We have plenty of time.

182
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,667
Why are you in a hurry? Take it easy.

183
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,461
Appreciate the view too.

184
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:37,421
Whatever.

185
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:40,382
Want me to buy you a soddeok-soddeok?

186
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:44,386
This way.

187
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:50,559
-Where are they going?
-Where are they going?

188
00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:52,895
What are they doing?

189
00:13:01,528 --> 00:13:02,863
This is so annoying.

190
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:05,157
So much.

191
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:08,410
-Suk-ja is good at dancing.
-Let's go, Suk-ja!

192
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:11,455
All right!

193
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:13,957
-This is nice!
-Doing great!

194
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,836
I'm really sorry,
but could I turn off the music?

195
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,754
What?

196
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:22,174
I prefer driving quietly.

197
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:26,762
Turn it off.
We shouldn't bother the driver.

198
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:28,430
You're such a party pooper.

199
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:30,140
You be quiet too.

200
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:34,853
Where are you from?

201
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:38,065
I was born in Seoul
and raised in Gyeonggi Province.

202
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:39,358
Goodness. Same here.

203
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:43,028
I got married and moved to Gongjin
from Yangpyeong at the age of 22.

204
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:46,532
Which Yoon family do you belong to?

205
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,575
The Haenam Yoon clan, ma'am.

206
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:51,995
So is my daughter-in-law.

207
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:55,207
Then who's your earliest ancestor?

208
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,502
Earliest ancestor?

209
00:13:58,585 --> 00:14:00,420
I'm not too sure.

210
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:05,217
They say there's no future
for those who don't know their history.

211
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:09,012
You should at least know that much.

212
00:14:09,096 --> 00:14:10,389
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:13,183
What do your parents do?

214
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:16,687
Well, my dad has retired.

215
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,230
And my mom passed away.

216
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,359
Why did you have to ask her that?

217
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:25,571
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

218
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:28,866
It's okay. I don't remember much anyway

219
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:30,534
since I was so little.

220
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:37,833
Dr. Yoon, is there a restroom nearby?

221
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,084
A restroom?

222
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:42,254
It'll take some time.

223
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:44,339
Is it urgent?

224
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:48,385
Old people need to go
to the bathroom often.

225
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:51,763
-Be quiet.
-Our bladders became weak.

226
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,474
Aging is inconvenient in many ways.

227
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,602
-Gam-ri!
-Hang in there.

228
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,729
-Hold on.
-Oh, dear.

229
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,439
BETMEORI
REST AREA

230
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:02,149
-I need to go.
-It's that way.

231
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:05,611

232
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,332

233
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,420
-Gosh, that must be refreshing.
-Let's go.

234
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:31,053
You should've gone with her.

235
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:33,722
-Be quiet.
-Please exit safely.

236
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,682
-Unbelievable.
-Be quiet.

237
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,562
-Goodness.
-You're just unbelievable.

238
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:43,523
-You have to go again?
-Darn it.

239
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:48,195
-Goodness.
-We'll wait here.

240
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:49,404
-Hey.
-I ate too much.

241
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:50,864
-Go together.
-I need to poop.

242
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:53,033
-We're halfway there.
-Be careful.

243
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:00,874
What's taking them so long?

244
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,542
They just went in.

245
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:13,637
Grandma, have a safe trip!

246
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:25,482
I thought you'd give me hell
the moment they left. Why are you quiet?

247
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:27,567
I believe in fairness.

248
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:31,238
I'm doing you a favor since I owe you one.

249
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,033
But admit this.

250
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:35,951
What?

251
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,703
Admit that what you did today

252
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:40,706
was rude, disrespectful, and out--

253
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,043
And out of line. Admit that.

254
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:46,294
I liked the rhythm.

255
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:49,172
Didn't you see how they were?

256
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:53,010
I couldn't let them take the bus
and hold their bladders during the trip.

257
00:16:53,093 --> 00:16:55,512
And my truck would've been
too uncomfortable for them.

258
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:56,972
You did a good deed.

259
00:16:58,306 --> 00:16:59,391
You're too nosy.

260
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:03,937
Like I said before,
I hate it when people cross the line.

261
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:06,815
-Don't let this happen again.
-Drop me off here.

262
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:09,109
-I clearly warned you, okay?
-At that crosswalk.

263
00:17:20,412 --> 00:17:21,913
What a rough driver.

264
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:24,124
By the way, why did you come to Seoul?

265
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,168
-What's your business?
-Bye.

266
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:31,631
He's just not likable.

267
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,009
Darn it, I'm late!

268
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:46,021
HEALTH AND MEDICAL CENTER

HOPE SMILE DENTIST
PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC

270
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,795
Gangwon Province sure is far,
seeing how you were late today.

271
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:12,297
I had my reasons.

272
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:14,508
At least I took the photo.

273
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:17,511
Gosh, Hye-jin used to be so punctual

274
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:20,388
that her nickname was Cinderella.

275
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:23,642
You're right. Whenever we had
a get-together,

276
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:25,143
you'd leave before midnight.

277
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:28,563
That was ages ago.
Let's talk about the present.

278
00:18:28,647 --> 00:18:30,065
How have you guys been?

279
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:32,275
Same old. Working on weekdays,

280
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,736
golfing and shopping on weekends.

281
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:38,198
Ji-won, how does it feel
to open a clinic in Gangnam?

282
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,659
Me? I'm not really that excited about it.

283
00:18:41,326 --> 00:18:43,870
I spend most of my income
paying off my loan.

284
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,206
I'm barely making ends meet.

285
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:48,208
Last year, I paid
300 million won in taxes.

286
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:52,212
They awarded me
for being an exemplary taxpayer.

287
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:55,924
But that's just another way
of saying that I'm a pushover.

288
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,760
How much do you make
to pay so much in taxes?

289
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:02,681
Well… I think I'm making
a decent amount of money.

290
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:10,730
But in some ways, I envy Hye-jin.

291
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:14,401
A seaside dental clinic in the country.

292
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,612
It's so simple and cute.

293
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,286
You're not so up-to-date, are you?

294
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:27,914
No wonder people think
Seoulites have narrow views.

295
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:30,959
-What?
-Rural areas are more developed now.

296
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:34,588
It's truly wonderful. You don't need
to go abroad to appreciate nice views.

297
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,341
And the hospitals make
a hefty amount of profit.

298
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:40,051
I'm the only dentist there,

299
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:43,346
so my clinic is flooded with patients.

300
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,765
There's even an article
about doctors in rural areas

301
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:47,767
making more money than those in the city?

302
00:19:48,393 --> 00:19:51,104
Sorry. I forgot.
You don't read newspapers.

303
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:04,201
How dare they all mock me?

304
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:06,786
I'm so annoyed.

305
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:10,207
I'll have a good trip. Don't cry.

306
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:14,169
My baby girl.

307
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:15,754
Call me once you arrive.

308
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:18,798
-Okay.
-I'm just worried. That's all.

309
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:20,133
Go home and rest.

310
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,178
-Don't cry. Your makeup will run.
-Okay.

311
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:27,098
-Be good to my girl.
-Yes, ma'am.

312
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,975
What are you staring at?

313
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:32,562
What? What are you doing here?

314
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:36,399
Are you jealous that they're married
and going on a honeymoon?

315
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:38,026
How did you know I'd be here?

316
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:39,444
I saw the invitation.

317
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:41,071
It was next to the wet wipes.

318
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:44,574
I left my phone in your car.

319
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:47,994
Still, you shouldn't have come here!
Someone might see us!

320
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:50,830
Are you a celebrity
or something? Stop overreacting.

321
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:54,626
Everyone from my university is here.

322
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,044
This is insane.

323
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:57,921
Follow me.

324
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:00,006
Did I do something wrong?

325
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:08,014
Fine. Come on. Why are you…

326
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:10,642
Stop it. I'm going.

327
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:29,744
I wasn't planning to get a ride from you.

328
00:21:30,578 --> 00:21:31,621
Remember that.

329
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,290
Whatever.

330
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:35,208
Drop me off at the terminal if you want.

331
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:36,918
At the terminal?

332
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:40,171
-We've already passed it.
-Oh, well.

333
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:43,258
Then I'll just let you give a ride.
This is nice.

334
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:48,930
Let me know if you get tired.
We can take turns driving.

335
00:21:49,014 --> 00:21:52,600
Forget it. I hate it
when other people touch my stuff.

336
00:21:53,685 --> 00:21:55,520
Besides, this is a new car.

337
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:58,148
Fine by me. I can just relax.

338
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:17,042
I'd love to have
some wine by the Han River.

339
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:21,004
Drinking makgeolli by the ocean
is just magnificent.

340
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:27,218
That restaurant has great pasta.

341
00:22:28,178 --> 00:22:31,014
Eating snow crab ramyeon
on a boat is the best.

342
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:36,102
I can't believe
I have to return to the boondocks.

343
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:39,314
There are skyscrapers everywhere.
It's so suffocating.

344
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,485
I can't wait to go back to Gongjin.

345
00:22:46,654 --> 00:22:48,156
Can you turn the AC on?

346
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:51,409
Turn it on yourself.

347
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:54,662
Don't touch my car.

348
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:11,763
DON'T LITTER
1 MILLION WON FINE

349
00:23:13,056 --> 00:23:16,351
They must've thought
they wouldn't get caught on weekends.

350
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:20,522
If I find you, you're dead meat!

351
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:23,399
What should I do? Chief Hong isn't here.

352
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:26,069
-He's not here?
-He went to Seoul.

353
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:29,197
He's been visiting Seoul often lately.

354
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:31,407
Hye-jin went to Seoul too.

355
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,452
Hello, Ms. Landlady.

356
00:23:34,536 --> 00:23:37,789
You're that friend of hers
who lives with her.

357
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:39,249
Yes. You're right.

358
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,670
You're our patient, Mr. Choi Eun-cheol.

359
00:23:43,753 --> 00:23:45,797
-Hello.
-You were a police officer?

360
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,798
Yes.

361
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:50,260
Gosh, you look so different in a uniform.

362
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:52,637
You look so reliable.

363
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,515
When you visited our clinic,
you were terrified and trembling.

364
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:56,432
I wasn't.

365
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,518
-Were you?
-No.

366
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:01,980
Next time, you don't
have to be so nervous.

367
00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:03,982
See you at the clinic.

368
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:07,402
-Have a good day.
-Bye.

369
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:26,629
Did I see wrong?

370
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:32,177
Damn it. Take a photo for evidence.

371
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,637
We should install a surveillance camera.

372
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:39,350
The toll is 12,700 won.

373
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:48,651
We're almost home.

374
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:51,196
When did I fall asleep?

375
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:54,616
There was one traffic jam
after another, yet you never woke up.

376
00:24:54,699 --> 00:24:56,743
It's very comfortable. You got a nice car.

377
00:24:59,412 --> 00:25:01,206
Am I a chauffeur or what?

378
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:03,166
I've been driving all day long.

379
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:05,960
I offered to take turns driving,
but you declined.

380
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:09,130
You shouldn't have left me bored at least.

381
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:11,507
I remembered that
you preferred driving quietly.

382
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:14,802
Well, aren't you so kindhearted?

383
00:25:15,303 --> 00:25:18,514
Someone littered again.
We're having a meeting at the restaurant.

384
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:22,018
Since you're driving anyway,
drop me off at the raw fish restaurant.

385
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:24,187
There's an emergency meeting,

386
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:26,981
and I'm too lazy to walk.

387
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,652
-Get out here.
-Sorry.

388
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:44,374
CLASSMATES CHATROOM

389
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:47,961
What?

390
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:50,004
When did this get taken?

391
00:25:52,048 --> 00:25:54,300
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

392
00:25:54,384 --> 00:25:55,969
Boyfriend, my foot.

393
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,933
He's not my boyfriend.
I just ran into someone I knew.

394
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:05,228
Boyfriend? Gosh, he's so cute.

395
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:07,814
Totally. Where did you meet
such a handsome guy?

396
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:10,525
I was surprised too when I saw him.

397
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,821
He's not a boyfriend.

398
00:26:14,904 --> 00:26:17,699
I'm not interested,
but he keeps chasing me.

399
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:27,000
This is cute?

400
00:27:17,175 --> 00:27:19,344
How could you sleep
when I'm driving like this?

401
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:21,220
Look at you.

402
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:46,347
GONGJIN MARKET

403
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:57,316
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

404
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,403
The ideal temperature for drip coffee
is between 88°C and 95°C.

405
00:29:00,486 --> 00:29:01,487
What did I say?

406
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:04,282
-Ninety…
-Five degrees.

407
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:07,744
Now, when you pour water,
start at the center.

408
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:11,289
Slowly spiral outward

409
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:14,041
then bring it back to the center.

410
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:17,754
Once these bubbles disappear,

411
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:20,047
you start the second brew.

412
00:29:21,424 --> 00:29:24,343
-It looks like bread that's rising.
-Right. Isn't it cute?

413
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:25,928
-Hello.
-Yes.

414
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:28,389
-Hello. Come sit down.
-Going to work?

415
00:29:28,973 --> 00:29:31,517
-You work here too?
-At times when he asks for help.

416
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:33,436
What a strange lifestyle you lead.

417
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,189
Do you even know what you're doing?

418
00:29:36,272 --> 00:29:37,857
Try some if you're curious.

419
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,692
He's one talented man.

420
00:29:39,776 --> 00:29:42,195
He's a certified barista.
He's teaching me right now.

421
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:45,448
-I see.
-Pour some water again and give it to her.

422
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:46,783
-Me?
-Yes.

423
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:47,909
Really?

424
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,788
-Is it already time?
-Yes.

425
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:54,373
All right. My first coffee.

426
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:55,458
Where are you going?

427
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:57,418
Remove the dripper, or it'll get bitter.

428
00:29:57,502 --> 00:29:58,878
Okay.

429
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:02,507
All right. You're my very first customer.

430
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:05,259
A cup of latte, please.

431
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,303
With a lot of syrup.

432
00:30:08,387 --> 00:30:10,014
This doesn't suit me, does it?

433
00:30:11,974 --> 00:30:13,184
Something's off.

434
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,144
Gosh, this thing…

435
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,911
What are you doing?

436
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,625
This candy wakes me up, you know.

437
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:41,045
Mondays always make me drowsy.

438
00:30:41,546 --> 00:30:44,632
Just Mondays? You doze off
throughout the entire week.

439
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:46,467
You little…

440
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:48,970
-Goodness.
-Hello, everyone.

441
00:30:49,053 --> 00:30:50,721
Hello.

442
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,139
-Here.
-Take this.

443
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:54,267
What brings you here? Gosh.

444
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:57,478
-What is this?
-Can't you see? It's trash.

445
00:30:57,562 --> 00:30:59,897
Exactly. Why did you bring it here?

446
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:02,692
There have been 24 cases of littering
at the market this year,

447
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:05,611
and we've asked you nine times
to install a security camera.

448
00:31:05,695 --> 00:31:08,155
However, the camera is nowhere to be seen,

449
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:11,325
and another case happened yesterday.
Are you okay?

450
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:15,955
I already asked city hall,
but it hasn't been approved yet.

451
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:19,292
Of course. I completely
understand your situation.

452
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,336
You have a tight budget
and a ton of work. It must be tough.

453
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,297
Gosh. Thanks for understanding.

454
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,424
So we're going to catch them ourselves.

455
00:31:26,507 --> 00:31:29,343
-What? How?
-Every crime leaves a trace.

456
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,762
The evidence must be in here.

457
00:31:34,223 --> 00:31:37,643
We're going to find out
what they ate and threw away right here.

458
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:38,769
-Should I?
-Rip it.

459
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:39,896
-Okay.
-Du-sik, don't!

460
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:41,522
Let me go!

461
00:31:41,606 --> 00:31:43,858
-I need to tear this open!
-No, you don't!

462
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:46,485
-Then I'll open this.
-Hwa-jeong, don't!

463
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:47,445
"Hwa-jeong"?

464
00:31:48,404 --> 00:31:51,449
Know when to talk professionally,
Mr. Chang.

465
00:31:51,532 --> 00:31:54,702
God! Right! I'm sorry, Ms. Yeo.

466
00:31:54,785 --> 00:31:59,916
Du-sik! Right! I happen to have
some business at city hall today.

467
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:05,254
I'll go right up to them and make sure
they understand what we want!

468
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:09,467
I'm serious. I want a camera too!
I'll get it installed!

469
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,387
Do you? A 3-million-pixel HD camera
with adjustable angles. Deal?

470
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:15,890
-Got it. Let's do that. I'll get it.
-Okay.

471
00:32:15,973 --> 00:32:18,643
So get this out of here. Now.

472
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,482
What lovely weather.

473
00:32:24,565 --> 00:32:27,985
It's a great day
to file a complaint. Have a good day.

474
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:28,986
Yeong-guk!

475
00:32:30,196 --> 00:32:31,405
Are you okay?

476
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:32,782
Gosh.

477
00:32:33,658 --> 00:32:37,453
I don't think I can live a long life.

478
00:32:37,536 --> 00:32:38,829
Open the windows!

479
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:43,584
WE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE FAMILY
GONGJIN-DONG

480
00:32:54,804 --> 00:32:56,013
We have a full schedule.

481
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:59,225
Yes. Make sure you stretch beforehand.

482
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:01,477
Stretch? Okay.

483
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:05,314
Hye-jin, help me out. Look.

484
00:33:06,732 --> 00:33:09,694
Which color suits me better?

485
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:11,070
They're both pretty.

486
00:33:12,446 --> 00:33:13,864
-This one.
-This?

487
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:19,704
What's with the makeup?

488
00:33:19,787 --> 00:33:21,580
Our booked patient will be here soon.

489
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,999
-A booked patient?
-Yes.

490
00:33:23,082 --> 00:33:26,419
Who is it? "Lee Seung-gi, Choi Eun-cheol…"

491
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,214
-Hello.
-Hello.

492
00:33:30,297 --> 00:33:31,674
Hello.

493
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:36,637
-Please wait one minute.
-Okay.

494
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:42,852
-Let me help you.
-Okay.

495
00:33:46,147 --> 00:33:47,356
-This way.
-Okay.

496
00:33:57,658 --> 00:34:00,578
We're done with the root canal treatment.

497
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:03,330
Ms. Pyo, please take care of the rest.

498
00:34:03,414 --> 00:34:04,331
Yes, ma'am.

499
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:07,793
-Keep your mouth open.
-Okay.

500
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:10,880
I'm going to
temporarily fill in your tooth.

501
00:34:10,963 --> 00:34:13,716
Mr. Choi, what did you do last weekend?

502
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:19,305
You worked? It must've been tiring.

503
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:21,724
What do you do in your free time?

504
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:26,729
I see. You must enjoy reading.

505
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,523
What's your favorite book?

506
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:39,158
My Sweet Orange Tree.

507
00:34:40,576 --> 00:34:41,744
Open your mouth.

508
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:50,503
What was that?

509
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:53,297
How did she understand?

510
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:58,385
Bye. I'll really get going.

511
00:34:58,469 --> 00:34:59,303
Bye!

512
00:35:02,848 --> 00:35:04,934
-Want a ride?
-Of course.

513
00:35:06,227 --> 00:35:08,020
What are you holding?

514
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:11,440
I got a halibut as a thank you.

515
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:14,151
Grill it for your lunch.

516
00:35:14,235 --> 00:35:15,778
I'm going to have it with you.

517
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:20,574
Look at you,
trying to make me cook for you.

518
00:35:21,158 --> 00:35:24,370
-You caught me.
-Hold on tight if you don't want to fall.

519
00:35:24,453 --> 00:35:27,164
-Okay.
-All right.

520
00:35:28,582 --> 00:35:30,543
-Let's go.
-Okay.

521
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:42,972
THEATER OF LIFE

522
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,145
Again? Aren't you sick of it?

523
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:53,149
For me, this is
the most entertaining show ever.

524
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:54,775
No wonder there's that song.

525
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:58,154
How wonderful would it be

526
00:35:58,237 --> 00:35:59,655
-If I was on TV?
-Gosh.

527
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:03,075
Stop that nonsense and eat up.

528
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:09,748
I love this soy sauce marinated crab.

529
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:12,334
What did Won-seok say? He liked it, right?

530
00:36:12,418 --> 00:36:15,421
I don't know. He was so busy

531
00:36:15,921 --> 00:36:17,548
that I had to leave right away.

532
00:36:17,631 --> 00:36:20,426
You went all the way there
but didn't get to eat together?

533
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:25,264
Hey, mix some rice
in the shell and eat it.

534
00:36:25,347 --> 00:36:26,807
-Okay.
-It's delicious.

535
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:29,226
What about you?

536
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,811
I'm good.

537
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,034
What was that back there?

538
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:47,286
Are you interested in Mr. Choi?

539
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:48,370
Yes.

540
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:51,498
Unbelievable. You only met him twice.

541
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:54,335
Hey, that doesn't matter.

542
00:36:54,418 --> 00:36:56,921
He's cute and looks amazing
in that uniform.

543
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:00,591
I saw his birthdate,
and he's four years my junior.

544
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:02,051
It's game over.

545
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:04,511
Lucky it's so simple for you.

546
00:37:07,014 --> 00:37:08,766
How did you know his birthdate?

547
00:37:10,935 --> 00:37:12,895
Don't look into our patients' information.

548
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:15,773
You're breaching
the Personal Information Protection Act.

549
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:17,191
Dr. Yoon!

550
00:37:18,442 --> 00:37:19,568
Goodness.

551
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:25,783
I know I agreed to take care of it,
but you can't barge in here like this.

552
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:27,326
I know.

553
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,372
But I missed it so much.

554
00:37:31,455 --> 00:37:34,833
Fine. Since you're here already,
take a good look.

555
00:37:36,126 --> 00:37:39,088
Dr. Yoon, have you held it on your palm?

556
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:40,172
No.

557
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,593
-Have you taken it for a walk at all?
-Of course not.

558
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:50,140
I've been studying about hedgehogs lately.

559
00:37:50,808 --> 00:37:52,768
You can actually form a bond with them.

560
00:37:53,602 --> 00:37:55,145
And when you do,

561
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:59,066
they lay down their spines
so you can pet them.

562
00:37:59,149 --> 00:38:02,653
Hey, feeding it and picking up
its poop is already a nuisance.

563
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:05,364
And you'll be taking it back soon.

564
00:38:05,447 --> 00:38:09,368
Still, it'll be nice
to form a bond while it's here.

565
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,873
When's the test? Is I-jun studying hard?

566
00:38:14,957 --> 00:38:17,251
He always studies hard.

567
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:20,170
Anyway, it's his birthday today.

568
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:21,880
I see.

569
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:25,259
-Tell him I said happy birthday.
-Okay.

570
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:28,137
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

571
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,681
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

572
00:38:30,764 --> 00:38:34,184
-Happy birthday, dear I-jun
-Happy birthday, dear I-jun

573
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:36,353
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

574
00:38:36,437 --> 00:38:38,522
Hooray!

575
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:40,566
-Blow out the candles.
-Blow them.

576
00:38:48,532 --> 00:38:49,742
I-jun.

577
00:38:50,909 --> 00:38:53,871
Thank you for being my son.

578
00:38:55,122 --> 00:38:58,083
Here. This is from me.

579
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:01,128
I got you the most expensive toy blocks.

580
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:03,922
Have you ever seen him
play with toys before?

581
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:05,674
I-jun, I got you a book.

582
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:10,679
You got him a book? He always reads.
How thoughtless.

583
00:39:11,263 --> 00:39:14,850
Thank you. I promise to repay you
for your kindness when I get older.

584
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:18,812
I-jun, I told you to speak casually to me.

585
00:39:18,896 --> 00:39:21,565
You agreed to do so, didn't you?

586
00:39:21,648 --> 00:39:23,942
That's how you can repay me.

587
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,987
He's not a kid. Let him do as he wants.

588
00:39:27,571 --> 00:39:28,489
Don't force him.

589
00:39:28,572 --> 00:39:30,366
That's rich coming from someone

590
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:33,369
who begged him to talk casually
and treat you like a friend.

591
00:39:33,452 --> 00:39:35,412
-Don't pretend you didn't.
-When did I?

592
00:39:35,496 --> 00:39:37,581
Last time, you begged him…

593
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:40,626
I have something to say.

594
00:39:41,543 --> 00:39:45,047
Starting next year,
we don't need to gather for my birthday.

595
00:39:45,631 --> 00:39:47,299
You two are divorced.

596
00:39:54,473 --> 00:39:55,974
Right, we are.

597
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:59,561
Son, are you hurt by that?

598
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:03,065
I was when I was six.
But now that I'm nine, I'm okay.

599
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:06,610
I'm glad. But our divorce

600
00:40:06,693 --> 00:40:10,656
doesn't change the fact
that you're our son.

601
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:13,700
We want to celebrate
your birthday together.

602
00:40:13,784 --> 00:40:15,202
We really do.

603
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:17,579
Yes. She's right.

604
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:21,500
I-jun, your birthday is
the most important day of the year to me.

605
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,502
It's like a national holiday.

606
00:40:25,462 --> 00:40:26,338
Okay.

607
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:31,385
Do you want to try the cake, sweetie?
I bought the tastiest one.

608
00:40:31,468 --> 00:40:33,804
-Let's cut it.
-Dessert comes after the meal.

609
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:35,973
Yes. You're right.

610
00:40:36,056 --> 00:40:37,641
-Right.
-Then let's eat.

611
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,602
Yes, let's eat first.

612
00:40:41,145 --> 00:40:42,104
Go on.

613
00:40:43,647 --> 00:40:44,857
Eat first.

614
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,734
Don't you know he waits
until the adults eat first?

615
00:40:47,818 --> 00:40:51,447
Right. I forgot. All right, look.

616
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,908
Here I go. An entire spoonful.

617
00:40:57,661 --> 00:40:58,996
Thank you for the meal.

618
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:00,622
Right.

619
00:41:01,665 --> 00:41:02,708
Let's eat.

620
00:41:06,837 --> 00:41:08,297
Thank you for the meal.

621
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,923
Took you long enough.

622
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,642
Your cucumber kimchi is still so tasty.

623
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:25,397
You know, I crave it every now and then.

624
00:41:28,025 --> 00:41:29,067
Eat lots.

625
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,741
I-jun, have some japchae.

626
00:41:35,824 --> 00:41:37,034
Have this.

627
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:39,203
You must have some on your birthday.

628
00:41:41,705 --> 00:41:43,790
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

629
00:41:43,874 --> 00:41:46,376
Ms. Dentist, you have a patient.

630
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,878
I said I didn't want to come.

631
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:51,006
I'm going to give you an earful
once we're out of here!

632
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:52,925
-That way?
-Gosh.

633
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:56,094
-Yes.
-Let me down this instant!

634
00:41:56,678 --> 00:41:59,681
Judging by the x-ray,
you must have been in a lot of pain.

635
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,684
Why? Is it bad?

636
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:05,479
I'd like to speak with her,
so can you please butt out?

637
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:09,316
Talk with her.

638
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,444
There's not much to say.

639
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:15,280
I've been chewing for the past 80 years.

640
00:42:15,364 --> 00:42:18,659
It's only natural
that my teeth have grown weak.

641
00:42:18,742 --> 00:42:21,828
But they're in pretty good condition
for your age.

642
00:42:21,912 --> 00:42:22,746
What?

643
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:24,706
You can still get implants.

644
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:28,502
Implants? I heard they're expensive.

645
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:32,130
Well…. I understand
why you think that way.

646
00:42:32,214 --> 00:42:36,385
But your insurance will cover up to 2,
so you'll only pay 30 percent.

647
00:42:36,468 --> 00:42:38,387
You just need to pay for one.

648
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:41,014
How much is that in total?

649
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:44,726
Well… Let me see.

650
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:48,605
About this much.

651
00:42:49,523 --> 00:42:52,859
Oh, dear. That's too expensive.

652
00:42:52,943 --> 00:42:56,863
Why would I spend
so much solely on my teeth?

653
00:42:56,947 --> 00:42:59,032
I'll just pull them out.

654
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:01,201
-Grandma.
-What?

655
00:43:01,868 --> 00:43:06,790
If it's too expensive,
you can get dentures instead.

656
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:11,461
But implants are
four times as strong as dentures.

657
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:15,757
And since you have strong bones,
it'd be best if you got--

658
00:43:15,841 --> 00:43:17,884
Forget it. I don't need them.

659
00:43:17,968 --> 00:43:20,929
Just pull out all my weak teeth.

660
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:24,474
Grandma, give it some thought and--

661
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:25,601
Ma'am.

662
00:43:25,684 --> 00:43:28,645
Your teeth aren't just
something you can pull out.

663
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:32,566
It could even be
life-threatening for the elderly.

664
00:43:32,649 --> 00:43:34,568
You won't be able to eat well,

665
00:43:34,651 --> 00:43:36,570
then you won't get enough nutrients.

666
00:43:36,653 --> 00:43:38,822
Your bones will weaken
and make it hard to walk.

667
00:43:38,905 --> 00:43:40,699
It could get really serious.

668
00:43:40,782 --> 00:43:43,285
Hey, you don't
have to scare her like that.

669
00:43:45,412 --> 00:43:46,455
Are you short on money?

670
00:43:46,538 --> 00:43:47,831
-Hey.
-What?

671
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:50,709
Do you not have enough money?

672
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:54,087
Not enough money? What do you take me for?

673
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:59,259
I own a house here and a big area of land.

674
00:43:59,343 --> 00:44:00,719
That's not all.

675
00:44:01,386 --> 00:44:05,098
My son works as an accountant in Seoul.

676
00:44:05,182 --> 00:44:10,062
Gosh. And my granddaughter
goes to Harvard University in America.

677
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:14,149
So you just don't want
to spend money on your treatment?

678
00:44:15,692 --> 00:44:17,694
Then I have nothing more to say.

679
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,405
-You can leave.
-Hey.

680
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:22,741
What? Unbelievable.

681
00:44:22,824 --> 00:44:24,701
Fine. I'll leave.

682
00:44:24,785 --> 00:44:27,704
You think being a dentist
makes you so great?

683
00:44:27,788 --> 00:44:30,874
-Fine. I'll leave.
-Grandma.

684
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,501
Grandma.

685
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:34,961
-Let's talk about this.
-No!

686
00:44:35,045 --> 00:44:37,214
-Hear me out.
-I don't want to.

687
00:44:37,297 --> 00:44:38,882
Come on.

688
00:44:38,965 --> 00:44:40,717
Let me just say something.

689
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:42,010
-Grandma.
-Forget it.

690
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:44,888
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

691
00:44:48,058 --> 00:44:49,017
I thought you left.

692
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:51,186
-Was that necessary?
-What do you mean?

693
00:44:51,269 --> 00:44:53,814
"Are you short on money?"
How could a doctor say that?

694
00:44:53,897 --> 00:44:56,149
Were you going to send her away?

695
00:44:56,233 --> 00:44:57,275
Watch what you say.

696
00:44:57,776 --> 00:45:01,863
I only asked because she was adamant
about not getting the treatment.

697
00:45:01,947 --> 00:45:03,949
You could've put it nicely.

698
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:06,410
No. A dental clinic
isn't a convenience store

699
00:45:06,493 --> 00:45:09,496
where you can ask for whatever you want.

700
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,251
Pulling out your teeth is a huge deal.
She was too rash and stubborn about it.

701
00:45:14,334 --> 00:45:17,504
I understand what you mean,
but you could've said it differently.

702
00:45:17,587 --> 00:45:19,589
What if she was your grandmother?

703
00:45:19,673 --> 00:45:22,426
-But she isn't, so why should I care?
-What?

704
00:45:22,509 --> 00:45:26,847
And you. You're not even
her guardian, so why are you overreacting?

705
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:31,977
People don't change so easily, do they?

706
00:45:43,655 --> 00:45:45,699
What was that? He's so annoying.

707
00:45:56,334 --> 00:45:58,462
CHUNG-HO HARDWARE

708
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:06,511
What? Your goods haven't arrived.

709
00:46:06,595 --> 00:46:09,264
You only put in the order
and haven't paid yet, right?

710
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:10,640
I already paid.

711
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:11,975
Geum-cheol.

712
00:46:12,976 --> 00:46:14,644
You can't fool me.

713
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:18,315
Fine, I haven't.

714
00:46:19,024 --> 00:46:20,484
Why do you ask?

715
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:26,490
I know you.

716
00:46:26,573 --> 00:46:29,659
You never pay money upfront
before you check the goods.

717
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:33,205
I'm begging you. Please stop coming here.

718
00:46:33,288 --> 00:46:35,540
I'll order it again next time.

719
00:46:35,624 --> 00:46:37,250
And aren't I your only friend?

720
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,127
You're right.

721
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:42,005
But I think I can manage
without having any friends.

722
00:46:42,088 --> 00:46:43,965
-Do you have any envelopes?
-I do.

723
00:46:59,064 --> 00:47:00,440
Isn't the weather lovely?

724
00:47:06,988 --> 00:47:08,990
Are you mad that I dragged you there?

725
00:47:11,201 --> 00:47:13,954
You seem pretty upset.

726
00:47:16,748 --> 00:47:19,417
But you see,
I'd like you to receive proper treatment.

727
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:22,587
Aren't your toothaches
bothering you so much?

728
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:30,929
So I'm going to give you something.

729
00:47:31,012 --> 00:47:32,973
Don't get mad, okay? You know

730
00:47:34,015 --> 00:47:36,560
I grew this big because you fed me.

731
00:47:37,143 --> 00:47:39,688
So I'd like to pay for your treatment.

732
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:43,942
So with this,
how about we get those teeth fixed?

733
00:47:47,195 --> 00:47:51,616
I'll give you three seconds to run.

734
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,160
-Come on, now.
-Three.

735
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:55,579
-Let's…
-Two.

736
00:47:55,662 --> 00:47:57,080
Let's talk about this.

737
00:47:57,163 --> 00:47:58,832
-One.
-Grandma!

738
00:47:59,624 --> 00:48:01,167
Gosh, I got wet too.

739
00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:02,085
Grandma!

740
00:48:02,168 --> 00:48:04,296
-Get lost!
-Fine.

741
00:48:07,007 --> 00:48:10,468
-Grandma, I'll come back tomorrow.
-You're still here?

742
00:48:11,011 --> 00:48:12,846
-See you tomorrow.
-Gosh.

743
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:14,723
I hate him.

744
00:48:14,806 --> 00:48:17,892
How dare he judge me?

745
00:48:17,976 --> 00:48:20,520
And why does he meddle
in other people's affairs?

746
00:48:21,271 --> 00:48:23,481
He should mind his own business.

747
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:25,567
He's always so nosy.

748
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,944
Does he want
to be complimented for his kindness?

749
00:48:28,028 --> 00:48:29,696
-Why are you so worked up?
-Am I?

750
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:33,658
-I'm not.
-You're

751
00:48:33,742 --> 00:48:36,411
at 160bpm and 100dB at the least.

752
00:48:36,494 --> 00:48:39,831
I've never seen you
get so worked up over someone.

753
00:48:40,832 --> 00:48:44,878
I mean, he keeps rubbing me the wrong way.

754
00:48:46,296 --> 00:48:48,131
CHIEF HONG

755
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:51,176
He's calling me.

756
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:53,428
See? He's so irritating.

757
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:02,562
Why did you call me so late?

758
00:49:02,646 --> 00:49:04,522
-You still came.
-Bye.

759
00:49:04,606 --> 00:49:05,732
Sit down.

760
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:23,166
Do you know what those lights are?

761
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:25,293
Who cares?

762
00:49:25,377 --> 00:49:26,961
They're squid boats.

763
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:29,839
Those fishermen are hard at work.

764
00:49:30,507 --> 00:49:34,260
But from afar,
those boats just look like pretty lights.

765
00:49:37,806 --> 00:49:41,309
Ms. Gam-ri has been cleaning squid
for decades now.

766
00:49:41,393 --> 00:49:44,145
But she never gets sick of them
and loves squid the most,

767
00:49:45,063 --> 00:49:46,981
although she hasn't eaten them for years.

768
00:49:47,982 --> 00:49:50,568
If you're trying
to evoke sympathy, just stop.

769
00:49:50,652 --> 00:49:53,905
I'll pay for the treatment.
But I have a favor to ask you.

770
00:49:55,073 --> 00:49:56,282
What is it?

771
00:49:56,866 --> 00:49:58,201
Keep it a secret.

772
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:02,831
Tell her it's some other cheap treatment.

773
00:50:03,873 --> 00:50:05,083
I can't do that.

774
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:08,837
As a doctor, I need
to take responsibility for what I do.

775
00:50:09,504 --> 00:50:12,048
I must notify my patients
of the treatment process.

776
00:50:12,132 --> 00:50:15,135
Fine. Then just remind me
of the total cost.

777
00:50:16,177 --> 00:50:17,637
I'll pay the rest,

778
00:50:18,555 --> 00:50:21,015
so just tell her
that you gave her a discount.

779
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:22,559
Why are you doing this?

780
00:50:23,226 --> 00:50:24,519
She doesn't want it.

781
00:50:24,602 --> 00:50:25,937
No, she just can't.

782
00:50:27,272 --> 00:50:29,691
She's been selfless all her life,

783
00:50:30,233 --> 00:50:33,111
so she doesn't know
how to take care of herself.

784
00:50:33,695 --> 00:50:35,155
So she endures the pain?

785
00:50:36,322 --> 00:50:38,616
-How selfish of her.
-"Selfish"?

786
00:50:39,325 --> 00:50:41,494
She's the most selfless woman
I've ever met.

787
00:50:41,578 --> 00:50:44,080
She did everything she could
to provide for her kids.

788
00:50:44,164 --> 00:50:47,167
And even now. She doesn't want
to burden them. Don't you get it?

789
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:51,171
No, I don't understand.
It's foolish and frustrating to watch.

790
00:50:51,254 --> 00:50:52,964
Why are you so pessimistic?

791
00:50:53,047 --> 00:50:55,633
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

792
00:50:56,593 --> 00:50:59,220
Do you know
what it means to be a good parent?

793
00:51:00,263 --> 00:51:01,973
It's staying healthy for a long time.

794
00:51:04,726 --> 00:51:07,937
They shouldn't endure pain
to save money for their children.

795
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:10,982
They should take care of themselves.

796
00:51:11,816 --> 00:51:12,817
Do you get it?

797
00:52:14,254 --> 00:52:17,966
SUNDAE, TTEOK

798
00:52:30,353 --> 00:52:31,896
Mom!

799
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:08,182
Hey…

800
00:53:14,188 --> 00:53:15,607
Don't cry, Mom.

801
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:18,443
I'm crying because I'm excited.

802
00:53:23,698 --> 00:53:24,782
Don't cry, dear.

803
00:53:24,866 --> 00:53:25,909
You too.

804
00:53:31,956 --> 00:53:33,541
My mom passed away.

805
00:53:35,418 --> 00:53:39,839
It's okay. I don't remember
much anyway since I was so little.

806
00:53:42,342 --> 00:53:43,968
No, you're not okay.

807
00:54:01,527 --> 00:54:02,904
Ms. Gam-ri.

808
00:54:03,863 --> 00:54:05,573
Ms. Gam-ri.

809
00:54:06,115 --> 00:54:09,911
I didn't bring any money today.
I'm serious. I didn't bring it.

810
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:16,376
How could you throw water at me?
I could've caught a cold.

811
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:20,296
No one catches a cold
during the summertime.

812
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:24,217
You saw how scary I was
when I got angry, right?

813
00:54:24,801 --> 00:54:27,512
I did. I won't upset you anymore.

814
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,891
Why aren't you using the washing machine?

815
00:54:32,725 --> 00:54:35,728
There's not much laundry
to run the washer.

816
00:54:35,812 --> 00:54:37,397
It's a waste of electricity.

817
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,065
Let me do it. Go sit down.

818
00:54:39,148 --> 00:54:41,317
-It's okay.
-No, let me.

819
00:54:42,193 --> 00:54:43,486
Rub it well,

820
00:54:43,569 --> 00:54:45,780
-Okay.
-or it won't be clean enough.

821
00:54:45,863 --> 00:54:49,242
Gosh, you and your nagging.
Fine. Look. Happy?

822
00:54:49,325 --> 00:54:51,577
-Good.
-Go sit down.

823
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:53,287
I'll leave it to you.

824
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:55,540
Okay, enough nagging.

825
00:55:00,169 --> 00:55:01,004
Grandma.

826
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:03,965
I'm actually upset with you.

827
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:07,176
You accept money from your son,

828
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,054
but why not from me?
Am I a stranger or what?

829
00:55:10,138 --> 00:55:13,099
Do you want to get drenched again?

830
00:55:13,182 --> 00:55:14,183
I take it back.

831
00:55:21,691 --> 00:55:27,196
I love the sound
of that bell you hung for me.

832
00:55:28,614 --> 00:55:31,200
Right? Enjoy the sound.

833
00:55:31,868 --> 00:55:34,037
And go enjoy a lot of great views

834
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,831
and eat a lot of good food.

835
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:42,045
Someone told me

836
00:55:42,545 --> 00:55:46,549
that the best thing a parent can do
for their child is staying healthy.

837
00:55:53,473 --> 00:55:57,226
Gosh, this is a superb bar of soap.
I wonder who made it.

838
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:02,607
Who made it?
It's no other than Du-sik himself.

839
00:56:04,025 --> 00:56:07,236
Ms. Gam-ri has been cleaning squid
for decades now.

840
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:10,740
But she never gets sick of them
and loves squid the most,

841
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:13,576
although she hasn't eaten them for years.

842
00:56:15,411 --> 00:56:16,913
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

843
00:56:17,538 --> 00:56:19,207
Isn't the squid too tough to chew?

844
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,416
Really?

845
00:56:24,545 --> 00:56:26,672
Hey, all squid are about this tough.

846
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,299
Really?

847
00:56:35,556 --> 00:56:37,183
This is tough too.

848
00:56:37,266 --> 00:56:38,684
What's gotten into you?

849
00:56:39,977 --> 00:56:41,771
This too.

850
00:56:44,524 --> 00:56:47,401
And this. Why are they
all so difficult to chew?

851
00:56:47,485 --> 00:56:51,447
Hye-jin, I'm taking your food away
if you keep complaining about it.

852
00:56:52,782 --> 00:56:53,908
They're completely fine.

853
00:57:06,629 --> 00:57:08,047
Hello?

854
00:57:08,131 --> 00:57:12,343
Won-seok, are you busy right now?

855
00:57:12,426 --> 00:57:15,805
I am, but I can talk for a minute.

856
00:57:16,514 --> 00:57:20,309
I see. Did you have lunch?

857
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:22,270
Of course. It's past lunchtime.

858
00:57:23,688 --> 00:57:26,441
Right. Did you try
the soy sauce marinated crab?

859
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:31,487
You've always liked it
since you were little.

860
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:35,992
Well, I've been too swamped
with work to eat at home lately.

861
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:38,077
I'll have it today.

862
00:57:38,161 --> 00:57:40,830
Why are you so busy?

863
00:57:40,913 --> 00:57:43,666
Take good care of your health.

864
00:57:43,749 --> 00:57:46,335
-You too, Mom.
-Okay.

865
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:50,548
By the way, Du-sik called a few days ago.

866
00:57:51,424 --> 00:57:52,633
He did?

867
00:57:53,759 --> 00:57:55,928
Hey, Won-seok. It's me, Du-sik.

868
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:57,930
Have you been well?

869
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:00,808
You see,

870
00:58:00,892 --> 00:58:04,437
I took your mom to the dentist.
Her teeth aren't in good condition.

871
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,482
She needs implants,
but she's vehemently refusing to get them.

872
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:09,108
Right. I know.

873
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:12,987
How about you convince her?

874
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:16,657
Did Du-sik tell you about it already?

875
00:58:17,325 --> 00:58:20,661
So what do you think I should do?

876
00:58:21,204 --> 00:58:25,583
I heard you were refusing to get
the implants. I can't force you to do it.

877
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:27,585
I looked it up.

878
00:58:28,294 --> 00:58:31,756
And some say that dental implants
are rather bad for the elderly.

879
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:35,051
So won't it be better
to get dentures later?

880
00:58:35,134 --> 00:58:37,386
-What?
-You see…

881
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:39,472
money is tight this year.

882
00:58:39,555 --> 00:58:41,557
Min-ju is studying in the States,

883
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,519
and her tuition is quite expensive.

884
00:58:46,646 --> 00:58:51,108
Oh, dear. Don't worry about me.

885
00:58:51,192 --> 00:58:53,611
I'm completely fine.

886
00:58:53,694 --> 00:58:58,157
Don't worry about me,
and focus on your family.

887
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,787
How is Min-ju doing?

888
00:59:10,586 --> 00:59:12,296
It's so hectic today.

889
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,090
You're doing well.

890
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,717
You know, we had more patients this week.

891
00:59:17,385 --> 00:59:19,595
Do you think word has gotten out
about my skills?

892
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,763
It must have.

893
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:28,062
PATIENT CHART
KIM GAM-RI

894
00:59:40,366 --> 00:59:43,494
Why am I here? I must be nuts.

895
00:59:46,622 --> 00:59:47,540
Hello.

896
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,584
Goodbye.

897
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:51,127
Wait.

898
00:59:52,169 --> 00:59:54,297
Did you have dinner?

899
00:59:55,673 --> 00:59:56,507
No.

900
00:59:57,508 --> 00:59:59,427
I didn't have any rice,

901
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:02,430
so I made some potato dough soup.

902
01:00:02,513 --> 01:00:05,016
-Have you tried it before?
-No.

903
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:06,976
Try some.

904
01:00:07,059 --> 01:00:11,564
I ground some fresh potatoes,
got moisture out of it,

905
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:14,108
and boiled it in meat broth.

906
01:00:14,191 --> 01:00:16,235
They're very chewy and delicious.

907
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:18,154
Thank you.

908
01:00:22,617 --> 01:00:23,492
How is it?

909
01:00:24,368 --> 01:00:25,911
It's really good.

910
01:00:25,995 --> 01:00:26,829
I'm glad.

911
01:00:26,912 --> 01:00:28,789
-Eat up.
-Okay.

912
01:00:36,714 --> 01:00:41,218
The elderly Ms. Gam-ri went to her room
to show us her most treasured belonging…

913
01:00:41,302 --> 01:00:45,598
This is me two years ago.

914
01:00:45,681 --> 01:00:47,808
We filmed it in that very room.

915
01:00:49,894 --> 01:00:52,313
-I see.
-Look at this.

916
01:00:52,396 --> 01:00:55,941
-Gosh.
-This is proof that my late father

917
01:00:56,025 --> 01:01:02,198
served in the Korean Independence Army
in 1941

918
01:01:02,281 --> 01:01:07,453
and was assigned to the second unit.

919
01:01:07,536 --> 01:01:12,124
My mom gave this to me,
and I kept it ever since.

920
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:15,670
But I couldn't read
the Chinese characters.

921
01:01:16,337 --> 01:01:19,965
Then 30 years ago,

922
01:01:20,049 --> 01:01:23,302
a little boy read this to me.

923
01:01:23,386 --> 01:01:26,138
He was such a smart boy.

924
01:01:26,222 --> 01:01:29,016
-He was a prodigy.
-Grandma!

925
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,893
-What? Goodness.
-Grandma.

926
01:01:30,976 --> 01:01:33,437
Speak of the devil.

927
01:01:33,521 --> 01:01:35,898
This is Du-sik.

928
01:01:35,981 --> 01:01:36,982
Yes, Du-sik.

929
01:01:38,192 --> 01:01:40,861
Look. There's our Du-sik.

930
01:01:41,696 --> 01:01:44,949
Thanks to him,
my late dad was acknowledged

931
01:01:45,032 --> 01:01:48,327
as a patriot who fought
for our nation's independence.

932
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:49,870
When was it aired?

933
01:01:49,954 --> 01:01:51,706
Two years ago.

934
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:57,336
My dad named me after the Korean flag.

935
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:02,675
As you know, there are geon, gon, gam,
and ri in the flag. I'm Gam-ri.

936
01:02:03,259 --> 01:02:06,971
And my older brother's name was Geon-gon.

937
01:02:07,555 --> 01:02:09,682
-That's right.
-What a great name.

938
01:02:10,558 --> 01:02:12,226
You must be proud of your father.

939
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:15,396
Of course. I sure am.

940
01:02:17,189 --> 01:02:19,859
Goodness. You haven't been eating

941
01:02:19,942 --> 01:02:22,820
because I've been rambling on.

942
01:02:22,903 --> 01:02:26,866
No wonder people say
old people talk so much. Gosh.

943
01:02:27,867 --> 01:02:30,661
-Eat up.
-Okay.

944
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,168
Thank you for the meal.

945
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:42,006
Rather, I should thank you
for driving me to Seoul.

946
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:43,424
Thank you.

947
01:02:48,053 --> 01:02:51,891
I actually came by to tell you something,
but I had dinner instead.

948
01:02:51,974 --> 01:02:55,394
Of course.
Eating comes before anything else.

949
01:02:55,478 --> 01:02:57,480
Nothing's more important than that.

950
01:02:57,563 --> 01:02:59,231
Exactly.

951
01:02:59,774 --> 01:03:01,817
If you knew that,

952
01:03:01,901 --> 01:03:04,528
how could you ask me
to pull your teeth out?

953
01:03:08,532 --> 01:03:11,619
Toothaches are truly a pity.

954
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,413
It doesn't show,

955
01:03:14,497 --> 01:03:18,375
so no one but yourself
knows how painful it is.

956
01:03:19,084 --> 01:03:20,503
Not even your kids.

957
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,182
Please come back to the clinic.

958
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:38,771
I can't do it for free, but I'll
only charge you for the materials.

959
01:03:40,022 --> 01:03:41,065
What?

960
01:03:42,358 --> 01:03:44,985
But you have to keep it a secret.

961
01:03:45,528 --> 01:03:47,696
No one else should know.

962
01:03:48,197 --> 01:03:52,117
If people get wind of this,
I may have to close down my clinic.

963
01:03:52,868 --> 01:03:55,913
Then you shouldn't do this for me.

964
01:03:57,373 --> 01:03:59,416
I heard squid is your favorite food.

965
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:06,340
My mom's favorite food was sundae.

966
01:04:09,552 --> 01:04:13,264
I just want to help you enjoy it again.

967
01:04:14,014 --> 01:04:15,140
That's all.

968
01:04:19,311 --> 01:04:22,189
Du-sik must've said something to you.

969
01:04:23,524 --> 01:04:26,652
He's kind but too nosy.

970
01:04:28,112 --> 01:04:29,321
I agree.

971
01:04:32,032 --> 01:04:35,828
He hung that bell for me.

972
01:05:00,936 --> 01:05:04,356
Darn it. It must've been a big one.

973
01:05:05,983 --> 01:05:06,984
What's that?

974
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:12,948
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

975
01:05:23,292 --> 01:05:24,960
Hello.

976
01:05:26,754 --> 01:05:27,796
All right.

977
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,423
I'm here

978
01:05:29,506 --> 01:05:31,050
to get my implants done.

979
01:05:32,301 --> 01:05:33,218
I'm glad you came.

980
01:05:33,302 --> 01:05:35,304
Can I pay first?

981
01:05:35,387 --> 01:05:38,557
First, you should consult with me.

982
01:05:38,641 --> 01:05:40,851
We're done talking.

983
01:05:40,935 --> 01:05:43,395
I've already prepared the money.

984
01:05:46,065 --> 01:05:47,566
I'll pay it all at once.

985
01:05:50,194 --> 01:05:55,032
I've been working like a dog all my life,

986
01:05:55,115 --> 01:05:58,911
so don't you think I deserve to eat
as much squid as I want?

987
01:05:58,994 --> 01:06:01,121
It's too tough, so you should be careful.

988
01:06:01,205 --> 01:06:04,541
-What?
-Have it once a week.

989
01:06:06,877 --> 01:06:09,171
I got 3-million-pixel HD cameras.
And 2 of them.

990
01:06:09,254 --> 01:06:11,674
You can also adjust the angles freely.

991
01:06:13,425 --> 01:06:15,219
It was easy but took you long enough.

992
01:06:15,302 --> 01:06:19,890
Ms. Yeo, don't hurt my feelings like that.

993
01:06:19,974 --> 01:06:23,978
I had to have a serious talk
with the mayor to get those.

994
01:06:24,061 --> 01:06:27,064
Good job. Thank you for your help.

995
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:30,776
So why couldn't you
have talked with him sooner?

996
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:32,820
You were always a slowpoke.

997
01:06:32,903 --> 01:06:34,822
Ms. Yeo, what you just said

998
01:06:34,905 --> 01:06:37,199
was very private. It was personal.

999
01:06:37,282 --> 01:06:39,535
Shut it and just take this.

1000
01:06:40,035 --> 01:06:43,080
-What is it?
-What do you think? It's cucumber kimchi.

1001
01:06:43,914 --> 01:06:45,416
You said you craved it.

1002
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:47,501
Gosh.

1003
01:06:48,335 --> 01:06:49,336
Gosh.

1004
01:06:53,173 --> 01:06:55,092
Move around. Let's see if they're working.

1005
01:06:55,175 --> 01:06:56,844
Why, hello, Ms. Gam-ri.

1006
01:06:56,927 --> 01:07:00,264
Bring me some porridge this instant.

1007
01:07:00,347 --> 01:07:01,390
Porridge?

1008
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:04,476
Grandma!

1009
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,020
Grandma.

1010
01:07:08,439 --> 01:07:09,648
Where does it hurt?

1011
01:07:10,983 --> 01:07:12,359
Bring the table.

1012
01:07:12,443 --> 01:07:13,861
Okay. Hold on.

1013
01:07:15,612 --> 01:07:17,322
Where does it hurt?

1014
01:07:17,406 --> 01:07:19,825
You never asked me
to bring porridge before.

1015
01:07:19,908 --> 01:07:23,912
I didn't know
dental implants would be this painful.

1016
01:07:23,996 --> 01:07:28,667
Now that the anesthesia
has worn off, my head is ringing.

1017
01:07:28,751 --> 01:07:29,877
What?

1018
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:33,130
I went to the dental clinic this morning.

1019
01:07:34,298 --> 01:07:37,301
-Grandma!
-Stop calling me

1020
01:07:37,384 --> 01:07:40,471
-and give me the porridge. I'm starving.
-Okay.

1021
01:07:41,055 --> 01:07:45,517
How did such a stubborn woman
like you have a change of heart?

1022
01:07:47,144 --> 01:07:50,856
Dr. Yoon visited me yesterday.

1023
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,566
She did?

1024
01:07:52,649 --> 01:07:54,777
She offered to give me a discount

1025
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:58,363
and told me to get the treatment already.

1026
01:07:59,406 --> 01:08:03,619
I thought she was
a sly fox, but I was wrong.

1027
01:08:04,912 --> 01:08:07,247
On the outside, she's as cold as ice.

1028
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:10,167
But she has a soft heart.

1029
01:08:12,544 --> 01:08:17,382
She must have been
through a lot in her life.

1030
01:08:21,553 --> 01:08:22,930
-Spoon.
-Right.

1031
01:08:32,564 --> 01:08:33,565
What's going on?

1032
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:35,859
Is it a blackout?

1033
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:54,128
Hello, Ms. Yeo. This is Hye-jin.

1034
01:08:55,295 --> 01:08:57,923
I think the power went out.

1035
01:09:08,433 --> 01:09:10,435
Don't you have any candles?

1036
01:09:10,519 --> 01:09:13,147
Because blackouts aren't
that common in Seoul.

1037
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:15,399
Gosh. Sure.

1038
01:09:18,735 --> 01:09:21,446
What was that? Did you just attack me?

1039
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:23,031
I never…

1040
01:09:24,324 --> 01:09:26,201
Are you Hammurabi? An eye for an eye?

1041
01:09:26,285 --> 01:09:28,453
-Say, "Teeth."
-Teeth?

1042
01:09:30,497 --> 01:09:33,959
-And a tooth for a tooth.
-You're so childish.

1043
01:09:34,501 --> 01:09:37,004
Hold on. Let's see.

1044
01:09:40,174 --> 01:09:44,386
Gosh, what don't you have
in that bag of yours?

1045
01:09:44,469 --> 01:09:45,762
How did the blackout happen?

1046
01:09:46,305 --> 01:09:50,350
I was washing my hair,
and the power went out all of a sudden.

1047
01:09:50,434 --> 01:09:53,437
Did this happen
to the entire neighborhood?

1048
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,274
No, just here. Did you check the fuse box?

1049
01:09:57,357 --> 01:09:58,942
The fuse box?

1050
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,278
Where is it?

1051
01:10:03,405 --> 01:10:04,239
Forget it.

1052
01:10:05,949 --> 01:10:07,034
The fuse box?

1053
01:10:10,412 --> 01:10:11,330
Gosh.

1054
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:15,959
I didn't know it was there.

1055
01:10:17,961 --> 01:10:19,796
The circuit breaker is still on.

1056
01:10:21,506 --> 01:10:23,425
I think it's the service wire.

1057
01:10:24,176 --> 01:10:25,677
We should call the power company.

1058
01:10:28,388 --> 01:10:31,183
Am I cursed or something?

1059
01:10:31,266 --> 01:10:34,394
It's just a small incident. Hang on.

1060
01:10:36,355 --> 01:10:37,773
Thank you.

1061
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:43,445
There's an issue
with the power supply line. That's why.

1062
01:10:43,528 --> 01:10:45,697
They're looking into it.
It'll get fixed soon.

1063
01:10:46,281 --> 01:10:49,576
Does that mean
I have to wait in the dark like this?

1064
01:10:50,494 --> 01:10:52,454
What? Are you scared?

1065
01:10:53,455 --> 01:10:56,208
Of course not.
I'm not scared. It was just a question.

1066
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:57,542
Where's your friend?

1067
01:10:58,377 --> 01:10:59,586
She went to have a facial.

1068
01:11:00,212 --> 01:11:02,214
Do you want me to wait with you
until she comes back?

1069
01:11:07,094 --> 01:11:08,345
Do you want some ice cream?

1070
01:11:11,265 --> 01:11:17,271
I'm just afraid that the ice cream
will melt due to the blackout. Hold on.

1071
01:11:33,912 --> 01:11:35,038
My goodness.

1072
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:39,710
Isn't that Bo-ra's hedgehog?

1073
01:11:39,793 --> 01:11:40,627
It is.

1074
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:42,796
I didn't know it was here.

1075
01:11:42,879 --> 01:11:44,256
Since you turned her down.

1076
01:11:44,923 --> 01:11:48,510
I thought you would've
offered to help her gladly.

1077
01:11:48,593 --> 01:11:49,970
Why did you decline?

1078
01:11:51,847 --> 01:11:53,765
I don't take in anything that's alive.

1079
01:11:57,269 --> 01:11:58,270
You guys are similar.

1080
01:11:58,937 --> 01:12:00,689
The hedgehog is just like you.

1081
01:12:01,898 --> 01:12:03,650
You're both spiky.

1082
01:12:03,734 --> 01:12:06,278
-What are you talking about?
-You even look alike.

1083
01:12:06,903 --> 01:12:08,530
You're so annoying.

1084
01:12:08,613 --> 01:12:09,448
I'm sorry.

1085
01:12:11,491 --> 01:12:12,492
What was that?

1086
01:12:13,952 --> 01:12:16,496
It's unlike you to apologize right away.

1087
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:20,292
I've been harsh on you
when I didn't know much about you.

1088
01:12:23,337 --> 01:12:26,048
I misjudged you. Sorry.

1089
01:12:27,632 --> 01:12:29,801
Stop that. You're scaring me.

1090
01:12:30,552 --> 01:12:33,430
If you didn't visit her,
she wouldn't have gotten the treatment.

1091
01:12:34,056 --> 01:12:34,973
Thanks.

1092
01:12:37,434 --> 01:12:42,147
That's because… Well…
I didn't feel good about what I'd said.

1093
01:12:43,023 --> 01:12:45,192
And she did pay me.

1094
01:12:45,942 --> 01:12:48,904
I'm going to earn a lot here
and return to Seoul.

1095
01:12:49,404 --> 01:12:51,406
That hasn't changed, so don't be mistaken.

1096
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:53,658
Fine. I hope you become filthy rich.

1097
01:13:00,582 --> 01:13:01,625
Here.

1098
01:13:05,837 --> 01:13:07,297
Thanks for the ice cream.

1099
01:13:15,806 --> 01:13:18,642
What was that? It was so sudden.

1100
01:13:23,146 --> 01:13:24,314
CHIEF HONG

1101
01:13:27,484 --> 01:13:29,444
Open the fuse box.

1102
01:13:37,327 --> 01:13:39,287
What? No way.

1103
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,128
Chief Hong!

1104
01:13:47,796 --> 01:13:48,797
Where'd you get this?

1105
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,465
Be quiet. You'll wake everyone up.

1106
01:13:50,549 --> 01:13:51,508
Where'd you get this?

1107
01:13:51,591 --> 01:13:53,176
On the street.

1108
01:13:56,012 --> 01:13:59,391
It was swept out to sea.
Why does it look fine?

1109
01:14:02,686 --> 01:14:03,770
Awesome.

1110
01:14:32,215 --> 01:14:33,467
My God!

1111
01:14:34,676 --> 01:14:36,720
Is that a leg?

1112
01:14:44,728 --> 01:14:46,438
Why would a shoe be here?

1113
01:14:47,105 --> 01:14:48,523
I thought it was a leg.

1114
01:14:51,735 --> 01:14:52,569
What?

1115
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:55,614
HOW TO DRY WET SHOES

1116
01:15:00,035 --> 01:15:00,869
Interesting.

1117
01:15:00,952 --> 01:15:02,954
HOW TO DRY SOAKED SHOES IN MONSOON SEASON

1118
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:08,335
WIPE THE INSIDE WITH NEWSPAPERS

1119
01:15:08,418 --> 01:15:09,586
The inside too?

1120
01:15:12,088 --> 01:15:15,884
-Lastly, use cool air.
-Use what?

1121
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:18,011
Use cool air. Remember.

1122
01:16:46,808 --> 01:16:48,893
He's always around
when you least expect it,

1123
01:16:48,977 --> 01:16:50,270
so where is he today?

1124
01:16:50,353 --> 01:16:51,980
You have a crush on this guy.

1125
01:16:52,063 --> 01:16:54,107
A man and woman can be just friends.

1126
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:56,234
Many have been installing cameras
inside the examination room.

1127
01:16:56,318 --> 01:16:58,194
Doctor, you're quite the beauty.

1128
01:16:58,278 --> 01:17:02,407
-Chief Hong only has today to spare.
-I'll be there.

1129
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,784
-Dr. Yoon must be drunk.
-What?

1130
01:17:04,868 --> 01:17:08,371
It's Yoon Dental Clinic.
They need us there.

1131
01:17:08,455 --> 01:17:09,497
Oh my.

1132
01:17:09,581 --> 01:17:12,792
You can ask me just one question.

1133
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,337
Why did you come to Gongjin?

1134
01:17:17,797 --> 01:17:22,802
