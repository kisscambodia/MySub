1
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,595
KEEP TO THE RIGHT

2
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,678
The 44th floor.

3
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,763
-The doors are closing.
-Wait! Hold on!

4
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,391
Thank you.

5
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,561
Gosh, it's hot. Could you…

6
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,397
Oh, my. We live on the same floor.

7
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,773
I see.

8
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,358
It's nice to meet you.

9
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,901
You too.

10
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,320
I live in Unit 4403.

11
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,115
It's my daughter's house, not mine.

12
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,199
I see.

13
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,035
I'm only staying for a few days.

14
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,622
-You must've worked out.
-I did.

15
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,166
You're so pretty.

16
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,500
Thank you.

17
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,212
You look around my daughter's age.
Are you married?

18
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,922
No, not yet.

19
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,843
I see. People nowadays don't need
to get married if they're competent.

20
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,680
My daughter works for an ad company.
What about you?

21
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,808
I also work for a company.

22
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,435
Which company?

23
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,936
-Well, then.
-Right.

24
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,528
Oh, my. You're right next door.

25
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,822
Right.

26
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,326
Goodness. People these days
order delivery too often.

27
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,747
-It's healthier to cook yourself.
-I see.

28
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,374
Would you like some of my side dishes?

29
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,668
No, that's okay.

30
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,046
I appreciate it, though.

31
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,173
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, ma'am.

32
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,135
-Have a good day.
-Okay.

33

DOCTOR YOON HYE-JIN

35
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,349
Dr. Yoon, Ms. Kim Yeon-ok is here.

36
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,226
She's here early.

37
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,814
EPISODE 1

38
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,067
-Hello.
-Hello.

39
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,488
You're from this morning…

40
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,325
What a small world.

41
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,453
You said you worked for a company,
but you're actually a dentist.

42
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,456
Shall we get you an X-ray first?

43
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,417
-Sure.
-Okay.

44
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,007
Thank you so much.

45
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,759
-My pleasure.
-Many of my teeth ached.

46
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,138
I was worried it'd be costly,
but you're too kind.

47
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,891
My daughter's paying, so I wasn't going
to do it if it was pricey.

48
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,270
I see. Your daughter must care
about you a lot.

49
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,646
She does.

50
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,317
Go home safely,
and I'll see you next time you come.

51
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,609
Thank you so much.

52
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,237
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

53
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,572
Goodbye.

54
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,285
Did we get new magazines?

55
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,413
You don't need to help me.

56
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,791
Aren't these beautiful?

57
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,669
They've been in my online cart

58
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,046
for a long time.

59
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,215
Why? I'm sure you can afford them.

60
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,217
I'm waiting for the promo code.

61
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,887
It doesn't hurt to get a discount.

62
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,972
They're so pretty.

63
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,018
Dr. Yoon, may I have a word with you?

64
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,352
Sure.

65
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,818
I just read your chart.

66
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,236
On Ms. Kim Yeon-ok?

67
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,489
Yes. You suggested only one implant

68
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,742
and three cavity treatments.

69
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:12,413
Correct. I'm planning to preserve
her teeth as much as possible.

70
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,209
-You're more careful than I thought.
-Sorry?

71
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,087
She'll need to get implants
for the rest sooner or later,

72
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,174
so it's best to get them right now
to prevent any more damage.

73
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,178
The best defense is a good offense.
You know that, right?

74
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,056
And you're one
of the best strikers our clinic has.

75
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,936
All right. Come up
with a new strategy, okay?

76
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,771
She's my patient.

77
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,902
I have the right
to plan her treatment the way I deem fit.

78
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,695
Please respect that.

79
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,075
Sure. If that's what you believe,

80
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,618
then okay.

81
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,828
Good day.

82
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,548
PPOYAN DENTAL CLINIC

83
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,674
What?

84
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,677
What do you mean?
I'm not in charge of her anymore?

85
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,639
The chief doctor is going
to treat Ms. Kim Yeon-ok herself.

86
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,647
What is this? Don't you know how to knock?

87
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,899
Ms. Kim is my patient.

88
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,234
-Give her back.
-What?

89
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,404
I don't care how you treat other patients,

90
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,239
but don't touch mine.

91
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,991
You seem to be hinting

92
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,618
there's a problem
with the way I treat patients.

93
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,208
It seems like you have
a lot to say, so go ahead.

94
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,840
You suggested double-jaw surgery
to a patient with joint issues,

95
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,426
non-insured materials to raise the fee,

96
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,053
and implants for teeth
that could be saved.

97
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,431
Ripping off patients is your specialty.

98
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,474
What did you say?

99
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:59,020
It's doctors like you that make people
suspect dental clinics of overtreatment.

100
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,688
Are you serious right now?

101
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,650
Did you forget I'm the one paying you?
How dare you act all upright?

102
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,528
You think your salary grows on trees?

103
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,532
Let's get our facts straight.

104
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,826
It's more like you're making money
thanks to me.

105
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,953
Most of the patients here are mine.

106
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,788
Have you gone mad?

107
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,501
How dare you look down on a doctor
who has much more experience than you?

108
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,421
"I will practise my profession
with conscience and dignity.

109
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,217
The health and well-being of my patient
will be my first consideration."

110
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,801
What are you spewing?

111
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,222
The Hippocratic Oath.
Do you even remember it?

112
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,558
And you call yourself a doctor.

113
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,644
Hippocrates would turn in his grave.

114
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,731
What a nutjob. Stop right there.

115
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,817
You won't get away with this.
You'll never be able to find work…

116
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,238
Hey! You're…

117
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,836
Hippocrates?

118
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,299
DOCTOR YOON HYE-JIN

119
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,803
So you just quit?

120
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,304
Yes.

121
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,847
What about the patient?

122
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,726
I introduced her to another clinic.

123
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,939
What is the motto you've lived by
for the past 20 years?

124
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,024
"Don't be nosy and focus on myself."

125
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,987
Exactly. It was very unlike you
to care about her.

126
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,323
She was on a power trip.
I have my own convictions as a doctor.

127
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,911
I see. Is that why you bought
those shoes as soon as you quit?

128
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:43,207
Of course. I gifted myself
a little something for my retirement.

129
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,669
The underlying message is
"Better days to come."

130
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,589
I'm sure your credit card company
sent you a message first.

131
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,091
"You have to pay
an extra two million won this month."

132
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,093
-Let's break up.
-Sure.

133
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,728
So what will you do?

134
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,939
Are you going to be jobless
and have bad credit?

135
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,192
I don't know. I don't have
enough money to open my own clinic.

136
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,946
I'll have to slave away
under someone wealthier than me.

137
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,326
I just hope I get paid well.

138
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,538
We're going to be slaves forever.

139
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,416
We got to find a way to escape it.

140
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,964
-Let's drink until we drop.
-Sounds good.

141
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,856
I didn't even shower.

142
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,401
What time is it?

143
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,488
DR. LEE

144
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,450
You're texting me already?

145
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,120
Can't run things without me?

146
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,460
How dare you post it
on the online dental community forum?

147
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,961
I'll make you pay for this.

148
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,382
You will never be able to work
in this line of work ever again.

149
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,466
Post what?

First…

154
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,289
I should delete this. Remove.

AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION,
WE DECIDED NOT TO RECRUIT YOU

170
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,655
This is bad.

171
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,159
Your chief doctor must be spreading
false rumors about you.

172
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,953
Our chief doctor
immediately knew it was you

173
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,914
as soon as he read your résumé.

174
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,728

179
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,974
so how could you send me
a guy who gets very seasick?

180
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,394
Jeez. You're still just as impatient.

181
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,147
No one's a pro from the start.
They need time to adjust.

182
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,941
Hey, a fisherman
that can't ride a boat is ridiculous.

183
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,695
He's a rookie, so cut him some slack.

184
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,031
He came all the way
to Korea to work, you know?

185
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,741
I know. Fine.

186
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,164
How are you holding up?

187
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,624
I was struggling

188
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,209
because the boat was swaying.

189
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,087
But now, even the ground is swaying.

190
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,757
We call it "land sickness."

191
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,182
Here.

192
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,850
It's peppermint tea.

193
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,768
I see.

194
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,814
I dried the leaves myself.
It'll help you with the nausea.

195
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,899
Thank you.

196
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,111
Good?

197
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,488
Right.

198
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,035
Stick these in your ears
before sailing out tomorrow.

199
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,745
They'll help prevent seasickness.

200
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,538
Thank you.

201
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,873
Give me the cup next time.

202
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,541
Also,

203
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,502
good work.

204
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,546
-You too.
-That's it!

205
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,924
Eat before you go!

206
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:07,841
Next time.

207
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,428
You better not drink in broad daylight,
or I'll tell your wife.

208
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,098
I won't, so enough with the nagging.

209
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,724
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

210
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,851
Hurry up, man.

211
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,936
Let's go.

212
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,649
-You're here early.
-Yes.

213
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,859
-Are the goods coming today?
-They already did.

214
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,778
-I see.
-Hey.

215
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,947
-Hello. How's business?
-Good. Try some.

216
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,657
-Should I?
-Sure.

217
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,034
-Isn't it savory?
-It is.

218
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,869
-Hope you sell lots today.
-Thanks.

219
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,204
Are you getting hot water?

220
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,707
Of course. You fixed it after all.

221
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,250
-Have some.
-Gosh.

222
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,752
Thanks for the pot.

223
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,129
Right. Isn't it sturdy?

224
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,630
-It is.
-Good.

225
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,175
Congratulations on the birth
of your grandchild.

226
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,220
Hey, Chief Hong.
Would you like to see a photo?

227
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,805
Sure. Let me see.

228
00:16:56,098 --> 00:17:00,978
The baby takes after your daughter.
Their mouth looks exactly like yours.

229
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,286
I think it's changed a bit.

230
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,660
Mom!

231
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,748
Hye-jin, be careful.
You'll hurt yourself if you run like that.

232
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,210
Okay, Mom!

233
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,530
Hye-jin.

234
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,534
Hey, you're good at this.

235
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,234
Yes?

236
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,112
Hi, Dad. It's me, Hye-jin.

237
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,906
I know. What is it? Is something wrong?

238
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,951
No, I just called to say hi.

239
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,372
It's unlike you. You never call
unless something's going on.

240
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,708
You're right.

241
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,003
-Is that Hye-jin?
-Yes.

242
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,132
Tell her I said hi.

243
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,218
Okay. Bye, then. Take care of yourself.

244
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,595
You too, Dad.

245
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,684
It doesn't hurt to be friendly.

246
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,020
You're always so cold
although you don't mean it.

247
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,238
No candy?

248
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,698
You're not a kid.

249
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,533
But it's so bitter.

250
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,046
Honey, what's the date today?

251
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,088
Today?

252
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,967
I think it's March 23.

253
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,878
Oh, no.

254
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,590
Oh, no!

255
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,124
Thank you.

256
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,965
But did you only find one of them?

257
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,260
I'm truly thankful,

258
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,263
but have you seen the other shoe?

259
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,683
I wore them for the first time today.

260
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,892
They were expensive.

261
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,771
Since you've already found this,

262
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,149
could you help me find the other one?

263
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,359
I guess there have always
been people like you.

264
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,944
Sorry?

265
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,739
If not, our ancestors
wouldn't have come up with the saying.

266
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,909
"Save a person from drowning,
and they'll ask for your belongings."

267
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,245
Goodness. That's not what I meant.

268
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,874
It's just that I have a fear of water,

269
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,917
but you don't seem to.

270
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,337
So I just thought you might help me.

271
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,257
You must be mistaken.
I didn't retrieve your shoe.

272
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,718
Your shoe just floated onto my board.

273
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,555
This shiny object
suddenly appeared in front of me.

274
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,141
Do you know how startled I was?

275
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,186
It wasn't intentional, but I apologize.

276
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,565
I'm not the type to ask
for a favor shamelessly.

277
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,443
But as you can see, I'm barefoot.

278
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,530
And my car is parked far away.
So could you please…

279
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,575
It's healthy to walk barefoot. Move.

280
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,998
What should I do?

281
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,881
Hey!

282
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,969
Take them.

283
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,137
TOILET-USE

284
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,514
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

285
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,059
I'm good.

286
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,436
Then just walk barefoot.

287
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,612
TOILET-USE
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

288
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,270
Goodness.

289
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,897
Hey, kid. Did this just fall out?

290
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,317
Oh, dear.

291
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,903
I'm a dentist.

292
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,113
Can I take a look?

293
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,242
Goodness. It's okay.

294
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,120
You're okay. So stop crying
and let me take a look.

295
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,124
Did it fall out on its own?

296
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,002
No.

297
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,837
That's not what happened.

298
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,340
Oh, no.

299
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,511
I hit him with my shoe pouch!

300
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:36,266
Then why are you crying
when he's the one who got hit?

301
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,853
I'm sorry.
You're very mature for your age.

302
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,104
Open your mouth.

303
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,441
Open wide.

304
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,235
It's your baby tooth.

305
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,865
Is there a dental clinic nearby?

306
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,825
It takes 30 minutes by car.

307
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:57,621
I see. Is your house nearby?

308
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,582
He just keeps complaining
without any reason.

309
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,085
That's why when you mentioned it,
that guy said, "Yes, sir."

310
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,338
I'd understand if it wasn't habitual.

311
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,839
Darn it!

312
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,257
Sorry.

313
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:10,926
Forget it.

HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

315
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,553
Oh, it's your wife.

316
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,263
-You…
-What do you mean?

317
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,224
We divorced three years ago.

318
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,059
I'm sorry. It's a force of habit.

319
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,727
Having lunch?

320
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,187
Yes, we are.

321
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,772
What are you having?

322
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,483
Rice soup. Over there.

323
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,527
-Right.
-Why don't you ever eat here?

324
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,865
Since you ate here free for ten years,
you don't want to pay for meals here?

325
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,825
No, it's not like that.

326
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,162
He can't have raw food. That's why.

327
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,122
-I can't?
-You don't eat raw food.

328
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,624
Right. I'm sorry.

329
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,501
I sell cooked food too.

330
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,462
Fish roe soup, pollack soup,
seaweed soup with sea urchin.

331
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,882
I see. We'll come next time then.

332
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,761
You better. Green onion seafood
pancake will be on the house.

333
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,346
Thanks.

334
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,516
Bye.

335
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,268
Mom!

336
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:05,146
-I-jun! Goodness, my son.
-Hi, I-jun.

337
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,773
What are you eating?

338
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,235
What? Is this blood?

339
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:14,114
What happened? Did you get hurt?

340
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,449
-It fell out.
-What did? Why?

341
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:20,245
Your tooth fell out.
You shouldn't have pulled it out yourself.

342
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,621
The hospital. Get the car.

343
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,665
-Okay.
-Calm down, will you?

344
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,459
What happened? Did it fall out on its own?

345
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,546
Who gave you that gauze?

346
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,429
Hello.

347
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,891
I went to the pharmacy
and got him the gauze.

348
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,727
You don't need to worry too much.

349
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,146
-Really, is that so?
-Yes.

350
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,649
By the way, who are you?

351
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,402
Why are you wearing our toilet slippers?

HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

353
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,867
Oh, my.

354
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:12,172
I wonder who took them
and gave them to you.

355
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,216
Well, it's a long story.

356
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,303
I promise to give them back next time.

357
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,847
It's okay. Wear them for the day
and throw them away.

358
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,892
Thank you. I should get going.

359
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,894
You can't leave like that.

360
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,147
Since you're here,
eat something. It's on the house.

361
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,273
That's okay.

362
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:34,152
You helped my son. I'd feel terrible
for not repaying your kindness.

363
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,196
Would you like some raw fish?

364
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,655
I'm really okay.

365
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,868
If you insist, could I have seaweed soup?

366
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,204
Here.

367
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,538
It looks good.

368
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,123
You can have more rice.

369
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,379
You're so skinny. Are you a size four?

370
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,048
I'm not skinny. I'm a size five.

371
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:58,760
Back in the day, I was as thin as a stick.

372
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,054
But then, I gave birth.

373
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,598
So these days, I only have this much rice

374
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,809
and lots of side dishes for dinner.

375
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,354
It'll get cold. Eat up.

376
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,189
Okay. Thank you for the meal.

377
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,654
It's good.

378
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,365
-It's all thanks to the oil I use.
-I see.

379
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,535
I used to run an oil store in the past.

380
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,079
Is this your first time in Gongjin?

381
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,331
This is my second…

382
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,542
Third time.

383
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,793
Visit us more often.

384
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,881
I'm not saying this because it's
my hometown. It's a really nice place.

385
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,634
Look at that beautiful sea.

386
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:44,639
Gongjin Harbor feels like
my late mother's embrace to me.

387
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,783
I love everything about Gongjin

388
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,828
except that there's no dental clinic.
That's the only downside.

389
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,831
I heard that it takes 30 minutes by car.

390
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,459
That's right. Had there been
a clinic here,

391
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,919
patients would be lining up.

392
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:19,632
I mean, there are a lot of old people
who need implants and dentures here.

393
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,595
-Is that so?
-Yes.

394
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,347
Let me know if you're ever interested.

395
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,974
I'll recommend a good area.

396
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,519
It's delicious.

397
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,520
Right?

398
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,997
Are you free from 3 p.m.
to 7 p.m. the day after tomorrow?

399
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,248
-Sure.
-Help me, Du-sik.

400
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,625
Four hours tomorrow night.

401
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,585
Can you come out again in two days?

402
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,131
Your goods are here.

403
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,469
CHUNG-HO HARDWARE

404
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:10,016
You're sleeping again.
At least, shut your eyes when you sleep.

405
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,351
My gosh.

406
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:12,936
Hey.

407
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,647
-Where is it?
-Over there.

408
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,440
-Where?
-Over there.

409
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,234
It's not here.

410
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,193
It's there.

411
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,862
-It's not here.
-It's here.

412
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,531
Here.

413
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,242
It's not funny.

414
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,874
Gosh, check this out.

415
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,168
Look at how shiny it is.

416
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,294
No wonder it's pricey.

417
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,714
You know it. I should charge you
150,000 won for that,

418
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,758
but I'll only ask for 120,000 won.

419
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,556
-Make it 90,000 won.
-It's from abroad.

420
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,015
What?

421
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,769
Then with the shipping fee,
I'll pay 92,500 won.

422
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,313
-This isn't normal delivery.
-I know you.

423
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,524
I know how much profit you make.

424
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,110
Let's see.

425
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,280
What are you doing?

426
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,948
-It's not opening.
-Hurry up.

427
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,909
-Open it already.
-It's not opening.

428
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,703
Come on. Stop joking around.

429
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:15,290
It's open. I'm going to ask
the grandma to fix this.

430
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,749
One, two,

431
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:21,921
-three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
-Three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

432
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,465
-nine.
-nine, ten.

433
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,758
Ninety thousand.

434
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,928
Two thousand… Can I give you coins?

435
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,555
-Give me bills.
-I only have big bills.

436
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,806
-Give me bills.
-Take coins.

437
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,391
-Give me bills.
-No small bills.

438
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,228
-Give me 10,000 won.
-Here's 2,500 won.

439
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,938
A 2,500-won bonus.

440
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,441
See you.

441
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,526
Damn it.

442
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,738
-What?
-What?

443
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,364
-What?
-Why are you back?

444
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,158
-I forgot this.
-Okay.

445
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,371
That's worth 20,000 won. Damn it.

446
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,626
Darn it.

447
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,590
Jeez, he gave me ten-won coins.

448
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,809
MONTHLY RENT
YEARLY RENT

449
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,521
It's definitely cheaper than Seoul.

450
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,692
I can afford to open my own clinic here.

451
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,695
MONTHLY RENT 10 MILLION DEPOSIT
YEARLY RENT 180 MILLION

452
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,741
Don't be ridiculous.
Opening a clinic in this countryside?

453
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,123
God, this is driving me crazy.

454
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,792
They were really expensive.

455
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,422
Let's just go home.

456
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,425
Let's go.

457
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,142
What?

458
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,603
Why won't it start?

459
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,858
Did the battery die?

460
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,238
Why now?

461
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,494
Insurance company…

462
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,412
Is this it?

463
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,206
Why now of all times?

464
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,337
Are you serious?

465
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,848
I know I'm in the boondocks,

466
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,183
but how could I not get a phone signal?

467
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,269
Or is it broken?

468
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,773
No. It worked just fine a while ago.

469
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,653
I'll use the phone at the restaurant.

470
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,449
My stomach…

471
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,535
Did I eat too much for lunch?

472
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,789
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

473
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,000
Is that a cafe? Gosh.

474
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,549
-Welcome.
-One cup of Americano, please.

475
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,302
-Sure.
-Where's the restroom?

476
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,806
Do you want hot or iced…

477
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,436
Iced coffee all the way.

478
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,689
She must've been in a hurry.

479
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,570
All right, then.

480
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,829
Much better.

481
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,882
"EXERCISING IN THE MOONLIGHT"

482
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,553
Do you feel better?

483
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,933
You must recognize him.

484
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,143
I don't.

485
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,647
Then why were you staring at it?

486
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,775
It just caught my eye.

487
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,863
You may not know his name but his song,
"Exercising in the Moonlight."

488
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,325
He came second on Top Ten Songs in 1993.

489
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:23,246
Exercising in the moonlight
Because I can't sleep

490
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,539
I don't recognize it.

491
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,500
-Enjoy your coffee.
-Thank you.

492
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:30,962
What was that?

493
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,302
It tastes horrible.

494
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,315
Seriously.

495
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:55,820
An autograph?

496
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,157
I'm sorry, but may I use your phone?

497
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,701
Go ahead.

498
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,035
Thank you.

499
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,166
This is the song I was talking about.

500
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,335
I'm sure you've heard of it.

501
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,421
Doesn't the melody sound familiar?

502
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,341
-This is the chorus.
-I'm sorry, but it's not working.

503
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,010
Why wouldn't it?

504
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,931
What? That's strange.

505
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,726
What's wrong with this?

506
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,936
Use my cell phone.

507
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,146
Thank you.

508
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,690
That's strange.

509
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,736
This isn't working either.

510
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,698
Why is neither of them working?

511
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,241
I'd like to pay.

512
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,409
Okay.

513
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,329
You didn't touch the coffee.

514
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,372
What a waste. You should finish it.

515
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,082
It's okay. I just want to pay.

516
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,959
Right. Take it to go.

517
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,379
No, it's okay. I'd just like to pay.

518
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,131
I can be quick.

519
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,511
Okay. All right.

520
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,513
What's wrong?

521
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,514
CHECKING…

522
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,059
It's not working.

523
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,977
Is the card the problem?

524
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,395
My card?

525
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,524
I'm so pissed. Why isn't my phone working?

526
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:19,904
Pissed? Ju-ri, didn't I tell you
not to use such words?

527
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,700
I think there's a problem
with the card reader.

528
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,660
Do you have cash?

529
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,453
-Cash?
-Yes.

530
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,621
I have none.

531
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,998
Not even 4,000 won? It's just 4,000 won.

532
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,168
You see, I don't carry cash.

533
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,587
Still, how could you
not even have 4,000 won?

534
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,923
Well… I'm sorry.

535
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,093
If there's a bank nearby,
I'll go withdraw some cash right now.

536
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,679
But how can I trust you?

537
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,223
What if you never come back?

538
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,476
-I'll leave my bag here.
-Okay.

539
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,435
Dad.

540
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,729
-What?
-Don't accept that. It's fake.

541
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,107
-It'd still cost more than 4,000 won.
-Hey,

542
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,566
this is genuine.

543
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,068
Stop lying.

544
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,071
What kind of person
carries a pricey bag and wears those?

545
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,948
-Wear what?
-Look at those.

546
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,326
Let me see. "Hwajeong"?

547
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,078
I have my reasons…

548
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,293
I'll leave my phone here. Okay?

549
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,335
Your phone?

550
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,253
Let me see.

551
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,423
It's the latest model.

552
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,301
-Look. It's the latest model.
-What?

553
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,635
You can go.

554
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,475
Gosh. How aggravating.

555
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,645
How dare that little brat
call my bag fake?

556
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,816
She has no idea how much I value brands.

557
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,491
EAST SEA BANK

558
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,746
What?

559
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,540
DURI BANK GONGJIN BRANCH

560
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,252
What?

561
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:03,257
Excuse me. Why isn't the ATM working?

562
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,261
I'm sorry, ma'am. It suddenly broke down,
so we're looking into it.

563
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,180
We're not sure when it'll get fixed.

564
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,514
I see.

565
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,482
There are some issues
at the banks as well,

566
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,651
so I can neither withdraw
nor wire you any money.

567
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,615
I'm sorry, but could I wire it
to you back in Seoul?

568
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,160
I'd never bilk money,
only 4,000 won at that.

569
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,078
No.

570
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,206
It's not like we can tell.

571
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,207
Look.

572
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,085
This is my business card.

573
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,420
My phone number is written there too.

574
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,339
DOCTOR YOON HYE-JIN

575
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,508
Are you a dentist?

576
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,301
Yes.

577
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,678
Who knows? This could be fake too.

578
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,639
-Hey.
-Dad…

579
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,808
That's real, and so is my bag.

580
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,434
-Watch what you say.
-Is she crazy?

581
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,685
-Dad…
-Are you okay?

582
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,605
Hey.

583
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,358
You ended up wearing them.

584
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,860
Do you know her?

585
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,030
I'm not sure how to answer that.

586
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,407
We do know each other.

587
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:11,784
We met once before.

588
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,412
What's up?

589
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:18,916
She's trying to leave
without paying for the coffee.

590
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,292
What? Come on.

591
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,712
That's not true. I ordered some coffee.

592
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,257
But everything is broken.
My credit card, phone,

593
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,092
-and the ATM.
-She's right.

594
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,845
All phones, internet,
and banks froze in Gongjin.

595
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,054
What?

596
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,806
There was a fire at Hanguk Telecom.

597
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,642
Are you serious? No way. Dad, look it up.

598
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,102
It doesn't work.

599
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,270
-Right.
-See?

600
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,563
It really doesn't work.

601
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,523
When will it be fixed?

602
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,443
Probably not anytime soon.
They haven't extinguished the fire.

603
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,069
Awesome. I should go watch.

604
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,488
Hey! You're going to pee
in your sleep tonight!

605
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,656
-Ju-ri!
-Whatever!

606
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,366
-It's dangerous!
-It's not.

607
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,993
-Darn it.
-Hey.

608
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,036
Can you spare me a minute?

609
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,706
Can I ask you something?

610
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,748
Me?

611
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,542
-Yes.
-Okay.

612
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,002
I…

613
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:08,007
I've never asked anyone
something like this before,

614
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,927
so I'm not sure how to bring it up.

615
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,054
Could you lend me 4,000 won?

616
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,394
I'm never this shameless. But…

617
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,439
Things aren't really going my way today.

618
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:29,069
I know I may seem
like a nuisance to you. I understand that.

619
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:34,241
But I'm in an urgent situation right now.

620
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,579
So could you please be kind
and help me out?

621
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,874
You want me to be kind.
So you're not this type of person?

622
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:46,670
Exactly. Normally, I refuse
to be indebted to anyone.

623
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:51,175
Let me get this straight.
So if the circumstances allowed,

624
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,052
you could get out of this on your own?

625
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,762
Exactly.

626
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,804
Then follow me.

627
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,848
What?

628
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,559
The 4,000 won.

629
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,187
I'll help you earn it instead.

630
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,944
Look. I'm following you as you said,

631
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,404
but how will I earn it?

632
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,406
Through valuable hard work, of course.

633
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,495
You're not taking me
somewhere shady, are you?

634
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,789
Eun-cheol!

635
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,124
Du-sik, did you hear about the fire?

636
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,417
Yes, just a while ago.

637
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,628
I've been patrolling, and it's chaotic.

638
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,755
Patrol around the shops.

639
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,715
They'll have to call it a day.

640
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,468
Tell them they'll be compensated
once the fire is put out.

641
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,803
Okay. Where are you going?

642
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,930
I'll take a look around up there.

643
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,723
-Okay. I'll call you later.
-Bye.

644
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,146
What? Shady?

645
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,398
Well…

646
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,526
It seems like
you're close with the police.

647
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,069
As you just saw.

648
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,530
Let's stop by somewhere first.

649
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,447
Where?

650
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,702
Gosh, why does he never
answer my questions?

651
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,879
You must've been startled.

652
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:11,964
There's been a fire.

653
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,717
Be patient,
and they'll get it all sorted out.

654
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,302
I'm off now.

655
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:17,970
Bye.

656
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,476
The firefighters are putting out the fire,

657
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,854
so stay home for today.

658
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,772
I said I'd fix it tomorrow.

659
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,065
You're so hardworking.

660
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,236
Grandma, let me do it for you.

661
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,655
Where are you going?

662
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,073
I'm visiting the grandmas.

663
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,491
Don't you worry.

664
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,953
The fire broke out underground,
so no one has been injured.

665
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,872
Your radio is working fine, right?

666
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,463
Why is it taking so long
to go to earn money?

667
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,923
I could've just waited at the cafe.

668
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,677
I'm sure you'd prefer this
to being monitored by those two.

669
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:14,526
There's a fire at the telecom company,
so the phones don't work now.

670
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:20,949
They're fixing it right now,
so don't worry too much. Okay?

671
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,536
What?

672
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,414
Do you want me to sit here? Here?

673
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,751
Where are you going?

674
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,836
Where?

675
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:34,630
Jeez.

676
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,009
Gosh.

677
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:44,390
Are these for me? Right?

678
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,894
You want me to share with her? Thanks.

679
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,734
Thank you.

680
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,070
Thanks for this.

681
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,490
Sit down.

682
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,118
See you.

683
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,030
What do you do for a living?

684
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,578
I heard people here addressing you
as Chief Hong.

685
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,621
Why would an outsider want to know that?

686
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,874
We're here. Over there.

687
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,263
Here.

688
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:12,060
Are you telling me
to remove innards from squid?

689
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,061
Yes.

690
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,440
You can't be serious.

691
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,067
I've never done this in my life.

692
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,278
I've never even touched a squid before.

693
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,031
Then today's your lucky day. Here.

694
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,408
Don't you need money?

695
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,579
How much is the pay?

696
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,122
It's 8,720 won per hour.

697
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:36,752
It's 8,720 won per hour?
Isn't that minimum wage?

698
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,795
Do you know who I am?

699
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,255
Yes. A penniless woman.

700
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,174
I don't think you know,

701
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,384
but I'm a dentist.

702
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,514
I'm a bit embarrassed to say this myself,

703
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,933
-but I'm a top-level elite.
-Grandma!

704
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,476
She's here to work.

705
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,478
-What are you doing?
-I'm a bit busy. Bye.

706
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,689
-Hey.
-I'll be back later. Good luck!

707
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,982
-What?
-Who?

708
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,279
Hello.

709
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,372
Let me teach you.

710
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,333
Slice it through the middle.

711
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,545
Spread it open here.

712
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,256
Then pull out the innards.

713
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:23,757
Give it a try.

714
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,343
Slice it through the middle.

715
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,140
Why doesn't it work?

716
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:37,312
By the looks of it,
she's not from around here.

717
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:41,608
Do you know why we're doing this?

718
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,568
No.

719
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,779
-What?
-Hey, explain it to her.

720
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,408
After we clean the squid here,

721
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,410
it is taken somewhere to be dried.

722
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:55,163
Then it becomes dried squid
that people enjoy.

723
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,540
I see.

724
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,334
How do you know Chief Hong?

725
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:00,919
Well…

726
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:05,632
You were with him until a while ago.

727
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,843
We met for the first time today.

728
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,011
-What?
-What?

729
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,679
What?

730
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:17,561
You should remove all the innards.

731
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,062
Don't leave any of them out.

732
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:19,980
Okay.

733
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,941
Goodness!

734
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,986
You should be careful with the squid ink.

735
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:31,992
Goodness. What should we do with you?

736
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,370
Kids these days are like that.

737
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,956
They've never done
this kind of job before,

738
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,626
so they have no idea how to do it.

739
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,670
You're not very dexterous, are you?

740
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,839
You can't make a living
out of those hands.

741
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,884
No one has ever said
that I wasn't dexterous.

742
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,812
Look. Didn't I do a good job this time?

743
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,231
What? Where are the legs?

744
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,358
The legs?

745
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,861
Goodness.

746
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,282
Oh, dear.

747
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,093
How could you leave me like that?

748
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,553
I brought your wage.
I guess you don't need it.

749
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,681
No. Give it to me.

750
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,518
You worked for three hours.

751
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:43,021
So 8,720 times 3 is 26,000…

752
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,356
What?

753
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,109
-Is this it?
-Of course not.

754
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,737
Here's the rest, 160 won.

755
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,701
What's with that look?

756
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,954
You barely did your job properly.

757
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,622
You don't deserve that money.

758
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,711
How does it feel to get
hard-earned money? Valuable, right?

759
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,797
I've always been a hard worker.

760
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,966
It's not easy being a dentist.

761
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:16,430
Please give this to the cafe owner.

762
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,267
Okay. Bye.

763
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,564
Right, an auto repair shop. Excuse me.

764
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,568
Why are you smiling?

765
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,904
Do you have a car?

766
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,030
"Cha"?

767
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,658
Yes.

768
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,204
-Tea.
-No, not that "cha."

769
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,791
Well…

770
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,170
What is that?

771
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,131
A car. Honk, honk.

772
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,342
All right.

773
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,847
I didn't mean to ask for your help
time after time. Thank you so much.

774
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,266
-Start your car.
-Sorry?

775
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,976
-Try the ignition.
-Right.

776
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,610
It's working. It started.

777
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,403
-Move aside.
-What?

778
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,534
What is it?

779
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,371
Look.

780
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,415
Do you see that?

781
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,711
What's this?

782
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,464
When did this happen?

783
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,175
Did you drive all the way here

784
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,385
with the tire-pressure warning lights on?

785
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,265
Well, I was able
to drive all the way here.

786
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,810
Don't you think
I'll be able to go back as well?

787
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,520
Do you have nine lives?

788
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,231
Get this fixed
at the repair shop in the morning.

789
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:52,400
You're telling me to spend a night here?
Looking like this?

790
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,201
There's a sauna across the harbor.

791
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,245
It's 9,000 won for a night.

792
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,372
Go there if you're interested.

793
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,916
You do reek.

794
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,887
I feel much better.

795
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,432
SNACK BAR

796
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,351
Bibimbap looks good.

797
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,521
Rice cake dumpling soup
and naengmyeon sound good too.

798
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,821
I have 13,160 won left.

799
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:41,241
I should put aside 10,000 won
just in case.

800
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:46,496
Then the amount
I can spend here is only 3,160 won.

801
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,420
I want eggs and sweet rice punch too.

802
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:57,632
What should I have?
Eggs? Sweet rice punch?

803
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,634
Eggs? Sweet rice punch?

804
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,387
What am I doing right now?

805
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,516
One sweet rice punch, please.

806
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,767
You really came.

807
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,439
What? Why are you here?

808
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,190
Can't you see? I'm working.

809
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,276
Sweet rice punch?

810
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,193
Yes.

811
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,910
This is really annoying.

812
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,871
I'm thankful for your help,

813
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,247
but why are you talking casually to me?

814
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,249
Okay what?

815
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,169
I was about to tell you
to talk casually as well.

816
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,253
It's fine by me.

817
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,924
And talking casually has its own perks.

818
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:42,260
I hate being so formal
only to make things get awkward.

819
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:45,138
Being global is a trend nowadays.
Look at the foreigners.

820
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:48,183
They call their parents-in-law
by their first names.

821
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,184
It's much better.

822
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,603
That's just ridiculous.

823
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,229
Need anything else?

824
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,232
I'm not that hungry.

825
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,530
Your stomach is saying otherwise.

826
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,240
I'm on a diet.

827
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,954
Who ordered these eggs?

828
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,957
A fire broke out
at Hanguk Telecom in Chung-ho,

829
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,292
and the entire Gongjin area
has been frozen.

830
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,920
-It's even on the news.
-There have been issues…

831
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:20,465
-That's understandable.
-Even the financial services were halted.

832
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:24,928
Who knew a fire at a telecom company
would leave me stranded here, penniless?

833
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,973
-It was put out around 7:30 p.m.
-I miss Seoul.

834
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:32,060
The Chung-ho mayor promised
to fix this matter as soon as possible,

835
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:35,063
look into the cause of the fire
to prevent similar incidents…

836
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,446
It's just a cricket.

837
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,582
Chief Hong! Goodness!

838
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,418
-What brings you here, Ms. Park?
-Hey!

839
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,544
Are you here for me?

840
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,338
I should go to Seoul
and move in with my daughter.

841
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,007
I can't live here anymore.

842
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,259
What is it this time?

843
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:08,138
I'm 70, but I have to run errands
since I'm the youngest around here.

844
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:11,933
Go to Gam-ri's place! She's hurt!

845
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,768
Hurry up!

846
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,770
-Grandma!
-What?

847
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,149
Grandma. Gosh.

848
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:22,027
You were fine just earlier.
What on earth happened?

849
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:26,781
I'm going deaf because
you yell at me all the time like that.

850
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,199
Where are you hurt?

851
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,452
Here. She hurt her ankle.

852
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,787
-Your ankle? Let me see.
-Yes.

853
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:36,041
Gosh, it's swollen. Does it hurt to move?

854
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:40,754
It's not a big deal.
I just sprained it a bit.

855
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,632
You're unbelievable.
Why would you hang your laundry there?

856
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:48,094
Are you a cat? Why would you
climb over the wall at night?

857
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,804
-Gosh.
-That's enough.

858
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:50,889
The wall?

859
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:53,933
Get on. Let's go to the hospital.

860
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,355
You should get an X-ray.

861
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,399
I don't need that.

862
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,276
I didn't break any bones.

863
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,697
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

864
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,616
I agree.

865
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,744
I hope you become filthy rich
being stingy like that.

866
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,913
I don't get why you're so stingy.

867
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:18,291
-Gosh, I'm so frustrated.
-Aren't you going home?

868
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,044
-I am. I am now.
-Go.

869
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,423
-Good night.
-Gosh.

870
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,885
Let me see.

871
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,268
Must you use an ice pack?

872
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:41,356
You should ice a sprain
right away to ease swelling.

873
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,775
-What's wrong? Is it too cold?
-No.

874
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,277
It's just slightly chilly.

875
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:50,698
Are you feeling cold, my dear Gam-ri?
Do you want me to hug you?

876
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:56,704
A grown man like you
shouldn't make such jokes.

877
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,749
Stay in the room for tonight.

878
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:03,378
I brought a chamber pot here,
so don't go out to the bathroom.

879
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,922
But I need to go to the senior center.

880
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,341
Don't be absurd. You're hurt.

881
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,135
I'll be bored here by myself.

882
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,928
I should go watch a soap opera.

883
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,139
-You have a TV.
-By myself? That's no fun.

884
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,724
-Then watch with me.
-Forget it.

885
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,227
You don't even know the plot.

886
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:23,022
-Gosh.
-They're all the same.

887
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:27,902
Am I heavy?

888
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,696
Yes.

889
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,616
They say as you get old,
you become lighter.

890
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,536
But seeing how heavy you are,
you must be still young.

891
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:41,040
You're going to be punished
for teasing an oldie like me.

892
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:47,046
Anyway, I feel bad for having you here.
You're not even getting paid.

893
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,216
You're right. I was going
to go home and rest.

894
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:54,262
You shouldn't have come.

895
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,848
I'm returning the favor.

896
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:01,561
Ever since my grandpa
passed away, you've fed me

897
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,480
at least 999 meals.

898
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,648
What choice did I have?

899
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,152
I couldn't let
a kid left all alone starve.

900
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,320
Still.

901
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:12,572
I'm grateful.

902
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,034
So even after I clock out,

903
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,786
I'll always run over if you need me.

904
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,705
Always?

905
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,875
Then you're like the genie to me?

906
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:27,253
Yes, I am. I'm like a wish-granting genie

907
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:31,257
that you can summon
by rubbing the magic lamp.

908
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,594
Is that even possible?

909
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,222
Yes, it is.

910
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,059
I must be so heavy.

911
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:44,312
No, you're as light as a feather.

912
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,396
Gosh.

913
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,233
Oh, dear.

914
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,109
All right.

915
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,278
-Goodness.
-Heave.

916
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:56,241
I can't believe I sprained my ankle.

917
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,535
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

918
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,453
Don't be sick.

919
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,122
It's really nothing.

920
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,960
-Still.
-It's only a mild sprain. Stop nagging.

921
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,306
Do they not clean?
I can't believe there's a bug indoors.

922
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,818
Well, there are many stars.

923
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,748
Mom.

924
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,710
Happy birthday.

925
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:59,197
All right. The auction will begin.
Get in line.

926
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,240
Single file.

927
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,285
We have two monkfish.

928
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:08,247
They're so fresh. They're so plump.

929
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:13,294
I see 64,000 won. I see 65,000 won.

930
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:16,506
Number 351 bid 65,000 won.

931
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,217
Okay. Sold!

932
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,927
You've got it for cheap!

933
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,514
We have two monkfish.

934
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,948
You're an auctioneer?

935
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,491
You must've slept well.

936
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:46,160
You were working at the sauna last night.

937
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,912
But today, you're working here?

938
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,081
You're a fraud, aren't you?

939
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,792
There's sleep in your eyes.
Did you even wash up?

940
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:57,630
By the way,
is there an auto repair shop nearby?

941
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,965
Of course.

942
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,049
Where?

943
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,553
I have to return
to Seoul today at all costs.

944
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,555
Is it expensive to fix a tire?

945
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,807
Will it cost more than 10,000 won?

946
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:08,850
Hey.

947
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,727
I'll wash up and go.

948
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,938
Okay. Take your time.

949
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,692
Is it expensive or not?

950
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:21,195
-You're the slow type, aren't you?
-What do you mean?

951
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,781
You're more dull-witted than I thought.

952
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:28,077
You don't have to tell me where it is,
but don't pick a fight with me.

953
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,537
How ridiculous.

954
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,581
Hold on.

955
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:40,757
-Hello?
-Hello, is this Dr. Yoon Hye-jin?

956
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,049
This is she. Who is this?

957
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,262
I'm your next-door neighbor.

958
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:51,434
You introduced me
to Hyeongsol Dental Clinic.

959
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:53,019
My, it works now.

960
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:54,645
Sorry?

961
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,439
Yes, I'm listening.

962
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,608
How was the treatment?

963
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,027
It was great, thanks to you.

964
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:05,448
I wanted to thank you in person,
but I haven't seen you around lately.

965
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,658
I see. I've been a bit busy.

966
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,369
I see.

967
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,623
I heard that
you and the new dentist are friends,

968
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:17,418
so I asked her for your number.

969
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:21,214
I see. May I ask why you called me?

970
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,383
Dr. Yoon, thank you so much.

971
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:31,265
My daughter paid for it
with her hard-earned money.

972
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:35,019
As her mother,
I felt terrible about making her pay.

973
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:38,189
But you made sure
they wouldn't rip me off.

974
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:39,440
I'm truly thankful.

975
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:45,071
I'm sorry for calling
when you must be so busy.

976
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,115
I just wanted to express my gratitude.

977
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,534
Thank you, Dr. Yoon.

978
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,453
It's my pleasure.

979
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,540
Good luck with the treatment.

980
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:59,085
Okay. Thank you so much. Goodbye.

981
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,628
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

982
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:06,717
What a kind-hearted woman.

983
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,515
Right, I should call the helpline.

984
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,818
Hye-jin, why is your phone off?

985
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:27,154
You're not taking drastic measures
because you can't find a job, right?

986
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:30,116
If I can't reach you by tomorrow,
I'm going to call the police.

987
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,994
Gosh, Mi-seon is terrifying
when she's worried.

988
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,290
I'm down south. Don't worry too much.

989
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,749
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am!

990
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,587
Hey, the kids from yesterday.

991
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,963
What was your names again?

992
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,257
I'm Chang I-jun.

993
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,885
I'm Choi Bo-ra. "Bo" as in boat,
and "ra" as in ramyeon.

994
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:50,428
Right.

995
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,973
Despite getting hit yesterday,
he still hangs out with you.

996
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,603
That's because I'm his only friend here.

997
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,938
That's not why.
I know she hit me by mistake.

998
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,149
How kind of you.

999
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,651
Can I take a look at your tooth?

1000
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,194
Sure.

1001
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:10,406
Open your mouth. It's healing well.

1002
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,284
If it feels loose again,
go to the dentist, okay?

1003
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,494
Okay.

1004
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,706
I will never ever forget
what you did for me yesterday.

1005
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:21,375
I will return the kindness no matter what.

1006
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,335
How old are you?

1007
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,961
We're both nine.

1008
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,464
But you know such difficult expressions?

1009
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:30,551
He knows over 100 expressions.
He even does calligraphy.

1010
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:34,221
You don't need to repay me.

1011
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,599
Just promise me you'll be healthy. Okay?

1012
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:38,351
Yes, ma'am.

1013
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,186
-You too.
-Okay.

1014
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,854
Go on, then.

1015
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:45,775
Ma'am.

1016
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:46,817
Yes?

1017
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,612
Thank you so much.

1018
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,656
I hope you visit us again.

1019
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,743
What? Okay.

1020
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:57,912
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1021
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:58,996
Let's go.

1022
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,252
How cute.

1023
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,796
All done.

1024
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:08,381
Oh, really?

1025
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:12,802
Thank you.

1026
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,477
-Du-sik.
-Hey.

1027
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,479
Thanks for opening the shop for me.

1028
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:26,190
Don't mention it.
I put the 4,000 won over there.

1029
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:27,650
-Four thousand won?
-Yes.

1030
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,610
What's this for?

1031
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,029
It's from that woman
who couldn't pay you yesterday.

1032
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,740
Ju-ri said both her bag

1033
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,535
and business card were fake.
I guess she's not a scammer.

1034
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,078
No, she isn't.

1035
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,204
How do you know?

1036
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:43,207
Well… I just know.

1037
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,292
You're smiling. Why?

1038
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,046
I'm always smiling.

1039
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:51,757
You're blushing.

1040
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,551
Coffee?

1041
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:13,904
Hello?

1042
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:15,573
It's me.

1043
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,616
Who is this?

1044
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,201
You must've deleted my number.

1045
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,537
Still, have you already
forgotten my voice?

1046
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:24,665
Dr. Lee?

1047
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,543
That's right. Have you been well?

1048
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,628
I heard you're working hard to land a job.

1049
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,922
Speak for yourself.

1050
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:35,885
I heard you worked hard to spread rumors
about me, so no one would hire me.

1051
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,262
Do you think that was me?

1052
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:41,432
Hye-jin, you're more naive than I thought.

1053
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,310
I didn't have to do anything.

1054
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:47,063
The dental community
is very small and closed.

1055
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:51,025
Who would want to hire a whistleblower
who badmouthed their chief doctor

1056
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:52,777
while brazenly disclosing her name?

1057
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,613
No one will hire you.

1058
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,741
In that sense, let me make you an offer.

1059
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:02,953
Kneel in front of me
and beg for my forgiveness.

1060
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:06,832
Then I'll have pity on you
and take you back.

1061
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,209
Kneel?

1062
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:12,546
Don't be absurd. Why would I work
for a quack like you again?

1063
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,758
What, a quack?
I don't think you understand--

1064
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:19,220
Forget it. Do you think
I must be hired at some clinic?

1065
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:20,596
I'll open my own.

1066
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,515
I'll run my own clinic!

1067
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:26,310
What a lunatic.

1068
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:40,324
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

1069
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,913
Ma'am.

1070
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,376
Hello. You're still here?

1071
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:53,129
You told me to come
if I was ever interested.

1072
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,213
Sorry?

1073
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,257
I'm going to open a clinic here.

1074
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,883
What? Seriously?

1075
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,886
Yes. I've made up my mind.

1076
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,847
I'm glad to hear that.

1077
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,015
Hold on. Let me see.

1078
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,143
Let's go to the realtor.

1079
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,854
No, this would be faster.

1080
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:14,984
Follow me.

1081
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,498
-So you slept at a sauna?
-Yes.

1082
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,625
You should've come to my house.

1083
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:34,295
Thank you for offering.

1084
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:41,635
By the way, does the realtor
live this high up?

1085
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:44,180
We're not meeting a realtor right now.

1086
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,310
Why is this loser calling me? Hold on.

1087
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:50,728
VILLAGE CHIEF CHANG YEONG-GUK

1088
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,105
Hello? What is it?

1089
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:57,943
What? You want to change
the date for the elderly party?

1090
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,528
Of course, you can't!

1091
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,948
We even did a survey
to decide on the date.

1092
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:07,077
I don't want to hear it.
I'll be right there, so just wait.

1093
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:12,124
Look. I'm sorry, but there's an emergency.

1094
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,710
Then what should I do?

1095
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:18,923
Go straight up this path,
and you'll see a boat on top.

1096
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,424
Go there.

1097
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:23,052
I already called him,
so he'll recognize you.

1098
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,804
-Call whom?
-I'm sorry.

1099
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,140
I need to go give him a good beating.

1100
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,352
-You should give me his number at least.
-Go.

1101
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:48,994
I'm so tired.

1102
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:50,955
Gosh.

1103
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,249
There really is a boat.

1104
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:56,001
Who put this here on top of a hill?

1105
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,672
It must be him.

1106
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,174
Excuse…

1107
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:06,011
Hey, we meet again.

1108
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,016
What? Why are you here?

1109
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,476
A clinic and a house?

1110
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:15,854
Were you the one she was talking about?

1111
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,524
Yes. For your information,
I'm not a fraud.

1112
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,654
REAL ESTATE AGENT
HONG DU-SIK

1113
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:26,949
What do you really do?

1114
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,453
What on earth is your deal?

1115
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,746
Me?

1116
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:34,623
I'm Chief Hong.

1117
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,201
Sit down here.

1118
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:53,827
PHARMACY

1119
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,747
Okay. Open your mouth.

1120
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:57,998
Open.

1121
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:00,876
Goodness. It's bleeding.

1122
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,347
What?

1123
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,224
Look.

1124
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:18,102
-What?
-Didn't I do well?

1125
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:10,362
Am I the only one
who finds this suspicious?

1126
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,615
I'm on government payroll, you see.

1127
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,409
Chief Hong is a regular chief.

1128
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:17,161
Don't you need renovating?

1129
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,745
I do that for minimum wage too.

1130
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:22,749
You're not scamming me
because I'm not from around here, right?

1131
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,043
Was she really a dentist?

1132
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,295
She's pretty.

1133
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:28,380
Please stop by even though you're busy.

1134
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,674
And promote the opening of your clinic.

1135
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:34,678
In a yard where dirt is kicked up,
they grill meat, boil soup, and sing.

1136
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,639
You think you're better than everyone.

1137
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,601
Look here, Doctor.

1138
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:42,519
Life isn't so fair for all of us.

1139
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:44,271
Got that?

1140
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:50,319
