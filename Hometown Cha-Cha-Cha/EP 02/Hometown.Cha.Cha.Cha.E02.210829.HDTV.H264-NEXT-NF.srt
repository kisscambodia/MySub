DIVORCE BY MUTUAL CONSENT
CHANG YEONG-GUK, YEO HWA-JEONG

3
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:40,971
<i>We all have moments we regret in life.</i>

DEMO OF <i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>,
OH YOON'S 2ND ALBUM

<i>Nevertheless,</i>

6
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:10,519
<i>we can never turn back the clock.</i>

CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:24,116
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

10
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,826
EPISODE 2

11
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,796
Look. Sweet, isn't it?

12
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:40,340
Open your clinic here

13
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:43,343
and your patients will heal
just by looking out the window.

14
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:44,678
The view sure is nice.

15
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:47,598
Nothing beats this
when it comes to good feng shui.

16
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,933
Mountain in the back
and water in the front.

17
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:53,353
I see the ocean, but where's the mountain?

18
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:56,899
Have you forgotten about the hill
that's behind the marketplace?

19
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:00,986
If you're done, let's go. I'm a busy man.

20
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,448
Hold your horses.
I have a long checklist to go through.

21
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:08,410
Good water pressure and sunlight
are essential.

22
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:12,706
Does this air conditioner work?

23
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,168
It doesn't.
I see you're the exhausting type.

24
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:17,878
No, I'm just thorough.

25
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,505
What's this?

26
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:22,132
The storage room.

27
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:27,971
Where will we check out next?
Is it far from here?

28
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:30,599
This is the only one.

29
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:33,602
You said we should get going.

30
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:36,605
Yes, to check out the house
for you to live in.

31
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:40,359
Then this is the only one
you have to show me?

32
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:41,443
Yes.

33
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:57,292
Two bedrooms and one…

34
00:03:58,085 --> 00:03:59,336
One bathroom.

35
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:02,172
An air-conditioner, gas stove, washer,

36
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:04,758
and even a dryer are provided.

37
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:08,595
Who uses this kind of wallpaper
these days?

38
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:13,350
Sweet, isn't it?
A tropical vibe with contrasting colors.

39
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:17,771
An eco-friendly atmosphere. Don't you
think it'll put you on a flowery path?

40
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:21,525
The interior design isn't my style at all.

41
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,361
What exactly is your style then?

42
00:04:25,737 --> 00:04:27,865
-As if that changes anything.
-Let's hear it.

43
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:32,828
Well… An overall vibe that incorporates
an antique, simple, and European style.

44
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:38,041
Wainscot paneling on the walls
and porcelain tiles on the floor.

45
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:43,172
Spanish tiles in the foyer
and light fixtures from Denmark would do.

46
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:46,675
I doubt you understood any of it.

47
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,844
How about some new wallpaper instead?

48
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:51,054
Off-white like teeth would be nice.

49
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:53,473
Let's sign the contract.

50
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:59,062
Hold on. What did you say
will be provided other than the washer?

51
00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:00,230
A dryer!

52
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:02,399
Are you saying you own

53
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:05,527
both the office building and apartment?

54
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:06,695
That's right.

55
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:09,698
Am I the only one
who finds this suspicious?

56
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:11,575
-What do you mean?
-Just think about it.

57
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:15,120
When she found out
I'd open a dental clinic here,

58
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:16,705
she introduced me to you,

59
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:19,374
and the office space
you showed me is hers.

60
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:21,585
How is this a coincidence?

61
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:27,049
You're not scamming me
because I'm not from around here, right?

62
00:05:28,175 --> 00:05:32,429
Doctor, I get how this
might seem suspicious to you,

63
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:35,390
but ask anyone in this town.

64
00:05:35,474 --> 00:05:37,976
Everyone knows who we are.

65
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,894
Exactly.

66
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:40,604
We could never scam anyone.

67
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:44,316
I'm on government payroll, you see.

68
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,861
How can you be when you
obviously own a restaurant?

69
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:50,656
I guess it's my turn this time.

70
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,453
YEO HWA-JEONG, ZONE CHIEF

71
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:57,704
Zone chief?

72
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:00,874
That's right. The government pays me
300,000 won a month.

73
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,542
And 20,000 won more for a meeting.

74
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:06,004
Chief Hong is a regular chief.
Only 50,000 a year.

75
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:09,466
Forget it. She still doesn't believe you,
so let's give her better proof.

76
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:12,177
See how much of a bargain you're getting.

77
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:15,555
GONGJIN, CHUNG-HO

78
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:18,350
The office space you just saw

79
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:21,311
is the unit she had saved
for her second restaurant.

80
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:24,648
But she offered it to you
because she thought

81
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:27,943
it'd benefit the whole town
if you opened a dental clinic.

82
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,487
Hey, stop that. That's not necessary.

83
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,448
She should know, though.
Forget it if you don't want it.

84
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,627
All right. Take a copy each.

85
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,505
Now that the contract has been signed,

86
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:52,009
you will fulfill your duties
as landlady and tenant.

87
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:53,635
Good job.

88
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,887
-How many hours did you work today?
-Four.

89
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:00,934
So, for four hours…

90
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:03,061
Here.

91
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:07,357
I got that number too. I'll wire
the money. Coins can be a nuisance.

92
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,734
Much appreciated.

93
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:13,322
It's fine. You don't have to see us out.

94
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:30,172
Why are you following me?

95
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:35,052
You sure are dense, aren't you?
Do I really have to tell you?

96
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:36,636
What do you mean?

97
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,556
You need to pay me.
17,440 won for my service.

98
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:41,808
Did you say 17,440 won?

99
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,021
Listen up. Whatever the task,
I go by minimum wage.

100
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:49,941
I'm sure you know. The minimum wage
in 2021 is 8,720 won per hour.

101
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:53,236
I worked 4 hours, which is 34,880 won.

102
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,865
And it should be evenly split
between you and Ms. Yeo.

103
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:02,412
I only have big notes.

104
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,289
I always have change ready.

105
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:06,500
All right.

106
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:08,877
Take 2,000 won first.

107
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,339
And here's 560 won.

108
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:15,634
Are we done now?

109
00:08:15,717 --> 00:08:19,262
Don't you need renovating?
I do that for minimum wage too.

110
00:08:19,346 --> 00:08:21,306
As if anyone could do it.

111
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,975
I mentioned my high standards earlier.

112
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:32,526
What are they?

113
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,865
Wallpaper and painting,
cement work, tiles, heating,

114
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:39,950
even plumbing?

115
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,034
CERTIFIED PLUMBER

116
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,953
I'll consider myself hired.

117
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:52,712
He's so weird.

118
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:56,216
Did you say Gongjin?

119
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:58,552
Where the heck is that?

120
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:01,805
Gongjin, Chung-ho City, Gangwon Province.

121
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:05,767
You're nuts. How are you going
to live in such hicksville?

122
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:08,478
I'm in the middle
of drawing a big picture.

123
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:12,774
Take a look. Awesome, right?

124
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:14,860
PRIVATE CLINIC DOCTORS
EARN MORE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE

125
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:18,447
So you're moving there just to earn money?

126
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:20,824
Well,

127
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,493
I can't find a job here,

128
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:25,954
and it's impossible
to open a clinic in Seoul.

129
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:30,000
This could fatten my bank account
in a short period of time.

130
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:34,212
You still shouldn't have signed the lease
without even telling me.

131
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:35,547
Sorry.

132
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:38,508
What can I do when it's already signed?

133
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:43,513
But why are you packing already?

134
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:47,684
You need to put this place on the market,
and I'm sure it'll take a while.

135
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,060
It's already sold.

136
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:52,189
Housing is in high demand these days.

137
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:53,940
When are you moving then?

138
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:57,777
-The day after tomorrow.
-Hey!

139
00:09:58,445 --> 00:10:01,740
-My gosh.
-Is someone pointing a gun at you?

140
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:03,241
What's with the rush?

141
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:05,702
It just happened that way.

142
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:07,078
Unbelievable.

143
00:10:08,246 --> 00:10:12,959
I'll be so bored here without you.

144
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:16,546
We've never been apart
since middle school.

145
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,839
I know.

146
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:24,513
Mi-seon.

147
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:27,516
Take this.

148
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,018
This…

149
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:33,021
It'll look good on you
since you're slender and all.

150
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:37,776
Forget it! Do you think
I care about this stupid dress right now?

151
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,277
Just don't go. Stay here!

152
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:43,156
Why are you being like that?
You're making it hard for me to leave.

153
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,035
Don't leave. Just don't go.

154
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:50,330
-Are you crying?
-I'm not.

155
00:10:56,878 --> 00:11:01,007
Come on. You're making me feel so bad.

156
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:10,934
Just so you know,
I hate this dress so much.

157
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:15,105
Give me that one instead. The nice one.

158
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:17,190
That one's too expensive.

159
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:19,651
-Cheapskate.
-Just try it on.

160
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:23,196
-Forget it.
-Darn it.

161
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:26,950
Just go. Go away to Gongjin.

162
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:59,190
-I'm good.
-You're doing great today.

163
00:11:59,274 --> 00:12:00,817
MR. YU EXPRESS

164
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:03,486
What's going on?

165
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,905
-What is it?
-Hey.

166
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:08,033
What's up? Is there a party somewhere?

167
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:09,576
Hey, Chun-jae.

168
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,163
It's not Chun-jae.
I told you to address me as Oh Yoon.

169
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:16,207
-Not according to your birth certificate.
-It's Oh Yoon, damn it.

170
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,168
Fine. Oh Yoon.

171
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,212
Someone's moving into Ms. Yeo's house.

172
00:12:21,296 --> 00:12:23,381
It's a young lady who's a dentist.

173
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,428
Wait. Was she really a dentist?

174
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,430
That girl's actually a dentist?

175
00:12:30,513 --> 00:12:31,389
Do you know her?

176
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:33,266
Not personally.

177
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,143
You can say there's a debt between us.

178
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:37,520
A debt? What's that about?

179
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:40,982
She didn't seem to be dexterous,
so I'm kind of worried.

180
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:43,693
Why are you all shyly watching from afar?

181
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:44,694
Hello, Ms. Yeo.

182
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:47,280
-I see you're here to play landlady.
-She's not looking.

183
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:50,116
-She always ignores me.
-That goes in the living room.

184
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,117
Doctor.

185
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,786
Hello.

186
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:55,663
You didn't have to come.

187
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:58,333
How can I not when you're moving in today?

188
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,710
I see you have a lot of stuff.

189
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:02,170
Yes.

190
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:06,883
They all live around here.

191
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:08,385
I see.

192
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:10,095
Remember me from the cafe?

193
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:13,348
They are your neighbors now,
so say hello as you come and go.

194
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:14,474
-Sure.
-Say hello.

195
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:15,850
Hello, everyone.

196
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:19,145
-Where does this go?
-Excuse me.

197
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:22,190
To the room… No, let me lead the way.

198
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,488
Is she actually moving here?

199
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:35,787
She's pretty.

200
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,872
She resembles me in some ways.

201
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:45,714
Hey, Dad.

202
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,133
Yes, the move went smoothly.

203
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:51,177
I'm still so busy unpacking.

204
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:54,013
You can visit once the clinic opens.

205
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:56,850
Sure, and take care of yourself.

206
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:58,893
Bye.

207
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:35,096
-Why are you here at this hour?
-To verify your registration.

208
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:42,854
Are you worried
that I might have falsified my move?

209
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:46,816
What do you think of the wallpaper?
I chose one of the best ones.

210
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,402
Well, I guess it's not bad.

211
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:52,489
-So, what is it?
-I have a few things to tell you.

212
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:55,658
Recyclables are collected
every Wednesday at 9:00 a.m.

213
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,535
-At the end of the alley--
-Hold on.

214
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,123
-Recyclables?
-Bring them to the end of the alley.

215
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:05,418
Boxes like these
should be taken out the day before.

216
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:06,586
Got it.

217
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:09,547
The combination
to the front door lock is 870724.

218
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:11,049
-So, 87…
-And 0724.

219
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,801
Okay, 0724.

220
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:15,053
You can change it to whatever you want.

221
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:16,221
What's this number?

222
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:17,639
My birthday.

223
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,892
Why is my lock combination your birthday?

224
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:24,103
Nothing came to mind,
so I used the combination to my door lock.

225
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:26,356
Why would you tell me that?

226
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,651
Whatever. I didn't hear it.
I already forgot.

227
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:30,819
I'll throw this away.

228
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:33,279
You need it if you want
to change the combination.

229
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:35,824
Really? You should've just said so.

230
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:41,955
-Are you 35, then?
-Yes.

231
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,208
You're a year older than me.

232
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:48,127
Was that a hint of affection I heard?

233
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:49,754
Don't you dare show me any.

234
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:54,175
Are you nuts? I just got goose bumps.

235
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:58,137
Same here. All right.
That's all I came to tell you.

236
00:15:58,221 --> 00:15:59,222
Any questions?

237
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:02,141
Go ahead.

238
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:05,603
Where can I get
a decent cup of coffee around here?

239
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:10,024
Taking a coffee to go is
how I start my workday.

240
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:12,026
There are a few near the harbor,

241
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,863
but that place is closest to your clinic.

242
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:16,114
Where's it?

243
00:16:16,197 --> 00:16:17,532
The 4,000-won place.

244
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:19,576
No way.

245
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,372
Let bygones be bygones.
They're your neighbors now.

246
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:26,749
That's not it.

247
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,086
It's just that the coffee there is awful.

248
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:32,463
Give it another try.

249
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:35,300
And the renovation will take a while.
I'll let you know.

250
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:38,386
Sure. How long will it take, though?

251
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:39,387
I'll call you.

252
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,180
It can't take too long.

253
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:45,018
He just left.

254
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:49,939
Recyclables, Wednesday.

255
00:16:50,648 --> 00:16:54,027
Lock combination, 8707…

256
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:13,296
You heard a new dental clinic
will open up, right?

257
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:15,214
Who hasn't heard?

258
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:17,800
I saw the dentist move in the other day,

259
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:21,346
and it's someone we all know!

260
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:25,808
It's the young lady
Chief Hong brought to the gutting deck.

261
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:27,143
-What?
-Are you sure?

262
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:29,646
Of course, I am!

263
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:32,607
So? What's so great about doctors?

264
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,234
My son is an accountant in Seoul.

265
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:39,530
Not that again.
Everyone in Gongjin knows now.

266
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:43,451
This is great, though. You've been
having trouble with your teeth,

267
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:45,119
so visit there once it opens.

268
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:48,122
You think I'll spend my money
for my damn teeth

269
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:51,125
when I don't have many days to live?

270
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:54,170
Tell me about it. That implant thingy

271
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:57,006
costs as much as a car.

272
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,761
Come on. You know
eating well is most important.

273
00:18:04,097 --> 00:18:06,766
Over there. There's that dentist.

274
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:08,309
-What?
-What?

275
00:18:09,394 --> 00:18:10,395
Goodness.

276
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:13,189
Is she…

277
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:18,111
Did I see that right?
She's only wearing her long johns, right?

278
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:21,197
Is that what you saw too?

279
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,617
For a second, I thought my mind
was playing tricks on me.

280
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:28,329
My goodness. What has the world come to?

281
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:31,499
All of her skin was showing over here.

282
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:33,042
How embarrassing.

283
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:44,679
MODERN PHOTO STUDIO

284
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:54,313
I know a mischievous face when I see one.

285
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:28,514
Are the renovations over or not?

286
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,131
He did a good job.

287
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:06,844
It sure is nice.

288
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:21,484
-Chief Hong!
-What?

289
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:23,820
There he is.

290
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:25,571
Hey.

291
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,086
The <i>gamju</i> is sweet and refreshing.
Who made it?

292
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:42,046
Isn't it obvious? Du-sik, of course.

293
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,048
You know how to make it?

294
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:46,551
As if there's anything he can't do.

295
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:49,470
Apart from finding a wife, I mean.

296
00:20:49,554 --> 00:20:50,763
You're absolutely right.

297
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:53,683
How did the conversation
turn that way all of a sudden?

298
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:56,394
Chief Hong,

299
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,480
why is this suit out here?

300
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:01,274
I'm throwing it out.

301
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:04,110
Why throw away something perfectly fine?

302
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:05,486
It looks expensive.

303
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:08,865
Maybe I should give it to my son-in-law.

304
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:14,245
Unbelievable. How can you give
your son-in-law a hand-me-down?

305
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:18,583
Hurry with the soap, will you?
I'm a very busy woman.

306
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,917
Okay. How many do you need?

307
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:21,961
-I'll take two.
-Two it is.

308
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:23,504
-Four for me.
-Noted.

309
00:21:23,588 --> 00:21:25,381
-I'll take ten.
-Ten?

310
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:28,092
Ms. Mat-i, you're a big spender!

311
00:21:28,176 --> 00:21:30,261
Nothing beats it
when it comes to rubbing off

312
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:32,054
the stench of squid and fish.

313
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:34,724
-Right.
-It's the absolute best.

314
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:37,185
Is that so? I appreciate
you saying that, ma'am.

315
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:40,104
I'll continue to sell it
at 500 won a piece.

316
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:42,273
That reminds me.

317
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:45,026
The young lady
you brought to the gutting deck

318
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:47,111
-is a dentist, correct?
-Yes.

319
00:21:47,194 --> 00:21:50,489
My gosh. You won't believe what we saw.

320
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:53,618
-How can she be that way?
-Why? Did something happen?

321
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:57,997
A while ago, we saw her running
along the walking trail.

322
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,750
Her outfit couldn't be more raunchy.

323
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,837
Her top barely covered her
while her pants clung to her body.

324
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:08,549
I could see her sheer bottom
which had me looking away!

325
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:12,887
How can one run around
wearing something like that?

326
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,430
-How embarrassing.
-Gosh.

327
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:17,433
I could even see her belly button.

328
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:21,062
That's just workout gear.
Many people wear that these days.

329
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:22,688
-What?
-What?

330
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:30,029
Grab your soap now.

331
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:33,157
It smells incredible
thanks to the tangerine peel.

332
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,534
Who will take this? Gosh, I dropped one.

333
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:39,246
This one got crushed.
I'll cut another piece for you.

334
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:42,124
Two for Ms. Gam-ri.

335
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:46,170
Ms. Suk-ja wanted four, right?

336
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:48,714
And ten for Ms. Mat-i. You're so generous.

337
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:50,341
Why isn't anyone answering me?

338
00:22:53,427 --> 00:22:55,262
Let's see.

339
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,395
Ms. Yeo?

340
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:04,981
Doctor. Hi, how are you?

341
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:08,609
Well, my goodness.

342
00:23:08,693 --> 00:23:09,819
I'm still unpacking…

343
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:13,447
I love what you've done with the place.

344
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:15,491
It looks totally different.

345
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:19,745
Can I get you something to drink?

346
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:22,707
No, it's fine. I have to get going anyway.

347
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,916
I just came by

348
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,005
to invite you to the party
for the elderly we're having tomorrow.

349
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:32,383
I see. A party for the elderly?

350
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:35,094
What do you say? Can you make it?

351
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:37,096
I'd have to check my schedule.

352
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,974
Please stop by even though you're busy.

353
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:41,809
Greet your neighbors properly

354
00:23:41,892 --> 00:23:43,894
and promote the opening of your clinic.

355
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:45,563
A promotion?

356
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:56,282
Here you go.

357
00:23:58,534 --> 00:23:59,785
-Eat lots.
-Sure.

358
00:24:14,842 --> 00:24:18,095
Let's just consider it
fixed and sunk costs.

359
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:20,514
-What are you standing there?
-Gosh.

360
00:24:20,598 --> 00:24:22,183
I was about to join.

361
00:24:23,851 --> 00:24:27,188
-What's with the camera?
-I'm here to take photos of the party.

362
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:28,272
By the hour?

363
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:30,858
Unfortunately, this one's for free.

364
00:24:30,941 --> 00:24:33,903
Don't take my photos.
I value my portrait rights.

365
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:36,781
Don't worry. I have high standards
when it comes to my models.

366
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:42,495
Doctor, over here!

367
00:24:42,578 --> 00:24:43,954
Yes, coming.

368
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:54,298
Welcome.

369
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:56,383
-Please have a seat.
-Hello.

370
00:24:57,843 --> 00:24:59,261
You remember us, don't you?

371
00:24:59,345 --> 00:25:02,306
Yes, of course.
I was grateful for the other day.

372
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:04,475
-You're a dentist, right?
-Yes.

373
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:08,187
I opened a dental clinic
in the building up there.

374
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,856
Please come by if your teeth bother you.

375
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,150
The world has changed
for the better, hasn't it?

376
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:15,778
Back then, we could barely make do,

377
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:18,072
so women rarely received higher education.

378
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:19,240
I see.

379
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:22,284
Anyway, enjoy the food.

380
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:25,746
From what I saw the other day,
you could use some food.

381
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,083
Hold on a second. This piece of meat

382
00:25:30,126 --> 00:25:33,087
wrapped in some of this kimchi…

383
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:36,507
Go ahead. It's really good, you know.

384
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,425
Open wide.

385
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:42,221
-Here you go.
-I…

386
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,764
There.

387
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,270
What… Why aren't you eating it?

388
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:50,437
Well, I…

389
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:53,649
I'll have it later.
I'm not hungry right now, so…

390
00:25:53,732 --> 00:25:57,987
Is it because she used her hands?
They're clean, you know.

391
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,114
No, that's not it.

392
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:05,411
Doctor, when did you get here?

393
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:06,787
Ms. Yeo.

394
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:09,707
Things were so hectic
that I didn't see you arrive.

395
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:11,750
Hello.

396
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:14,587
I saw you move in the other day.

397
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:17,464
I'm the owner of
Gongjin Korean-Chinese Restaurant.

398
00:26:18,424 --> 00:26:20,009
-Hello.
-Right.

399
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:23,429
Goodness me. How have things been for you?

400
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,056
It turns out

401
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,644
you rented out the house and office space
that are in her name.

402
00:26:30,728 --> 00:26:34,565
A good landlady should be in your cards,
but you ended up with a fussy one.

403
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:37,484
What are you spewing?

404
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:38,903
But I'm right.

405
00:26:38,986 --> 00:26:40,988
Everyone knows you're a fussy one.

406
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,991
That's not true.

407
00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:47,703
Doctor, I'm a friendly one, you know.

408
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:50,748
I gave you a discount on your deposit
since you leased two.

409
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:53,876
Don't hesitate to let me know
if anything bothers you.

410
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:56,712
-Actually, there are a few things.
-Goodness.

411
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:59,548
Do tell. I'll get it sorted immediately.

412
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:01,967
Is that so? Then could you

413
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:04,136
change the utility room floor tiles?

414
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,930
Why? Are there any cracks?

415
00:27:06,013 --> 00:27:08,891
Actually, there are some minor cracks

416
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:11,560
which don't seem pleasant to the eyes.

417
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:14,897
-There's also a hole in the screen window.
-My gosh.

418
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,983
It's only as big as
a quarter of my pinky fingernail,

419
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:21,987
but mosquitoes and fruit flies
can still make it in

420
00:27:22,071 --> 00:27:24,365
-which is a nuisance.
-Goodness.

421
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:27,076
-Also, you sell fish at your restaurant.
-Right.

422
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,496
Maybe you should consider
another way of grilling it.

423
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:34,250
The smell is quite overpowering, you see.

424
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:37,503
I'm particularly not fond
of fishy smells, so…

425
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:38,587
She's not wrong.

426
00:27:39,797 --> 00:27:43,759
Hi, I'm Bo-ra's mother,
the owner of the supermarket nearby.

427
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:44,843
Hello.

428
00:27:44,927 --> 00:27:46,470
And this is my husband.

429
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:47,888
-Hello.
-Hi.

430
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:50,015
-I run the hardware store.
-I see.

431
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:53,769
-It's nice to have some youth in the town.
-Right.

432
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:56,188
You didn't buy anything
at the store the other day.

433
00:27:56,272 --> 00:27:58,107
-Really?
-Just come by anytime.

434
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:03,112
Actually, it's because
I didn't find what I was looking for.

435
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:05,281
-What?
-What? What didn't we have?

436
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:07,575
We have more items
than any other place in town.

437
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:09,535
-She's right.
-It's a shampoo

438
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:11,287
from a high-end brand,

439
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,205
so I doubt the countryside has it.

440
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:15,207
Countryside?

441
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,418
I went by just in case, but I was right.

442
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:19,128
Don't worry about it.

443
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:21,880
-I bought some online.
-I see.

444
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,675
-Honey, can you…
-Right.

445
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:25,676
Slow and steady.

446
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,930
Did you manage to get an
internet connection all the way out here?

447
00:28:30,014 --> 00:28:32,933
I should go change the way I grill fish.

448
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:35,853
I should get going too.

449
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:38,230
Does the store not have certain items?

450
00:28:38,314 --> 00:28:39,398
We have the essentials.

451
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:43,193
If your teeth ever bother you…

452
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:56,832
So you're really a dentist.

453
00:28:58,709 --> 00:28:59,835
Yes.

454
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:01,295
My gosh.

455
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:04,632
I shouldn't have gotten
the wrong idea about you.

456
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:07,217
I apologize.

457
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:11,180
Let's forget what happened, shall we?

458
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:14,892
Let me properly introduce myself then.

459
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,186
<i>A sleepless moonlit night</i>

460
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:18,812
Right, you don't know the song.

461
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:20,856
Anyway, I'm Oh Yoon.

462
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:23,525
A singer.

463
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:24,485
Hello.

464
00:29:28,322 --> 00:29:31,533
This happens to be my first studio album.

465
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:33,911
Think of it as a welcoming gift.

466
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:35,496
-For me?
-Yes.

467
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:38,040
Thank you. It also has my autograph.

468
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:40,959
Thank you.

469
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:45,047
Did you enjoy enough food?

470
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,382
Yes, go ahead.

471
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,939
Ms. Yeo, I'll take a bowl
of <i>yukgaejang</i> too.

472
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:05,109
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

473
00:30:05,192 --> 00:30:07,486
Does the smell of my grilled fish
disgust you?

474
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:09,071
-Of course not.
-Right?

475
00:30:09,863 --> 00:30:12,408
I always use fresh fish caught daily.

476
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:15,703
-Did someone say something?
-Forget it.

477
00:30:18,455 --> 00:30:22,960
<i>Greetings. This is the village chief,
Chang Yeong-guk.</i>

478
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,006
Today, a party for the elderly

479
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:32,010
is taking place at the town hall.

480
00:30:32,094 --> 00:30:35,013
<i>We're gathering to wish
our elders good health.</i>

481
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:38,767
<i>Meat and rice cakes
will be served as part of the feast,</i>

482
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:42,855
<i>so please attend the party
if you haven't already</i>

483
00:30:42,938 --> 00:30:46,066
<i>and make sure to get there
as soon as you can.</i>

484
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:51,405
Just so you know, I would've won
the number one song on <i>Top Ten Songs</i>

485
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:55,284
if I hadn't gone up against
Seo Taiji and Boys in 1993.

486
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:58,078
Do you know the song "Hayeoga"?

487
00:30:58,162 --> 00:30:59,621
-<i>To you, I'm--</i>
-That song I know.

488
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:01,498
See? Everyone knows "Hayeoga."

489
00:31:01,582 --> 00:31:03,292
Do you know what Korea's number two

490
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,835
-national treasure is?
-No.

491
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:07,212
The ten-story Stone Pagoda
at Wongaksa Temple Site.

492
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:09,882
We all know what
the number one treasure is,

493
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:11,049
but not number two.

494
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:13,469
It's the same with you.
You know "Hayeoga,"

495
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:15,596
but not "Exercising in the Moonlight."

496
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,015
No one ever remembers second place.

497
00:31:18,098 --> 00:31:20,225
Why am I so worked up about this?

498
00:31:21,185 --> 00:31:22,519
It's not you I'm blaming.

499
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:26,899
Anyway, my second album
was well on its way.

500
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:28,442
I poured my soul into it.

501
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:30,694
I even recorded the title song,

502
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:33,822
but my manager ran off
with all of the production funds.

503
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:37,993
And while I looked for him
everywhere throughout the country,

504
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:40,370
people forgot about me.

505
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:43,749
Since then, all I could do
was sing at nightclubs,

506
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:46,460
and I ended up settling here in Gongjin.

507
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:51,048
-I met a woman, you see.
-I need to use the restroom.

508
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:52,341
Yes, sure thing.

509
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,885
I see you go to the restroom often.

510
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:59,556
Ms. Dentist, why don't you come
have a bowl of <i>yukgaejang</i> too?

511
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,601
-I'm good.
-Why not? Still on a diet?

512
00:32:02,684 --> 00:32:04,895
That's not it.
I just don't have an appetite.

513
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:06,480
But it smells incredible.

514
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:11,360
Are you aware of how much dust is here?

515
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:13,070
And there are so many people here.

516
00:32:13,153 --> 00:32:16,990
Food cooked out here in the open
is just unsanitary.

517
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:20,410
Hold on a second.
Are you calling this soup dirty?

518
00:32:20,494 --> 00:32:21,662
I'm just saying.

519
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:24,206
Spoken like a fussy Seoulite.

520
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:26,250
Must you be so picky?

521
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,670
Why can't you look the other way
and only see the good things?

522
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:30,963
What for?

523
00:32:31,922 --> 00:32:33,674
Because you just moved here and--

524
00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:37,427
Hey, Mi-seon. Where are you?

525
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:41,640
<i>I'm out grocery shopping.</i>

526
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:45,686
My boyfriend's been busy at work,
so we haven't been able to get together.

527
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:47,104
I thought I'd cook for him.

528
00:32:47,187 --> 00:32:48,981
Devoted, aren't you?

529
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:54,403
What's with the commotion?

530
00:32:54,486 --> 00:32:58,073
This is Oh Yoon speaking. It's not
a true party without a song from me!

531
00:32:58,156 --> 00:33:00,659
Geum-cheol, let's do this!

532
00:33:00,742 --> 00:33:01,702
All right!

533
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:04,329
-Just a second.
-<i>When spring comes</i>

534
00:33:04,413 --> 00:33:07,666
<i>You said you'd come to me</i>

535
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:12,421
<i>Like a singing swallow</i>

536
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:13,672
Geum-cheol!

537
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:18,427
A party for the elderly?
You really went there?

538
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,096
I was hoping I could
promote my new clinic,

539
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,556
but I shouldn't have come.

540
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:24,850
<i>Why's that? It's not for you, is it?</i>

541
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:26,435
You have no idea.

542
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:29,313
In a yard where dirt is kicked up,

543
00:33:29,396 --> 00:33:31,481
they grill meat, boil soup, and sing.

544
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:34,735
On top of that, the old ladies
use their bare hands when eating.

545
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:38,280
Gosh, it's like they're doing
everything you hate.

546
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:40,449
Exactly.

547
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,535
<i>Looking up at the blue sky</i>

548
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:44,536
I'm reminded of you!

549
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,663
<i>I'm reminded of you</i>

550
00:33:47,247 --> 00:33:48,290
Geum-cheol!

551
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:50,292
<i>Just like a swallow</i>

552
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,794
<i>My heart flies to you</i>

553
00:33:52,878 --> 00:33:56,423
This is so annoying.
I shouldn't have come.

554
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,134
CANCEL

555
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:01,511
Hey, what the hell?

556
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:02,846
-What?
-Darn it.

557
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:05,474
-Hey, who did that?
-It was getting good.

558
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:06,683
What's going on?

559
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:11,355
<i>I don't like anything here.
Maybe I should've just stayed in Seoul.</i>

560
00:34:11,438 --> 00:34:12,314
-What?
-What?

561
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:16,318
<i>There's this cafe owner here
who's apparently</i>

562
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:17,986
<i>an obscure singer.</i>

563
00:34:18,487 --> 00:34:19,863
<i>Do you know Oh Yoon?</i>

564
00:34:22,783 --> 00:34:24,326
You don't know, right?

565
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:28,622
He keeps on talking about himself
when I didn't even ask.

566
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:32,876
<i>His second album was scrapped
after his manager took off with the money.</i>

567
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:35,587
<i>Isn't that an excuse though?</i>

568
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:40,384
<i>If he had the willpower or talent,
he would've made it one way or another.</i>

569
00:34:42,552 --> 00:34:44,388
-<i>I…</i>
-Don't. It's all right.

570
00:34:44,471 --> 00:34:45,847
-<i>Living in the past</i>
-I'm good.

571
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:47,557
<i>when one's present is in shambles?</i>

572
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:49,393
<i>That's only what cowards do.</i>

573
00:34:50,394 --> 00:34:52,729
-<i>I feel bad though.</i>
-About what?

574
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,274
I feel bad for those
whose hopes are left behind in the past.

575
00:34:57,025 --> 00:35:00,696
One's unfulfilled dreams
tend to hold a place in the heart.

576
00:35:02,948 --> 00:35:06,868
<i>Anyway, I'm nearly at the cashier now.</i>

577
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:08,620
Right, bye.

578
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:41,653
Unbelievable.
How could you have left the mike on?

579
00:35:41,737 --> 00:35:42,571
Turn it off!

580
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:43,947
What?

581
00:35:44,031 --> 00:35:45,032
Oh, gosh.

582
00:35:48,744 --> 00:35:50,537
Chun-jae.

583
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,414
-Chun-jae!
-Chun-jae!

584
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:32,814
Here you are. I looked everywhere for you.

585
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:35,817
Why did you have to… Damn it.

586
00:36:36,526 --> 00:36:39,446
You should take more photos.
Why are you here?

587
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:41,114
I took enough.

588
00:36:44,576 --> 00:36:46,453
Chun-jae, are you all right?

589
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:52,876
Don't take what she said to heart.
Consider it as ignorant babbling.

590
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,963
All she said is right though.

591
00:36:58,006 --> 00:37:00,216
My life is worthy of such an assessment.

592
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,427
What are you talking about?

593
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,429
Regulars come by to hear your song,

594
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:06,723
and you have a daughter you love so much.

595
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:14,981
You know what?
Let's go someplace nice for a drink

596
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,233
and lighten our mood.

597
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:19,319
I need to make lunch for Ju-ri.

598
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:22,906
She didn't want to eat at the party today,

599
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:24,574
which I scolded her for.

600
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,703
Good thing she didn't come.

601
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:32,290
I'm off.

602
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:44,761
DENTAL HYGIENIST WANTED

603
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:46,972
NEW DENTAL CLINIC IN GONGJIN
LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE

604
00:37:52,435 --> 00:37:54,020
Me and my big mouth.

605
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:58,108
To hell with my business.
I should pack up.

606
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:12,455
Delivery. Are you Yoon Hye-jin?

607
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:13,623
I am.

608
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:15,458
Can you sign here?

609
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:18,753
I didn't expect it to get here so soon
since it's an overseas delivery.

610
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:21,631
That's how it usually is,

611
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:23,675
but this one's early.

612
00:38:23,758 --> 00:38:25,468
You really do everything around here.

613
00:38:28,763 --> 00:38:31,224
What? Why are you staring at me like that?

614
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:34,811
-You think you're better than everyone.
-What?

615
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:37,731
Being smart, you got good grades
and became a dentist.

616
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:39,858
Your life must've been smooth.

617
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,945
Not always, of course,
but all you hit were simple speed bumps.

618
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:46,072
Getting over those small bumps,

619
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:48,742
you thought that willpower
could get you anywhere.

620
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:50,952
If this is about earlier, stop.

621
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:53,538
I shouldn't have to hear this from you.

622
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:56,499
Why not? You freely judge
other people's lives,

623
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,585
but are offended
when you're being assessed?

624
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,089
Look here, doctor.
It seems like you're mistaken.

625
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:07,010
Life isn't so fair for all of us.

626
00:39:08,136 --> 00:39:10,930
Some spend their whole lives
on unpaved roads,

627
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:15,351
while some run at full speed
only to reach the edge of a cliff.

628
00:39:16,102 --> 00:39:17,228
Got that?

629
00:39:33,661 --> 00:39:35,497
What now? Do you have more to say?

630
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:40,752
Mi-seon?

631
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:46,508
I took a cab here.

632
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,426
It cost me 200,000 won.

633
00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:50,470
What's going on?

634
00:39:58,311 --> 00:39:59,479
Let's head inside.

635
00:39:59,562 --> 00:40:01,189
Damn bastard.

636
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:06,986
So you went to his place with groceries,

637
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,906
and a woman with a two to eight parting

638
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:12,367
was there in his dress shirt?

639
00:40:13,034 --> 00:40:13,868
Yes.

640
00:40:14,702 --> 00:40:17,455
Apparently, she came after landing.
She's a flight attendant.

641
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:18,373
And?

642
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:22,752
Both she and I had no idea.

643
00:40:22,836 --> 00:40:25,421
-That's when the bastard crawled in.
-And?

644
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:28,049
We both took out items
from the grocery bag.

645
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,927
I wielded spring onions
while she swung the net of onions.

646
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,180
Wasn't there anything sharp?

647
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:37,308
The spring onions were the sharpest item.

648
00:40:39,144 --> 00:40:41,855
You're a true friend
who'd let me ruin my life completely.

649
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:45,233
Come on. We're going back to Seoul.

650
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:46,568
Sit back down.

651
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:48,570
Why? We should go and kill that bastard.

652
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:52,490
Or did you already?

653
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:55,952
Enough with the crap
and take down that classified ad.

654
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,335
Board and lodging
and a ten percent raise. Okay?

655
00:41:07,714 --> 00:41:08,798
Deal?

656
00:41:09,507 --> 00:41:10,341
Deal.

657
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:13,344
Come here!

658
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:18,975
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

659
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:20,226
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

660
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:29,194
It's finally D-day.

661
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:31,029
Let's get off to a good start.

662
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,049
YOON DENTAL CLINIC OPENING EVENT

663
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:11,569
I guess word didn't spread properly.

664
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:16,074
What if I promote the clinic online?
I have 50,000 followers on social media.

665
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:18,368
BORA SUPERMARKET

666
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:20,536
-Hello.
-Hello.

667
00:42:28,294 --> 00:42:29,420
-Hello.
-Hello.

668
00:42:29,504 --> 00:42:31,589
Yun-gyeong, I'd like to buy some shampoo.

669
00:42:32,131 --> 00:42:33,758
The one with the nice scent.

670
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:36,552
Unbelievable.

671
00:42:36,636 --> 00:42:37,804
What's going on?

672
00:42:42,684 --> 00:42:45,311
Hey, did you do something wrong?

673
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:03,746
What is it?

674
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:05,498
What?

675
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:12,088
What's wrong?

676
00:43:14,173 --> 00:43:15,466
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

677
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,051
Why do you keep glancing at her?

678
00:43:17,135 --> 00:43:20,596
It's nothing. The anchovies
are on the smaller side today.

679
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,100
Well, they're supposed to be small.

680
00:43:24,183 --> 00:43:25,768
-Right.
-They look delicious.

681
00:43:27,228 --> 00:43:28,646
Goodness.

682
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:30,606
Gosh!

683
00:43:31,316 --> 00:43:34,068
Seriously? And you're telling me this now?

684
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:37,322
If I had told you sooner,
you wouldn't have moved here.

685
00:43:37,405 --> 00:43:40,074
You're not a friend, but a scam artist.

686
00:43:42,243 --> 00:43:46,164
What am I going to do?
The rumors must've spread.

687
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,085
Forget it.

688
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:54,213
Private clinics can't stay afloat
without the town's trust.

689
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:56,883
Let's pack it up and head back to Seoul.

690
00:43:56,966 --> 00:43:58,551
How can I

691
00:43:59,594 --> 00:44:00,928
when I spent a fortune here?

692
00:44:01,012 --> 00:44:03,556
Don't think of it like that.
Cut your losses now,

693
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:07,643
or you'll spend months being in the red.

694
00:44:08,269 --> 00:44:09,395
Like my dad.

695
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:14,067
Hey!

696
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:15,985
Where are you going?

697
00:44:16,736 --> 00:44:17,862
Where is she going?

698
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:49,560
Out for some moonlight jogging?

699
00:44:54,065 --> 00:44:56,776
You must be angry
about what I said that day.

700
00:44:58,736 --> 00:44:59,737
By the way,

701
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:03,616
how about you run
in a different outfit next time?

702
00:45:06,077 --> 00:45:08,079
-What?
-Rumor has it

703
00:45:08,162 --> 00:45:10,331
that the dentist
runs around in her long johns.

704
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,417
These are leggings.

705
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:16,712
Whether I wear long johns or a bikini
is none of their business.

706
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:20,675
Yes, you're right. But I'd appreciate
you meeting them halfway.

707
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:24,011
I see you've yet
to catch up with the world.

708
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,972
Meddling can be dangerous, you know.

709
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:30,184
I know that it's for a better workout
and not for other people to see.

710
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:32,061
-But?
-This may sound old-fashioned,

711
00:45:32,145 --> 00:45:35,398
but this isn't Seoul.
The town has an older population.

712
00:45:35,481 --> 00:45:36,732
It sure is exhausting.

713
00:45:36,816 --> 00:45:40,111
Yet, you're the one
who chose to open a dental clinic here.

714
00:45:40,736 --> 00:45:42,947
Don't we all need some time to adjust?

715
00:45:44,282 --> 00:45:48,202
I've thought about it,
and all people make mistakes.

716
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,165
Technically speaking, you didn't know
that the mic was turned on.

717
00:45:52,665 --> 00:45:55,126
We all badmouth others
at least once in our lives.

718
00:45:55,209 --> 00:45:56,586
It'll be fine, so don't worry.

719
00:45:57,253 --> 00:46:01,340
Everyone in this town is probably busy
talking smack about you too.

720
00:46:02,675 --> 00:46:06,387
Now that things are even,
you can move forward from here.

721
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:09,098
Did you hand out rice cakes?

722
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:13,477
Unbelievable.

723
00:46:25,198 --> 00:46:27,033
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

724
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:28,117
Ms. Yeo.

725
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:32,997
Hello. This is to celebrate
the opening of my clinic.

726
00:46:33,748 --> 00:46:36,209
Right. I see you bought rice cakes.

727
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:38,419
-Please have it while it's warm.
-Thank you.

728
00:46:40,671 --> 00:46:44,008
Hello, I'm here from Yoon Dental Clinic.

729
00:46:44,091 --> 00:46:45,426
Please have some rice cakes.

730
00:46:47,678 --> 00:46:48,721
You can leave it here.

731
00:46:53,768 --> 00:46:54,852
Have a good day.

732
00:46:55,728 --> 00:46:57,271
Darn it. Why isn't this working?

733
00:46:57,355 --> 00:46:58,731
BORA SUPERMARKET

734
00:46:58,814 --> 00:46:59,899
Hello.

735
00:47:00,816 --> 00:47:01,776
Have some rice cake.

736
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:04,737
I'm being tested for
gestational diabetes tomorrow.

737
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,197
I see you can't have any.

738
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:09,242
Sorry about that.

739
00:47:09,325 --> 00:47:10,660
I'm sorry.

740
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:14,872
Hello.

741
00:47:15,581 --> 00:47:18,376
Yoon Dental Clinic just opened.
I hope we get along.

742
00:47:28,094 --> 00:47:31,264
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

743
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,490
Hey, it's the dentist!

744
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:52,410
-Hello.
-Hello.

745
00:47:52,493 --> 00:47:53,953
Hi, kids.

746
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:55,413
What are you up to?

747
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:00,876
What's this?

748
00:48:02,211 --> 00:48:03,504
Is it a hedgehog?

749
00:48:03,587 --> 00:48:04,755
Yes.

750
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:05,798
No way.

751
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,723
You want me to take care of it?

752
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,893
Yes, we saved up our allowance to buy it,

753
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:20,771
but my mom won't let me keep it.

754
00:48:20,855 --> 00:48:22,398
GONGJIN MARKET

755
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:24,358
You can take it instead then.

756
00:48:25,026 --> 00:48:26,569
I was going to,

757
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:29,196
but I haven't been able
to tell my mom yet.

758
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,783
He'll ask her once he wins a prize
at the math competition.

759
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:33,993
Is that so?

760
00:48:34,618 --> 00:48:37,580
That'll be really hard.
Are you sure you can do it?

761
00:48:37,663 --> 00:48:39,707
He's super smart!

762
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,751
He gets a perfect score all the time.

763
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:43,502
Really?

764
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:50,509
Still, I'm afraid I can't take this.

765
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:55,890
Hey, why don't you ask
Chief Hong to look after it?

766
00:48:55,973 --> 00:48:58,059
We already asked,

767
00:48:58,976 --> 00:49:00,353
and he declined.

768
00:49:00,436 --> 00:49:01,520
Why?

769
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:08,569
He acts all high and mighty
but declines a child's request?

770
00:49:10,071 --> 00:49:13,908
I'm sorry to say this,
but I can't look after it either.

771
00:49:14,658 --> 00:49:16,535
Pets aren't really my thing,

772
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:19,205
and providing for myself is tough enough.

773
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:23,000
Look for someone else to help, okay?
Again, I'm sorry.

774
00:49:23,959 --> 00:49:25,294
Enjoy your rice cake.

775
00:49:28,381 --> 00:49:31,300
See? I told you she wouldn't do it for us.

776
00:49:31,842 --> 00:49:36,972
My mom said that
she's such a cold-hearted person.

777
00:49:45,773 --> 00:49:50,027
Money sure is great.
You always get what you pay for.

778
00:49:50,528 --> 00:49:52,071
How was the facial?

779
00:49:52,154 --> 00:49:53,072
Gosh.

780
00:49:54,657 --> 00:49:57,118
What's this? Is that a hedgehog?

781
00:49:57,201 --> 00:49:58,911
Where did you get it?

782
00:49:58,994 --> 00:50:01,997
Someone asked me
to take care of it for a few days.

783
00:50:02,498 --> 00:50:04,750
Who in this town would ask you?

784
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:09,046
Well, my first patient in Gongjin did.

785
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,258
What do you mean?
We still have zero patients.

786
00:50:14,343 --> 00:50:15,344
Hey.

787
00:50:16,053 --> 00:50:17,638
What's with all this mail?

788
00:50:18,597 --> 00:50:21,475
How many charity organizations
do you support?

789
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:23,769
Jeez. It's not that many.

790
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:25,438
Not that many, my foot.

791
00:50:26,105 --> 00:50:27,940
Single mothers, low-income households,

792
00:50:28,023 --> 00:50:29,900
and schools in Africa.

793
00:50:29,984 --> 00:50:32,695
Shouldn't you be
tightening your belt instead?

794
00:50:32,778 --> 00:50:35,197
Until we get patients,
cut back on monthly donations.

795
00:50:35,281 --> 00:50:36,907
Look at it run.

796
00:50:37,783 --> 00:50:39,034
Just look at it go.

797
00:50:40,035 --> 00:50:42,204
-There you go.
-Unbelievable.

798
00:50:42,288 --> 00:50:44,832
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

799
00:50:44,915 --> 00:50:47,877
REGULAR PERFORMANCE CANCELED

800
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:51,130
Chun-jae, has today's performance
been canceled?

801
00:50:51,714 --> 00:50:53,966
Yes, I'm not feeling all that good.

802
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:55,217
What, how bad is it?

803
00:50:55,301 --> 00:50:58,053
What? My head is a bit…

804
00:50:59,263 --> 00:51:03,642
Customers never seem
to finish their coffee. What a waste.

805
00:51:03,726 --> 00:51:06,103
-That's because it's no good.
-What?

806
00:51:06,187 --> 00:51:08,689
Your coffee tastes awful.
Uncle Du-sik's is good though.

807
00:51:08,772 --> 00:51:10,608
-It's really bad.
-Ju-ri, stop.

808
00:51:10,691 --> 00:51:12,026
-What? It's true.
-Right?

809
00:51:13,444 --> 00:51:14,778
I don't do anything right.

810
00:51:20,659 --> 00:51:23,287
Ju-ri, I know you've hit puberty
and want to rebel

811
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:24,997
-every three seconds.
-Puberty?

812
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,083
But don't be so mean to your father.
You'll regret it later.

813
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:29,877
-You smell like a geezer.
-What?

814
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,253
-You stink.
-I don't.

815
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:32,421
You do.

816
00:51:32,505 --> 00:51:36,425
I only say this
because I'm the slightest bit wiser.

817
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:40,346
-And I sound like an adult, not a geezer.
-"Adult."

818
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:44,099
-Don't be crooked like your eyebrows.
-Wait. Do my eyebrows look weird?

819
00:51:44,183 --> 00:51:45,309
That can't be.

820
00:51:46,185 --> 00:51:48,312
Gosh. They look perfectly fine!

821
00:51:48,395 --> 00:51:50,648
I sure did a good job on them.

822
00:51:57,154 --> 00:51:58,030
Jeez.

823
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:14,171
<i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>
OH YOON

824
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:16,382
DEMO OF <i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>,
OH YOON'S 2ND ALBUM

825
00:52:25,933 --> 00:52:28,394
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

826
00:52:28,477 --> 00:52:31,730
WEEKDAYS 9:00 TO 18:00
SATURDAYS 9:00 TO 12:00

827
00:52:31,814 --> 00:52:33,774
I hope we get patients today.

828
00:52:33,857 --> 00:52:36,860
We will. You handed out
the rice cakes, remember?

829
00:52:36,944 --> 00:52:37,861
The rice cakes?

830
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:46,120
Welcome.

831
00:52:46,203 --> 00:52:47,538
Good day.

832
00:52:47,621 --> 00:52:48,706
What the hell?

833
00:52:52,918 --> 00:52:54,253
You still don't get it.

834
00:52:54,336 --> 00:52:55,796
Why are you on my case again?

835
00:52:55,879 --> 00:52:58,173
Because you're pathetic.
Do you really think

836
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:00,259
that giving out rice cakes was enough?

837
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:01,719
I followed your advice.

838
00:53:02,928 --> 00:53:05,180
-It made no difference.
-Because it was insincere.

839
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:08,726
Didn't you reluctantly show your face
and ask them to come by some time?

840
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:10,102
I can almost see it.

841
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:11,228
So what?

842
00:53:11,312 --> 00:53:13,147
-Come with me.
-Where?

843
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,316
Would you rather let your business tank?

844
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:19,862
Are you nuts? Why would you bring me here?

845
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:23,449
Aren't you a resident too?
You should be at the neighborhood meeting.

846
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:24,992
You know what I mean.

847
00:53:25,576 --> 00:53:27,411
-I can't go in there.
-Jeez.

848
00:53:28,162 --> 00:53:30,205
Will you just keep avoiding them then?

849
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:32,082
If you can't pick up spilt milk,

850
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:34,960
you should at least
apologize to them for spilling the milk,

851
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:36,587
rather than avoid them.

852
00:53:37,963 --> 00:53:39,465
Go in already. I'm busy.

853
00:53:39,548 --> 00:53:40,758
Aren't you going in?

854
00:53:40,841 --> 00:53:42,718
No, I have other things to do.

855
00:53:42,801 --> 00:53:43,636
Wait.

856
00:53:44,261 --> 00:53:46,013
How can I possibly go in there alone?

857
00:53:46,096 --> 00:53:47,931
They're all strangers to me.

858
00:53:48,015 --> 00:53:49,433
Are you leaning on me?

859
00:53:50,934 --> 00:53:52,936
-Of course not.
-Then get in there already.

860
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,023
Don't even think about running.
I'll hunt you down.

861
00:53:58,359 --> 00:53:59,401
Are you leaning on me?

862
00:53:59,485 --> 00:54:00,694
No.

863
00:54:11,705 --> 00:54:16,085
Did she really think that
giving out the rice cakes would do?

864
00:54:16,168 --> 00:54:17,753
I thought she was nice,

865
00:54:17,836 --> 00:54:20,214
but she thinks my supermarket
is a corner shop

866
00:54:20,297 --> 00:54:22,341
and calls Gongjin the countryside.

867
00:54:22,424 --> 00:54:26,387
She couldn't be more wrong.
This is an old town with a long history.

868
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,722
It has history and is on the bigger side.

869
00:54:28,806 --> 00:54:31,392
Gongjin used to be home
to the Dragon King.

870
00:54:31,475 --> 00:54:33,727
But there she is running
while barely covered.

871
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:35,688
It must've angered the Dragon King.

872
00:54:35,771 --> 00:54:36,772
Tell me about it.

873
00:54:36,855 --> 00:54:39,858
And how dare she
look down on us like that?

874
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:41,610
It sure is upsetting.

875
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:45,489
That's enough. Please drop it already.

876
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:47,449
What do you mean we should drop it?

877
00:54:47,533 --> 00:54:49,618
Aren't you just as pissed off?

878
00:54:49,702 --> 00:54:52,746
When will you stop hitting people
while you talk?

879
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:53,997
When did I do that?

880
00:54:54,081 --> 00:54:55,582
You did it just now.

881
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:57,292
Sitting next to you hurts.

882
00:54:58,043 --> 00:55:01,046
Stop accusing me
of something I didn't do. My gosh.

883
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,298
Chun-jae, you tell me. Did I do that?

884
00:55:03,382 --> 00:55:04,842
Goodness.

885
00:55:04,925 --> 00:55:08,679
Must you two get into it again?

886
00:55:09,346 --> 00:55:10,347
Gosh.

887
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:13,600
Hello, everyone.

888
00:55:13,684 --> 00:55:14,643
-What?
-Huh?

889
00:55:14,727 --> 00:55:16,353
-Dr. Yoon!
-What?

890
00:55:16,437 --> 00:55:20,023
I never expected you
to attend the neighborhood meeting.

891
00:55:20,107 --> 00:55:21,358
Tell me about it.

892
00:55:21,442 --> 00:55:24,445
I'm sorry about the town hall
not meeting your high standards.

893
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:26,280
Jeez.

894
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:29,658
God, it's heavy. Move out of the way.

895
00:55:31,493 --> 00:55:33,996
-Gosh, this almost killed my back.
-What is it?

896
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,457
-I'm a little late, aren't I?
-Yes.

897
00:55:37,082 --> 00:55:39,251
I went to bring today's snacks.

898
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:40,711
-Snacks?
-Yes.

899
00:55:40,794 --> 00:55:43,380
It's all Dr. Yoon's treat.

900
00:55:43,464 --> 00:55:44,423
-What?
-What?

901
00:55:44,506 --> 00:55:45,507
She asked for my help.

902
00:55:45,591 --> 00:55:49,011
She was edgy because she just moved,
so she made a mistake.

903
00:55:49,094 --> 00:55:51,722
She wanted to apologize
and asked me to prepare some food.

904
00:55:56,143 --> 00:56:00,439
Yun-gyeong, I bought these
from your store earlier

905
00:56:00,522 --> 00:56:02,149
-and left a receipt.
-Really?

906
00:56:02,232 --> 00:56:03,400
Of course.

907
00:56:03,484 --> 00:56:06,111
Please take your pick then!

908
00:56:06,195 --> 00:56:10,365
We have <i>yugwa</i> and <i>gangjeong</i>,
as well as fruits and beverages.

909
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:12,326
For those with bad teeth,

910
00:56:13,994 --> 00:56:15,954
there are white and yellow peaches.

911
00:56:16,038 --> 00:56:17,748
-Goodness.
-Yellow peaches?

912
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:21,043
-Don't just sit there. Help me.
-Of course.

913
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,544
-Geum-cheol.
-Yes?

914
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:23,962
Me? Okay.

915
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:25,422
Take this.

916
00:56:25,506 --> 00:56:27,508
-Take the box.
-Here you go.

917
00:56:27,591 --> 00:56:29,927
-It's fine. You can take a seat.
-Goodness.

918
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:32,054
-Here.
-My gosh.

919
00:56:32,638 --> 00:56:36,183
Here. Take the beverages.

920
00:56:36,266 --> 00:56:37,893
And this.

921
00:56:37,976 --> 00:56:40,062
-Also…
-She bought a lot.

922
00:56:41,855 --> 00:56:44,441
<i>So that'll be the end of today's meeting.</i>

923
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:47,486
I hope you didn't forget about
the weekly cleaning this Saturday.

924
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:48,445
-No.
-Of course not.

925
00:56:48,529 --> 00:56:50,280
Please bring your cleaning tools

926
00:56:50,364 --> 00:56:54,284
and gather at the recycling site
at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

927
00:56:54,368 --> 00:56:56,161
-Right.
-Got it.

928
00:56:56,245 --> 00:56:57,663
Before we wrap up,

929
00:56:57,746 --> 00:57:03,043
let's give it up for Dr. Yoon who
provided the snacks for today's meeting.

930
00:57:03,127 --> 00:57:04,294
Right.

931
00:57:04,378 --> 00:57:05,921
It was nice.

932
00:57:06,713 --> 00:57:08,674
We enjoyed it.

933
00:57:08,757 --> 00:57:10,050
Everything was good.

934
00:57:16,348 --> 00:57:17,391
I enjoyed those snacks.

935
00:57:17,474 --> 00:57:18,851
-Bye.
-Good night.

936
00:57:18,934 --> 00:57:20,394
Good job for today.

937
00:57:20,477 --> 00:57:22,437
You too, Ms. Gam-ri.

938
00:57:22,521 --> 00:57:24,314
-Get some rest then.
-Good night.

939
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:25,357
-Bye!
-Good night!

940
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,985
-Thanks for today.
-Chun-jae, get home safely.

941
00:57:28,068 --> 00:57:29,153
-Good night.
-You too.

942
00:57:34,449 --> 00:57:37,119
Thank you for today.

943
00:57:38,328 --> 00:57:40,664
I didn't expect you to care so much.

944
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,963
-Give me your hand.
-What?

945
00:57:48,046 --> 00:57:49,715
Show me your hand.

946
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:50,716
My hand?

947
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:15,824
-What's this?
-Take a look.

948
00:58:21,455 --> 00:58:22,623
A total of 125,000 won?

949
00:58:22,706 --> 00:58:25,459
Before I knew it, I bought that much.

950
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,378
You know where to wire the money, right?

951
00:58:30,297 --> 00:58:32,341
So does this mean

952
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,803
you bought the snacks to help me,

953
00:58:37,804 --> 00:58:39,723
-but I have to pay?
-Of course.

954
00:58:39,806 --> 00:58:42,601
You're obviously richer,
so why should I pay?

955
00:58:42,684 --> 00:58:44,269
-You're telling me now?
-Why not?

956
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:46,855
I didn't ask you to do this.

957
00:58:46,939 --> 00:58:49,149
You didn't even ask for my consent.

958
00:58:49,233 --> 00:58:51,235
You should work on how to say thanks.

959
00:58:51,318 --> 00:58:54,947
Neighborhood meeting or whatnot,
don't invite me to events like this again.

960
00:58:55,906 --> 00:58:57,115
I won't let it slide.

961
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:59,076
Wire it by the end of the day. Bye.

962
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:00,494
I warned you.

963
00:59:00,577 --> 00:59:01,745
Duly noted.

964
00:59:05,582 --> 00:59:06,917
What the hell?

965
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,544
I'm not grateful anymore.

966
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,716
Hurry, guys.

967
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,052
-Hurry over!
-Morning!

968
00:59:17,135 --> 00:59:19,930
-Morning.
-Hurry up. Just look at the time!

969
00:59:20,013 --> 00:59:21,848
-There they come.
-Hello.

970
00:59:21,932 --> 00:59:23,809
Honey, I told you to stay home.

971
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:25,894
-Let's get this over with.
-Hello.

972
00:59:25,978 --> 00:59:28,355
Let's split into teams

973
00:59:28,438 --> 00:59:32,276
and pick up the trash thoroughly.
We'll all contribute, okay?

974
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:35,195
Thank you, everyone.
Let's get started then.

975
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:47,165
Goodness. I see you just got up.

976
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:49,334
Right. What is this about?

977
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:52,546
At the neighborhood meeting,
I mentioned the weekly cleaning.

978
00:59:52,629 --> 00:59:56,883
Everyone else showed up, but you didn't
until well over 9:00 a.m., so I came.

979
00:59:56,967 --> 00:59:58,302
Right.

980
00:59:59,803 --> 01:00:02,306
Could I perhaps skip it this once?

981
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:04,683
As you know, I just moved here.

982
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:06,476
I'll participate starting next week.

983
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:07,978
Sure thing.

984
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:09,396
All right, then.

985
01:00:16,194 --> 01:00:17,404
That's understandable.

986
01:00:21,366 --> 01:00:24,119
Ms. Dentist, get out here.

987
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,664
Get out here, Ms. Dentist!

988
01:00:27,748 --> 01:00:28,915
He's so annoying.

989
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:32,711
I know you're in there.

990
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:34,504
I won't leave until you come out.

991
01:00:37,215 --> 01:00:38,216
Get out here!

992
01:00:39,134 --> 01:00:40,135
Ms. Dentist!

993
01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:42,679
Jeez.

994
01:00:42,763 --> 01:00:46,308
Out. Get out.

995
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,853
Go, see what he wants!

996
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,647
Chief Hong,

997
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,901
I feel a little under the weather.

998
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,779
Opening the clinic
must've taken a toll on me.

999
01:01:13,862 --> 01:01:14,696
What?

1000
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:21,119
I have a fever too.

1001
01:01:21,203 --> 01:01:24,247
Is that so? That's too bad.

1002
01:01:24,956 --> 01:01:26,708
Let me see. Hold on.

1003
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:28,668
Found it.

1004
01:01:28,752 --> 01:01:30,629
Here it is.

1005
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,881
Here.

1006
01:01:36,343 --> 01:01:37,886
That's 36.3°C.

1007
01:01:38,887 --> 01:01:40,389
You're 0.2°C below average.

1008
01:01:40,472 --> 01:01:41,640
Well…

1009
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:43,892
Maybe I run colder.

1010
01:01:43,975 --> 01:01:45,310
Get out here now!

1011
01:01:46,353 --> 01:01:48,563
Just leave me alone!

1012
01:01:49,356 --> 01:01:51,191
I need my sleep.

1013
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:10,043
Chun-jae.

1014
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:11,670
Help the ladies over there.

1015
01:02:13,755 --> 01:02:14,589
Won't you sweep?

1016
01:02:14,673 --> 01:02:17,300
Can't you see that I am?
I'm not the only one out here.

1017
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,982
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

1018
01:02:51,585 --> 01:02:54,129
The clinic is open, right?

1019
01:02:54,921 --> 01:02:57,591
Right, of course. Ms. Pyo?

1020
01:02:57,674 --> 01:02:59,301
-It's your first time, right?
-Yes.

1021
01:02:59,384 --> 01:03:01,386
-Please fill out this form first.
-Sure.

1022
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,721
-Right here.
-Got it.

1023
01:03:13,148 --> 01:03:14,316
-Here.
-Thank you.

1024
01:03:15,484 --> 01:03:18,236
Mr. Choi Eun-cheol, shall we?

1025
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,362
Okay.

1026
01:03:24,284 --> 01:03:25,285
Hello.

1027
01:03:26,453 --> 01:03:27,370
Hello.

1028
01:03:27,454 --> 01:03:29,623
Hello. It's your first time, right?

1029
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:34,461
<i>I went there because you recommended it,
and it was nice.</i>

1030
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:36,630
Really?

1031
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:39,591
<i>The treatment didn't hurt
which shows her competence,</i>

1032
01:03:39,674 --> 01:03:41,301
<i>and the cost was reasonable.</i>

1033
01:03:42,594 --> 01:03:43,595
I'm glad.

1034
01:03:44,262 --> 01:03:45,555
Anyway, thanks.

1035
01:03:45,639 --> 01:03:46,848
See you.

1036
01:03:48,642 --> 01:03:49,893
-No customers?
-You're here.

1037
01:03:49,976 --> 01:03:51,770
I'm sorry I had to step out.

1038
01:03:51,853 --> 01:03:54,105
Don't be. I'm paid to watch the cafe.

1039
01:03:54,189 --> 01:03:57,442
One might think I actually pay you a lot.

1040
01:03:57,526 --> 01:03:59,528
Why you won't accept a raise is beyond me.

1041
01:03:59,611 --> 01:04:01,071
I like things the way they are.

1042
01:04:01,154 --> 01:04:02,697
Aren't you going fishing today?

1043
01:04:03,198 --> 01:04:04,324
I'm here, so get going.

1044
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:05,617
After I'm done with this.

1045
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,286
By the way,
I uploaded a file on your computer.

1046
01:04:08,828 --> 01:04:10,747
A file? What kind of file?

1047
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,376
Your second title song,
"The End and the Beginning."

1048
01:04:15,752 --> 01:04:17,671
2ND ALBUM <i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>

1049
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:19,839
I didn't think it belonged in the trash.

1050
01:04:22,842 --> 01:04:24,052
Times have changed.

1051
01:04:24,135 --> 01:04:27,597
It's been digitized, so you
don't need to listen to it on a tape.

1052
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,644
How nice of you to care so much about me.

1053
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:35,355
Thanks, Du-sik.

1054
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:39,859
I'm good though.

1055
01:04:40,735 --> 01:04:41,570
What?

1056
01:04:42,237 --> 01:04:45,156
I'm done reminiscing my past.

1057
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,702
I can't make it big
as a singer anymore at this age,

1058
01:04:48,785 --> 01:04:50,829
so I should focus on the present.

1059
01:04:50,912 --> 01:04:54,416
I'm going to put my head on straight
and improve the cafe instead.

1060
01:04:54,499 --> 01:04:58,295
I need to put Ju-ri through fashion school
so that she can become a designer.

1061
01:05:04,092 --> 01:05:07,304
-Chun-jae.
-So can you teach me how to make coffee?

1062
01:05:07,387 --> 01:05:11,433
How can I run a cafe when I can't
even make a decent cup of it?

1063
01:05:11,516 --> 01:05:12,892
I guess that was bad.

1064
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:13,852
I'm in.

1065
01:05:14,603 --> 01:05:15,979
I won't go easy on you.

1066
01:05:16,062 --> 01:05:17,188
-Got it.
-Right.

1067
01:05:17,272 --> 01:05:19,107
-Get over here then.
-Right now?

1068
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:21,818
Of course. I said I wouldn't
go easy on you.

1069
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:23,862
-Gosh.
-Darn.

1070
01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:25,780
Even I don't drink the coffee I make.

1071
01:05:27,574 --> 01:05:30,076
Thank you. Please have a good day.

1072
01:05:30,744 --> 01:05:32,078
Ms. Park In-sun?

1073
01:05:33,246 --> 01:05:34,414
Hello, sir.

1074
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,249
Is this your first time here?

1075
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,508
You're almost done.

1076
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,179
Suction, please.

1077
01:05:49,262 --> 01:05:50,180
Okay.

<i>WALDEN</i> BY HENRY DAVID THOREAU

1079
01:06:04,486 --> 01:06:08,323
WHAT I DESIRE ARE
THE FLOWERS AND FRUIT OF PEOPLE

1080
01:06:15,997 --> 01:06:20,377
Hye-jin, my gosh. What a day.
It was exhausting, wasn't it?

1081
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:24,005
No, I was so happy
that I didn't feel tired at all.

1082
01:06:24,089 --> 01:06:26,633
This could be the beginning
of great success!

1083
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:29,511
Tell me about it.

1084
01:06:29,594 --> 01:06:33,890
It's odd though.
How did we get so many all of a sudden?

1085
01:06:33,973 --> 01:06:35,266
What?

1086
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:38,520
Our situation changed literally overnight.

1087
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:41,981
Did my social media pay off?

1088
01:06:44,317 --> 01:06:48,863
Or maybe the bad rumors about you
have finally subsided.

1089
01:06:53,993 --> 01:06:56,871
<i>Life isn't so fair for all of us.</i>

1090
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:01,251
<i>Some spend their whole lives
on unpaved roads,</i>

1091
01:07:01,835 --> 01:07:05,630
<i>while some run at full speed
only to reach the edge of a cliff.</i>

1092
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,593
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

1093
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:18,435
I…

1094
01:07:19,728 --> 01:07:22,021
listened to the album you gave me.

1095
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,441
Right.

1096
01:07:24,524 --> 01:07:25,942
To be honest though,

1097
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:28,737
"Exercising in the Moonlight"
wasn't all that good.

1098
01:07:30,405 --> 01:07:31,406
I see.

1099
01:07:31,489 --> 01:07:32,866
But,

1100
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:35,660
I did enjoy "Blue Scar on the Heart".

1101
01:07:37,996 --> 01:07:41,708
The melody was nice
and I could relate to the lyrics.

1102
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:43,501
I really liked it.

1103
01:07:47,714 --> 01:07:49,174
Oh, I see.

1104
01:07:49,841 --> 01:07:51,301
So that's more your style.

1105
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:56,306
I'm truly sorry about
what I said that day.

1106
01:07:56,389 --> 01:08:01,227
That day? And what day would that be?

1107
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:08,985
Have you perhaps seen Chief Hong today?

1108
01:08:09,068 --> 01:08:11,488
You mean Du-sik? Well,

1109
01:08:11,571 --> 01:08:14,199
he went out to the mudflats.

1110
01:08:14,282 --> 01:08:16,034
Would you be able to find it though?

1111
01:08:16,117 --> 01:08:19,704
-From Gongjin Harbor--
-Yes, I know where it is.

1112
01:08:19,788 --> 01:08:21,372
I see. It's where Turtle Rock is.

1113
01:08:21,456 --> 01:08:23,833
Right. Well, enjoy your smoke.

1114
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:25,752
Actually, I'm trying to quit.

1115
01:08:27,212 --> 01:08:29,380
-Thank you.
-Thanks to you too.

1116
01:08:34,302 --> 01:08:37,347
I really should quit.
A singer shouldn't smoke.

1120
01:09:59,137 --> 01:10:00,346
Chief Hong!

1121
01:10:04,058 --> 01:10:05,351
Fancy seeing you here.

1122
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,689
Well, I had something to say.

1123
01:10:12,358 --> 01:10:13,484
Go ahead.

1124
01:10:14,485 --> 01:10:17,655
The clinic had a surge of patients today,

1125
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:19,699
and I think I have you to thank.

1126
01:10:20,575 --> 01:10:22,744
I thought about
what you said the other day too.

1127
01:10:23,411 --> 01:10:26,080
I'm not saying you were right,

1128
01:10:26,164 --> 01:10:29,334
-but you have a point--
-I can't hear a thing!

1129
01:10:29,417 --> 01:10:30,668
Can you come up here?

1130
01:10:31,878 --> 01:10:33,212
I don't think I can.

1131
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,717
Your shoes always cause trouble.

1132
01:10:46,017 --> 01:10:47,185
Here.

1133
01:10:49,437 --> 01:10:50,438
Come on.

1134
01:11:39,946 --> 01:11:43,366
Did I keep you waiting long?

1135
01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:47,704
Absolutely.
Did you catch a lot of fish today?

1136
01:11:48,329 --> 01:11:50,498
Well, there was a ton caught on the net.

1137
01:11:51,457 --> 01:11:53,376
Some of your favorite croaker too.

1138
01:11:53,459 --> 01:11:57,255
Gosh, that's my favorite.

1139
01:11:57,922 --> 01:12:01,134
Why don't we grill some for dinner today?

1140
01:12:01,676 --> 01:12:03,469
Sounds delicious!

1141
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:08,891
Sir, if you don't mind,
could you take a photo of us?

1142
01:12:08,975 --> 01:12:10,893
I'm not good at things like this though.

1143
01:12:10,977 --> 01:12:14,689
It's quite easy.
Look into this lens and press the button.

1144
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:17,859
-Let me give it a try.
-Thank you.

1145
01:12:17,942 --> 01:12:19,235
Go stand there.

1146
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:26,117
Hye-jin, smile for the camera.

1147
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,537
But Mom, you were sick just a while ago.

1148
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:32,540
I'm fine. I'm not sick at all anymore.

1149
01:12:39,047 --> 01:12:41,132
All right. One…

1150
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:43,551

1151
01:12:45,636 --> 01:12:46,637

1153
01:12:50,516 --> 01:12:51,726
Thank you, sir.

1154
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:54,103
Come on. Let's go.

One, two, three.

1158
01:13:17,168 --> 01:13:20,463
Why don't we go to the photo studio
and take a photo too?

1159
01:13:20,546 --> 01:13:22,673
