DIVORCE BY MUTUAL CONSENT
CHANG YEONG-GUK, YEO HWA-JEONG

00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:39,952
<i>We all have moments we regret in life.</i>

DEMO OF <i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>,
OH YOON'S 2ND ALBUM

<i>Nevertheless,</i>

6
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:08,742
<i>we can never turn back the clock.</i>

CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

9
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:22,224
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

10
00:02:22,306 --> 00:02:23,919
EPISODE 2

11
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:35,788
Look. Sweet, isn't it?

12
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:38,310
Open your clinic here

13
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:41,288
and your patients will heal
just by looking out the window.

14
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:42,612
The view sure is nice.

15
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,507
Nothing beats this
when it comes to good feng shui.

16
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,822
Mountain in the back
and water in the front.

17
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:51,213
I see the ocean, but where's the mountain?

18
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,729
Have you forgotten about the hill
that's behind the marketplace?

19
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:58,782
If you're done, let's go. I'm a busy man.

20
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:02,214
Hold your horses.
I have a long checklist to go through.

21
00:03:02,793 --> 00:03:06,143
Good water pressure and sunlight
are essential.

22
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,402
Does this air conditioner work?

23
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:13,835
It doesn't.
I see you're the exhausting type.

24
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:15,530
No, I'm just thorough.

25
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:17,144
What's this?

26
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,748
The storage room.

27
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:25,538
Where will we check out next?
Is it far from here?

28
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,144
This is the only one.

29
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,121
You said we should get going.

30
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:34,099
Yes, to check out the house
for you to live in.

31
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,821
Then this is the only one
you have to show me?

32
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:38,896
Yes.

33
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:54,611
Two bedrooms and one…

34
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:56,637
One bathroom.

35
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,449
An air-conditioner, gas stove, washer,

36
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,013
and even a dryer are provided.

37
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:05,818
Who uses this kind of wallpaper
these days?

38
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:10,533
Sweet, isn't it?
A tropical vibe with contrasting colors.

39
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:14,916
An eco-friendly atmosphere. Don't you
think it'll put you on a flowery path?

40
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:18,638
The interior design isn't my style at all.

41
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:21,450
What exactly is your style then?

42
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:24,925
-As if that changes anything.
-Let's hear it.

43
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:29,846
Well… An overall vibe that incorporates
an antique, simple, and European style.

44
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:35,015
Wainscot paneling on the walls
and porcelain tiles on the floor.

45
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:40,102
Spanish tiles in the foyer
and light fixtures from Denmark would do.

46
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:43,575
I doubt you understood any of it.

47
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,726
How about some new wallpaper instead?

48
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:47,917
Off-white like teeth would be nice.

49
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,316
Let's sign the contract.

50
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:55,858
Hold on. What did you say
will be provided other than the washer?

51
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:57,016
A dryer!

52
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:59,166
Are you saying you own

53
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:02,268
both the office building and apartment?

54
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:03,426
That's right.

55
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:06,404
Am I the only one
who finds this suspicious?

56
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:08,265
-What do you mean?
-Just think about it.

57
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:11,780
When she found out
I'd open a dental clinic here,

58
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:13,351
she introduced me to you,

59
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:15,998
and the office space
you showed me is hers.

60
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,190
How is this a coincidence?

61
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:23,608
You're not scamming me
because I'm not from around here, right?

62
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,942
Doctor, I get how this
might seem suspicious to you,

63
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:31,878
but ask anyone in this town.

64
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,442
Everyone knows who we are.

65
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:35,352
Exactly.

66
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,048
We could never scam anyone.

67
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:40,728
I'm on government payroll, you see.

68
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:44,243
How can you be when you
obviously own a restaurant?

69
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:47,015
I guess it's my turn this time.

70
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:52,763
YEO HWA-JEONG, ZONE CHIEF

71
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:54,003
Zone chief?

72
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:57,146
That's right. The government pays me
300,000 won a month.

73
00:05:57,229 --> 00:05:58,800
And 20,000 won more for a meeting.

74
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:02,233
Chief Hong is a regular chief.
Only 50,000 a year.

75
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:05,665
Forget it. She still doesn't believe you,
so let's give her better proof.

76
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:08,353
See how much of a bargain you're getting.

77
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:11,703
GONGJIN, CHUNG-HO

78
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,474
The office space you just saw

79
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:17,410
is the unit she had saved
for her second restaurant.

80
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:20,719
But she offered it to you
because she thought

81
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:23,986
it'd benefit the whole town
if you opened a dental clinic.

82
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:26,508
Hey, stop that. That's not necessary.

83
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:29,444
She should know, though.
Forget it if you don't want it.

84
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,520
All right. Take a copy each.

85
00:06:42,223 --> 00:06:44,374
Now that the contract has been signed,

86
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:47,848
you will fulfill your duties
as landlady and tenant.

87
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,460
Good job.

88
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,693
-How many hours did you work today?
-Four.

89
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:56,698
So, for four hours…

90
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:58,806
Here.

91
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:03,066
I got that number too. I'll wire
the money. Coins can be a nuisance.

92
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:04,431
Much appreciated.

93
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,981
It's fine. You don't have to see us out.

94
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:25,688
Why are you following me?

95
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,527
You sure are dense, aren't you?
Do I really have to tell you?

96
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,097
What do you mean?

97
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,992
You need to pay me.
17,440 won for my service.

98
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:37,225
Did you say 17,440 won?

99
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:41,403
Listen up. Whatever the task,
I go by minimum wage.

100
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:45,289
I'm sure you know. The minimum wage
in 2021 is 8,720 won per hour.

101
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:48,557
I worked 4 hours, which is 34,880 won.

102
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,155
And it should be evenly split
between you and Ms. Yeo.

103
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,655
I only have big notes.

104
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,516
I always have change ready.

105
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:01,708
All right.

106
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:04,065
Take 2,000 won first.

107
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:07,498
And here's 560 won.

108
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,765
Are we done now?

109
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:14,362
Don't you need renovating?
I do that for minimum wage too.

110
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:16,389
As if anyone could do it.

111
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:19,035
I mentioned my high standards earlier.

112
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:27,514
What are they?

113
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:33,799
Wallpaper and painting,
cement work, tiles, heating,

114
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:34,875
even plumbing?

115
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:35,950
CERTIFIED PLUMBER

116
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:37,853
I'll consider myself hired.

117
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:47,529
He's so weird.

118
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:51,003
Did you say Gongjin?

119
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:53,319
Where the heck is that?

120
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:56,545
Gongjin, Chung-ho City, Gangwon Province.

121
00:08:56,627 --> 00:09:00,473
You're nuts. How are you going
to live in such hicksville?

122
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:03,161
I'm in the middle
of drawing a big picture.

123
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:07,421
Take a look. Awesome, right?

124
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:09,489
PRIVATE CLINIC DOCTORS
EARN MORE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE

125
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:13,046
So you're moving there just to earn money?

126
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,403
Well,

127
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:18,049
I can't find a job here,

128
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,489
and it's impossible
to open a clinic in Seoul.

129
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:24,501
This could fatten my bank account
in a short period of time.

130
00:09:25,286 --> 00:09:28,677
You still shouldn't have signed the lease
without even telling me.

131
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:30,001
Sorry.

132
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,937
What can I do when it's already signed?

133
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,900
But why are you packing already?

134
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:42,035
You need to put this place on the market,
and I'm sure it'll take a while.

135
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:43,400
It's already sold.

136
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,502
Housing is in high demand these days.

137
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:48,238
When are you moving then?

138
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:52,043
-The day after tomorrow.
-Hey!

139
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:55,972
-My gosh.
-Is someone pointing a gun at you?

140
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,461
What's with the rush?

141
00:09:57,544 --> 00:09:59,901
It just happened that way.

142
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,265
Unbelievable.

143
00:10:02,423 --> 00:10:07,096
I'll be so bored here without you.

144
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:10,653
We've never been apart
since middle school.

145
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:11,935
I know.

146
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,552
Mi-seon.

147
00:10:20,372 --> 00:10:21,530
Take this.

148
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,011
This…

149
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:26,988
It'll look good on you
since you're slender and all.

150
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:31,703
Forget it! Do you think
I care about this stupid dress right now?

151
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:33,191
Just don't go. Stay here!

152
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:37,038
Why are you being like that?
You're making it hard for me to leave.

153
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:40,884
Don't leave. Just don't go.

154
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:44,151
-Are you crying?
-I'm not.

155
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:54,737
Come on. You're making me feel so bad.

156
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:04,580
Just so you know,
I hate this dress so much.

157
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:08,716
Give me that one instead. The nice one.

158
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,783
That one's too expensive.

159
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:13,224
-Cheapskate.
-Just try it on.

160
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,739
-Forget it.
-Darn it.

161
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,461
Just go. Go away to Gongjin.

162
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:52,428
-I'm good.
-You're doing great today.

163
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,041
MR. YU EXPRESS

164
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:56,687
What's going on?

165
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,086
-What is it?
-Hey.

166
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:01,196
What's up? Is there a party somewhere?

167
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:02,726
Hey, Chun-jae.

168
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:06,282
It's not Chun-jae.
I told you to address me as Oh Yoon.

169
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:09,301
-Not according to your birth certificate.
-It's Oh Yoon, damn it.

170
00:12:09,384 --> 00:12:11,245
Fine. Oh Yoon.

171
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:14,263
Someone's moving into Ms. Yeo's house.

172
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:16,414
It's a young lady who's a dentist.

173
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:21,418
Wait. Was she really a dentist?

174
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,403
That girl's actually a dentist?

175
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:24,354
Do you know her?

176
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:26,215
Not personally.

177
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:28,076
You can say there's a debt between us.

178
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,433
A debt? What's that about?

179
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,866
She didn't seem to be dexterous,
so I'm kind of worried.

180
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:36,554
Why are you all shyly watching from afar?

181
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:37,546
Hello, Ms. Yeo.

182
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,110
-I see you're here to play landlady.
-She's not looking.

183
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:42,922
-She always ignores me.
-That goes in the living room.

184
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:43,915
Doctor.

185
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:45,570
Hello.

186
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,422
You didn't have to come.

187
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:51,070
How can I not when you're moving in today?

188
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:53,427
I see you have a lot of stuff.

189
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,874
Yes.

190
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:59,547
They all live around here.

191
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,037
I see.

192
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:02,732
Remember me from the cafe?

193
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:05,958
They are your neighbors now,
so say hello as you come and go.

194
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,074
-Sure.
-Say hello.

195
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:08,439
Hello, everyone.

196
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,706
-Where does this go?
-Excuse me.

197
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:14,725
To the room… No, let me lead the way.

198
00:13:17,868 --> 00:13:20,969
Is she actually moving here?

199
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,207
She's pretty.

200
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:30,274
She resembles me in some ways.

201
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,050
Hey, Dad.

202
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,448
Yes, the move went smoothly.

203
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:43,466
I'm still so busy unpacking.

204
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,278
You can visit once the clinic opens.

205
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:49,091
Sure, and take care of yourself.

206
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,117
Bye.

207
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:27,013
-Why are you here at this hour?
-To verify your registration.

208
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:34,706
Are you worried
that I might have falsified my move?

209
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:38,634
What do you think of the wallpaper?
I chose one of the best ones.

210
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:41,198
Well, I guess it's not bad.

211
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:44,259
-So, what is it?
-I have a few things to tell you.

212
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,401
Recyclables are collected
every Wednesday at 9:00 a.m.

213
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,262
-At the end of the alley--
-Hold on.

214
00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:53,812
-Recyclables?
-Bring them to the end of the alley.

215
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:57,079
Boxes like these
should be taken out the day before.

216
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,237
Got it.

217
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:01,173
The combination
to the front door lock is 870724.

218
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:02,662
-So, 87…
-And 0724.

219
00:15:02,744 --> 00:15:04,399
Okay, 0724.

220
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:06,632
You can change it to whatever you want.

221
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:07,790
What's this number?

222
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:09,196
My birthday.

223
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:12,422
Why is my lock combination your birthday?

224
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:15,605
Nothing came to mind,
so I used the combination to my door lock.

225
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:17,839
Why would you tell me that?

226
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:21,106
Whatever. I didn't hear it.
I already forgot.

227
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:22,265
I'll throw this away.

228
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:24,704
You need it if you want
to change the combination.

229
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:27,227
Really? You should've just said so.

230
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:33,306
-Are you 35, then?
-Yes.

231
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:36,532
You're a year older than me.

232
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:39,426
Was that a hint of affection I heard?

233
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,039
Don't you dare show me any.

234
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:45,423
Are you nuts? I just got goose bumps.

235
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:49,351
Same here. All right.
That's all I came to tell you.

236
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:50,427
Any questions?

237
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:53,321
Go ahead.

238
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:56,754
Where can I get
a decent cup of coffee around here?

239
00:15:57,788 --> 00:16:01,138
Taking a coffee to go is
how I start my workday.

240
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,123
There are a few near the harbor,

241
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:05,936
but that place is closest to your clinic.

242
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:07,176
Where's it?

243
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,582
The 4,000-won place.

244
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,609
No way.

245
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:15,364
Let bygones be bygones.
They're your neighbors now.

246
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:17,721
That's not it.

247
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:21,030
It's just that the coffee there is awful.

248
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:23,386
Give it another try.

249
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,199
And the renovation will take a while.
I'll let you know.

250
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,259
Sure. How long will it take, though?

251
00:16:29,342 --> 00:16:30,252
I'll call you.

252
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:32,030
It can't take too long.

253
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:35,835
He just left.

254
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:40,715
Recyclables, Wednesday.

255
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,768
Lock combination, 8707…

256
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,874
You heard a new dental clinic
will open up, right?

257
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,775
Who hasn't heard?

258
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,340
I saw the dentist move in the other day,

259
00:17:08,423 --> 00:17:11,856
and it's someone we all know!

260
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:16,280
It's the young lady
Chief Hong brought to the gutting deck.

261
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:17,603
-What?
-Are you sure?

262
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:20,085
Of course, I am!

263
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:23,021
So? What's so great about doctors?

264
00:17:23,103 --> 00:17:25,626
My son is an accountant in Seoul.

265
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,886
Not that again.
Everyone in Gongjin knows now.

266
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:33,773
This is great, though. You've been
having trouble with your teeth,

267
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:35,427
so visit there once it opens.

268
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,405
You think I'll spend my money
for my damn teeth

269
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:41,382
when I don't have many days to live?

270
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:44,402
Tell me about it. That implant thingy

271
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:47,214
costs as much as a car.

272
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:51,928
Come on. You know
eating well is most important.

273
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:56,891
Over there. There's that dentist.

274
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,421
-What?
-What?

275
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:00,489
Goodness.

276
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:03,259
Is she…

277
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:08,140
Did I see that right?
She's only wearing her long johns, right?

278
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:11,200
Is that what you saw too?

279
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:14,591
For a second, I thought my mind
was playing tricks on me.

280
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:18,271
My goodness. What has the world come to?

281
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:21,414
All of her skin was showing over here.

282
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:22,944
How embarrassing.

283
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:34,483
MODERN PHOTO STUDIO

284
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:44,035
I know a mischievous face when I see one.

285
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:17,947
Are the renovations over or not?

286
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,279
He did a good job.

287
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:55,952
It sure is nice.

288
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,468
-Chief Hong!
-What?

289
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,784
There he is.

290
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:14,520
Hey.

291
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:28,912
The <i>gamju</i> is sweet and refreshing.
Who made it?

292
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,856
Isn't it obvious? Du-sik, of course.

293
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:32,841
You know how to make it?

294
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:35,323
As if there's anything he can't do.

295
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:38,217
Apart from finding a wife, I mean.

296
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,499
You're absolutely right.

297
00:20:39,582 --> 00:20:42,394
How did the conversation
turn that way all of a sudden?

298
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:45,082
Chief Hong,

299
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,142
why is this suit out here?

300
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:49,921
I'm throwing it out.

301
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:52,733
Why throw away something perfectly fine?

302
00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:54,097
It looks expensive.

303
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:57,448
Maybe I should give it to my son-in-law.

304
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:02,782
Unbelievable. How can you give
your son-in-law a hand-me-down?

305
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:07,083
Hurry with the soap, will you?
I'm a very busy woman.

306
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,406
Okay. How many do you need?

307
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:10,433
-I'll take two.
-Two it is.

308
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:11,963
-Four for me.
-Noted.

309
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:13,824
-I'll take ten.
-Ten?

310
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,512
Ms. Mat-i, you're a big spender!

311
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:18,663
Nothing beats it
when it comes to rubbing off

312
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,440
the stench of squid and fish.

313
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:23,088
-Right.
-It's the absolute best.

314
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,528
Is that so? I appreciate
you saying that, ma'am.

315
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,422
I'll continue to sell it
at 500 won a piece.

316
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:30,573
That reminds me.

317
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:33,303
The young lady
you brought to the gutting deck

318
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:35,370
-is a dentist, correct?
-Yes.

319
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:38,719
My gosh. You won't believe what we saw.

320
00:21:38,803 --> 00:21:41,822
-How can she be that way?
-Why? Did something happen?

321
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:46,164
A while ago, we saw her running
along the walking trail.

322
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:48,893
Her outfit couldn't be more raunchy.

323
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:52,946
Her top barely covered her
while her pants clung to her body.

324
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:56,626
I could see her sheer bottom
which had me looking away!

325
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,928
How can one run around
wearing something like that?

326
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,458
-How embarrassing.
-Gosh.

327
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,435
I could even see her belly button.

328
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:09,033
That's just workout gear.
Many people wear that these days.

329
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:10,646
-What?
-What?

330
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:17,924
Grab your soap now.

331
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:21,026
It smells incredible
thanks to the tangerine peel.

332
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:23,383
Who will take this? Gosh, I dropped one.

333
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:27,063
This one got crushed.
I'll cut another piece for you.

334
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:29,917
Two for Ms. Gam-ri.

335
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,929
Ms. Suk-ja wanted four, right?

336
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:36,451
And ten for Ms. Mat-i. You're so generous.

337
00:22:36,534 --> 00:22:38,064
Why isn't anyone answering me?

338
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:42,944
Let's see.

339
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:50,016
Ms. Yeo?

340
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:52,580
Doctor. Hi, how are you?

341
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,178
Well, my goodness.

342
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:57,377
I'm still unpacking…

343
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,975
I love what you've done with the place.

344
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:03,001
It looks totally different.

345
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:07,219
Can I get you something to drink?

346
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,156
No, it's fine. I have to get going anyway.

347
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,355
I just came by

348
00:23:11,438 --> 00:23:16,401
to invite you to the party
for the elderly we're having tomorrow.

349
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,750
I see. A party for the elderly?

350
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,438
What do you say? Can you make it?

351
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:24,423
I'd have to check my schedule.

352
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,277
Please stop by even though you're busy.

353
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,097
Greet your neighbors properly

354
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,164
and promote the opening of your clinic.

355
00:23:31,992 --> 00:23:32,819
A promotion?

356
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,447
Here you go.

357
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,920
-Eat lots.
-Sure.

358
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,075
Let's just consider it
fixed and sunk costs.

359
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:07,474
-What are you standing there?
-Gosh.

360
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:09,129
I was about to join.

361
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,091
-What's with the camera?
-I'm here to take photos of the party.

362
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:15,166
By the hour?

363
00:24:15,248 --> 00:24:17,730
Unfortunately, this one's for free.

364
00:24:17,812 --> 00:24:20,749
Don't take my photos.
I value my portrait rights.

365
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:23,603
Don't worry. I have high standards
when it comes to my models.

366
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:29,269
Doctor, over here!

367
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:30,715
Yes, coming.

368
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,972
Welcome.

369
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:43,039
-Please have a seat.
-Hello.

370
00:24:44,487 --> 00:24:45,893
You remember us, don't you?

371
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:48,912
Yes, of course.
I was grateful for the other day.

372
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:51,063
-You're a dentist, right?
-Yes.

373
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:54,743
I opened a dental clinic
in the building up there.

374
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:57,389
Please come by if your teeth bother you.

375
00:24:57,473 --> 00:24:59,664
The world has changed
for the better, hasn't it?

376
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:02,270
Back then, we could barely make do,

377
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:04,544
so women rarely received higher education.

378
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:05,702
I see.

379
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:08,721
Anyway, enjoy the food.

380
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:12,153
From what I saw the other day,
you could use some food.

381
00:25:12,237 --> 00:25:15,462
Hold on a second. This piece of meat

382
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:19,432
wrapped in some of this kimchi…

383
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:22,823
Go ahead. It's really good, you know.

384
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:24,725
Open wide.

385
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:28,489
-Here you go.
-I…

386
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:30,019
There.

387
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:35,478
What… Why aren't you eating it?

388
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,635
Well, I…

389
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:39,820
I'll have it later.
I'm not hungry right now, so…

390
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:44,121
Is it because she used her hands?
They're clean, you know.

391
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:46,230
No, that's not it.

392
00:25:49,084 --> 00:25:51,482
Doctor, when did you get here?

393
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:52,847
Ms. Yeo.

394
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,742
Things were so hectic
that I didn't see you arrive.

395
00:25:56,527 --> 00:25:57,768
Hello.

396
00:25:57,851 --> 00:26:00,581
I saw you move in the other day.

397
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,433
I'm the owner of
Gongjin Korean-Chinese Restaurant.

398
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:05,957
-Hello.
-Right.

399
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:09,348
Goodness me. How have things been for you?

400
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:11,953
It turns out

401
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:16,502
you rented out the house and office space
that are in her name.

402
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:20,390
A good landlady should be in your cards,
but you ended up with a fussy one.

403
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,284
What are you spewing?

404
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:24,691
But I'm right.

405
00:26:24,773 --> 00:26:26,758
Everyone knows you're a fussy one.

406
00:26:28,743 --> 00:26:29,736
That's not true.

407
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:33,416
Doctor, I'm a friendly one, you know.

408
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:36,436
I gave you a discount on your deposit
since you leased two.

409
00:26:36,518 --> 00:26:39,537
Don't hesitate to let me know
if anything bothers you.

410
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:42,349
-Actually, there are a few things.
-Goodness.

411
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:45,161
Do tell. I'll get it sorted immediately.

412
00:26:45,244 --> 00:26:47,560
Is that so? Then could you

413
00:26:47,643 --> 00:26:49,710
change the utility room floor tiles?

414
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:51,489
Why? Are there any cracks?

415
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:54,425
Actually, there are some minor cracks

416
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:57,071
which don't seem pleasant to the eyes.

417
00:26:57,155 --> 00:27:00,380
-There's also a hole in the screen window.
-My gosh.

418
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:03,440
It's only as big as
a quarter of my pinky fingernail,

419
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:07,410
but mosquitoes and fruit flies
can still make it in

420
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,768
-which is a nuisance.
-Goodness.

421
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,456
-Also, you sell fish at your restaurant.
-Right.

422
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:15,847
Maybe you should consider
another way of grilling it.

423
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:19,569
The smell is quite overpowering, you see.

424
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:22,795
I'm particularly not fond
of fishy smells, so…

425
00:27:22,877 --> 00:27:23,869
She's not wrong.

426
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:28,998
Hi, I'm Bo-ra's mother,
the owner of the supermarket nearby.

427
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,072
Hello.

428
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:31,686
And this is my husband.

429
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:33,092
-Hello.
-Hi.

430
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:35,201
-I run the hardware store.
-I see.

431
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:38,923
-It's nice to have some youth in the town.
-Right.

432
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:41,321
You didn't buy anything
at the store the other day.

433
00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:43,224
-Really?
-Just come by anytime.

434
00:27:43,306 --> 00:27:48,187
Actually, it's because
I didn't find what I was looking for.

435
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:50,337
-What?
-What? What didn't we have?

436
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,612
We have more items
than any other place in town.

437
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:54,555
-She's right.
-It's a shampoo

438
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:56,292
from a high-end brand,

439
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,194
so I doubt the countryside has it.

440
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,179
Countryside?

441
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:02,372
I went by just in case, but I was right.

442
00:28:02,454 --> 00:28:04,067
Don't worry about it.

443
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,796
-I bought some online.
-I see.

444
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,567
-Honey, can you…
-Right.

445
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:10,560
Slow and steady.

446
00:28:10,642 --> 00:28:14,778
Did you manage to get an
internet connection all the way out here?

447
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:17,755
I should go change the way I grill fish.

448
00:28:18,748 --> 00:28:20,650
I should get going too.

449
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,007
Does the store not have certain items?

450
00:28:23,091 --> 00:28:24,165
We have the essentials.

451
00:28:24,992 --> 00:28:27,928
If your teeth ever bother you…

452
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:41,452
So you're really a dentist.

453
00:28:43,313 --> 00:28:44,429
Yes.

454
00:28:45,008 --> 00:28:45,877
My gosh.

455
00:28:46,662 --> 00:28:49,186
I shouldn't have gotten
the wrong idea about you.

456
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:51,749
I apologize.

457
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:55,678
Let's forget what happened, shall we?

458
00:28:55,761 --> 00:28:59,359
Let me properly introduce myself then.

459
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,633
<i>A sleepless moonlit night</i>

460
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:03,246
Right, you don't know the song.

461
00:29:04,032 --> 00:29:05,272
Anyway, I'm Oh Yoon.

462
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:07,919
A singer.

463
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:08,871
Hello.

464
00:29:12,675 --> 00:29:15,859
This happens to be my first studio album.

465
00:29:15,942 --> 00:29:18,217
Think of it as a welcoming gift.

466
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,788
-For me?
-Yes.

467
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:22,311
Thank you. It also has my autograph.

468
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,205
Thank you.

469
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,258
Did you enjoy enough food?

470
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:30,582
Yes, go ahead.

471
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:46,007
Ms. Yeo, I'll take a bowl
of <i>yukgaejang</i> too.

472
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:49,151
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

473
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:51,507
Does the smell of my grilled fish
disgust you?

474
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,079
-Of course not.
-Right?

475
00:29:53,864 --> 00:29:56,388
I always use fresh fish caught daily.

476
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:59,655
-Did someone say something?
-Forget it.

477
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:06,850
<i>Greetings. This is the village chief,
Chang Yeong-guk.</i>

478
00:30:07,346 --> 00:30:11,854
Today, a party for the elderly

479
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:15,824
is taking place at the town hall.

480
00:30:15,907 --> 00:30:18,801
<i>We're gathering to wish
our elders good health.</i>

481
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:22,524
<i>Meat and rice cakes
will be served as part of the feast,</i>

482
00:30:22,607 --> 00:30:26,577
<i>so please attend the party
if you haven't already</i>

483
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,761
<i>and make sure to get there
as soon as you can.</i>

484
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:35,055
Just so you know, I would've won
the number one song on <i>Top Ten Songs</i>

485
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:38,901
if I hadn't gone up against
Seo Taiji and Boys in 1993.

486
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:41,671
Do you know the song "Hayeoga"?

487
00:30:41,754 --> 00:30:43,201
-<i>To you, I'm--</i>
-That song I know.

488
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:45,062
See? Everyone knows "Hayeoga."

489
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,841
Do you know what Korea's number two

490
00:30:46,923 --> 00:30:48,371
-national treasure is?
-No.

491
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:50,728
The ten-story Stone Pagoda
at Wongaksa Temple Site.

492
00:30:50,811 --> 00:30:53,375
We all know what
the number one treasure is,

493
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:54,532
but not number two.

494
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:56,932
It's the same with you.
You know "Hayeoga,"

495
00:30:57,014 --> 00:30:59,041
but not "Exercising in the Moonlight."

496
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,439
No one ever remembers second place.

497
00:31:01,521 --> 00:31:03,630
Why am I so worked up about this?

498
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:05,905
It's not you I'm blaming.

499
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:10,248
Anyway, my second album
was well on its way.

500
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,778
I poured my soul into it.

501
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,011
I even recorded the title song,

502
00:31:14,094 --> 00:31:17,112
but my manager ran off
with all of the production funds.

503
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:21,248
And while I looked for him
everywhere throughout the country,

504
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,605
people forgot about me.

505
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:26,955
Since then, all I could do
was sing at nightclubs,

506
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:29,643
and I ended up settling here in Gongjin.

507
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:34,192
-I met a woman, you see.
-I need to use the restroom.

508
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:35,474
Yes, sure thing.

509
00:31:36,177 --> 00:31:37,997
I see you go to the restroom often.

510
00:31:39,445 --> 00:31:42,628
Ms. Dentist, why don't you come
have a bowl of <i>yukgaejang</i> too?

511
00:31:42,712 --> 00:31:45,648
-I'm good.
-Why not? Still on a diet?

512
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,922
That's not it.
I just don't have an appetite.

513
00:31:48,004 --> 00:31:49,494
But it smells incredible.

514
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:54,332
Are you aware of how much dust is here?

515
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:56,028
And there are so many people here.

516
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,915
Food cooked out here in the open
is just unsanitary.

517
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:03,306
Hold on a second.
Are you calling this soup dirty?

518
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:04,547
I'm just saying.

519
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:07,070
Spoken like a fussy Seoulite.

520
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:09,096
Must you be so picky?

521
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,487
Why can't you look the other way
and only see the good things?

522
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,769
What for?

523
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,457
Because you just moved here and--

524
00:32:17,863 --> 00:32:20,179
Hey, Mi-seon. Where are you?

525
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:24,356
<i>I'm out grocery shopping.</i>

526
00:32:24,438 --> 00:32:28,368
My boyfriend's been busy at work,
so we haven't been able to get together.

527
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,774
I thought I'd cook for him.

528
00:32:29,856 --> 00:32:31,635
Devoted, aren't you?

529
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:37,011
What's with the commotion?

530
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:40,650
This is Oh Yoon speaking. It's not
a true party without a song from me!

531
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:43,214
Geum-cheol, let's do this!

532
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:44,248
All right!

533
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:46,853
-Just a second.
-<i>When spring comes</i>

534
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:50,162
<i>You said you'd come to me</i>

535
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:54,876
<i>Like a singing swallow</i>

536
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,117
Geum-cheol!

537
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:00,831
A party for the elderly?
You really went there?

538
00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:03,478
I was hoping I could
promote my new clinic,

539
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,925
but I shouldn't have come.

540
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:07,200
<i>Why's that? It's not for you, is it?</i>

541
00:33:07,282 --> 00:33:08,772
You have no idea.

542
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,625
In a yard where dirt is kicked up,

543
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:13,775
they grill meat, boil soup, and sing.

544
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:17,001
On top of that, the old ladies
use their bare hands when eating.

545
00:33:17,084 --> 00:33:20,516
Gosh, it's like they're doing
everything you hate.

546
00:33:21,426 --> 00:33:22,667
Exactly.

547
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:25,727
<i>Looking up at the blue sky</i>

548
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,719
I'm reminded of you!

549
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:28,828
<i>I'm reminded of you</i>

550
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,442
Geum-cheol!

551
00:33:30,524 --> 00:33:32,427
<i>Just like a swallow</i>

552
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:34,907
<i>My heart flies to you</i>

553
00:33:34,991 --> 00:33:38,506
This is so annoying.
I shouldn't have come.

554
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,194
CANCEL

555
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,551
Hey, what the hell?

556
00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:44,874
-What?
-Darn it.

557
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:47,480
-Hey, who did that?
-It was getting good.

558
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:48,679
What's going on?

559
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:53,311
<i>I don't like anything here.
Maybe I should've just stayed in Seoul.</i>

560
00:33:53,394 --> 00:33:54,262
-What?
-What?

561
00:33:54,344 --> 00:33:58,232
<i>There's this cafe owner here
who's apparently</i>

562
00:33:58,314 --> 00:33:59,886
<i>an obscure singer.</i>

563
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:01,747
<i>Do you know Oh Yoon?</i>

564
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,172
You don't know, right?

565
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:10,432
He keeps on talking about himself
when I didn't even ask.

566
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:14,650
<i>His second album was scrapped
after his manager took off with the money.</i>

567
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,338
<i>Isn't that an excuse though?</i>

568
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:22,094
<i>If he had the willpower or talent,
he would've made it one way or another.</i>

569
00:34:24,244 --> 00:34:26,064
-<i>I…</i>
-Don't. It's all right.

570
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,511
-<i>Living in the past</i>
-I'm good.

571
00:34:27,594 --> 00:34:29,207
<i>when one's present is in shambles?</i>

572
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,027
<i>That's only what cowards do.</i>

573
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,335
-<i>I feel bad though.</i>
-About what?

574
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:37,850
I feel bad for those
whose hopes are left behind in the past.

575
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:42,234
One's unfulfilled dreams
tend to hold a place in the heart.

576
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:48,354
<i>Anyway, I'm nearly at the cashier now.</i>

577
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:50,091
Right, bye.

578
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,845
Unbelievable.
How could you have left the mike on?

579
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:23,755
Turn it off!

580
00:35:23,837 --> 00:35:25,119
What?

581
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:26,195
Oh, gosh.

582
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,653
Chun-jae.

583
00:35:31,736 --> 00:35:33,514
-Chun-jae!
-Chun-jae!

584
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,356
Here you are. I looked everywhere for you.

585
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,334
Why did you have to… Damn it.

586
00:36:15,037 --> 00:36:17,932
You should take more photos.
Why are you here?

587
00:36:18,015 --> 00:36:19,586
I took enough.

588
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:24,880
Chun-jae, are you all right?

589
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:31,249
Don't take what she said to heart.
Consider it as ignorant babbling.

590
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:35,301
All she said is right though.

591
00:36:36,335 --> 00:36:38,526
My life is worthy of such an assessment.

592
00:36:39,105 --> 00:36:40,719
What are you talking about?

593
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:42,704
Regulars come by to hear your song,

594
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,978
and you have a daughter you love so much.

595
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:53,166
You know what?
Let's go someplace nice for a drink

596
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:55,399
and lighten our mood.

597
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:57,468
I need to make lunch for Ju-ri.

598
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:01,024
She didn't want to eat at the party today,

599
00:37:01,107 --> 00:37:02,678
which I scolded her for.

600
00:37:05,242 --> 00:37:06,772
Good thing she didn't come.

601
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:10,329
I'm off.

602
00:37:21,784 --> 00:37:22,694
DENTAL HYGIENIST WANTED

603
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:24,886
NEW DENTAL CLINIC IN GONGJIN
LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE

604
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:31,875
Me and my big mouth.

605
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:35,928
To hell with my business.
I should pack up.

606
00:37:47,507 --> 00:37:50,154
Delivery. Are you Yoon Hye-jin?

607
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:51,312
I am.

608
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:53,131
Can you sign here?

609
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:56,398
I didn't expect it to get here so soon
since it's an overseas delivery.

610
00:37:57,722 --> 00:37:59,252
That's how it usually is,

611
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:01,279
but this one's early.

612
00:38:01,361 --> 00:38:03,056
You really do everything around here.

613
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:08,764
What? Why are you staring at me like that?

614
00:38:09,343 --> 00:38:12,320
-You think you're better than everyone.
-What?

615
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:15,216
Being smart, you got good grades
and became a dentist.

616
00:38:15,298 --> 00:38:17,325
Your life must've been smooth.

617
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:21,377
Not always, of course,
but all you hit were simple speed bumps.

618
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,486
Getting over those small bumps,

619
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:26,133
you thought that willpower
could get you anywhere.

620
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:28,325
If this is about earlier, stop.

621
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:30,889
I shouldn't have to hear this from you.

622
00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:33,825
Why not? You freely judge
other people's lives,

623
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:35,893
but are offended
when you're being assessed?

624
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:40,359
Look here, doctor.
It seems like you're mistaken.

625
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:44,247
Life isn't so fair for all of us.

626
00:38:45,363 --> 00:38:48,133
Some spend their whole lives
on unpaved roads,

627
00:38:48,713 --> 00:38:52,517
while some run at full speed
only to reach the edge of a cliff.

628
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:54,378
Got that?

629
00:39:10,672 --> 00:39:12,492
What now? Do you have more to say?

630
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:17,703
Mi-seon?

631
00:39:21,755 --> 00:39:23,410
I took a cab here.

632
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:25,312
It cost me 200,000 won.

633
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,339
What's going on?

634
00:39:35,113 --> 00:39:36,271
Let's head inside.

635
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:37,967
Damn bastard.

636
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:43,715
So you went to his place with groceries,

637
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,610
and a woman with a two to eight parting

638
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:49,050
was there in his dress shirt?

639
00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:50,538
Yes.

640
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:54,095
Apparently, she came after landing.
She's a flight attendant.

641
00:39:54,178 --> 00:39:55,005
And?

642
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:59,347
Both she and I had no idea.

643
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:01,994
-That's when the bastard crawled in.
-And?

644
00:40:02,077 --> 00:40:04,599
We both took out items
from the grocery bag.

645
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:07,453
I wielded spring onions
while she swung the net of onions.

646
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:10,678
Wasn't there anything sharp?

647
00:40:10,762 --> 00:40:13,780
The spring onions were the sharpest item.

648
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,288
You're a true friend
who'd let me ruin my life completely.

649
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,638
Come on. We're going back to Seoul.

650
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,962
Sit back down.

651
00:40:23,044 --> 00:40:24,947
Why? We should go and kill that bastard.

652
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:28,833
Or did you already?

653
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:32,266
Enough with the crap
and take down that classified ad.

654
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,578
Board and lodging
and a ten percent raise. Okay?

655
00:40:43,928 --> 00:40:45,003
Deal?

656
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:46,533
Deal.

657
00:40:47,691 --> 00:40:49,511
Come here!

658
00:40:53,978 --> 00:40:55,094
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

659
00:40:55,176 --> 00:40:56,335
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

660
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:05,227
It's finally D-day.

661
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:07,046
Let's get off to a good start.

662
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:26,896
YOON DENTAL CLINIC OPENING EVENT

663
00:41:44,348 --> 00:41:47,243
I guess word didn't spread properly.

664
00:41:47,326 --> 00:41:51,710
What if I promote the clinic online?
I have 50,000 followers on social media.

665
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,984
BORA SUPERMARKET

666
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:56,134
-Hello.
-Hello.

667
00:42:03,826 --> 00:42:04,943
-Hello.
-Hello.

668
00:42:05,026 --> 00:42:07,093
Yun-gyeong, I'd like to buy some shampoo.

669
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:09,244
The one with the nice scent.

670
00:42:11,022 --> 00:42:12,014
Unbelievable.

671
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,256
What's going on?

672
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:20,699
Hey, did you do something wrong?

673
00:42:37,945 --> 00:42:38,978
What is it?

674
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:40,715
What?

675
00:42:46,174 --> 00:42:47,249
What's wrong?

676
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,599
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

677
00:42:50,682 --> 00:42:52,170
Why do you keep glancing at her?

678
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:55,685
It's nothing. The anchovies
are on the smaller side today.

679
00:42:55,768 --> 00:42:59,159
Well, they're supposed to be small.

680
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:00,813
-Right.
-They look delicious.

681
00:43:02,261 --> 00:43:03,667
Goodness.

682
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:05,610
Gosh!

683
00:43:06,314 --> 00:43:09,043
Seriously? And you're telling me this now?

684
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:12,270
If I had told you sooner,
you wouldn't have moved here.

685
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:14,998
You're not a friend, but a scam artist.

686
00:43:17,149 --> 00:43:21,037
What am I going to do?
The rumors must've spread.

687
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,916
Forget it.

688
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:29,017
Private clinics can't stay afloat
without the town's trust.

689
00:43:29,101 --> 00:43:31,665
Let's pack it up and head back to Seoul.

690
00:43:31,747 --> 00:43:33,319
How can I

691
00:43:34,353 --> 00:43:35,676
when I spent a fortune here?

692
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:38,281
Don't think of it like that.
Cut your losses now,

693
00:43:38,364 --> 00:43:42,334
or you'll spend months being in the red.

694
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,071
Like my dad.

695
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:48,703
Hey!

696
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:50,605
Where are you going?

697
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,466
Where is she going?

698
00:44:22,366 --> 00:44:23,896
Out for some moonlight jogging?

699
00:44:28,363 --> 00:44:31,051
You must be angry
about what I said that day.

700
00:44:32,994 --> 00:44:33,987
By the way,

701
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:37,833
how about you run
in a different outfit next time?

702
00:44:40,273 --> 00:44:42,258
-What?
-Rumor has it

703
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,491
that the dentist
runs around in her long johns.

704
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:47,551
These are leggings.

705
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:50,818
Whether I wear long johns or a bikini
is none of their business.

706
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:54,747
Yes, you're right. But I'd appreciate
you meeting them halfway.

707
00:44:55,822 --> 00:44:58,055
I see you've yet
to catch up with the world.

708
00:44:58,138 --> 00:44:59,999
Meddling can be dangerous, you know.

709
00:45:00,082 --> 00:45:04,176
I know that it's for a better workout
and not for other people to see.

710
00:45:04,259 --> 00:45:06,037
-But?
-This may sound old-fashioned,

711
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,346
but this isn't Seoul.
The town has an older population.

712
00:45:09,428 --> 00:45:10,668
It sure is exhausting.

713
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:14,019
Yet, you're the one
who chose to open a dental clinic here.

714
00:45:14,638 --> 00:45:16,831
Don't we all need some time to adjust?

715
00:45:18,154 --> 00:45:22,041
I've thought about it,
and all people make mistakes.

716
00:45:22,703 --> 00:45:25,971
Technically speaking, you didn't know
that the mic was turned on.

717
00:45:26,466 --> 00:45:28,907
We all badmouth others
at least once in our lives.

718
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:30,354
It'll be fine, so don't worry.

719
00:45:31,016 --> 00:45:35,068
Everyone in this town is probably busy
talking smack about you too.

720
00:45:36,392 --> 00:45:40,072
Now that things are even,
you can move forward from here.

721
00:45:41,147 --> 00:45:42,760
Did you hand out rice cakes?

722
00:45:45,696 --> 00:45:47,102
Unbelievable.

723
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:00,543
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

724
00:46:00,626 --> 00:46:01,618
Ms. Yeo.

725
00:46:03,479 --> 00:46:06,457
Hello. This is to celebrate
the opening of my clinic.

726
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:09,642
Right. I see you bought rice cakes.

727
00:46:09,724 --> 00:46:11,833
-Please have it while it's warm.
-Thank you.

728
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:17,375
Hello, I'm here from Yoon Dental Clinic.

729
00:46:17,457 --> 00:46:18,781
Please have some rice cakes.

730
00:46:21,013 --> 00:46:22,048
You can leave it here.

731
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:28,127
Have a good day.

732
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:30,525
Darn it. Why isn't this working?

733
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:31,973
BORA SUPERMARKET

734
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,131
Hello.

735
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,992
Have some rice cake.

736
00:46:35,074 --> 00:46:37,928
I'm being tested for
gestational diabetes tomorrow.

737
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,376
I see you can't have any.

738
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:42,395
Sorry about that.

739
00:46:42,477 --> 00:46:43,801
I'm sorry.

740
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:47,977
Hello.

741
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,452
Yoon Dental Clinic just opened.
I hope we get along.

742
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:04,230
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

743
00:47:20,854 --> 00:47:22,302
Hey, it's the dentist!

744
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:25,197
-Hello.
-Hello.

745
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,727
Hi, kids.

746
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:28,175
What are you up to?

747
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,592
What's this?

748
00:47:34,915 --> 00:47:36,197
Is it a hedgehog?

749
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,438
Yes.

750
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,472
No way.

751
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,330
You want me to take care of it?

752
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,464
Yes, we saved up our allowance to buy it,

753
00:47:51,127 --> 00:47:53,318
but my mom won't let me keep it.

754
00:47:53,401 --> 00:47:54,931
GONGJIN MARKET

755
00:47:55,014 --> 00:47:56,875
You can take it instead then.

756
00:47:57,537 --> 00:47:59,067
I was going to,

757
00:47:59,604 --> 00:48:01,672
but I haven't been able
to tell my mom yet.

758
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:05,228
He'll ask her once he wins a prize
at the math competition.

759
00:48:05,312 --> 00:48:06,428
Is that so?

760
00:48:07,048 --> 00:48:09,985
That'll be really hard.
Are you sure you can do it?

761
00:48:10,067 --> 00:48:12,094
He's super smart!

762
00:48:12,176 --> 00:48:14,120
He gets a perfect score all the time.

763
00:48:14,203 --> 00:48:15,857
Really?

764
00:48:20,323 --> 00:48:22,804
Still, I'm afraid I can't take this.

765
00:48:24,376 --> 00:48:28,140
Hey, why don't you ask
Chief Hong to look after it?

766
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:30,290
We already asked,

767
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,565
and he declined.

768
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:33,722
Why?

769
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:40,711
He acts all high and mighty
but declines a child's request?

770
00:48:42,201 --> 00:48:46,005
I'm sorry to say this,
but I can't look after it either.

771
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:48,610
Pets aren't really my thing,

772
00:48:49,272 --> 00:48:51,257
and providing for myself is tough enough.

773
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:55,020
Look for someone else to help, okay?
Again, I'm sorry.

774
00:48:55,971 --> 00:48:57,295
Enjoy your rice cake.

775
00:49:00,356 --> 00:49:03,250
See? I told you she wouldn't do it for us.

776
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:08,874
My mom said that
she's such a cold-hearted person.

777
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,818
Money sure is great.
You always get what you pay for.

778
00:49:22,315 --> 00:49:23,845
How was the facial?

779
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:24,837
Gosh.

780
00:49:26,409 --> 00:49:28,849
What's this? Is that a hedgehog?

781
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:30,627
Where did you get it?

782
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:33,687
Someone asked me
to take care of it for a few days.

783
00:49:34,184 --> 00:49:36,417
Who in this town would ask you?

784
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,676
Well, my first patient in Gongjin did.

785
00:49:40,759 --> 00:49:43,861
What do you mean?
We still have zero patients.

786
00:49:45,928 --> 00:49:46,921
Hey.

787
00:49:47,624 --> 00:49:49,195
What's with all this mail?

788
00:49:50,146 --> 00:49:53,000
How many charity organizations
do you support?

789
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:55,275
Jeez. It's not that many.

790
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:56,929
Not that many, my foot.

791
00:49:57,591 --> 00:49:59,410
Single mothers, low-income households,

792
00:49:59,492 --> 00:50:01,354
and schools in Africa.

793
00:50:01,437 --> 00:50:04,125
Shouldn't you be
tightening your belt instead?

794
00:50:04,207 --> 00:50:06,606
Until we get patients,
cut back on monthly donations.

795
00:50:06,689 --> 00:50:08,301
Look at it run.

796
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,410
Just look at it go.

797
00:50:11,403 --> 00:50:13,553
-There you go.
-Unbelievable.

798
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:16,159
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

799
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:19,178
REGULAR PERFORMANCE CANCELED

800
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:22,404
Chun-jae, has today's performance
been canceled?

801
00:50:22,983 --> 00:50:25,216
Yes, I'm not feeling all that good.

802
00:50:25,298 --> 00:50:26,456
What, how bad is it?

803
00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:29,268
What? My head is a bit…

804
00:50:30,468 --> 00:50:34,810
Customers never seem
to finish their coffee. What a waste.

805
00:50:34,893 --> 00:50:37,250
-That's because it's no good.
-What?

806
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,814
Your coffee tastes awful.
Uncle Du-sik's is good though.

807
00:50:39,896 --> 00:50:41,717
-It's really bad.
-Ju-ri, stop.

808
00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:43,123
-What? It's true.
-Right?

809
00:50:44,529 --> 00:50:45,852
I don't do anything right.

810
00:50:51,683 --> 00:50:54,288
Ju-ri, I know you've hit puberty
and want to rebel

811
00:50:54,371 --> 00:50:55,984
-every three seconds.
-Puberty?

812
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:59,044
But don't be so mean to your father.
You'll regret it later.

813
00:50:59,127 --> 00:51:00,823
-You smell like a geezer.
-What?

814
00:51:00,905 --> 00:51:02,187
-You stink.
-I don't.

815
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,345
You do.

816
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:07,315
I only say this
because I'm the slightest bit wiser.

817
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:11,203
-And I sound like an adult, not a geezer.
-"Adult."

818
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:14,924
-Don't be crooked like your eyebrows.
-Wait. Do my eyebrows look weird?

819
00:51:15,008 --> 00:51:16,124
That can't be.

820
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:19,102
Gosh. They look perfectly fine!

821
00:51:19,184 --> 00:51:21,418
I sure did a good job on them.

822
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:28,737
Jeez.

823
00:51:43,294 --> 00:51:44,742
<i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>
OH YOON

824
00:51:44,825 --> 00:51:46,934
DEMO OF <i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>,
OH YOON'S 2ND ALBUM

825
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,844
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

826
00:51:58,926 --> 00:52:02,152
WEEKDAYS 9:00 TO 18:00
SATURDAYS 9:00 TO 12:00

827
00:52:02,235 --> 00:52:04,179
I hope we get patients today.

828
00:52:04,261 --> 00:52:07,238
We will. You handed out
the rice cakes, remember?

829
00:52:07,322 --> 00:52:08,231
The rice cakes?

830
00:52:15,593 --> 00:52:16,420
Welcome.

831
00:52:16,502 --> 00:52:17,826
Good day.

832
00:52:17,908 --> 00:52:18,984
What the hell?

833
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,484
You still don't get it.

834
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:26,014
Why are you on my case again?

835
00:52:26,096 --> 00:52:28,371
Because you're pathetic.
Do you really think

836
00:52:28,454 --> 00:52:30,439
that giving out rice cakes was enough?

837
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,887
I followed your advice.

838
00:52:33,086 --> 00:52:35,319
-It made no difference.
-Because it was insincere.

839
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,835
Didn't you reluctantly show your face
and ask them to come by some time?

840
00:52:38,917 --> 00:52:40,199
I can almost see it.

841
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:41,315
So what?

842
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:43,218
-Come with me.
-Where?

843
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,369
Would you rather let your business tank?

844
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:49,876
Are you nuts? Why would you bring me here?

845
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:53,433
Aren't you a resident too?
You should be at the neighborhood meeting.

846
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:54,963
You know what I mean.

847
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:57,361
-I can't go in there.
-Jeez.

848
00:52:58,106 --> 00:53:00,132
Will you just keep avoiding them then?

849
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:01,993
If you can't pick up spilt milk,

850
00:53:02,076 --> 00:53:04,846
you should at least
apologize to them for spilling the milk,

851
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,460
rather than avoid them.

852
00:53:07,824 --> 00:53:09,313
Go in already. I'm busy.

853
00:53:09,396 --> 00:53:10,595
Aren't you going in?

854
00:53:10,678 --> 00:53:12,539
No, I have other things to do.

855
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:13,449
Wait.

856
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:15,806
How can I possibly go in there alone?

857
00:53:15,888 --> 00:53:17,708
They're all strangers to me.

858
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:19,197
Are you leaning on me?

859
00:53:20,685 --> 00:53:22,670
-Of course not.
-Then get in there already.

860
00:53:22,753 --> 00:53:25,731
Don't even think about running.
I'll hunt you down.

861
00:53:28,047 --> 00:53:29,080
Are you leaning on me?

862
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,362
No.

863
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,623
Did she really think that
giving out the rice cakes would do?

864
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:47,277
I thought she was nice,

865
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,717
but she thinks my supermarket
is a corner shop

866
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:51,826
and calls Gongjin the countryside.

867
00:53:51,908 --> 00:53:55,838
She couldn't be more wrong.
This is an old town with a long history.

868
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,153
It has history and is on the bigger side.

869
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:00,800
Gongjin used to be home
to the Dragon King.

870
00:54:00,883 --> 00:54:03,116
But there she is running
while barely covered.

871
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,060
It must've angered the Dragon King.

872
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:06,135
Tell me about it.

873
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:09,195
And how dare she
look down on us like that?

874
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:10,932
It sure is upsetting.

875
00:54:12,172 --> 00:54:14,778
That's enough. Please drop it already.

876
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,722
What do you mean we should drop it?

877
00:54:16,805 --> 00:54:18,872
Aren't you just as pissed off?

878
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:21,974
When will you stop hitting people
while you talk?

879
00:54:22,057 --> 00:54:23,214
When did I do that?

880
00:54:23,297 --> 00:54:24,786
You did it just now.

881
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:26,481
Sitting next to you hurts.

882
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:30,203
Stop accusing me
of something I didn't do. My gosh.

883
00:54:30,287 --> 00:54:32,436
Chun-jae, you tell me. Did I do that?

884
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,967
Goodness.

885
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:37,772
Must you two get into it again?

886
00:54:38,433 --> 00:54:39,426
Gosh.

887
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:42,651
Hello, everyone.

888
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:43,685
-What?
-Huh?

889
00:54:43,769 --> 00:54:45,381
-Dr. Yoon!
-What?

890
00:54:45,464 --> 00:54:49,020
I never expected you
to attend the neighborhood meeting.

891
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:50,343
Tell me about it.

892
00:54:50,427 --> 00:54:53,404
I'm sorry about the town hall
not meeting your high standards.

893
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,224
Jeez.

894
00:54:56,175 --> 00:54:58,573
God, it's heavy. Move out of the way.

895
00:55:00,393 --> 00:55:02,874
-Gosh, this almost killed my back.
-What is it?

896
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:05,314
-I'm a little late, aren't I?
-Yes.

897
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:08,085
I went to bring today's snacks.

898
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:09,532
-Snacks?
-Yes.

899
00:55:09,615 --> 00:55:12,179
It's all Dr. Yoon's treat.

900
00:55:12,262 --> 00:55:13,213
-What?
-What?

901
00:55:13,295 --> 00:55:14,288
She asked for my help.

902
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:17,762
She was edgy because she just moved,
so she made a mistake.

903
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:20,450
She wanted to apologize
and asked me to prepare some food.

904
00:55:24,834 --> 00:55:29,093
Yun-gyeong, I bought these
from your store earlier

905
00:55:29,176 --> 00:55:30,789
-and left a receipt.
-Really?

906
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:32,029
Of course.

907
00:55:32,113 --> 00:55:34,717
Please take your pick then!

908
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:38,935
We have <i>yugwa</i> and <i>gangjeong</i>,
as well as fruits and beverages.

909
00:55:39,514 --> 00:55:40,880
For those with bad teeth,

910
00:55:42,534 --> 00:55:44,477
there are white and yellow peaches.

911
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,256
-Goodness.
-Yellow peaches?

912
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,523
-Don't just sit there. Help me.
-Of course.

913
00:55:49,605 --> 00:55:51,011
-Geum-cheol.
-Yes?

914
00:55:51,094 --> 00:55:52,417
Me? Okay.

915
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,865
Take this.

916
00:55:53,948 --> 00:55:55,933
-Take the box.
-Here you go.

917
00:55:56,015 --> 00:55:58,332
-It's fine. You can take a seat.
-Goodness.

918
00:55:58,414 --> 00:56:00,441
-Here.
-My gosh.

919
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:04,535
Here. Take the beverages.

920
00:56:04,617 --> 00:56:06,230
And this.

921
00:56:06,313 --> 00:56:08,381
-Also…
-She bought a lot.

922
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,723
<i>So that'll be the end of today's meeting.</i>

923
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:15,742
I hope you didn't forget about
the weekly cleaning this Saturday.

924
00:56:15,824 --> 00:56:16,693
-No.
-Of course not.

925
00:56:16,776 --> 00:56:18,512
Please bring your cleaning tools

926
00:56:18,596 --> 00:56:22,482
and gather at the recycling site
at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

927
00:56:22,566 --> 00:56:24,344
-Right.
-Got it.

928
00:56:24,427 --> 00:56:25,833
Before we wrap up,

929
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:31,167
let's give it up for Dr. Yoon who
provided the snacks for today's meeting.

930
00:56:31,251 --> 00:56:32,408
Right.

931
00:56:32,491 --> 00:56:34,021
It was nice.

932
00:56:34,806 --> 00:56:36,751
We enjoyed it.

933
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:38,115
Everything was good.

934
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,394
I enjoyed those snacks.

935
00:56:45,476 --> 00:56:46,841
-Bye.
-Good night.

936
00:56:46,924 --> 00:56:48,371
Good job for today.

937
00:56:48,454 --> 00:56:50,397
You too, Ms. Gam-ri.

938
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,258
-Get some rest then.
-Good night.

939
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:53,292
-Bye!
-Good night!

940
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:55,898
-Thanks for today.
-Chun-jae, get home safely.

941
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,056
-Good night.
-You too.

942
00:57:02,307 --> 00:57:04,955
Thank you for today.

943
00:57:06,153 --> 00:57:08,470
I didn't expect you to care so much.

944
00:57:13,929 --> 00:57:15,707
-Give me your hand.
-What?

945
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:17,444
Show me your hand.

946
00:57:17,526 --> 00:57:18,437
My hand?

947
00:57:41,512 --> 00:57:43,332
-What's this?
-Take a look.

948
00:57:48,915 --> 00:57:50,073
A total of 125,000 won?

949
00:57:50,156 --> 00:57:52,885
Before I knew it, I bought that much.

950
00:57:53,878 --> 00:57:55,780
You know where to wire the money, right?

951
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,709
So does this mean

952
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,133
you bought the snacks to help me,

953
00:58:05,126 --> 00:58:07,028
-but I have to pay?
-Of course.

954
00:58:07,111 --> 00:58:09,882
You're obviously richer,
so why should I pay?

955
00:58:09,964 --> 00:58:11,536
-You're telling me now?
-Why not?

956
00:58:12,446 --> 00:58:14,100
I didn't ask you to do this.

957
00:58:14,183 --> 00:58:16,375
You didn't even ask for my consent.

958
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,443
You should work on how to say thanks.

959
00:58:18,525 --> 00:58:22,124
Neighborhood meeting or whatnot,
don't invite me to events like this again.

960
00:58:23,074 --> 00:58:24,273
I won't let it slide.

961
00:58:24,357 --> 00:58:26,218
Wire it by the end of the day. Bye.

962
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,624
I warned you.

963
00:58:27,706 --> 00:58:28,864
Duly noted.

964
00:58:32,669 --> 00:58:33,992
What the hell?

965
00:58:35,274 --> 00:58:36,597
I'm not grateful anymore.

966
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:41,725
Hurry, guys.

967
00:58:41,808 --> 00:58:44,041
-Hurry over!
-Morning!

968
00:58:44,124 --> 00:58:46,895
-Morning.
-Hurry up. Just look at the time!

969
00:58:46,977 --> 00:58:48,797
-There they come.
-Hello.

970
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,741
Honey, I told you to stay home.

971
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:52,808
-Let's get this over with.
-Hello.

972
00:58:52,892 --> 00:58:55,249
Let's split into teams

973
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:59,136
and pick up the trash thoroughly.
We'll all contribute, okay?

974
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:02,031
Thank you, everyone.
Let's get started then.

975
00:59:11,087 --> 00:59:13,899
Goodness. I see you just got up.

976
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,050
Right. What is this about?

977
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:19,235
At the neighborhood meeting,
I mentioned the weekly cleaning.

978
00:59:19,317 --> 00:59:23,535
Everyone else showed up, but you didn't
until well over 9:00 a.m., so I came.

979
00:59:23,618 --> 00:59:24,942
Right.

980
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,912
Could I perhaps skip it this once?

981
00:59:28,994 --> 00:59:31,269
As you know, I just moved here.

982
00:59:31,351 --> 00:59:33,047
I'll participate starting next week.

983
00:59:33,626 --> 00:59:34,536
Sure thing.

984
00:59:34,618 --> 00:59:35,942
All right, then.

985
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:43,882
That's understandable.

986
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:50,540
Ms. Dentist, get out here.

987
00:59:52,029 --> 00:59:54,055
Get out here, Ms. Dentist!

988
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:55,296
He's so annoying.

989
00:59:57,322 --> 00:59:59,060
I know you're in there.

990
00:59:59,142 --> 01:00:00,837
I won't leave until you come out.

991
01:00:03,526 --> 01:00:04,518
Get out here!

992
01:00:05,428 --> 01:00:06,421
Ms. Dentist!

993
01:00:07,206 --> 01:00:08,943
Jeez.

994
01:00:09,027 --> 01:00:12,542
Out. Get out.

995
01:00:13,203 --> 01:00:16,056
Go, see what he wants!

996
01:00:29,435 --> 01:00:30,675
Chief Hong,

997
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:33,902
I feel a little under the weather.

998
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:36,756
Opening the clinic
must've taken a toll on me.

999
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:37,665
What?

1000
01:00:42,959 --> 01:00:44,033
I have a fever too.

1001
01:00:44,117 --> 01:00:47,135
Is that so? That's too bad.

1002
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:49,575
Let me see. Hold on.

1003
01:00:50,526 --> 01:00:51,518
Found it.

1004
01:00:51,602 --> 01:00:53,463
Here it is.

1005
01:00:54,703 --> 01:00:55,696
Here.

1006
01:00:59,128 --> 01:01:00,658
That's 36.3°C.

1007
01:01:01,651 --> 01:01:03,140
You're 0.2°C below average.

1008
01:01:03,223 --> 01:01:04,381
Well…

1009
01:01:05,455 --> 01:01:06,614
Maybe I run colder.

1010
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,020
Get out here now!

1011
01:01:09,054 --> 01:01:11,245
Just leave me alone!

1012
01:01:12,031 --> 01:01:13,851
I need my sleep.

1013
01:01:31,468 --> 01:01:32,543
Chun-jae.

1014
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:34,156
Help the ladies over there.

1015
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:37,051
Won't you sweep?

1016
01:01:37,134 --> 01:01:39,739
Can't you see that I am?
I'm not the only one out here.

1017
01:01:52,146 --> 01:01:54,296
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

1018
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:16,256
The clinic is open, right?

1019
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:19,688
Right, of course. Ms. Pyo?

1020
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:21,384
-It's your first time, right?
-Yes.

1021
01:02:21,466 --> 01:02:23,451
-Please fill out this form first.
-Sure.

1022
01:02:23,535 --> 01:02:24,775
-Right here.
-Got it.

1023
01:02:35,114 --> 01:02:36,272
-Here.
-Thank you.

1024
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:40,159
Mr. Choi Eun-cheol, shall we?

1025
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:41,275
Okay.

1026
01:02:46,155 --> 01:02:47,148
Hello.

1027
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,215
Hello.

1028
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:51,449
Hello. It's your first time, right?

1029
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,246
<i>I went there because you recommended it,
and it was nice.</i>

1030
01:02:57,445 --> 01:02:58,397
Really?

1031
01:02:58,479 --> 01:03:01,333
<i>The treatment didn't hurt
which shows her competence,</i>

1032
01:03:01,415 --> 01:03:03,028
<i>and the cost was reasonable.</i>

1033
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:05,303
I'm glad.

1034
01:03:05,964 --> 01:03:07,246
Anyway, thanks.

1035
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,528
See you.

1036
01:03:10,307 --> 01:03:11,548
-No customers?
-You're here.

1037
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,409
I'm sorry I had to step out.

1038
01:03:13,491 --> 01:03:15,724
Don't be. I'm paid to watch the cafe.

1039
01:03:15,807 --> 01:03:19,033
One might think I actually pay you a lot.

1040
01:03:19,116 --> 01:03:21,101
Why you won't accept a raise is beyond me.

1041
01:03:21,183 --> 01:03:22,631
I like things the way they are.

1042
01:03:22,713 --> 01:03:24,243
Aren't you going fishing today?

1043
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:25,856
I'm here, so get going.

1044
01:03:25,939 --> 01:03:27,138
After I'm done with this.

1045
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:29,785
By the way,
I uploaded a file on your computer.

1046
01:03:30,322 --> 01:03:32,225
A file? What kind of file?

1047
01:03:33,507 --> 01:03:35,823
Your second title song,
"The End and the Beginning."

1048
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,090
2ND ALBUM <i>THE END AND THE BEGINNING</i>

1049
01:03:39,173 --> 01:03:41,240
I didn't think it belonged in the trash.

1050
01:03:44,217 --> 01:03:45,417
Times have changed.

1051
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,932
It's been digitized, so you
don't need to listen to it on a tape.

1052
01:03:51,414 --> 01:03:53,936
How nice of you to care so much about me.

1053
01:03:55,384 --> 01:03:56,625
Thanks, Du-sik.

1054
01:03:59,809 --> 01:04:01,090
I'm good though.

1055
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:02,787
What?

1056
01:04:03,448 --> 01:04:06,343
I'm done reminiscing my past.

1057
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:09,858
I can't make it big
as a singer anymore at this age,

1058
01:04:09,941 --> 01:04:11,967
so I should focus on the present.

1059
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:15,524
I'm going to put my head on straight
and improve the cafe instead.

1060
01:04:15,606 --> 01:04:19,370
I need to put Ju-ri through fashion school
so that she can become a designer.

1061
01:04:25,118 --> 01:04:28,303
-Chun-jae.
-So can you teach me how to make coffee?

1062
01:04:28,385 --> 01:04:32,397
How can I run a cafe when I can't
even make a decent cup of it?

1063
01:04:32,479 --> 01:04:33,844
I guess that was bad.

1064
01:04:33,927 --> 01:04:34,795
I'm in.

1065
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,904
I won't go easy on you.

1066
01:04:36,987 --> 01:04:38,103
-Got it.
-Right.

1067
01:04:38,187 --> 01:04:40,006
-Get over here then.
-Right now?

1068
01:04:40,088 --> 01:04:42,694
Of course. I said I wouldn't
go easy on you.

1069
01:04:43,439 --> 01:04:44,721
-Gosh.
-Darn.

1070
01:04:44,803 --> 01:04:46,622
Even I don't drink the coffee I make.

1071
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:50,882
Thank you. Please have a good day.

1072
01:04:51,544 --> 01:04:52,867
Ms. Park In-sun?

1073
01:04:54,025 --> 01:04:55,183
Hello, sir.

1074
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,003
Is this your first time here?

1075
01:05:04,364 --> 01:05:06,183
You're almost done.

1076
01:05:08,168 --> 01:05:09,823
Suction, please.

1077
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:10,816
Okay.

<i>WALDEN</i> BY HENRY DAVID THOREAU

1079
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:28,805
WHAT I DESIRE ARE
THE FLOWERS AND FRUIT OF PEOPLE

1080
01:05:36,414 --> 01:05:40,757
Hye-jin, my gosh. What a day.
It was exhausting, wasn't it?

1081
01:05:40,839 --> 01:05:44,354
No, I was so happy
that I didn't feel tired at all.

1082
01:05:44,438 --> 01:05:46,960
This could be the beginning
of great success!

1083
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:49,814
Tell me about it.

1084
01:05:49,896 --> 01:05:54,156
It's odd though.
How did we get so many all of a sudden?

1085
01:05:54,238 --> 01:05:55,520
What?

1086
01:05:55,603 --> 01:05:58,746
Our situation changed literally overnight.

1087
01:06:00,276 --> 01:06:02,178
Did my social media pay off?

1088
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:09,002
Or maybe the bad rumors about you
have finally subsided.

1089
01:06:14,088 --> 01:06:16,942
<i>Life isn't so fair for all of us.</i>

1090
01:06:18,473 --> 01:06:21,285
<i>Some spend their whole lives
on unpaved roads,</i>

1091
01:06:21,864 --> 01:06:25,627
<i>while some run at full speed
only to reach the edge of a cliff.</i>

1092
01:06:28,563 --> 01:06:30,548
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

1093
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:38,323
I…

1094
01:06:39,606 --> 01:06:41,879
listened to the album you gave me.

1095
01:06:43,286 --> 01:06:44,279
Right.

1096
01:06:44,361 --> 01:06:45,767
To be honest though,

1097
01:06:46,264 --> 01:06:48,538
"Exercising in the Moonlight"
wasn't all that good.

1098
01:06:50,192 --> 01:06:51,185
I see.

1099
01:06:51,267 --> 01:06:52,632
But,

1100
01:06:52,715 --> 01:06:55,403
I did enjoy "Blue Scar on the Heart".

1101
01:06:57,719 --> 01:07:01,399
The melody was nice
and I could relate to the lyrics.

1102
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:03,177
I really liked it.

1103
01:07:07,355 --> 01:07:08,802
Oh, I see.

1104
01:07:09,463 --> 01:07:10,911
So that's more your style.

1105
01:07:12,565 --> 01:07:15,874
I'm truly sorry about
what I said that day.

1106
01:07:15,956 --> 01:07:20,753
That day? And what day would that be?

1107
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:28,445
Have you perhaps seen Chief Hong today?

1108
01:07:28,528 --> 01:07:30,927
You mean Du-sik? Well,

1109
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:33,615
he went out to the mudflats.

1110
01:07:33,698 --> 01:07:35,435
Would you be able to find it though?

1111
01:07:35,517 --> 01:07:39,074
-From Gongjin Harbor--
-Yes, I know where it is.

1112
01:07:39,157 --> 01:07:40,727
I see. It's where Turtle Rock is.

1113
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:43,168
Right. Well, enjoy your smoke.

1114
01:07:43,251 --> 01:07:45,070
Actually, I'm trying to quit.

1115
01:07:46,518 --> 01:07:48,668
-Thank you.
-Thanks to you too.

1116
01:07:53,548 --> 01:07:56,567
I really should quit.
A singer shouldn't smoke.

1120
01:09:17,665 --> 01:09:18,863
Chief Hong!

1121
01:09:22,544 --> 01:09:23,826
Fancy seeing you here.

1122
01:09:25,481 --> 01:09:28,127
Well, I had something to say.

1123
01:09:30,774 --> 01:09:31,890
Go ahead.

1124
01:09:32,883 --> 01:09:36,026
The clinic had a surge of patients today,

1125
01:09:36,109 --> 01:09:38,052
and I think I have you to thank.

1126
01:09:38,921 --> 01:09:41,072
I thought about
what you said the other day too.

1127
01:09:41,733 --> 01:09:44,379
I'm not saying you were right,

1128
01:09:44,463 --> 01:09:47,606
-but you have a point--
-I can't hear a thing!

1129
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:48,929
Can you come up here?

1130
01:09:50,128 --> 01:09:51,451
I don't think I can.

1131
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:55,918
Your shoes always cause trouble.

1132
01:10:04,148 --> 01:10:05,306
Here.

1133
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:08,531
Come on.

1134
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:01,011
Did I keep you waiting long?

1135
01:11:01,093 --> 01:11:05,312
Absolutely.
Did you catch a lot of fish today?

1136
01:11:05,932 --> 01:11:08,082
Well, there was a ton caught on the net.

1137
01:11:09,033 --> 01:11:10,936
Some of your favorite croaker too.

1138
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:14,782
Gosh, that's my favorite.

1139
01:11:15,444 --> 01:11:18,628
Why don't we grill some for dinner today?

1140
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:20,944
Sounds delicious!

1141
01:11:22,515 --> 01:11:26,320
Sir, if you don't mind,
could you take a photo of us?

1142
01:11:26,403 --> 01:11:28,305
I'm not good at things like this though.

1143
01:11:28,388 --> 01:11:32,069
It's quite easy.
Look into this lens and press the button.

1144
01:11:33,103 --> 01:11:35,212
-Let me give it a try.
-Thank you.

1145
01:11:35,294 --> 01:11:36,576
Go stand there.

1146
01:11:40,877 --> 01:11:43,400
Hye-jin, smile for the camera.

1147
01:11:43,482 --> 01:11:46,791
But Mom, you were sick just a while ago.

1148
01:11:46,873 --> 01:11:49,768
I'm fine. I'm not sick at all anymore.

1149
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,288
All right. One…

1150
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:00,686

01:12:07,592 --> 01:12:08,792

One, two, three.

1158
01:12:34,019 --> 01:12:37,286
Why don't we go to the photo studio
and take a photo too?

1159
01:12:37,368 --> 01:12:39,477
