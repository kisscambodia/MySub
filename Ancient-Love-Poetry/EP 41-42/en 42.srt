=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 42=

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,600
Master.

4
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,550
You are finally back.

5
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,470
Since the Purple Moon disappeared,

6
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,190
the demon realm has got in chaos.

7
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,510
The Demon King was incurably hurt.

8
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,000
It...

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,110
What happened
to the young Goddess?

10
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,080
Is Master Shanggu going to awaken?

11
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,470
Go get Fengran.

12
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,720
Let her come right now.

13
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,680
Yes.

14
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,830
Houchi.

15
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,830
Houchi.

16
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,680
Your child is gifted with God vein.

17
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,000
Your energy will be drained.

18
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,040
If he survives,

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,640
you’ll lose your Spiritual Strength.

20
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,470
I can feel he’s about to be born.

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,360
Promise me.

22
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,160
If I die,

23
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,590
you’ll keep this child for me.

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,720
No! I can’t, Houchi!

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,640
Please.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,720
You must keep this child for me.

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,640
He...

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,720
He’s innocent.

29
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,640
Okay.

30
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,880
I promise.

31
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,030
No matter what happens,

32
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,240
I’ll protect him well.

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,830
Houchi.

34
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,360
You’re the closest person to me.

35
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,190
No matter what,

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,280
I won’t let anything happen
to you and your baby.

37
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,940
♪He protects the Three Realms for her♪

38
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,820
♪Perseverance♪

39
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,260
♪It’s still echoing in ears♪

40
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,300

♪This love is boundless

42
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,590
Shanggu.

43
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,640
Master.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,950
Master, what can I do for you?

45
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,520
Please tell me.

46
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,390
Shanggu.

47
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,550
Shanggu.

48
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,190
Shanggu.

49
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,270
Leave.

50
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,360
Yes.

51
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:38,800
Sen Yu.

52
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,920
Is Demon God crazy?

53
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,520
Purple Moon is withdrawn.

54
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,150
How will our demons
fight against immortals?

55
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,960
The demon lords of Third Heaven

56
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,590
mostly rely on Purple Moon
for cultivation.

57
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,960
Let’s go back to see His Majesty.

58
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,470
Okay.

59
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,750
Soldiers, guard the camp!

60
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,240
Let’s go.

61
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,560
The two sides are holding peace talks.

62
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,400
Jingyang.

63
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,030
What do you mean by this?

64
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,840
Demon God attacked the Dome

65
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
and hurt True God Bai Jue.

66
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,680
I’m ordered to kill all of you.

67
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,520
Soldiers, listen to my order.

68
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,240
Eradicate the demon soldiers.

69
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,640
End it once and for all!

70
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,520
Aye!

71
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:46,710
Qin.

72
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,680
Sen Yu!

73
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,310
Qin.

74
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,520
Go!

75
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,800
Go back and tell Father

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,560
it’s Master Tianqi

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,990
who got us into this.

78
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,750
Go!

79
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,560
No!

80
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,400
Why?

81
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,990
Why didn’t you leave?

82
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,560
Without Purple Moon,

83
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,190
you can’t defeat him
even exploding your demon core.

84
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,080
The demon clan is behind me.

85
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,190
I must fight.

86
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,710
Okay.

87
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,030
We won’t leave.

88
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,080
Let’s fight them to the end.

89
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,560
Stop!

90
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,520
Brother.

91
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,960
I stroke the drum.

92
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,520
The demons didn’t invade
the Demon Region.

93
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,800
Sorry.

94
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,400
I did it to save someone.

95
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,710
Jingjian!

96
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,590
Are you out of your mind?

97
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,400
Are you helping the demons?

98
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,150
Brother.

99
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,270
Withdraw your troops.

100
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,800
Don’t push me.

101
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,310
Demon God attacked the Dome today.

102
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,990
There’s no turning back
for the two sides.

103
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,520
Eradicate the demons,

104
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,430
and the threat to our immortals.

105
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,560
Brother.

106
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,920
Don’t make another mistake.

107
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,680
Demons are also living creatures.

108
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,120
Why should they be eradicated?

109
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,080
Go away!

110
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,990
It’s Mother’s order.

111
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,680
But the peace talk is Father’s order.

112
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,640
You...!

113
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,800
You’re as soft-hearted

114
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,640
as Father.

115
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,520
Calm down, Your Highness.

116
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,030
If it weren’t for Muguang,

117
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,520
I should’ve caught both of them.

118
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,750
There are soldiers guarding outside.

119
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:24,990
If they find it...

120
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,310
Why do you fear while I fear nothing?

121
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,990
You said we must act with caution.

122
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,800
What... What’s wrong with me?

123
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,830
I can’t even control my demon power.

124
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,150
We’ve been a couple
for 60 thousand years.

125
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,880
I don’t wanna anger Muguang.

126
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,800
But I can’t bear with his temper.

127
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,760
He’s soft and indecisive,

128
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,390
claiming to be kindhearted.

129
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,680
With him,

130
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,950
how should I deal with the True Gods?

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,830
What if Tianqi takes advantage of it

132
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,880
and Bai Jue knows

133
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,270
Yuemi was harmed

134
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,440
because of me?

135
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,830
I meant to kill Tianqi and Houchi

136
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,470
on the wedding.

137
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,830
Unexpectedly,

138
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,920
Shanggu was revived.

139
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,390
What a miscalculation.

140
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,920
That said,

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,590
Tianqi’s strength hasn’t yet recovered.

142
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,760
Nor Houchi has awakened to be Shanggu.

143
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,120
The time has come.

144
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,240
I can’t miss such a good chance.

145
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,590
Fengnyu.

146
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,560
Your Highness.

147
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,760
But...

148
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,440
Just do as you were told.

149
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,510
I will bear the consequence.

150
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,320
If Heavenly Emperor blames...

151
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,560
As a matter of fact,

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,270
Yuemi’s death was just an accident.

153
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,390
Given a couple
of 60 thousand years,

154
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,510
Muguang won’t severely punish me.

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,630
Even if he knows
I’m descended to a demon,

156
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,830
I have a way to deal with it.

157
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,320
Yes.

158
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,440
Are you alright?

159
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,000
I’m fine.

160
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,240
Master Jingyuan has taken Houchi

161
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,000
back to Xuanjing Palace.

162
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,360
Master ordered me to take you to her.

163
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,680
What is it?

164
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,510
Master withdrew
the power of Purple Moon.

165
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,800
These people must mean no good.

166
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,000
You go inside first.

167
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,030
I’ll guard here.

168
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,140
(Purple Moon Spring)

169
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,270
Your hair!

170
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,800
What on earth happened in the Dome?

171
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,440
Gu Jun is dead.

172
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,150
Was it Wu Huan’s doing?

173
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,070
I’m going to kill her.

174
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,630
Fengran.

175
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,710
Come back.

176
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,270
Houchi just awakened to Shanggu.

177
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,950
But she’s too weak

178
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,390
to bear the power of
Original Being of Chaos.

179
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,390
And she just gave birth.

180
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,150
Now she needs your care.

181
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,120
Whose baby is it?

182
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,360
It’s Qingmu’s.

183
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,830
Be careful.

184
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,760
Your Highness.

185
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,030
You came back in time.

186
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,830
His Majesty...

187
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,320
He passed away.

188
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:07,950
Father.

189
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,920
I’m back.

190
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,270
Look at me!

191
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,630
Please talk to me!

192
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,240
Father.

193
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,680
You said you’d punish me

194
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,880
for my mistake.

195
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,240
Now I’m back.

196
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Please punish me! Please scold me!

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,200
Father!

198
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,070
Come back to me!

199
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,950
With that Demon God,
how could the demons not win?

200
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,920
His Majesty’s lifelong cultivation

201
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,270
was inseparable from the Purple Moon.

202
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,880
Demon God withdrew it.

203
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,270
So His Majesty’s power was all taken.

204
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,590
I should’ve repelled him.

205
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,200
Sen Yu.

206
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,590
Calm down.

207
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Whatever he has done,

208
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,270
he’s the foundation of the demons.

209
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,470
If we fight each other
at this time of crisis,

210
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,270
the immortals will attack us off-guard.

211
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,320
Chang Qin, you’re so cruel.

212
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,240
His Majesty sees you as his daughter.

213
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,390
Now he’s dead.

214
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,510
You even ignored the blood feud.

215
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,070
A disaster is imminent.

216
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,030
Are you still inciting him?

217
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,070
If you really mean it,

218
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,800
why don’t you try to help His Highness?

219
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,880
My father

220
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,070
ended up like this.

221
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,030
I can’t bear this.

222
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,150
Where are the elders of Xuanjing Palace?

223
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,120
Irritated by Demon King’s death,

224
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,560
they’ve gone to the Purple Moon Spring.

225
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,680
Sen Yu.

226
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,200
Are you going to kill Demon God?

227
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
As his son,

228
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,680
I must avenge my father.

229
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,120
As the young chief of the demons,

230
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,360
I must protect the demon clan.

231
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,760
If Demon God is dead,

232
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,680
no one else can protect the demon clan!

233
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,240
Sen Yu!

234
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
Sen Yu!

235
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,740
Sen Yu!

236
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:30,470
(Purple Moon Spring)

237
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,440
Everyone.

238
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
What do you mean by this?

239
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,510
Purple Moon Spring is
where the Master lives.

240
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,590
No trespassing.

241
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,320
If Demon God is guiltless,

242
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,000
why doesn’t he show himself?

243
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,440
He withdrew the Purple Moon

244
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,360
and ruined all our cultivation.

245
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,760
Shouldn’t he give us an explanation?

246
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,800
If not the Purple Moon,

247
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,440
you wouldn’t have had your cultivation.

248
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,390
Master took back what belongs to him.

249
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,880
What should he explain?

250
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,560
Leave now.

251
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,240
Or I’ll show no mercy.

252
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,240
Does it belong to him?

253
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,510
Zihan.

254
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,870
The demons did benefit from Jingyuan.

255
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,630
For 60 thousand years,

256
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,990
we’ve been against all beings for him.

257
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,110
The whole clan protects him alone.

258
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,960
As the Demon God,

259
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,720
shouldn’t he protect the demon clan?

260
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,150
But what did he do?

261
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,560
For his personal affair,

262
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,390
he withdrew the Purple Moon

263
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,560
and got the demon clan into this.

264
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,080
We follow his lead.

265
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,800
What about him?

266
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,480
What are we in his eyes?

267
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,390
A bunch of animals he keeps?

268
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,350
I’m warning you.

269
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,080
Get out of the way.

270
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,870
Your Highness.

271
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,350
Watch your tongue.

272
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,750
Watch my tongue?

273
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
My father has died in the palace.

274
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,390
That’s what he gains
for his loyalty of 60 thousand years.

275
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,750
You let me watch my tongue?

276
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,200
As his son,

277
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,390
I shall avenge him

278
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,150
or never be an immortal!

279
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,080
Demon King died?

280
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,270
Even if he lost power,

281
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,600
he could just be a mortal.

282
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,990
How could he die?

283
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,750
If Demon God can’t bring my father
back to life,

284
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,320
he’ll pay with his blood!

285
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,800
Sen Yu!

286
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,110
About Demon King,

287
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,440
I know you’re angry.

288
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,440
But don’t jump to conclusion.

289
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,200
Everyone.

290
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,990
Since Master is back,

291
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,320
he’ll try to recover your power.

292
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,990
For Demon King’s sake,

293
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
I won’t argue with you.

294
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,270
Leave now

295
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,510
and I’ll pretend nothing happened.

296
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,750
Your Highness, don’t believe him.

297
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,390
Demon God won’t care about our lives.

298
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,390
Purple Moon is in Demon God’s body.

299
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Kill him

300
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,800
and take back the Purple Moon.

301
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,680
Shut up!

302
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,870
Xiaoli!

303
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
Xiaoli! Xiaoli!

304
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,390
Demons, take my order!

305
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,680
Kill Demon God for the Purple Moon!

306
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,390
Houchi.

307
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,030
Houchi.

308
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,870
Look.

309
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,350
It’s a boy.

310
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,800
He’s so cute

311
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,750
and so small.

312
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,080
He takes after Qingmu.

313
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,320
Houchi.

314
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Give him a name.

315
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,600
His father has gone.

316
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,870
I’m dying soon.

317
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,750
I’ll name him

318
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,270
“Qi (abandonment)”.

319
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,200
Qi?

320
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,030
Qi.

321
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,440
Little one.

322
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,990
Your name is like
your uncle’s name Tianqi.

323
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,870
You’ll have the name Yuanqi.

324
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,350
Good name.

325
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,630
He’ll achieve something big.

326
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,800
Yuanqi.

327
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,600
I have nothing to give you.

328
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,680
In Qingchi Palace, there are some toys

329
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,990
your grandfather bought for me.

330
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,630
They’re all for boys.

331
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,390
You will like them.

332
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Now they are yours.

333
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,750
Your grandfather had a good eye.

334
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,560
You’ll certainly like them.

335
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,390
Houchi.

336
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,230
In the future,

337
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,440
if he asks about his parents,

338
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,480
please tell him

339
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,990
his father is North Sea Lord Qingmu,

340
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,390
a true hero

341
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,920
who curbed the violent
and assisted the weak,

342
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,440
upholding justice and love.

343
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,540
His mother Houchi

344
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,320
had a happy life,

345
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,630
was accompanied by good friends

346
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,200
and spoiled by her father and husband.

347
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,920
She led a carefree life.

348
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,870
Houchi, stop talking.

349
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,630
Take a rest

350
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,680
and you will be fine.

351
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,920
Yeah.

352
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,300
When he grows up,

353
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,360
tell him yourself.

354
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,200
Houchi.

355
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,110
You don’t have to comfort me.

356
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,560
True God Shanggu sacrificed herself

357
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,320
for the Three Realms.

358
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,870
Now

359
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,350
let me pay for her kindness instead.

360
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,870
If Chief Goddess Shanggu wakes up
and remembers me,

00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,150

I’ve wanted to go to him.

382
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,350
What do you think

383
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,870
the world would be

384
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,150
when the Spiritual Strength disappears?

385
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,350
I will

386
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,030
reunite with Qingmu, right?

387
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,110
I can certainly meet him again.

388
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,800
♪When we wake up♪

389
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,960
Houchi.

390
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,500
Houchi.

391
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:15,180
♪I’ll finally confess to you♪

392
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,720
Don’t forget it, everyone,

393
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,030
I’m a God.

394
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,630
You are not my match.

395
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,080
I won’t hurt you

396
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,630
for we are all demons.

397
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,030
You are a God.

398
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,630
How could you bear to see us suffer?

399
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,990
Your Highness.

400
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,560
God Zihan is blindly loyal.

401
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,600
He has no sympathy for us.

402
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,680
You fox!

403
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,030
Are you stirring up troubles?

404
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,560
Do you want me to beat you

405
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,630
to your true form?

406
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,750
Demon King’s death is fishy.

407
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,600
After this is ended,

408
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,150
I’ll look into you.

409
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,560
Calm down, everyone.

410
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,270
Don’t panic.

411
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,480
Before withdrawing the Purple Moon,
Master said

412
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,390
he’d give back your cultivation

413
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,840
that he had taken,

414
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,110
though it would take some time.

415
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,200
Some time?

416
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,030
How long will it be?

417
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,320
Yes. How long?

418
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,990
- How long?
- Make it clear!

419
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,390
A hundred years.

420
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,270
Just a hundred years.

421
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,560
I swear with
the Power of the Original Being.

422
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,680
Only a hundred years.

423
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,270
Is it true?

424
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,960
If your power isn’t recovered

425
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,750
in a hundred years,

426
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,080
you can come and confront me.

427
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,510
I will surrender myself

428
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,720
and never resist.

429
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,560
What about my father?

430
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,350
He owned the cultivation
of thousands of years.

431
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:40,840
Dream on!

432
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,030
Today you’ll all die!

433
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
Why bother a hundred years?

434
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,110
You again!

435
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,870
Are you done?

436
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,110
A low Lord

437
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,720
dares to be so rude in my realm!

438
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,320
Do you think no one can stop you?

439
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,110
Deicide Flower!

440
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,510
How did you get the demon’s item?

441
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,390
It’s toxic.

442
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,200
Protect yourself.

443
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,390
Fengran.

444
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,920
Take Houchi and Yuanqi

445
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,920
back to Qingchi Palace right now.

446
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,600
Activate the protection barrier
left by Gu Jun.

447
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,270
No matter what happens outside,

448
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,230
do not open the barrier.

449
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,560
Keep it in mind.

450
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,390
Why back to Qingchi Palace?

451
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,480
Isn’t this the safest place?

452
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,200
Not any more,

453
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,480
I guess.

454
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,990
When she wakes up,

455
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,750
she’ll be no longer Houchi

456
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,630
but Shanggu.

457
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,510
Will you look after her and protect her

458
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,320
as you did to Houchi?

459
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,840
Shanggu or Houchi,

460
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,870
she’s the same.

461
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,030
Master.

462
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,920
Master, where are you going?

463
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,110
Jingyang.

464
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,230
You rat

465
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,030
take advantage of this!

466
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:44,750
How shameless!

467
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,390
Don’t irritate him!

468
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:55,960
Xiaoli!

469
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:00,720
Are you alright?

470
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,080
Your Highness.

471
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,480
I won’t let you die.

472
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,560
Ignorant!

473
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,440
I’m gonna kill you all!

474
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:25,920
I have a way.

475
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,870
Don’t!

476
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,350
Xiaoli! Xiaoli!

477
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,990
Master, be careful!

478
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,270
Other than me, no one else

479
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,990
shall fail the demon clan!

480
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,630
Demon God.

481
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,750
When you attacked the Dome,

482
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,870
you should’ve thought of this.

483
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,110
As the Demon God,

484
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,030
your power is so weak.

485
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,560
My mother even gave me this.

486
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,350
Demon God is just average.

487
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,800
Bai Jue!

488
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,080
Aren’t you in a coma?

489
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,270
Brother.

490
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,960
Don’t be rude

491
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,270
to Master.

492
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,320
You dare to use the demon’s item.

493
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,110
Tie yourself up and go to Xuantian Hall.

494
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,960
Wait for your punishment
from your father.

495
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,320
Where is Houchi?

496
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,510
I’ll protect her.

497
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,110
None of your business.

498
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,150
You’d better protect her all your life.

499
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,920
She hurt True God.

500
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,320
She can’t pay the price
even if she dies.

501
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,600
Zihan.

502
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,680
Zihan.

503
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,230
I...

504
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,720
Master.

505
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,150
I’m deeply poisoned.

506
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,200
I won’t live long.

507
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,750
Don’t talk nonsense.

508
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,630
I have the divine power.

509
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,990
I can definitely save you!

510
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,960
Yes.

511
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,080
Master is powerful.

512
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,350
But Master,

513
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,800
Purple Moon is gone.

514
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,200
Sen Jian is dead.

515
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,680
I’m also dying.

516
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,510
Who will protect you in the future?

517
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,600
Master.

518
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,750
I privately made a decision for you,

519
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,230
to restore the demon clan
in a hundred years.

520
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,390
Please be sure to do it.

521
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,320
I... I don’t wanna be cursed by them.

522
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,030
I don’t want you to live in stigma.

523
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,030
Yes.

524
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,510
I promise.

525
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,110
I will never forget

526
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,270
your words.

527
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,750
I used to listen to you.

528
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,960
You can finally listen to me once.

529
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,630
Master.

530
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,680
In this world,

531
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,600
I envy you so much.

532
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,320
You live freely,

533
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,750
doing whatever you want to do.

534
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,230
It was Yuemi first. Now it’s you.

535
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,870
Zihan.

536
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,990
I promise.

537
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,990
From now on,

538
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,560
I will never be willful.

539
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,960
I promise.

540
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,440
Lord Fengran.

541
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,870
Where are you taking Houchi?

542
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,150
Fengnyu.

543
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,320
The time has changed.

544
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,630
Houchi has awakened
as the Chief Goddess Shanggu.

545
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,080
If you hurt her,

546
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,270
you’ll be guilty
of murdering the Goddess.

547
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,080
It’s unforgivable.

548
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,440
So what?

549
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,600
The God Realm is long gone.

550
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,750
The immortals will soon
eliminate the demons.

551
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,790
Bai Jue and my master
are paramount.

552
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,440
Without Bai Jue’s order,

553
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,440
she’s nothing but a commoner.

554
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:21,760
Soldiers.

555
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,680
Get them.

556
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,350
Get lost!

557
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,440
What are you doing here?

558
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,280
Don’t get me wrong.

559
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,550
Master Bai Jue

560
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,920
asked me to save you.

561
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,760
Did Bai Jue send you here?

562
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,240
What does he mean?

563
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,960
He harmed us.
Now is he helping us?

564
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,550
I don’t know the grudge between you.

565
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,350
Just be aware that

566
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,440
I’ll only serve Master Bai Jue

567
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,870
in the future.

568
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,280
You wicked manner

569
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,550
makes me sick.

570
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,920
I didn’t mean it

571
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,280
to offend Qingchi Palace before.

572
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,830
It was stirred up by that witch Wu Huan.

573
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,240
Please pardon me.

574
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,520
Don't lower yourself to my level.

575
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,550
Ungrateful

576
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,790
and vicious.

577
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,280
You are so mean,

578
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,240
having no principle at all.

579
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,830
I work for the most powerful person.

580
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,350
That’s exactly my principle.

581
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,200
No need.

582
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,830
I can do it.

583
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,520
Master.

584
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,830
Muguang.

585
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,960
From today on,

586
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,720
the demons will join the Dome.

587
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,480
I order you to recover

588
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,720
the demons’ strength in a century.

589
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,390
Any problem?

590
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,720
The demons are also living creatures.

591
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,520
It’s up to you, Master.

592
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,310
I wonder what Jingyang has done

593
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,830
that you let him kneel here.

594
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,000
He released the Deicide Flower

595
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,070
and slaughtered the demons.

596
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,720
Shouldn’t I punish him?

597
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,070
You bastard!

598
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,790
How did you get the Deicide Flower?

599
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,550
I have the doubt, too.

600
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,790
Heavenly Empress asked me
to give you this.

601
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,070
Your Highness.

602
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,480
She said it’s the Deicide Flower.

603
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,350
Its poison can kill God.

604
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,870
Isn’t Mother too careful?

605
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,000
We have Master Bai Jue.

606
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,550
Why bother doing this?

607
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,550
I don’t know.

608
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,830
She just let me tell you.

609
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,680
Do not open it

610
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,480
unless it’s necessary.

611
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,790
Father.

612
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,280
It’s not me.

613
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,310
It... It’s Mother...

614
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,280
Master.

615
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,520
My son is unruly.

616
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,390
He must’ve played
with the Deicide Flower

617
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,040
and made the mistake

618
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,390
when Wu Huan was out
of the Nether World.

619
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,960
I...

620
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,680
I didn’t teach him well.

621
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,070
Please spare his life.

622
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,680
Please spare his life, Master!

623
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,440
Really?

624
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,070
Jingyang is just a Lord.

625
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,070
How could he control the Deicide Flower?

626
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,550
Master.

627
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,070
For the sake that

628
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,040
he’s been guarding
the border for years,

629
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,440
please spare his life.

630
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,830
I’ll be lenient,
but he must be punished.

631
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,200
Yes. Yes.

632
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,790
Punish him with 20 thunder strikes

633
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,920
and 100-year detention.

634
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,720
You bastard!

635
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,310
Thank Master for sparing your life!

636
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,000
Master, thanks for sparing my life.

637
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,310
Only a truce of two sides

638
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,720
can bring peace to the world.

639
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,870
If anyone dares to attempt it again,

640
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,870
he shall not be spared.

641
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,760
Yes, Master.

642
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,480
How long will she sleep like this?

643
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,520
I don’t know.

644
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,070
Maybe one month.

645
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,550
Or a century.

646
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,550
It all

647
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,280
depends on herself.

648
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,960
Chang Que.

649
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,520
Is there any medicine to wake her up?

650
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,480
Sixty thousand years is
just a blink of an eye.

651
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,870
We could wait for a longer time.

652
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,870
Demon God.

653
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,920
What did Bai Jue mean by that?

654
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,040
He was so ruthless to Houchi

655
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,870
in the Dome.

656
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,720
Why did he save her today?

657
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,480
For Shanggu, maybe.

658
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,070
Today,

659
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,240
thank you

660
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,680
for covering me for my power loss.

661
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,630
I should thank you
for sparing my brother.

662
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
You should hate me.

663
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,040
I dare not.

664
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,870
I’d like to ask you a question.

665
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,680
Go ahead.

666
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,870
You don’t like me,

667
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,390
yet you agreed to marry me.

668
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,110
Is it to let Houchi give up

669
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,310
or for Master Shanggu?

670
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,590
You know I don’t like you.

671
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,960
Why do you stay here?

672
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,520
In terms of love,

673
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:08,000
I’ve given up hope for it.

674
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,550
Now I only

675
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,790
care about honor.

676
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,440
It’s best for me to stay in the Dome.

677
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,150
At least, in the eyes of others,

678
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,760
I’m still the closest person to you.

679
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,590
You’re now

680
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,040
frank and sincere, not pretentious.

681
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,720
At the wedding,

682
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,960
I’ve lost face.

683
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,280
Please have mercy on me.

684
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,000
Don’t expel me out of the Dome.

685
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,110
I hate

686
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,520
to be an ingrate.

687
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,110
As long as you behave,

688
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,070
you’ll have the honor as you wish.
