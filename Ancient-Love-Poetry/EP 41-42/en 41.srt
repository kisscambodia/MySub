00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 41=

3
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,950
Thank you for coming

4
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,060
for old times’ sake.

5
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,540
Just leave.

6
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,950
I won’t.

7
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,950
I’ll get you out.

8
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,750
No one can harm you.

9
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,140
Not even my mother!

10
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,540
Go now!

11
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,220
Being able to see you before I die,

12
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,220
I have no more regrets.

13
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,310
Fengran,

14
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,930
I found out who you are

15
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,260
back in the Parasol Forest.

16
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,820
I thought

17
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,100
as long as I stayed away from you,

18
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,930
you’d be safe from my mother.

19
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,540
But I was wrong.

20
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,260
I should’ve told everything to Father.

21
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,180
That way,

22
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,730
Mother wouldn’t do anything to you.

23
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,930
It was all my fault!

24
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,340
Fengran!

25
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,730
Go…

26
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,180
Fengran! Fengran!

27
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,100
Fengran!

28
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:02,930
Fengran!

29
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,180
Fengran!

30
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,980
Fengran!

31
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,060
I lied to you back in Dibei Town.

32
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,490
I love you,

33
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,730
and only you.

34
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,130
I already knew that.

35
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,490
Fengran,

36
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,650
could you give me one more chance?

37
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,820
Fengran! Fengran! Fengran!

38
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,420
Only a True God

39
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,050
deserves such a grand wedding.

40
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,170
It’s beyond splendid!

41
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,370
In the year 63421
of post ancient calendar,

42
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,740
on June 5th,

43
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,770
True God Bai Jue and
Princess Jingzhao are getting married.

44
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,860
Please welcome them.

45
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,650
Master,

46
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,300
this is our big day.

47
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,100
Aren’t you happy?

48
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,330
We both know the truth.

49
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,490
Why bother putting on a show?

50
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,650
Look, how beautiful that is!

51
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,330
What a perfect couple!

52
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,100
Get Houchi out.

53
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,610
You went there regardless.

54
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,610
Houchi.

55
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,700
Goddess Houchi!

56
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,540
Qingmu,

57
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,210
how could you marry her?

58
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:29,890
Have you forgotten about

59
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,890
our promise?

60
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,330
I’ll say this one more time.

61
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,020
I’m not Qingmu.

62
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,170
Liar!

63
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,890
These fireflies
recognize Qingmu’s scent.

64
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,100
His spiritual sense
must still be in your body.

65
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,540
Also, I know for a fact

66
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,490
that you still remember me.

67
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,450
I’ve learned everything.

68
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,100
That you and Boxuan...

69
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,610
Enough!

70
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,420
You can deny all you want,

71
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,980
but I know you’re him.

72
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,370
Nothing can change that.

73
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,580
I’ve made it clear

74
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,170
that no one

75
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,100
in the Three Realms

76
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,490
shall bring up
my previous identity again.

77
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,420
I’ve left

78
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,330
the past behind.

79
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,100
That’s not up to you.

80
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,540
Here’s something you should know.

81
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,700
I’m pregnant...

82
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,490
Goddess Houchi,

83
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,770
honestly,

84
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,540
what you had with Qingmu

85
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,100
is as weeny as those fireflies.

86
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,890
Life and death

87
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,740
are predestined.

88
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,770
You can’t change anything.

89
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,580
All I want to hear from you

90
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:56,980
is that Qingmu is still alive.

91
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:58,860
He didn’t die,

92
00:07:59,390 --> 00:07:59,890
did he?

93
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,540
He’s just become another man

94
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,170
who doesn’t

95
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:05,860
love me

96
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,170
but...

97
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,890
My Spiritual Strength
doesn’t belong to anyone else.

98
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,700
Stop pestering me!

99
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,210
You’re so eager to get rid of me

100
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,770
that you’re crushing the past
between Qingmu and me.

101
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,860
Is Master Shanggu
aware of what you’re doing?

102
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,140
So this is a True God.

103
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,820
All patronizing

104
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,330
and heartless.

105
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,540
Whatever.

106
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,890
Anyway,

107
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,180
I’m marrying Jingzhao.

108
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,100
You’d better leave

109
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,940
with dignity.

110
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,300
He doesn’t love you at all.

111
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,250
He’s using you.

112
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,890
Are you sure
that you’re going to marry him?

113
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:58,940
Houchi,

114
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,890
you’re jealous, aren’t you?

115
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Finally,

116
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,010
you’re tasting what I once tasted.

117
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,740
This time, I’m marrying my love

118
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,100
while you’re abandoned.

119
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,420
You love him?

120
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,380
Because he has Qingmu’s face

121
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,500
or he’s powerful?

122
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,450
Or neither?

123
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,180
You simply hate to lose,

124
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,690
especially

125
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,890
to someone you’ll never win.

126
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,100
How dare you!

127
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,250
That’s fierce!

128
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,210
I still think something is missing.

129
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,650
What is it?

130
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,680
Let me.

131
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,770
Qingmu.

132
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,320
Stop.

133
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,060
Master,

134
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,180
Houchi is disrespectful and impertinent.

135
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,010
Shouldn’t she be punished?

136
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,250
Do not push the envelope!

137
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,810
Why do you seem outraged?

138
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,300
Did I do anything unforgivable?

139
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,540
No one was as impartial as you

140
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,450
in the God Realm.

141
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,060
Father.

142
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,330
Sorry, I’m late.

143
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,620
Or none of this would’ve happened.

144
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,060
My daughter

145
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,060
is of noble birth.

146
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,860
What did she do wrong

147
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,330
that you tortured her like that?

148
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,330
That was far from torture.

149
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,450
Disrespecting a True God
is a capital crime.

150
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,810
Who are you

151
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,770
to interrupt me?

152
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,810
Enough, Gu Jun!

153
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,330
How dare you

154
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,770
sabotage Master’s wedding!

155
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,450
100 years ago,

156
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,570
Houchi and Qingmu were a couple.

157
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,500
But it seems

158
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,250
that my awakening

159
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,810
did set them apart.

160
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,810
So

161
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,740
what Houchi said and did just now

162
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,420
are understandable.

163
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,740
Take her back

164
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,300
and talk to her nicely.

165
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,380
Don’t let her come to me

166
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,380
because of Qingmu again.

167
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,740
Houchi,

168
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,450
Houchi,

169
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,060
let’s go home.

170
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,380
Since Qingmu has become part of you,

171
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,420
you should take care of
his unfinished business.

172
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:52,770
What is that?

173
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,650
Divorce me in public

174
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,540
in presence of the immortals.

175
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,860
In the name of Qingmu?

176
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,210
Do it,

177
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,450
or I won’t leave.

178
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,250
Then you and Jingzhao

179
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,210
can’t proceed with your wedding.

180
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,100
That’s...

181
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,450
Houchi,

182
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,940
Master has been lenient enough.

183
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,890
Don’t push it.

184
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,620
If there’s one thing

185
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,770
I learned from True God Shanggu

186
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,690
60,000 years ago,

187
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,100
that is,

188
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,860
justice must be upheld

189
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,980
in the world.

190
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,180
Master Bai Jue,

191
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,210
Houchi’s request is fair.

192
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,180
It’s only right to put an end

193
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,650
to everything between you two.

194

Houchi not only offended him,

227
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,180
but also the Heavenly Palace.

228
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,770
He’s tolerant enough

229
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,570
to forgive her

230
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,450
but the Heavenly Palace has rules

231
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,300
that can’t be disregarded.

232
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,500
Houchi must be severely punished.

233
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,620
Or if others follow suit,

234
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,810
how should we lead immortals

235
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,450
and discipline the lower realm?

236
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,770
The Heavenly Palace

237
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,060
is never my concern!

00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,940

Tianqi,

241
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,250
shouldn’t you be in the Demon Realm?

242
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,330
What are you doing here?

243
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,500
Bai Jue,

244
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,770
we’ve known each other
for hundreds of thousands of years.

245
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,690
How could I

246
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,500
skip your wedding?

247
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:13,930
Oh, and,

248
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,380
stop calling me Tianqi.

249
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,450
Right now,

250
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,780
my name is Jingyuan.

251
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,930
You haven’t regained your power.

252
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,290
You aren’t my match.

253
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,290
I’m not in the mood for a fight.

254
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,620
You’d better leave.

255
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,100
I will

256
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,500
after I stop your wedding.

257
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,210
Are you here to stop me?

258
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,410
Of course.

259
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,290
Cancel it,

260
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,810
and I won’t interfere

261
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,530
in any of your business again.

262
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,780
What if I don’t?

263
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,290
If not,

264
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,410
then you’re a liar

265
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,450
and a jerk.

266
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,410
Demon God,

267
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,330
you’ve helped Houchi

268
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,530
and the Qingchi Palace more than once.

269
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,660
Does that mean they’re indeed

270
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,260
in cahoots with you demons?

271
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,020
So what if we’re demons?

272
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,530
An immortal

273
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,260
with a rotten heart

274
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,860
is as filthy as dirt.

275
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,130
Wu Huan,

276
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,810
don’t forget how Yuemi died.

277
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,050
I’ll make you pay.

278
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,780
Just wait for it.

279
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,810
Demon God,

280
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,690
enough of your nonsense!

281
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,410
What is he talking about?

282
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,050
You don’t know?

283
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,900
Muguang,

284
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,780
don’t listen to him.

285
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,570
Bai Jue,

286
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,900
if Shanggu finds out

287
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,660
that you’re marrying Jingzhao

288
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,290
and betrayed Houchi,

289
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,410
she’ll never forgive you.

290
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,170
Why are you bringing her up?

291
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,260
She sacrificed herself

292
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,020
for the Three Realms 60,000 years ago.

293
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,260
You know she...

294
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:50,900
Tianqi,

295
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,660
zip it,

296
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
or I won’t be easy on you.

297
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,660
Bring it on.

298
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,100
I’m not afraid.

299
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,170
Enough is enough.

300
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,140
Just stop.

301
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,900
We have divorced.

302
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,020
I want nothing else from him.

303
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,380
Houchi,

304
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,210
you’re on top of the Three Realms.

305
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,900
You can’t afford to lose.

306
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,530
Purple Moon!

307
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,530
Half of the Power of the Original Being

308
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,140
has been used to make the Purple Moon

309
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,020
to support the Demon Realm.

310
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,450
Tianqi,

311
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,780
don’t you know that without it,

312
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,210
demon lords whose cultivation
depends on it

313
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:28,930
will suffer and die?

314
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,100
Tianqi!

315
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,780
(Something is happening in the Dome.)

316
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,880
(Your safety matters the most.
Stay away from my mother.)

317
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,020
(Go back to the Qingchi Palace.
Jingjian)

318
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,690
Houchi.

319
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,410
Mother won’t let them go

320
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,620
for the sake of the Heavenly Palace.

321
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,290
But going inside is of no help.

322
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,740
That’s the only way

323
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,020
to put a stop to it.

324
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,740
Immortals are beyond salvation.

325
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,290
I’ll fill in for Shanggu to be the judge

326
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,330
and execute them all.

327
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,900

328

333
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,690
in the Hidden Mountain when she knew

334
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,210
you woke up in Qingmu’s body?

335
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,210
She said Qingmu’s life and death,

336
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,330
love and hatred

337
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,170
were never up to someone else.

342
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,050

you selfishly

Demon God has barely regained his power.

553
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,860

554
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,420

555
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,100

557
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,220

your secret will be safe

559
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,970

560
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,180

562
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,140

564

Be honest with me.

566
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,490
Demon God brought up
my master Yuemi in front of you.

567
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,290
What exactly happened?

568
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,140
Demon God is a threat to the world.

569
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,660
You’d rather believe him than me?

570
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,770
We’re a couple.

571

00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,100
Gu Jun,

574
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,700
am I wrong about her all these years?

575
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,220
Master,

576
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:58,860
you’re finally back.

577
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,250
The loss of the Purple Moon

578
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:00,860
has left the Demon Realm in chaos.

579
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,010
Demon King is dying.

580
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,530
What...?

581
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:04,770
What happened to young Goddess?

582
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,810
Is Master Shanggu about to come back?

583
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,220
Go find Fengran

584
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,530
and take her here.

585
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,530
