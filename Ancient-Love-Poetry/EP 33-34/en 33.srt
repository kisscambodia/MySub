2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 33=

3
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,800
No matter why

4
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,630
Qingmu did so in the Demon Region today,

5
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,630
he

6
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,520
did help the Demons.

7
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,950
If you want me to believe

8
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,030
he’s still loyal,

9
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,990
he must return the Twin Spear
to the Heavenly Palace.

10
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,070
I’ll give you three days.

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,430
Fine.

12
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,880
It’s a deal.

13
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
No wonder you’ve been merciful
towards Houchi and Qingmu.

14
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,520
Turns out you still want
to reopen the God Realm.

15
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,510
Leave us.

16
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,230
What’s upsetting you, Your Highness?

17
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,840
I never expected that

18
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,790
though we’ve been a couple
for tens of thousands of years,

19
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,590
he joined hands with someone else

20
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,720
even without telling me.

21
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:44,920
Your Highness,

22
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,590
you want to...?

23
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,230
This has

24
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,200
just begun.

25
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,560
As long as Immortals and the Demons
don’t stop fighting,

26
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,950
when I cultivate myself in my own way,

27
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,480
I’ll sooner or later

28
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,590
tread every other immortal underfoot.

29
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Spare me, Your Highness!

30
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,590
Spare me, Your Highness!

31
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,150
You killed countless immortals.

32
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,280
Why should I spare you?

33
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,870
As long as you spare me,

34
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,790
I will

35
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,920
serve you faithfully!

36
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,120
Serve me?

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,310
You’re willing to betray the Demons?

38
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,720
I’ve lived tens of thousands of years,

39
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
cultivating myself
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

40
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,150
I don’t care about the fight
between the Immortals and the Demons.

41
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,200
If the Demon God hadn’t appeared,

42
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,390
I wouldn’t have been involved.

43
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,480
It’s wise of you.

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,840
God’s... God’s Mark?

45
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,280
It’s my mark.

46
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,590
If you serve me faithfully,

47
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,310
I’ll remove it.

48
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,840
Otherwise, when I want to destroy you,

49
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,000
you’ll be crushed

50
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,590
with nothing left.

51
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,000
I’ll certainly follow your lead

52
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,070
and never betray you, Your Highness!

53
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,190
Thank you, Your Highness.

54
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,230
All right.

55
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,280
Do something for me.

56
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,190
When you make it,

57
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,000
you’ll profit from it.

58
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,120
Yes, Your Highness.

59
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,380
(Qingchi Palace)

60
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,510
Your Grace.

61
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,270
Lady Fengran.

62
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,790
Are Houchi and Qingmu back?

63
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,350
For your information,

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,120
Her Grace and Lord Qingmu
haven’t come back yet.

65
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,280
Your Grace,

66
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,280
it took Qingmu lots of effort

67
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,070
to get your permission.

68
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,510
Why don’t you just let him and Houchi

69
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,760
spend some comfortable days?

70
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,510
Anyway, when you’re here,

71
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,280
the Heavenly Palace
can do nothing to us.

72
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,160
We’re in the wrong, after all.

73
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,470
If Qingmu doesn’t return the Twin Spear
in three days,

74
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,790
it won’t end up well.

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,120
I’m going to find them, then.

76
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,040
Your spiritual power
seemed to be unstable.

77
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,070
But now,

78
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,510
it’s back to normal?

79
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,950
It’s not only normal,

80
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,670
but also abundant.

81
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,720
Possibly because you have two weapons.

82
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,440
I’m glad you’re fine.

83
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,070
Where Boxuan stays

84
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,280
is the North Sea?

85
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,230
We came here before,

86
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,280
but why didn’t we feel him?

87
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,390
The four seas are linked.

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,560
Below the vast North Sea

89
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,840
are countless secret paths.

90
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,390
When I cultivated myself here
in the past thousand years,

91
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,120
I didn’t experience any of the paths.

92
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,840
Maybe it’s the reason.

93
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,840
Don’t get fooled by him.

94
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,600
Boxuan was right in his place,

95
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,070
but he didn’t know?

96
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,390
How is that possible?

97
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,760
Jingyuan?

98
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,840
Why are you here?

99
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,760
In case you’re fooled

100
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,070
by such a liar,

101
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,390
I’m here to protect you.

102
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,790
In the Demon Region,

103
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,790
you even failed
to defeat the Heavenly Empress.

104
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,630
I think you’re the one
who often cheats others.

105
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,670
Let’s go.

106
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,950
Small trick.

107
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,230
What?

108
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,120
They went to the North Sea?

109
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,840
We’re putting pressure on
the Qingchi Palace.

110
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,120
Why did they go to the North Sea,

111
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,910
instead of coming up with a solution?

112
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,160
I don’t know, either.

113
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,280
What should I do now?

114
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,160
Please tell me.

115
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,160
His Majesty has a three-day agreement
with Gu Jun.

116
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,670
In three days,

117
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,670
if the Twin Spear can’t be returned,

118
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,670
their crime of colluding
with the Demon God

119
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,950
and betraying the Immortals
will be confirmed.

120
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,470
No matter how hard
Gu Jun tries to explain then,

121
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,630
he can’t vindicate himself.

122
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,230
Do you know what you should do?

123
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,190
I’m willing to serve you, Your Highness.

124
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,790
But I don’t have
as much spiritual power as before.

125
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,880
There’s a thin spiritual aura
at the bottom of the North Sea

126
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,320
and they can hardly get more power.

127
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,560
But the Demon God is there with them

128
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,440
and Qingmu has just got two weapons.

129
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,160
I don’t think I can defeat them.

130
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,470
This power of God

131
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,070
will last for a couple of hours
in your body,

132
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,350
which can help you get the Twin Spear.

133
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

134
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,720
I have some power of God now,

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,070
but I’m all alone.

136
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,790
Without some good weapons,

137
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,560
I don’t think I can fight them.

138
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,590
Look at you.

139
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
If you hadn’t been so greedy,

140
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,640
you wouldn’t have ended up like this.

141
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,520
This is the Magic Dart
of the Eagle Clan.

142
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,270
It’s the best for a sneak attack.

143
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,230
To make extra certain,

144
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,910
I’m giving it to you.

145
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,710
Remember.

146
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,590
Your aim is to get back the Twin Spear.

147
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,830
Yes.

148
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,640
Don’t let anyone recognize you.

149
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,400
If anything goes wrong...

150
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,470
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

151
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,590
I understand.

152
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,520
Why is Boxuan in such a place?

153
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,710
A secret door is over there.

154
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,760
It’s made of ice?

155
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,640
It’s not ordinary ice.

156
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
It’s ancient ice

157
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,560
from the Shanggu Realm.

158
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,520
I don’t think we can break it
with ordinary spells.

159
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,760
Indeed.

160
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,350
Boxuan often used some spells

161
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,910
from the Shanggu Realm.

162
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,790
He must have left a clue
behind the door.

163
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,520
Let’s try to open the door.

164
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,230
Qingmu?

165
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,120
I don’t know why I could open it.

166
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,670
Maybe,

167
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,120
we’ll know

168
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,030
when we find Boxuan.

169
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,030
It’s Boxuan!

170
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,270
Houchi.

171
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
What kind of powerful immortal

172
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,150
could seal Boxuan in this place?

173
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,200
And you can’t unseal him
even when you work together.

174
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,760
No immortal could.

175
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,760
But some God or Goddess may.

176
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,030
What do you mean?

177
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,320
Try with your Taicang Spear.

178
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,320
Boxuan!

179
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:45,790
Qingmu!

180
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,570
No!

181
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,400
It’s going to collapse.

182
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,230
Let’s go!

183
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,790
Go.

184
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,830
Who dared to do this!

185
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,560
Come out immediately!

186
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,470
Octagon God-trapping Formation?

187
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,030
Tianqi, don’t underestimate him.

188
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,270
What did you call me?

189
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,120
Let’s try to get out of here.

190
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
There’s power of God in this formation.

191
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,000
Who’s doing this?

192
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,960
I knew it when I first saw
the formation.

193
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,350
But you just realized it?

194
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,910
I never like you.

195
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,440
But if today,

196
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,790
we’re killed by such an unknown nobody,

197
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,080
we’ll be a joke.

198
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,320
Why don’t we defeat him together?

199
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,150
What do you say, Demon God?

200
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,080
You don’t like me?

201
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,470
I don’t like you, either.

202
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,120
You’re just as stubborn as before.

203
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,590
You just need my help,

204
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,520
but you always deny it.

205
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,790
Three-head, how dare you!

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,760
It’s not me!

207
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,440
You get the wrong man!

208
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,150
Go!

209
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,030
Who’s breaking in?

210
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,680
Get out of my way.

211
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,540
Stop!

212
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:36,910
Fengran?

213
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,000
What brings you here?

214
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,640
Your Highness.

215
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,560
Lady Fengran is here for me.

216
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,590
Leave us.

217
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,560
Yes.

218
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,520
Jingjian,

219
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,470
why is there such dense evil force?

220
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,030
There’re always casualties

221
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,470
during every fight
between immortals and demons.

222
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,760
Evil force is generated, then.

223
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,640
I don’t know why,

224
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,470
but this time,
there’s far too much evil force.

225
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,560
Maybe because humans died, too.

226
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,910
I’m garrisoning this place

227
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,590
to release the souls

228
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,080
and purify the evil force.

229
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,910
I understand now.

230
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,830
Getting stuck in evil force

231
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,790
will bring the most harm
to the foundation.

232
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,230
You must be very careful.

233
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,270
You’re worried about me?

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,640
In your dream!

235
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,400
You put in a good word for Houchi
in the Heavenly Palace.

236
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,670
I’m caring about you in return.

237
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,350
Don’t worry.

238
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,520
I’ll take good care of myself

239
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,640
and won’t keep you worried.

240
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,880
Keep a safe distance from me,

241
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,350
or they’ll say you collude
with the Qingchi Palace

242
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,350
and the Demons.

243
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Fengran, I’m not scared of that.

244
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,670
Enough.

245
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,760
I’m... I’m here to ask you

246
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,670
if you know where Houchi is.

247
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,030
Houchi?

248
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,470
Isn’t she back to the Qingchi Palace?

249
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,470
When I was patrolling in Dibei Town
of the Human Realm,

250
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,270
I heard that she and Qingmu
had gone back.

251
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,270
They...

252
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,880
They would go to the North Sea before
getting back to the Qingchi Palace.

253
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,200
They should have arrived already.

254
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,030
The North Sea?

255
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,230
That man who just ran away

256
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,590
is the Three-head Fire Dragon?

257
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,230
Why was he ambushing in that place?

258
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,350
What a shameless dragon!

259
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,080
Shortly after he was taken away
by Wu Huan,

260
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,960
he got far stronger power

261
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,880
and came to snatch the Twin Spear.

262
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,520
He must be working
for the Heavenly Palace now.

263
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,790
Jingyuan,

264
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,270
why do you look so pale?

265
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,150
There’s a thin spiritual aura
at the bottom of the sea.

266
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,710
When I was forcibly enhancing my power,

267
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,350
I got my spiritual veins hurt.

268
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,670
I’ll be all right after a rest.

269
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,760
Houchi,

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,270
let’s get back to the Qingchi Palace

271
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,080
and tell God Gu Jun that

272
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,590
we found Boxuan
and met the Three-head Fire Dragon.

273
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,230
Then he’ll decide what to do.

274
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,640
Oh, my dear Houchi.

275
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,760
At last, I found you.

276
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,590
Why are you coming?

277
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,790
You have no idea.

278
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,880
The Heavenly Palace
and the Qingchi Palace

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,960
have fallen out
because you stopped the fight

280
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,710
between immortals and demons
in the Demon Region.

281
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,320
Why did you come to the North Sea?

282
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,440
Fengran,

283
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,640
we found Boxuan.

284
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,790
Congratulations, Your Highness.

285
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,320
With the Twin Spear,

286
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,710
you can restrain the Qingchi Palace.

287
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,560
You did a good job.

288
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,640
You deserve my thinking highly of you.

289
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,640
I’m flattered, Your Highness.

290
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,960
When Qingmu and Houchi
can’t return the Twin Spear

291
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,080
in three days,

292
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,830
their crime of colluding
with the Demon God will be confirmed.

293
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,150
Gu Jun always shields them.

294
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,520
He’ll certainly defend them.

295
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,790
When they lose the support,

296
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,640
they can hardly regain the old glory.

297
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,120
With such a little trick,

298
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,710
you’ll get rid of the Qingchi Palace!

299
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,520
Multiple benefits.

300
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,120
Enough.

301
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,000
The Dart is yours.

302
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,320
Thank you, Your Highness!

303
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,260
(Purple Moon Spring)

304
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,030
God Zihan,

305
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,640
it’s very serious
that the Heavenly Emperor has sent

306
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,800
more troops to the Demon Region.

307
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,440
I’d like to discuss it with Master.

308
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,520
No need.

309
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,520
Master ordered that
before he summoned you,

310
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,230
you could just command everything.

311
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,320
Has he not returned yet?

312
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,040
Master has been
in the Purple Moon Spring...

313
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,760
I don’t believe that.

314
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,830
Why are you keeping it secret?

315
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,070
Since the battle in the Demon Region,

316
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,800
Master hasn’t returned
to the Third Heaven.

317
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,120
Everything has changed
for the Immortals and the Demons.

318
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,680
Master needs to make a decision
for everything.

319
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,950
Where has he gone?

320
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,470
Sen Jian, how dare you!

321
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,710
How dare you ask about his whereabouts

322
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,590
and be insubordinate!

323
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,160
What?

324
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,120
I was away for only a few days

325
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,400
and you have forgotten
how to be a Demon King?

326
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,830
I’m sorry, Master.

327
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,230
Zihan, come with me.

328
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,680
Master!

329
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,680
- Master!
- Master!

330
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,590
Your spiritual veins got hurt!

331
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,400
Let me get you in.

332
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,340
(Qingchi Palace)

333
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,590
Your Grace!

334
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
Her Grace is back with Lord Boxuan.

335
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,950
Where are they?

336
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,800
In the Huajing Pond.

337
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,830
Houchi really found him?

338
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,760
Your Grace.

339
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,550
Your Grace.

340
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,160
Father.

341
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,760
You’re no longer mad at me?

342
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,680
You brought me up.

343
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,000
You’re my only father.

344
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,640
I got you wrong.

345
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,590
I’m sorry for that.

346
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,640
Please forgive me.

347
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,120
I’m glad you’re back.

348
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,230
Houchi,

349
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,920
when you were away in the Human Realm,

350
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,640
God Gu Jun cared
neither for food nor drink

351
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,550
and he kept talking about you.

352
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,680
He said he regretted it so much

353
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,920
and he should have told you the truth.

354
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,400
By the way,

355
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,760
how did you find Boxuan?

356
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,310
You said you found him
because of Qingmu’s dream.

357
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,400
That’s odd.

358
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,430
Your Grace,

359
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,000
please check on Boxuan.

360
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,590
For Master Shanggu,

361
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,830
you indeed suffered the pain
of tearing your Original Being.

362
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,540
Father.

363
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,160
Boxuan was hurt
during the thunder trail.

364
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
Now his spiritual sense is closed

365
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,400
and he’s in deep sleep.

366
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,070
When can he wake up?

367
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,120
Don’t worry.

368
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Boxuan has strong power.

369
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,830
After his sense is fixed,

370
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,190
he’ll wake up.

371
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,190
Just take good care of him.

372
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,880
Don’t worry, Father.

373
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,120
I’ll guard him carefully.

374
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,800
Qingmu,

375
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,350
come with me.

376
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,680
No one lived here for years.

377
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,350
It’s quite desolate.

378
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,000
Fengran,

379
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,120
go fetch some ornaments from my study.

380
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,760
Oh,

381
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,550
the eaglewood from the South Sea.

382
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,310
Remember to use it.

383
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,680
Boxuan likes to read with it.

384
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,550
By the way,

385
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,120
get some peach wine heated.

386
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,830
Boxuan likes drinking.

387
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,550
He used to drink some every day.

388
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:51,840
All right.

389
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,830
I’m on my way.

390
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,430
Did anyone else know

391
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,680
you found Boxuan,

392
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,350
except you two and Fengran?

393
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,590
With the help of the Demon God,

394
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,920
we managed to get him back

395
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,760
from the ice-bound cave

396
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,280
of the North Sea.

397
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,400
So,

398
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,550
he knew it, too.

399
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,160
Your Grace,

400
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,880
is there anything wrong?

401
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,550
The Demon God is cunning.

402
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,640
He even attempted to destroy the world.

403
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,680
He must have helped you

404
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,640
for some personal reason.

405
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,590
Regardless of the peace negotiation,

406
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,920
he started the war in the Demon Region.

407
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,350
We’ll certainly be blamed.

408
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,680
You’d better have less contact with him.

409
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,640
I understand.

410
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,830
Your Grace,

411
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,920
when I saw Boxuan,

412
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,430
I felt something strange.

413
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,590
What was it?

414
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,880
Felt like some Spiritual Strength

415
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
flew into my body.

416
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,000
Could he be...?

417
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,120
Your love with Houchi

418
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,590
kind of makes up for their regret.

419
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,520
You mean

420
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,590
True God Bai Jue also had deep love

421
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,310
for True God Shanggu?

422
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,800
The second part of what I told Houchi

423
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,350
is true.

424
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,160
After Boxuan’s sense is fixed,

425
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,640
he will wake up.

426
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,800
But when he wakes up, you’ll...

427
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,400
I don’t care how long I can live.

428
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,950
I’ll always love her until I die.

429
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,400
Don’t worry, God Gu Jun.

430
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,120
I’ll keep working on it.

431
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,000
But...

432
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,520
Will True God Bai Jue be nice to Houchi?

433
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,310
Love is so complicated.

434
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,070
I don’t understand it, either.

435
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,950
No matter what,

436
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,400
I never regret it.

437
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:45,950
All right.

438
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,640
So much for the personal affairs.

439
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,710
Let’s get to the business.

440
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,160
Give the Twin Spear to me.

441
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,000
I’ll return it to the Heavenly Palace.

442
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,950
Bad.

443
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,880
I knew it!

444
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,230
What happened?

445
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,520
Houchi,

446
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,920
aren’t you curious

447
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,830
what he looks like

448
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,000
behind the mask?

449
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,190
I am.

450
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,400
Then why don’t you open it
and have a look?

451
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,950
Anyway, he’s lying here,

452
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,400
without any ability to stop you.

453
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,800
Boxuan told me that

454
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,230
no one could see his face

455
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,160
unless he removed the mask himself.

456
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,190
He’s got such a brilliant spell?

457
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,230
Fengran,

458
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,550
think about what happened.

459
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Qingmu looked weird, didn’t he?

460
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,470
Was he jealous

461
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,350
because you cared so much about Boxuan?

462
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,430
He can’t be.

463
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,280
In the North Sea,

464
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,950
he called Jingyuan Tianqi.

465
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,280
Tianqi?

466
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,520
Isn’t it the name of the Demon God?

467
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,040
Three-head Fire Dragon?

468
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,800
The Twin Spear was stolen.

469
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,040
The Heavenly Empress could
confirm our crime

470
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,350
of colluding with the Demon God.

471
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,550
Exactly.

472
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,950
In the Demon Region,

473
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,470
immortals saw Houchi fight Jingyang.

474
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,950
You then repulsed Wu Huan
for the Demon God.

475
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,040
If we can’t return the Twin Spear
in three days,

476
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,800
all immortals will go against us.

477
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,190
I’ll go get it back.

478
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,760
It’s too late.

479
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,160
I’m afraid

480
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,160
Wu Huan has it now.

481
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,000
It’s my fault.

482
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,430
If it weren’t for me,

483
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,950
the Heavenly Palace
wouldn’t have pushed you.

484
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,350
Wrong.

485
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,310
It’s not your fault.

486
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,800
Wu Huan is domineering,

487
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,190
but she wouldn’t be my enemy

488
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,070
for such a small problem.

489
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,310
Why on earth

490
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,350
did she do that?

491
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,470
It’s also you who asked them
to collude with the Demon God?

492
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,120
You mean

493
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,310
you want to be an enemy
to the Heavenly Palace

494
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,760
and betray the Immortals?

495
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,710
Houchi absorbed the power
of the Pilgrimage Hall.

496
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,120
Even Muguang has suspected
her real identity.

497
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,640
Why did Wu Huan want to kill her,

498
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,550
instead of noticing who she might be?

499
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,160
Wu Huan,

500
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,120
how much of your loyalty
to Master Shanggu

501
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,710
can be true?

502
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,880
It’s the Demon God.

503
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,680
He killed my master.

504
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,880
Wu Huan witnessed that!

505
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,520
Please accept my condolences.

506
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,190
No one except Wu Huan saw

507
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,640
the Demon God kill Goddess Yuemi.

508
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,280
Even Master Bai Jue believed Wu Huan

509
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,680
and he...

510
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,280
Your Grace.

511
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,290
Your Grace?

512
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,830
What’s the matter?

513
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,070
Nothing.

514
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,040
Don’t worry.

515
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,920
No matter what Wu Huan is planning,

516
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,040
I won’t let her succeed again this time.

517
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,000
Houchi, are you all right?

518
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,000
Why is this happening?

519
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,350
Didn’t Father say

520
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,760
Boxuan’s spiritual sense was damaged
by the thunder strikes?

521
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,760
He looks like he’s lost all his power.

522
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,120
When he’s frozen all over,

523
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,190
I’m afraid he can’t come back to life.

524
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,120
Is there any way to save him?

525
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,190
Yes, but the only way is too hard.

526
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,000
Accumulated spiritual aura
generates treasures.

527
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,310
I hear

528
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,400
we can’t get back someone’s
spiritual power back,

529
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,760
unless we collect
the Ghost Suppressing Tower,

530
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,280
the Spirit Gathering Bead
and the Demon Gathering Streamer

531
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,550
and put his body in them.

532
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,040
Where are the treasures?

533
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,210
Fengran.

534
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,070
God Gu Jun has gone
to the Heavenly Palace.

535
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,920
It’s a serious thing
to collect the three treasures.

536
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,800
Shall we not decide until he comes back?

537
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,230
Did he say when he would come back?

538
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,710
I don’t think

539
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,000
Boxuan can hold that long.

540
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,070
The Spirit Gathering Bead is a treasure
of the Heavenly Palace.

541
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,950
The Demon Gathering Streamer controls
the beasts of the Demon Realm.

542
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,070
The Ghost Suppressing Tower
is suppressing the evil force

543
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,350
and guarding the Human Realm.

544
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,120
Let alone it’ll be a dangerous trip,

545
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,950
even if we get the three treasures,

546
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,760
we’ll immediately be enemies
of the Three Realms.

547
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,590
By then, how can your father

548
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,590
defend Qilian Mountains alone?

549
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,550
Houchi,

550
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,680
Qingmu is right.

551
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,830
When God Gu Jun is back,

552
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,280
let’s ask him for opinions.

553
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,550
Your Highness,

554
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,280
immortals and demons only have
put more soldiers in the Demon Region,

555
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,710
without having any fight.

556
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,880
Why?

557
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,000
If they fight,
the Human Realm will be damaged.

558
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,400
Father is so benevolent

559
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,760
that he doesn’t want
the Human Realm to suffer.

560
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,550
That’s why the demons are safe now.

561
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,680
If I commanded the war,

562
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,400
we would have destroyed
the Xuanjing Palace already.

563
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:20,830
Your Highness.

564
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,830
Your Highness, mind your words.

565
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,120
Gu Jun?

566
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,880
Why is he here?

567
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,710
I just came back
from inspecting the four seas

568
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,950
and I was told you came.

569
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,430
It’s not the deadline yet.

570
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,920
Did you come here

571
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,680
for some other issue?

572
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,920
Muguang,

573
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,640
do you remember what we promised

574
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,470
when we left the God Realm

575
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,520
sixty thousand years ago?

576
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,310
We promised that one day,

577
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,800
we would reopen the God Realm,

578
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,520
get back all Gods

579
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,280
and regain the old glory.

580
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,830
Over tens of thousands of years,

581
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,070
I’ve never forgotten our promise.

582
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,920
Otherwise,

583
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,430
I wouldn’t have asked you
to get back the weapons.

584
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,430
Did you really ask me to get them back

585
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,430
not for yourself?

586
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,590
Immortals and demons have fought
in the past sixty thousand years.

587
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,000
You didn’t mean to
unify the Three Realms,

588
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,070
but the Three Realms are in chaos
because of you.

589
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,070
Demons helped the Demon God
to destroy the world,

590
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,310
and my master died a miserable death.

591
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,800
I can’t let it go.

592
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,880
But the Demon God is still alive.

593
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,040
Have you thought about it?

594
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,590
Maybe Goddess Yuemi died

595
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,800
for some other reason.

596
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,350
Goddess Yuemi was very close
to the Four True Gods.

597
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,310
If Goddess Yuemi was really killed
by the Demon God,

598
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,190
why would True God Bai Jue

599
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,950
have spared his life back then?

600
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,950
And

601
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,120
was there anybody who witnessed

602
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
it was the Demon God
that killed Goddess Yuemi?

603
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,800
Wu Huan witnessed the kill.

604
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,070
As you said,

605
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,640
it was Wu Huan,

606
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,920
not you with your own eyes.

607
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,400
Gu Jun,

608
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,520
what do you mean by that?

609
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,520
You think Wu Huan lied?

610
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,550
In the unrest of the God Realm,

611
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,920
we didn’t have time
to check many details.

612
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,070
Wu Huan has been with you
for 60,000 years.

613
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,640
You should know what kind of person

614
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,470
she is better than I do.

615
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,230
You’ve never doubted even a little bit

616
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,640
about what happened
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp?

617
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,800
Now, the Demon God and Four Weapons
have appeared one by one.

618
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,520
We’ll reopen the God Realm
sooner or later.

619
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,430
But before that,

620
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,040
I hope you can find out the truth

621
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
so that you can console Goddess Yuemi

622
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,280
and other Gods of Stars

623
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,800
who died in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

624
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,430
I have to go to the Demon Region

625
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,830
to purify the grievances
generated from the battle.

626
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,190
Think carefully about it.

627
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,400
What?

628
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Gu Jun met your father secretly?

629
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:45,950
Mother,

630
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,400
it’s true.

631
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,550
I saw Gu Jun come alone.

632
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,920
I asked my men to check on it

633
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,190
and learned that Gu Jun had waited on
the Cloud Platform for the whole night.

634
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,230
Did you figure out

635
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,800
why he came?

636
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,590
The Cloud Platform was quiet.

637
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,280
The Attendant Immortals heard

638
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,310
Gu Jun and Father argue.

639
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,680
They kind of mentioned a name...
called Yuemi.

640
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,120
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

641
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,230
Qingmu can’t return the Twin Spear.

642
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,800
God Gu Jun must have come

643
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,310
to ask for mercy from His Majesty.

644
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,280
Can’t return the Twin Spear?

645
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,230
Did Qingmu

646
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,830
really give it to the Demon God?

647
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,160
If he could return it,

648
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,830
Gu Jun wouldn’t have argued
with your father.

649
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,760
I know

650
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,550
how to deal with the Qingchi Palace.

651
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,430
Just focus on the mission

652
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,830
your father assigned you.

653
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,710
Yes, Mother.

654
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,550
You’re just back from the battlefield.

655
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,400
You must be tried.

656
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,230
Go get a good rest.

657
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,310
I shouldn’t have said that.
I’m sorry, Your Highness.

658
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,070
Go get Three-head to me!

659
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,160
Yes.

660
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,950
Why did Gu Jun suddenly mention Yuemi

661
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,950
in front of Muguang?

662
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,190
Did he find out something?

663
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,400
When I couldn’t find Boxuan,

664
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,480
I thought there was hope

665
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,790
that he wasn’t in danger.

666
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,070
Now I’ve found him.

667
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,440
But he’s like this.

668
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,350
Unexpectedly,

669
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,590
it’s so complicated to save him.

670
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,350
Qingmu.

671
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,070
I don’t want you or Fengran
to be embarrassed.

672
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,200
Nor do I want the Qingchi Palace
to be a target for all.

673
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,200
But I really want to save Boxuan.

674
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,400
Houchi,

675
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,070
could you tell me about him?

676
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,990
How was he to you?

677
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,750
He was very nice to me.

678
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,030
Last time I saw him,

679
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,590
he was leaving the Qingchi Palace
to go through trials.

680
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,750
It’s such a lovely place!

681
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,990
I like it here!

682
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,270
If you like it,

683
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,920
I’ll bring you here again in the future.

684
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,440
10,000 years.

685
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,790
I promise

686
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,400
I will be back in 10,000 years.

687
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,590
And I will find you

688
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,550
no matter where you are.

689
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,720
After Boxuan’s sense is fixed,

690
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,120
he will wake up.

691
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,510
But when he wakes up, you’ll...

692
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,680
Qingmu,

693
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,720
if I insist on getting the treasures,

694
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,350
will you hate me?

695
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,480
Have you made up your mind?

696
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,510
I wouldn’t care if it were someone else.

697
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,960
But it’s Boxuan. I can’t watch him

698
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,270
die like this

699
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,790
and do nothing to save him.

700
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,680
All right.

701
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,880
Now that you’ve made up your mind,

702
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,960
I’ll help you get the three treasures.

703
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,510
But you must promise me something.

704
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,400
On this trip,

705
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
I’ll take full responsibility on my own.

706
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:13,990
All right.

707
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,510
I promise you.

708
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,680
What do you want to do?

709
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,440
I want to protect you

710
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,830
and the Qingchi Palace.

711
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,880
Please allow me

712
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,680
to do it my own way for the last time.

713
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,960
This is my father’s God-binding Spell.

714
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,990
It has his power of God on it.

715
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:55,990
You can’t remove it.

716
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,830
It’ll be invalid in one day.

717
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,240
Houchi,

718
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,510
you can’t go alone.

719
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,200
What shall I do if you’re in danger?

720
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,720
Remove it from me!

721
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,400
After I get the treasures,

722
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,830
I’ll come back immediately.

723
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,400
I’m wrong this time.

724
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:09,990
Take care.

725
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,120
Houchi!

726
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,440
Three-head,

727
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,550
did anything special happen

728
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,880
in the North Sea that day?

729
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
Please spare me, Your Highness.

730
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,310
The Demon God had such strong power.

731
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,790
I’m afraid he recognized me.

732
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,200
What?

733
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,790
How dared you not tell me!

734
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,510
You evil woman!

735
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,440
I won’t bear with you anymore!

736
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,400
I knew you were crafty.

737
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,590
You’re dead meat!

738
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,480
Your Highness! Your Highness!

739
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,790
I’ve got something else.

740
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,920
Please don’t kill me.

741
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,400
When I trapped them,

742
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,120
I heard Lord Qingmu

743
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,920
mention Boxuan to Houchi.

744
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,240
I didn’t know who Boxuan was,

745
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,920
but Qingmu asked Houchi
to take Boxuan and leave.

746
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,830
Boxuan?

747
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,400
Did they go to the North Sea

748
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
for this man Boxuan?

749
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,400
If this time,

750
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,440
you dare to fool me again...

751
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,790
I don’t dare to fool you, Your Highness!

752
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,270
I never dare!

753
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,680
Never.

754
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,270
Leave us.

755
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,990
Thank you, Your Highness!

756
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,400
Boxuan?

757
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,720
Does he have something to do

758
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,510
with the portrait at the bottom
of the Huajing Pond?

759
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,310
No.

760
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,750
I must have someone
keep an eye on the Qingchi Palace.

761
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,160
Or I’ll always be in a passive position.

762
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,880
As recorded in books,

763
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,510
the Ghost Suppressing Tower
came from the Shanggu Realm

764
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,160
and it can suppress all evil force.

765
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,510
(Imperial Mausoleum)
It’s in the Underground Palace.

766
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,200
It’s indeed the Ghost Suppressing Tower!

767
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,160
No one is allowed to get close
to the Ghost Suppressing Tower.

768
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,240
Who are you?

769
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,960
How dare you come to steal it!

770
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,200
Are you Lord Bi Xi guarding the Tower?

771
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,790
Now that you know me,

772
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,240
how dare you come to steal it!

773
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,400
You get me wrong.

774
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,750
I just want to borrow it
to save a friend.

775
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,510
I’ll return it after that.

776
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,550
All greedy men say the same thing.

777
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,120
The Ghost Suppressing Tower
can help with cultivation.

778
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
How will you return it
after you borrow it?

779
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,240
Now that you managed to break in,

780
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,400
you must have strong power.

781
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,680
For the sake that you’ve cultivated
yourself for thousands of years

782
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,030
and you have pure spiritual power,

783
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,720
I won’t kill you.

784
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,510
Leave immediately.

785
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,640
I must get the Tower today!

786
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,480
Sir, if you refuse to lend it to me,

787
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,990
don’t blame me for offending you.
