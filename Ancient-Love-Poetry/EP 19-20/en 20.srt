00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,400
Crispy on the outside
and soft on the inside.

4
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,610
It tastes best now.

5
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,240
Just now,

6
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,480
I was sorry.

7
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,320
I saw you activate your bracelet.

8
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,080
Is it the amulet from Boxuan?

9
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,730
You want to ask about him again?

10
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,410
I just want to figure out

11
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,640
who I really am.

12
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:12,730
You...

13
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,210
You’re North Sea Lord Qingmu,

14
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,690
the man Princess Jingzhao loves.

15
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,210
Everybody knows that.

16
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,120
In the name

17
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,120
North Sea Lord Qingmu,

18
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,960
the first three words were from
the Heavenly Emperor.

19
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,330
I named myself with the last word.

20
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,210
Except this,

21
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,960
I don’t even know as much as you do.

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,490
A thousand years ago,

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,850
I woke up in the North Sea

24
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,680
and didn’t remember who I was.

25
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,890
I had nothing with me,

26
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:46,970
but one bracelet.

27
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,530
Then I wandered
throughout the Three Realms,

28
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,040
trying to figure out who I was.

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,000
You and your bracelet

30
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,210
can be my only clue.

31
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,170
So, I want to go with you

32
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,210
and look for Lord Boxuan.

33
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,040
Maybe he knows who I am.

34
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,440
Thank you for helping me
at the Skyreach Pillar.

35
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,970
Also for helping me out

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,810
of the Barrier for Demons
and the Vine Demon.

37
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,360
Boxuan is from Qingchi Palace.

38
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,970
He treats me like his own sister.

39
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,290
Ten thousand years ago,

40
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,000
he said he would leave for experience
and go through the Tribulation.

41
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,680
Then he’s never come back.

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,170
I went to Mount Lookout to look for him.

43
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,440
But no one was living
in the bamboo house.

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Only this fan was left there.

45
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,920
Demon Lord Ziyue’s magic weapon?

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,640
So, you went to the Demon Realm
because you thought

47
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,050
Boxuan had something to do with Ziyue?

48
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,130
What?

49
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,690
You look like Boxuan in figure.

50
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,360
But you’re totally different in temper.

51
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Never heard of it.

52
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,250
Did Boxuan date a female lord
in Qingchi Palace

53
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,000
ten thousand years ago?

54
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,050
If you’re his son,

55
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,280
you should call me Aunt.

56
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,410
Maybe you’re his brother?

57
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,170
Or you’re someone close to him.

58
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,280
Boxuan never gave anyone anything
without a reason.

59
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,640
When I was young, I was too childish

60
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,810
that I only played with him

61
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,920
instead of asking about his identity.

62
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,690
If I had cared a bit more,

63
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,080
we would have some more clues now.

64
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:38,810
Houchi,

65
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,720
where’re you going?

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,330
I’m a Goddess in the Heavenly Realm.

67
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,050
Why do you think
you can call me by my name?

68
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,410
Who are you taking me to,
Goddess Houchi?

69
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,200
Taking you?

70
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,200
I’ve told you who Boxuan is.

71
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,560
If you want to see him,

72
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,330
go find him personally.

73
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,770
What about you?

74
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:56,770
Me?

75
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,890
What does it concern you?

76
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,530
I hate anyone
related to the Heavenly Palace.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,080
The Heavenly Emperor conferred it on me.

78
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
I’m not related with Heavenly Palace.

79
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,280
You made fun of me,

80
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,170
and also helped me.

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,170
I’ve told you all I know

82
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,200
about Boxuan.

83
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,890
We’re even.

Greetings, Heavenly Father.

106
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:43,920
There you are.

107
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
I summoned you,

108
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,600
because I want you to visit
the third heaven of the Demon Realm.

109
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,530
You mean...?

110
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,920
When many Gods fell,

111
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,690
the remaining ones couldn’t support
the functioning of the God Realm.

112
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,320
Master Zhiyang had no choice,
but to shut the God Realm

113
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,080
and sent us there

114
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,410
to disseminate the cultivation
to Immortals and Demons.

115
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,450
He hoped that the cultivation of Gods

116
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,570
could be abundant again.

117
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,450
At that time, he mentioned that

118
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,450
when it was time to strike,

119
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,640
we could go look for
Four Weapons of True Gods

120
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,250
lost in the lower realm

121
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,730
and reopen the gate between
the Bronze Bridge and the God Realm

122
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,160
to reactivate the God Realm.

123
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,690
After looking for them over many years,

124
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,130
I’ve got nothing,
but the clue for the Twin Spear

125
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,040
left by True God Zhiyang.

126
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,410
Lately, I recalled that

127
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,600
after the battle
between Gods and Devils,

128
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,410
Purple Moon Whip suddenly disappeared
from the Hidden Pavilion.

129
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,480
I can’t help suspecting

130
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,360
if some demons took it away

131
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,600
in the chaos.

132
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,080
You mean

133
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,570
the Purple Moon Whip may be hidden
in the Demon Realm?

134
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,410
Sen Jian is merely a Demigod,

135
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,730
but he fought us for ten thousand years.

136
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,600
There must be a reason.

137
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,810
I want you to go to the Demon Realm

138
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,600
and try to figure out

139
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,600
if the Demon King
has the Purple Moon Whip.

140
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
If he has it,

141
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,010
and wants to reactivate
the God Realm with me,

142
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,850
I’ll promise to give him

143
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,570
ten blessed spots in the Immortal Realm.

144
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,730
When we get some spiritual veins
after the God Realm is reactivated,

145
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,600
I’d like to share
with them equally, too.

146
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,810
But Heavenly Father,

147
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,600
demons are never on good terms with us.

148
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,360
Tianqi was one of the Four True Gods.

149
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,760
Gu Jun was also evolved
from a flood dragon.

150
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,600
When the God Realm was in its prime,

151
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,970
there was no difference
between immortals and demons.

152
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
You’re right.

153
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,810
Without the ceasefire between us,

154
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,970
the Three Realms couldn’t be in peace.

155
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,080
This is the Magic Rope.

156
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,250
It’ll help you out of danger.

157
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,210
Among my children,

158
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,130
you’re the steadiest one.

159
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,570
Only by sending you

160
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,600
can I present my sincerity.

161
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,810
Rest assured, Heavenly Father.

162
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,090
I won’t let you down.

163
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,250
Go ahead.

164
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,040
After so many years,

165
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,010
you still haven’t given up
on reactivating the God Realm?

166
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,480
True God Zhiyang entrusted us

167
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,280
with the God Realm.

168
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,330
Now it’s split.

169
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,960
Immortals and demons
are totally incompatible.

170
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,250
How I’ve disappointed him!

171
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,920
It was Sen Jian who disobeyed
Master Zhiyang’s order

172
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,360
and betrayed us.

173
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,360
Even if we want a ceasefire,

174
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,130
I don’t think he’s of one mind with us.

175
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,690
Don’t forget.

176
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Master Bai Jue killed

177
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,090
Demon God Tianqi.

178
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,010
Wu Huan,

179
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,280
it’s been sixty thousand years

180
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,810
since that happened.

181
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,600
There’s little spiritual aura
in the lower realm.

182
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,480
Let alone Gods,

183
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,210
there’s hardly a lord
in a thousand years.

184
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,210
We have trouble cultivating ourselves.

185
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,330
So do the demons.

186
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
We can’t achieve the best

187
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,920
unless we reactive the God Realm

188
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,480
and let the two species cultivate in it.

189
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,360
Sen Jian has remained Demigod
for ten thousand years

190
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,720
and can’t make more progress.

191
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,450
I don’t think he’ll reject me.

192
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,450
Hope so.

193
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:09,960
I’ll take this.

194
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,690
All right.

195
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,010
That’s Lord Qingmu.

196
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,400
It’s him? It’s really him.

197
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,160
He looks so handsome,

198
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,920
just as he is in the rumor.

199
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:27,840
Yeah.

200
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,330
I never expected to see him personally.

201
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,890
Was that Lord Qingmu?

202
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,840
Yes.

203
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,690
You were right.

204
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,690
He looks great.

205
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,650
- Yeah, he does.
- Yeah.

206
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,280
He looks good in the robe.

207
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,210
He does.

208
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,920
Are you sure
you’re looking for Boxuan with me?

209
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:48,890
Sure.

210
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:49,720
All right.

211
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,600
But I can’t take you for no good reason.

212
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,810
You should at least do something

213
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,280
for our searching trip.

214
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,650
I’m the most powerful in this place.

215
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,890
I don’t mean letting you fight.

216
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,130
What else do you want me for?

217
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,280
Do you know

218
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,090
what we need most
in searching for someone?

219
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:03,960
Clues?

220
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,520
No.

221
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,480
Sacred Beads.

222
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,520
You want me
to earn Sacred Beads for you?

223
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,810
There’s a lonely place

224
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,770
over there.

225
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,600
In one hour,

226
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,400
let’s meet there.

227
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,210
Where are you going?

228
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,720
Are you going to abandon me again?

229
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,250
See you in one hour.

230
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,400
I thought you would run away again.

231
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,400
No.

232
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,570
I promised to take you.

233
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,040
I need you to earn Sacred Beads.

234
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,720
I’ve got a plan.

235
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,480
We can earn as many as we want.

236
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,040
Go.

237
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,160
You don’t know it, do you?

238
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,130
Even the view of your back

239
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,210
can be sold for 20 top-grade Sacred Beads
in the Immortal Realm.

240
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,920
Half of female lords of the Three Realms

241
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,480
have a crush on you.

242
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:46,960
When you keep such a high profile,

243
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,450
I’m afraid before you earn
any Sacred Beads,

244
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,360
all demons will know you have come.

245
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,250
But we shouldn’t take
such paths, either.

246
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,160
We can earn Sacred Beads here.

247
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:56,770
How?

248
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
Wait for me.

249
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,250
It’s Lord Qingmu.

250
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,130
It’s really him.

251
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,570
- Lord Qingmu!
- Lord Qingmu!

252
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,720
- You!
- Wait for me!

253
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:09,920
Wait for me!

254
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,770
You!

255
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,360
Look at me.

256
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,090
- Stop running!
- Stop running!

257
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,570
Wait for me.

258
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,130
Lord.

259
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,520
- Lord Qingmu!
- Lord Qingmu!

260
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,250
Don’t touch me. I’m not Qingmu.

261
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,840
Lord Qingmu, don’t go.

262
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,840
Stay away!

263
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,520
Wait.

264
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,920
Female demons are indeed generous.

265
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Greetings, Heavenly Mother.

266
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,160
There you are.

267
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,720
Take your seat.

268
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:55,840
You’ve come in time.

269
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,280
These are secret arts
from the Feng Clan.

270
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,770
Pick some and learn them.

271
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,520
But...

272
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,960
I haven’t finished the Gold Dragon Spell

273
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,570
Heavenly Father gave me.

274
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
The secret arts...

275
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,570
Why don’t you

276
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,690
ask my second brother to learn them?

277
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,650
He’s more hard-working than you.

278
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,920
He completed them
three hundred years ago.

279
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,400
He’s the Phoenix.

280
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,920
He must learn, of course.

281
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,400
I have something to ask you.

282
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,130
That day,

283
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,040
your father was angry with Jingyang

284
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,400
and I couldn’t ask you.

285
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,250
In Daze Mansion,

286
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,130
did Houchi really hurt Ziyuan
at one stroke,

287
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,810
set up the restriction
and get the thunder strike?

288
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,040
It was her!

289
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,570
She used the thunder strike on me

290
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,250
and humiliated me.

291
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,690
Heavenly Mother,

292
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,480
do you still care for her?

293
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,960
If you want to know it,

294
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,160
ask her in Qingchi Palace.

295
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,360
Why bother to ask me?

296
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,720
I’m asking because I care for you.

297
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,330
Did she...

298
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,330
Did she really stop
my Phoenix Feather Fan

299
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,840
and set up the restriction on Ziyuan?

300
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,360
She did, so what?

301
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,690
Maybe,

302
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,770
Houchi used some

303
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,160
shady arts.

304
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,450
Or why did she suddenly
become so powerful

305
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,570
with her weak spiritual vein?

306
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,090
It’s really weird.

307
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,330
I’ll figure it out.

308
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,600
I won’t let you suffer in vain.

309
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,810
Isn’t it

310
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,090
your favorite Feather Umbrella?

311
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,450
Feather Umbrella is as powerful
as Phoenix Feather Fan.

312
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,520
But it can help cultivators

313
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,040
to absorb all spiritual aura.

314
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,960
It’s very beneficial for cultivation.

315
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,160
I’m giving it to you.

316
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,280
Hope you’ll cultivate yourself carefully

317
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,400
and become a Goddess soon.

318
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,600
Thank you, Heavenly Mother.

319
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,770
I won’t let you down.

320
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,840
Lord Qingmu,

321
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,210
still angry with me?

322
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,780
We did that to look for Boxuan,
didn’t we?

323
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,100
You promised me, too.

324
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,340
I felt sorry for you.

325
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,500
Who could know you were so impatient?

326
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,060
When they flirted with you,

327
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,100
you couldn’t bear.

328
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,780
Think about it.

329
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,460
No one will believe

330
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,100
you’re North Sea Lord Qingmu.

331
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,100
Now I believe that

332
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,300
you’re not a playboy.

333
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,220
You’re definitely not.

334
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,540
Are you hungry?

335
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,660
Shall we go have a meal?

336
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,340
Don’t get angry.

337
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,420
Besides,

338
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,900
we’ve made a lot of Sacred Beads.

339
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,340
It’s enough for looking for Boxuan.

340
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,660
You have no idea

341
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,460
how handsome you look in this robe.

342
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,420
Then why do you hate me so much?

343
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,580
It’s not your fault.

344
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,540
Simply because Jingzhao loves you.

345
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,820
But I don’t love her.

346
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,580
Let’s go have a meal.

347
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,580
I’m hungry.

348
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,700
I’m not used to eating this.

349
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,700
Enjoy more yourself.

350
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,940
All right.

351
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,460
Thank you.

352
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,420
This way, please.

353
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,020
All right.

354
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,700
Come on. Try some.

355
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,820
Tastes great.

356
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,580
This is not an ordinary restaurant.

357
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,580
Lord Turtle lives in the back hall.

358
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,820
He knows everything in the Demon Realm.

359
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,940
Fengran asked me to come to him

360
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,580
in case I need any news.

361
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,580
So, I came up with that stupid idea.

362
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,180
Sorry for that.

363
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,580
Now that you did it to look for Boxuan,

364
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,940
I should sacrifice some.

365
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,820
Let’s go to the back hall later.

366
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,340
Have some more to eat.

367
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,100
Come on.

368
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,020
Cheers.

369
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,300
This tastes good, too.

370
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,340
Who are you?

371
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,100
We have something to ask Lord Turtle.

372
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,100
Have you brought Sacred Beads?

373
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,100
Sure.

374
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,820
Let her in.

375
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
He’s with me.

376
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,940
One bag of Sacred Beads for one person.

377
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,340
How did he see us?

378
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,460
Just get in here.

379
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,700
It may be dangerous in there.

380
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,820
Let me go.

381
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,820
I’ll go.

382
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
I know more about Boxuan.

383
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,100
I know what I’m going to ask him.

384
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,100
Be careful, then.

385
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,700
Wait for me in the front hall.

386
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,940
You’re Fengran’s friend?

387
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,540
Tell me.

388
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,580
What do you come for?

389
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,100
I hear you know everything
about the Three Realms.

390
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,540
I want to ask you for someone.

391
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,420
Who?

392
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,820
Demon Lord Ziyue.

393
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,460
Don’t be nervous.

394
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,100
I mean no harm.

395
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,940
Demon Lord Ziyue is powerful.

396
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,940
If I really wanted to hurt him,

397
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,180
I wouldn’t come alone.

398
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,580
Isn’t the immortal out there

399
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,820
your partner?

400
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,180
He didn’t come in.

401
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,940
Why is there no sound?

402
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,300
He still didn’t say

403
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,660
where Demon Lord Ziyue was.

404
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,780
Our rule is that

405
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,420
one person asks one question.

406
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,300
Your immortal friend

407
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,020
sent his little friend.

408
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,100
Isn’t he breaking my rule?

409
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,020
It’s a paper figure
with Spiritual Strength.

410
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,220
It doesn’t count.

411
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,060
I decide my own rules.

412
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,580
No matter how powerful
Qingchi Palace is,

413
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,580
you can’t make decisions for me.

414
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,220
Have you heard of it?

415
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,300
The other day,

416
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,820
young Goddess of Qingchi Palace

417
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,180
defeated Lord Ziyuan with one stroke.

418
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,420
It’s just exaggeration of immortals.

419
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,700
I hear that Houchi was born
with no spiritual vein.

420
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,940
Maybe she’s an illegitimate daughter

421
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,100
with a common mother.

422
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Cheers. Cheers.

423
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,420
You’re saying bestial words!

424
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,940
Royal families of Tiger Demons
are decent.

425
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,940
But you’re a shame!

426
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,220
What?

427
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Want to defend
the illegitimate daughter

428
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
from Qingchi Palace?

429
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,660
Let me teach you a lesson.

430
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,180
Men,

431
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,780
fight him!

432
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,580
You know who I am?

433
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,580
Because of Fengran.

434
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,180
I have no more Sacred Beads for you.

435
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,940
Please do me a favor.

436
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,220
For the sake that Fengran helped me,

437
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,820
I could tell you

438
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,900
about Demon Lord Ziyue.

439
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,460
But you must promise me one thing

440
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,060
in the name of Qingchi Palace

441
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,580
to make up for the missing Sacred Beads.

442
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,060
You’re blackmailing me.

443
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,900
If you don’t want it,

444
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,180
you may leave.

445
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,420
I won’t give back your Sacred Beads.

446
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,180
I can’t promise you

447
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,060
what you want.

448
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,420
My Heavenly Father told me that

449
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,060
we would be impartial

450
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,300
and we would live all alone.

451
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,420
We wouldn’t fight for power,

452
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,940
or interfere with the Heavenly Realm.

453
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,940
You can refuse to tell me
where Demon Lord Ziyue is,

454
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,020
regardless of your friendship
with Fengran.

455
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,700
But I can’t break our promise,

456
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,940
regardless of my father’s instruction.

457
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,420
Take the Sacred Beads as a present.

458
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,780
Good day.

459
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,180
Wait.

460
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,540
It’s eloquent of you.

461
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,220
If I don’t tell you,

462
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,020
I’ll be a disloyal and dishonest man.

463
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,020
Take the news you want

464
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,940
and leave here immediately

465
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,580
with your partner.

466
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,820
If you do any harm to the demons,

467
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,900
don’t blame me for being rude.

468
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,060
We’re in the Demon Realm.

469
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,580
There’s huge enmity
between immortals and demons.

470
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,820
How could you do this?

471
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,820
Those drunkards just humiliated you.

472
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,580
I couldn’t help,
but taught them a lesson.

473
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,780
But don’t worry.

474
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,780
I didn’t use any immortal power

475
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,580
and I won’t get exposed.

476
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,820
What’s the paper figure?

477
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,060
I raised him with Spiritual Strength

478
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,180
when I was in the North Sea.

479
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:45,940
He’s my friend.

480
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,700
Do you know I nearly failed
to get any news

481
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,580
simply because of him?

482
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,540
I was just worried about...

483
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,220
Did you really get no news

484
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,580
about Demon Lord Ziyue?

485
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,900
To me,

486
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,780
Boxuan matters most.

487
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,300
I won’t be negligent

488
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,420
in looking for him.

489
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,820
Lord Qingmu,

490
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,180
we don’t go the same way.

491
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:02,820
From this day on,

492
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,180
let’s go our own ways

493
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,420
and don’t see each other again.

494
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,060
Kick me out again with another excuse?

495
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,180
All right, then.

496
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,940
I won’t go with you, either.

497
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,900
Whoever wants cultivation
in the third heaven

498
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,700
must pay a top-grade Sacred Bead.

499
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,700
Lend me one Sacred Bead.

500
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,660
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

501
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,300
Next.

502
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,420
So many people are here.

503
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,180
Yeah.

504
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,300
I’ve been here for a while.

505
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:33,900
Next.

506
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,420
I’m late again.

507
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,060
Looks like I can’t get the token.

508
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,220
Everyone wants cultivation
in the third heaven.

509
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,940
But only ten tokens
are issued every day.

510
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,300
Totally not enough.

511
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,700
I hear Black and White Evils
are guarding the pass today.

512
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,100
Even if we got the token,

513
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
we couldn’t defeat them.

514
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,700
Or shall we let it go?

515
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,940
We’d better be alive first.

516
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,780
Let’s wait for a while.

517
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,540
All right, then.

518
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,420
When they know we guard the pass today,

519
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,180
they still dare to break through
the Life and Death Gate?

520
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,580
How reckless they are!

521
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,820
Who are you?

522
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,780
I’m Jingjian from the Heavenly Palace.

523
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,940
Under the command
of the Heavenly Emperor,

524
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,060
I’m here to visit the Demon King.

525
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,540
It’s brave of you, Second Prince.

526
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,820
You dared to come to the third heaven

527
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,580
without any subordinate.

528
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,580
In a fight,

529
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,540
messengers are never killed.

530
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,700
If you want a fight,

531
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,820
let’s fight on the battlefield.

532
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,060
Demons like you

533
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,940
won’t fight me in the third heaven,

534
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,220
will you?

535
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,100
You’re indeed the God of War
among immortals.

536
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
His Majesty is in seclusion.

537
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,380
I’ll take you to see Prince Sen Yu

538
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,580
in Xuanjing Palace.

539
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,060
Thank you.

540
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,420
Here’s the last token!

541
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,060
The last?

542
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,180
It goes to the highest bidder.

543
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,940
Me. Give it to me!

544
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,460
I have Sacred Beads.

545
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,220
No rush. No rush.

546
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:55,940
Those back there.

547
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,300
Give it to me!

548
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:56,700
No rush.

549
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,940
Give it to me.

550
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,660
- Don’t squeeze.
- Give it to me!

551
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,780
I have a lot of Sacred Beads.

552
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,100
- As many as I do?
- Me! Me!

553
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,060
The token is mine.

554
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
So many Sacred Beads?

555
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,020
Here.

556
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,700
Such a big bag of Sacred Beads?

557
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,220
Do you have so many?

558
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,300
No.

559
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,060
Stop!

560
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
How dare you deceive me with camouflage!

561
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,780
Give the token back to me!

562
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,060
It’s mine. Mine!

563
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,820
Stop!

564
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,820
Stop snatching!

565
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,300
Stop!

566
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,460
- Stop!
- It’s mine.

567
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:29,820
Leave some to me.

568
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,340
Stop snatching!

569
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,900
How dare anyone make trouble
in front of the Life and Death Gate!

570
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:33,820
Somebody.

571
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,780
Take Prince Jingjian to Xuanjing Palace.

572
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,580
Yes.

573
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,700
- It’s mine!
- Stop, all of you!

574
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,020
Who’s making trouble here?

575
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,420
I’m Qingchi from North Qilian Mountains.

576
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,660
I work for Demon Lord Ziyue.

577
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,300
Under his command,

578
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,300
I come here for something important.

579
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,220
Take me in immediately.

580
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,580
What north or south Qilian Mountains?

581
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,900
Never heard of it.

582
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,420
Don’t try to deceive me!

583
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,300
Ignorant men!

584
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,020
Even if you don’t recognize me,

585
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,940
can’t you recognize the token
of Demon Lord Ziyue?

586
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,580
It’s indeed his token.

587
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,180
Take me in immediately.

588
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,020
If you hold up his emergency,

589
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,900
you might be killed.

590
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,300
She sounds so arrogant.

591
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,340
Maybe she’s not lying.

592
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,700
Shall we let her in?

593
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,940
It’s sensible of you.

594
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,300
If there’s a chance,

595
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,220
I’ll put in a good word for you.

596
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,700
Wait.

597
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,460
Ordered by the Demon King,

598
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,900
I guard the gate to the third heaven.

599
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,900
Nobody unidentified can be allowed in

600
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,820
without challenging
the Life and Death Gate.

601
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,780
It’s my duty.

602
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,580
Sorry for the offense.

603
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,020
Wait.

604
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,700
Now that we both work for Lord Ziyue,

605
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,060
we don’t need to injure our harmony.

606
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,900
Let’s not have a life and death fight.

607
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,540
Whoever leaves the ring first

608
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,580
will lose.

609
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,580
Deal.

610
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,700
I’ll fight you alone,

611
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,660
and restrain one of my hands.

612
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,460
When I fight you with only one hand,

613
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,220
I can still defeat you!

614
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,580
But Black...

615
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,660
It’ll be fine.

616
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:52,900
Where’s she?

617
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,660
What’s going on?

618
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:55,940
Fly out!

619
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,580
Freeze!

620
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:18,820
You lost.

621
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,060
You cheated!

622
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,700
When you lost, you lost.

623
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,580
All right.

624
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,540
I won.

625
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,300
I won’t play.

626
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:24,940
You!

627
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,700
The fight in front of
the Life and Death Gate

628
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,300
is the supreme battle
in the Demon Realm.

629
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,220
But you used such a foul trick.

630
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,940
Shame on you!

631
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,060
What foul trick?

632
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,940
He simply underestimated me.

633
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,820
I kicked him out with my own strength.

634
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,300
What lame arguments!

635
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,580
We demons only care for strength,

636
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,540
but not rules.

637
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,940
Someone as mean as you

638
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,540
can’t ever enter the third heaven.

639
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,340
Don’t be nervous, Your Highness.

640
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,060
Someone must be breaking through
the Life and Death Gate.

641
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,540
Who are you?

642
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,180
How dared you break our rule!

643
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,220
A challenger.

644
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,420
Lord Qingmu,

645
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,180
if the White finds out...

646
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,060
How could you get in?

647
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,940
You sound arrogant.

648
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,420
Didn’t you just say

649
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,340
you only cared for strength,

650
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,300
but not rules?

651
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,300
In this case,

652
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,580
I’ll break your rule, then.

653
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,820
He used the sword

654
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,180
even as strongly as me.

655
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,700
Never heard of such a demon.

656
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,180
Demons turn out to be more powerful

657
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,900
than I’ve imagined.

658
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,100
Heavenly Father is right.

659
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
If we want to reactivate the God Realm,

660
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,060
we mustn’t be enemies with demons.

661
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,020
Come, please.

662
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,660
You cut off my Purple Fire?

663
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,580
I’ll see who you are.

664
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,300
Is that you?

665
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,300
Are you really back?

666
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,180
I’ll see who isn’t convinced yet

667
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,420
in the third heaven.

668
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,180
Why is there Demon Power on Qingmu?

669
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,700
Bai Jue?

670
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,100
You have the strongest Demon Power
I’ve ever seen.

671
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,900
Come in, please.

672
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,580
Let’s go.

673
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,340
Your Highness.

674
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,580
What’s wrong with you?

675
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,940
Can’t you see I’m busy?

676
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,820
Your Highness,

677
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,700
Prince Jingjian from the Heavenly Palace
asked to see you.

678
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,700
What?

679
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,940
When a prince comes,

680
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,300
I must see him immediately?

681
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,940
Immortals are all evil.

682
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,180
Ignore him for one day.

683
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,460
Let’s see him tomorrow.

684
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,220
Leave me.

685
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,180
Yes.

686
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,460
Prince Sen Yu sounds so irascible.

687
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,940
He must be handling something difficult.

688
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,700
Well,

689
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,460
I’ll come tomorrow.

690
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,180
I hear the third heaven
is the most bustling at night.

691
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,580
I want to take a walk there.

692
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,580
May I?

693
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,940
Sure.

694
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,820
Enjoy yourself.

695
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,300
Lord Turtle said that

696
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,540
Houchi got some clues
about the third heaven.

697
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,820
But the third heaven is so big.

698
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Where can she be?

699
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,580
Fengran?

700
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,580
Lords in Qingchi Palace never came out
over tens of thousands of years.

701
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,580
But now they’re visiting
the Demon Realm.

702
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,580
Is there any reason for that?

703
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,420
Lord Fengran,

704
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,180
how are you doing lately?

705
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,060
It’s you?

706
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,820
Why are you here?

707
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,660
Under the command
of the Heavenly Emperor,

708
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,020
I have something to discuss about
with the Demon King.

709
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,340
Lord Fengran, what brings you here

710
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,340
to the third heaven?

711
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,660
If you need anything,

712
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,940
I’d like to help.

713
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,100
Now that you have business to do,

714
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,660
I’ll leave you alone.

715
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,660
Wait.

716
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,820
What?

717
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,020
I’m sorry to say that,

718
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,060
but I seldom leave the Heavenly Palace

719
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,820
and I’m not familiar
with the Demon Realm.

720
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,940
Now that we’ve met,

721
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,180
why don’t we go together

722
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,220
so that we can take care of each other?

723
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,940
What does it concern me

724
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,100
whether you’re familiar with this place?

725
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,780
Why can you...?

726
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,300
Or,

727
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,060
you’re up to something

728
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,700
that you don’t want us to know?

729
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,100
He looks like a weak scholar,

730
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,700
but he’s quite cunning.

731
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,420
If I go with him,

732
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,540
he can spy on me.

733
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,460
If I don’t,

734
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,940
it proves we collude with demons.

735
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,340
Now that you trust me,

736
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,420
we can take a walk together.

737
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,780
The third heaven is more prosperous

738
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,060
than any other place.

739
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,060
Let me show you around

740
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,580
and have a good time.

741
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,540
Your wish is my command.

742
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,340
He just helped me
to get into the third heaven.

743
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,900
But he ignored me upon coming in.

744
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,900
Forget it.

745
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,180
He saved me, anyway.

746
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,140
And he’s younger.

747
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,020
I’d like to make him happy.

748
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,020
Thank you for helping me just now.

749
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,340
I’ll keep that in mind.

750
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,060
When I find Boxuan
and get back to Qingchi Palace,

751
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,140
I’ll reward you heavily.

752
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,540
Waiter,

753
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,220
get us some wine.

754
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,780
All right. A minute.

755
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:12,820
You will?

756
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,420
Now you’d like to go

757
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,820
with me?

758
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:18,900
Here’s the wine for you.

759
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,100
Since we met,

760
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,180
we’ve never had schemes.

761
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,300
I was in such a fit of anger

762
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,460
that I said something
without careful thought.

763
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,820
In your heart,

764
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,420
am I always someone

765
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,340
who is arrogant, impulsive,

766
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,540
and childish?

767
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,820
Not that dramatic.

768
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,820
Come on.

769
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,820
Enjoy the wine when we talk.

770
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,580
Anyway,

771
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,020
you care for nothing,
but looking for Boxuan.

772
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,180
Like you said, let’s go our own ways.

773
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,580
I won’t enjoy your wine.

774
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,300
Don’t push it.

775
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,900
I hear that Houchi was born
with no spiritual vein.

776
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
Maybe she’s an illegitimate daughter

777
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,020
with a common mother.

778
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,560
- Cheers. Cheers.
- Enjoy the wine. Cheers.

779
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,620
You’re saying bestial words!

780
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,340
Royal families of Tiger Demons
are decent.

781
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,340
But you’re a shame!

782
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,420
What?

783
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,100
Want to defend the illegitimate daughter
from Qingchi Palace?

784
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,620
Let me teach you a lesson.

785
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,340
Men,

786
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:19,820
fight him!

787
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,460
What are you laughing at?

788
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,500
I’m not worried about her.

789
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,580
I simply want to find Boxuan soon.

790
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,500
Stop laughing.

791
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,500
Catch up.

792
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,500
Stop it,

793
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,540
or I’ll turn you into waste paper.

794
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,900
Why did you do this?

795
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:20,980
What?

796
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,100
We’re not families or friends.

797
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,640
If you come for Boxuan,

798
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,060
you could have tricked me
or threatened me.

799
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,620
But you saved me many times.

800
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,620
You even fought to defend
the reputation of Qingchi Palace.

801
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,460
Lord Qingmu,

802
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
why did you do this?

803
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,180
What do you mean why?

804
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,700
A man does what he wants.

805
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,820
When I want to defend you, I defend you.

806
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,380
When I want to save you, I save you.

807
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,860
There’s no specific reason.

808
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,740
But I don’t like to owe others.

809
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,260
And I don’t care how people think of me.

810
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,180
I’m used to the curses on me.

811
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,660
You don’t need to...

812
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,240
But I care.

813
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,420
I can’t stand seeing you be criticized.

814
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,660
I can’t stand seeing you be bullied.

815
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,460
I can’t stand seeing you pretend
nothing happened

816
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,700
while you actually feel sad.

817
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,380
Whenever I’m with you,

818
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,480
I defend you.

819
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,060
Because...

820
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,700
Because I want you to be my friend.

821
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:23,860
From this day on,

822
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,660
shall we go together

823
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,540
and be honest to each other?

824
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,380
Childish.

825
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,900
You’re simply a bit older than me.

826
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,020
Why can you say I’m childish?

827
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,100
Finish the wine
and let’s go look for Boxuan.

828
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,860
Come on in.

829
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,420
You haven’t come for a while.

830
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,340
I’m right here for you, aren’t I?

831
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,460
Lord Fengran,

832
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,340
where are we?

833
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,580
You’ve stayed in the Heavenly Palace
for so long

834
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,700
(Pleasure House)
that you don’t even know this place.

835
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,460
There’re the most beautiful demons

836
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,540
and the best spirit in it.

837
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,100
What?

838
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,020
You don’t like it?

839
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,580
I...

840
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,860
I’ve admired this place for long.

841
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,100
I must get in.

842
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,660
If you don’t like it,

843
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,140
go back and wait for me in the inn.

844
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,460
After I have enough fun,

845
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,940
I’ll go back to you.

846
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,820
Wait.

847
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,140
What?

848
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,420
Do you need me

849
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,700
to walk you back to the inn?

850
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,140
No.

851
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,900
I just don’t understand.

852
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,420
It’s a place for men.

853
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,140
What fun can you have?

854
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,340
Or do you simply want to get rid of me

855
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,100
by getting into this place?

856
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,060
You’re poorly informed.

857
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,260
There’re female demons in it,

858
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,140
as well as male demons.

859
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:12,940
What?

860
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,020
When males can come,

861
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,940
females can’t?

862
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,380
Well, Lord Fengran,

863
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,860
please kindly enlighten me tonight.
