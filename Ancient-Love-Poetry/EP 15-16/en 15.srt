2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,830
The Tribulation of Chaos comes,

4
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,710
and the God Realm will collapse.

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,430
Only when the Chief God of Chaos
sacrifices her life to the tribulation

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,120
can you solve the difficulties
of all beings.

7
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,630
Bastard!

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Old man!

9
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,880
You let Shanggu work hard
to learn the Power of Chaos

10
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
and inherit the position of Chief God,

11
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,910
is it

12
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,510
just to make her

13
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,960
die for your people?

14
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,510
In your eyes,

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,830
is she just a sacrifice?

16
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,350
Master, watch your mouth.

17
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,720
Purple Jade Whip!

18
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,560
Master!

19
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,040
Master!

20
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,600
Master!

21
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,240
I am not afraid.

22
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,630
Qingtian,

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,470
if you have the ability,

24
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,630
pass the God’s punishment on me
and kill me!

25
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,920
Get out!

26
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,710
Master!

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Master!

28
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,600
Master!

29
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,070
I must stop it.

30
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,110
No matter what price I will take,

31
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,030
I will never let Shanggu

32
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,280
inherit the position of Chief God.

33
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,360
I couldn’t protect her
thousands of years ago.

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,790
This time,

35
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,030
I won’t let her get hurt at any cost.

36
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,320
Even if it’s you,

37
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,390
I won’t let it happen.

38
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,310
After inheriting the throne of God,

39
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,470
she is going to die
for the common people.

40
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,030
Tianqi.

41
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,590
So this is your difficulty.

42
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,800
So this is why

43
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,750
you’d rather let the common people die
than tell out the secret.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,590
Tianqi.

45
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,110
I said that

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,360
one day you would regret it

47
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,280
if you knew about the truth.

48
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,230
If it weren’t you who let her
become the Chief God so soon,

49
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,720
how could she
have a great God power of Chaos

50
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,360
and become a pawn
to save the common people?

51
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,800
How could I be forced
to be of destruction?

52
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,750
You thought you protected her.

53
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,080
But what about the truth?

54
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,230
The truth is that you

55
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,160
forced her into her destiny
step by step

56
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,390
and let her fall into perdition.

57
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,390
It’s you.

58
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,830
You killed her by yourself!

59
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,670
No way.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,560
There must be a way
to resolve the Tribulation of Chaos.

61
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,640
Her life must not

62
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,440
be the only way.

63
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,920
I have already found

64
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,200
the way, haven’t I?

65
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,920
It will be solvable

66
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,670
at the expense of the death
of all beings from Three Realms.

67
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,950
But you!

68
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,200
You ruined her with your own hands!

69
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,670
It’s not the right way.

70
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,080
It definitely won’t be Shanggu’s wish

71
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,950
if we save her by billions of lives.

72
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,720
What else can you do?

73
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,440
There must be another way.

74
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,160
Give me some time.

75
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,110
A hundred years. No.

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,640
Ten years.

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,920
I must find a way.

78
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,000
I will definitely find a way
to save her.

79
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,640
That’s too late.

80
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
The Tribulation of Chaos

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,200
will come in two days.

82
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,310
All this is doomed already.

83
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,360
When the Tribulation of Chaos comes

84
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,640
and spiritual power
of the world disappear,

85
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,240
it’ll be the Gods’ end.

86
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,920
Except for her death,

87
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,990
nothing could help.

88
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,800
It turned out that I hurt her
by my own hands.

89
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,270
What’s up?

90
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,680
Just now,

91
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,200
I was watching the stars
at Changyuan Hall.

92
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,520
It suddenly reminded me that

93
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,640
Chief God still owes me
an appointment.

94
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,400
What appointment?

95
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,750
Let’s talk about it after I cultivate
the instruction feather of Chief God.

96
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,840
Haven’t you forgotten

97
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,680
your appointment with me
at the Taoyuan Forest that day?

98
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,150
After you take over
the instruction feather of Chief God,

99
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,920
can you go to Taoyuan Forest with me?

100
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,430
I have something

101
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,920
hiding in my heart for a long time.

102
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,030
I want to tell you there.

103
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,750
Haven’t you forgotten it?

104
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,750
I never forgot the appointment

105
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
with you.

106
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,520
But this appointment has long passed.

107
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,030
I come to the Pilgrimage Hall today

108
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,200
to invite Chief God to
our appointment of that day.

109
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,360
No way.

110
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,150
Tomorrow I will become
the Chief God of Chaos,

111
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,800
and give an explanation to the Gods.

112
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,680
Just because you will be
the Chief God of Chaos tomorrow,

113
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,520
I come here today.

114
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,960
I have never wanted anything
in my life.

115
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,840
But my only wish

116
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,990
is that Shanggu who practiced with me
in my Changyuan Hall back then

117
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,400
can accompany me
to the appointment today.

118
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,680
Not tomorrow’s Chief God of Chaos.

119
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,460
Can you?

120
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,920
No.

121
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,360
No way.

122
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,270
What’s wrong with you today?

123
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,430
The Gods have felt stirred by

124
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,120
the cultivation today.

125
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,470
If I stopped abruptly,

126
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,750
it would be too improper.

127
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,640
Wait till I end all this.

128
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Wait till I end all this.

129
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,120
I never asked anyone in my life.

130
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,550
I have only one wish.

131
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,120
Just this one wish.

132
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,640
Shanggu,

133
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,590
leave with me.

134
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,200
OK?

135
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,240
(The Tribulation of Chaos comes,
and the God Realm will collapse.)

136
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,640
(Only when the Chief God of Chaos
sacrifices her life to the tribulation)

137
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,140
(can you solve the difficulties
of all beings.)

138
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,520
The Tribulation of Chaos is coming!

139
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,670
Hurry up and report to Master!

140
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,260
Yes!

141
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,670
Master!

142
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,310
Everyone knows that
between heaven and earth,

143
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,430
there will be a tribulation
every 180,000 years.

144
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,080
Only the Chief God can resolve it.

145
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,790
And now the stele means that

146
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,430
Shanggu must sacrifice her spirit
to save the world.

147
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,400
Nonsense!

148
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,960
It’s impossible.

149
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,840
Block the Heaven and Earth Platform
immediately.

150
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,520
No one is allowed in or out.

151
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,280
Master can block
the Heaven and Earth Platform,

152
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,840
but you can’t keep all Gods’ mouths
of the God Realm shut.

153
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,720
The instructions from the Ancestral God
are nothing but the truth.

154
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,520
It is already said
that there is a tribulation.

155
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,310
There must be a tribulation.

156
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,280
If Master Shanggu still
hasn’t shown up yet,

157
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,160
would she want to wait
until the God Realm collapses?

158
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,600
Even if the God Realm were collapsed,

159
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,790
there would still have
my Master and two True Gods.

160
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,280
When is it your turn to talk that much?

161
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,840
Ridiculous!

162
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,670
The God Realm is the God Realm
of all the Gods.

163
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,310
How could your Pilgrimage Hall
have the final say?

164
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,200
Master Zhiyang.

165
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,280
Since all Gods are here,

166
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,840
I thought that

167
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,400
as the tribulation has not come yet,

168
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,600
all Gods should perform our duties

169
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
and keep our responsibilities
at the moment.

170
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,480
As for the matter of the resolution,

171
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
we still have the True Gods to decide.

172
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,960
We can’t be messed up here

173
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,480
because of this warning.

174
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,600
Report.

175
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,960
Report to Master Zhiyang.

176
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,720
The Tribulation of Chaos
at the Bronze Barrier Gate is spreading!

177
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,160
The Bronze Bridge is collapsing!

178
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,840
I’m afraid the entire God Realm
would collapse

179
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,840
within twenty-four hours!

180
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,160
The Power of Chaos is disintegrating?

181
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,550
Could it be…

182
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,430
This is the Tribulation of Chaos!

183
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,230
The Tribulation of Chaos.

184
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,960
My Master is the Chief God of Chaos.

185
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,430
If her spirit were sacrificed,

186
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
who can protect the common people?

187
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,790
The Tribulation of Chaos is coming.

188
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,310
Our God Realm is about
to encounter a catastrophe.

189
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,160
Master Zhiyang, please ask the Chief God
to come out of the Hall

190
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,520
and decide for the common people!

191
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,040
Please ask the Chief God
to come out of the Hall

192
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,790
and decide for the common people!

193
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,430
You guys…

194
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,670
You see.

195
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,480
The God Light is off!

196
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,790
Shanggu is not cultivating
the instruction feather of Chief God!

197
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,160
What can we do now?

198
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,080
What to do?

199
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,430
God of Thunder, what can we do now?

200
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,790
Shanggu must know
that she should be sacrificed

201
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,640
so she escaped from the God Realm.

202
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,480
Nonsense!

203
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,160
How can my Master be such a person?

204
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,080
Then where is she?

205
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,080
She descended the imperial order
to inherit the throne.

206
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,720
But she stops cultivating the instruction feather
of Chief God just at this moment.

207
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,600
If not to escape…

208
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,380
Shut up!

209
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,750
I will definitely bring Shanggu back

210
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
and give an explanation to you.

211
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,040
But before everything is found out,

212
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,990
I don’t want to hear any

213
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,200
slanderous words against
the Chief God of Chaos.

214
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,230
Otherwise, remove his Title of God

215
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,520
and banish him from the God Realm.

216
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,600
Master Zhiyang, please forgive me.

217
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,280
I was also in a hurry.

218
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,720
That’s why I dared to speak falsely.

219
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,060
Muguang.

220
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,750
Yes.

221
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,480
You hold my Twin Spear

222
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,990
and fight against the Tribulation of Chaos
with all Gods.

223
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,600
If there is a traitor,

224
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,230
punish him with the crime of treason!

225
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,670
Within twenty-four hours,

226
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,080
I will give an explanation to you all.

227
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,080
Yes.

228
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,870
Master.

229
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,960
I thought

230
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,990
you would take me to Taoyuan Forest.

231
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,160
Since it’s a late appointment,

232
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,040
I can decide where the appointment is.

233
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,230
Be serious!

234
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,700
(Endure the Hardship)

235
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,040
Why should I learn this

236
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,200
primer of babies?

237
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,310
Bai Jue, come here!

238
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,400
Today,

239
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,400
you and I have fun for a day.

240
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,720
I’ll accompany you

241
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,910
to do everything you want.

242
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,160
Master, please.

243
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,230
I remember that
when you were in Changyuan Hall,

244
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,600
I even scolded you.

245
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,750
Zhiyang has burnt

246
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,080
many gadgets of mine when I was little.

247
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,640
Fortunately, Yuemi and Tianqi
prepared a warehouse of them for me.

248
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,480
Now they can feel relieved.

249
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,640
Since then,

250
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,200
they don’t have to worry about me
anymore.

251
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,430
That’s it. I won’t mention these.

252
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,200
If Master Bai Jue loses,

253
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,790
will there be any reward?

254
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,600
To the best of my ability.

255
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,350
I have played in the God Realm
for so many years.

256
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,670
It’s the first time for me to see

257
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,910
a person speaks
with such great assurance.

258
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,400
Come on.

259
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,790
Whoever has more points wins.

260
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,280
Let’s make a deal first.

261
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,040
No cheating with God power.

262
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,200
Come on.

263
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,990
Open it.

264
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,750
Oh, there really are things

265
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,750
that Master Bai Jue is not good at!

266
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,520
Master Bai Jue lost this, right?

267
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,280
I admit the defeat.

268
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,960
What reward do you want?

269
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,640
It’s not difficult.

270
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,310
Do you remember that

271
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,040
when I first entered Changyuan Hall,

272
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
you let me do three things.

273
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,180
Yes.

274
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,480
Today,

275
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,430
if you can make me laugh three times,

276
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,640
I will be satisfied

277
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,280
with this appointment
at the Mount Lookout.

278
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,080
What’s the problem?

279
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,960
I said

280
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,080
I’ll do it to the best of my ability.

281
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,960
You silly.

282
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,720
How can you make girls happy

283
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,750

You already knew

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,200
that Shanggu should sacrifice her life?

304
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,160
Yes.

305
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,790
What about Tianqi?

306
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,040
Tianqi was the first to know

307
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
the warning from
the Tribulation of Chaos.

308
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,670
Everything he did was

309
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,230
for Shanggu.

310
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,310
Just now,

311
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,990
an inscription from the Ancestral God
appeared on the Heaven and Earth Platform.

312
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,110
All Gods knew that

313
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,110
only Shanggu

314
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,280
could resolve the Tribulation of Chaos.

315
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,870
Bai Jue.

316
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,160
She must come back.

317
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,750
Go back?

318
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,080
And sacrifice her life?

319
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:04,910
Zhiyang.

320
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,280
It shouldn’t be her.

321
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,350
No one knows that the fate
of the Chief God of Chaos

322
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,960
is to sacrifice in exchange for peace.

323
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,910
But no matter how the tribulation
will be resolved,

324
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,550
now the God Realm is in turmoil.

325
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,110
As the Chief God of Chaos,

326
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,230
she must return to the God Realm
to control the overall situation.

327
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,870
What are you doing?

328
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
Even if it is God’s will,
I have to go against it.

329
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,400
Zhiyang.

330
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,080
I never beg you for anything.

331
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,550
Only today.

332
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
I’m asking it at expense of my life.

333
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,120
I can’t let Shanggu return
to the God Realm.

334
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,630
Once she knows the truth
of the Tribulation of Chaos,

335
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,310
she will definitely inherit the throne

336
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,240
and sacrifice her spirit.

337
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,550
I don’t want to see her in ashes.

338
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,790
What do you want?

339
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,080
I’ll do it for her.

340
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,430
The Tribulation of Chaos
can only be resolved

341
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,240
by the God power of Chaos.

342
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,030
Even if your spirit were destroyed,

343
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,670
and you sacrificed it for Shanggu,

344
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,960
you could just seal it temporarily.

345
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,510
You set stars in the God Realm
day by day.

346
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,030
Here we come to the Heavenly Realm,

347
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,790
and you still take me to see the stars.

348
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,630
Aren’t you tired?

349
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,720
I thought that

350
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,720
as long as you watch the stars with me,

351
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,880
no matter where,

352
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,510
you would like it.

353
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,910
Do you remember

354
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,310
these stars?

355
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,240
Are these…

356
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,790
Back then at Heaven and Earth Platform,

357
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,000
we were looking at the same stars.

358
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,150
Then why

359
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,240
we have to see these stars today?

360
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,840
I thought

361
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,310
you would miss that night.

362
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,100
♪Hold tightly with your warm hand♪

363
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,280
What happened?

364
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,240
Why are you so sweet today?

365
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,600
Are you

366
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,270
miraculously transformed by others?

367
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,240
It’s possible.

368
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,390
Try it out

369
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,790
if you want to know the truth.

370
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,310
How to?

371
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,150

460
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,000
come back?

461
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,720
The God Realm would be gone
if they didn’t return.

462
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,880
Shut up!

463
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,310
Shanggu.

464
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,790
Why are you here? Where’s Bai Jue?

465
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,030
Thousands of years ago,
you protected me.

466
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,030
Thousands of years later,
you still did it.

467
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,880
Zhiyang.

468
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,150
I am no longer that Shanggu back then.

469
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,480
Since the Ancestral God made the epoch,

470
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,790
the God Realm has been stable
for hundreds of thousands of years.

471
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,430
The catastrophes we had been through

472
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,310
were a lot more than this.

473
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,670
I never participated in your past.

474
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,200
But right now,

475
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,200
we have to face it together.

476
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,550
Just take it as God’s

477
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,670
first trial for me

478
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,840
after inheriting the Chief God of Chaos.

479
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,630
Master is going to cultivate
the instruction feather of Chief God.

480
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,910
Shanggu!

481
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,030
Shanggu!

482
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,510
Master!

483
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,430
We have always been together

484
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,790
to fight against the catastrophe
of our God Realm.

485
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,550
We never assign responsibility
to one person!

486
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,510
Please don’t be instructed by one warning
from the Ancestral God!

487
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,510
You don’t have to sacrifice your life!

488
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,120
Gu Jun is right!

489
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,080
Now the God Realm
suffers this catastrophe.

490
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,200
We should work together

491
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,600
and bridge over
the Tribulation of Chaos.

492
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,720
Thank you all.

493
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,200
My life is a life.

494
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,510
The lives of all common people
are also lives.

495
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,150
This is the destiny,

496
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,790
though I really don’t agree with it.

497
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,200
But if today,

498
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,720
we must sacrifice one person’s life

499
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,240
in exchange for
all common people’s peace,

500
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,270
no one would be more suitable than me.

501
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,000
I will cultivate the instruction feather
of Chief God again

502
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,120
and eliminate the Tribulation of Chaos.

503
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,360
Master, do not!

504
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,310
Didn’t you just say

505
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,630
that we should face it together?

506
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,630
I am the Chief God of Chaos.

507
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,390
Saving the common people

508
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,000
is my duty.

509
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,030
If you

510
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,670
stood in my position here,

511
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,390
how would you choose?

512
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,000
Shanggu.

513
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,080
You really grew up.

514
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,760
All Gods. Follow her orders.

515
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,270
Protect the Chief God!

516
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,430
The position of Heaven.

517
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,840
Come on, Gods of Seasons!

518
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,480
The position of Earth.
Come on, Gods of Weather!

519
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,790
Overlord.

520
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,840
Shanggu is in
the Heaven and Earth Platform

521
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
cultivating
the instruction feather of Chief God.

522
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,200
I believe it will be completed soon.

523
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,720
I have waited for 70,000 years.

524
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,270
Today finally comes!

525
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,310
Back then Qingtian

526
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,360
told me about the good news
that Tribulation of Chaos

527
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,200
would come.

528
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,310
But he wanted me to sacrifice to

529
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,790
save the entire God Realm.

530
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,910
Looking at the entire God Realm,

531
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,390
why should I die for them?

532
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,120
However, because of this, Qingtian

533
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,790
thought that

534
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,720
I wasn’t suitable for the position
of the Chief God of the Three Realms.

535
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,510
Today I’ll take a good look at

536
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,910
how those hypocrites

537
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,240
will choose.

538
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:11,900
No!

539
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,120
I beg you, Shanggu!

540
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,910
This is my responsibility
as the Chief God.

541
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,080
I have to protect the world.

542
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,840
Bai Jue.

543
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,030
Don’t worry.

544
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,030
I will be a qualified Chief God

545
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,760
and bring peace and tranquility
to the God Realm.

546
00:34:59,150 --> 00:34:59,910
Master!

547
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,040
Master!

548
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,350
Shanggu!

549
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,630
Master Bai Jue!

550
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,870
Bai Jue.

551
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,870
Master Bai Jue!

552
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,520
You can’t die for her!

553
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,760
No way!

554
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,350
Destruction Pestle?!

555
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,670
How dare you collude with the Devils!
