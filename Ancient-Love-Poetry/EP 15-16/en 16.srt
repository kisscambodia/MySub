00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,120

is not eliminated,

116
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,150

125
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,240
he would close the Changyuan Hall.

126
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,270
Alright.

127
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,520
I’ll talk to him.

128
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,710
The looks
are quite similar to Shanggu’s.

129
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,680
Everyone in the God Realm

130
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,120
feels heartbroken about
the death of Shanggu.

131
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,390
But we are True Gods.

132
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,510
We shoulder the responsibility
of the world.

133
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,000
I know that

134
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,920
since you taught Shanggu,

135
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,920
the only things you cared about
are hers.

136
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,270
But now you have watched her

137
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,270
disappear in front of your eyes.

138
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,800
Let alone you,

139
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,150
it’s also hard for me to let it go.

140
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,000
It still hurts when I’m thinking of it.

141
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,680
What I want most is to protect her.

142
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,270
But I pushed her into

143
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,630
everlasting perdition.

144
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,680
Recently,

145
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,830
I’ve often thought of something
in the past.

146
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,150
Tianqi,

147
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,270
you and me.

148
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,240
We were still young at that time.

149
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,590
We did what the Ancestral God

150
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,240
let us do.

151
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,880
Although we couldn’t understand
the meaning behind,

152
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,150
and couldn’t understand
the truth within,

153
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,630
we were confused but very happy.

154
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,270
If you insist on escaping the world,

155
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,270
I won’t persuade you anymore.

156
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,240
I have found out something.

157
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,800
It was Moyu who gave
the Destruction Pestle to Xueying.

158
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,150
Presumably, the Devils had known
the Tribulation of Chaos in advance.

159
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,120
The soldiers of the God Realm

160
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,920
hadn’t recovered
from the Destruction War,

161
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,830
and then we encountered
the Tribulation of Chaos.

162
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,270
If Xuanyi comes here to attack,

163
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,470
all beings of the world
will be in mire and fire.

164
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,000
And the death of Shanggu

165
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,000
will be in vain.

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,880
Xuanyi?

167
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,680
Do you still remember the guess

168
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,880
I told you at Mount Lookout?

169
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
If Xuanyi knew that

170
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,070
the fate of being the Chief God of Chaos
was to sacrifice for the world,

171
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,120
would he obey the destiny?

172
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,680
This is why Xuanyi fell into the Devils.

173
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,800
He wanted Shanggu to sacrifice
in the Tribulation of Chaos for him.

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
For that, he was willing to endure
70,000 years of hardships.

175
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,470
Bai Jue.

176
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,510
You are not able to teach

177
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
the Chief God you are obsessed with.

178
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,510
Why don’t you give her to me?

179
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,440
Within a thousand years,

180
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,200
I will definitely return you
a Chief God of Chaos.

181
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,560
My proposal

182
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,360
has benefits

183
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,920
to you, to me,

184
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,030
and to all beings in the Three Realms.

185
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,030

what you and I have guessed,

then Shanggu’s death

187
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,440
definitely has something to do
with Xuanyi.

188
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,000
Master!

189
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:19,830
Master!

190
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,950
What happened
that made you so badly injured?

191
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,120
Report to Master.

192
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,320
Xuanyi has led the Devils to break
the barrier of the Nether World.

193
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,560
The guards all died

194
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,950
except for me.

195
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,360
It’s the Bronze Bridge.

196
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,440
The Devils are attacking here.

197
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,150
Master ordered us to leave the God Realm

198
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,120
and go to the Heavenly Realm
to stabilize the situation

199
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,030
in case of contingencies.

200
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,270
In case of contingencies?

201
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,830
Master’s words are very pessimistic.

202
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,030
I’m afraid the battle with the Devils

203
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,120
will have the most hopeless outlook.

204
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,590
If Tianqi hadn’t attempted to
destruct the world,

205
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,470
and the Demons hadn’t counterattacked,

206
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,710
how could our God Realm
have ended up like this?

207
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,390
Sooner or later,
I’ll bring fair back from the Demons.

208
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,760
Master sacrificed herself

209
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,950
in exchange for the stability
of the God Realm.

210
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,830
I will never allow the Devils
to destroy it.

211
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,220
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

212
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,320
Don’t go!

213
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,880
Gu Jun.

214
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,270
Master must have his reason

215
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,920
to give us this order.

216
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,510
We can’t be impulsive.

217
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,470
But the God Realm…

218
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,240
I know.

219
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,590
We are all not afraid to die.

220
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,830
But in case...

221
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,270
Gu Jun,
we must listen to Master’s orders.

222
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,270
Xuanyi chose to attack at this time.

223
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,800
He must have detected
our poor situation.

224
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Your spirit is badly injured.

225
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,630
My cultivation has degenerated.

226
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,560
So what?

227
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,710
I will let him pay for it today.

228
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,320
I have waited for 70,000 years.

229
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,120
Today finally comes!

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,920
You two are really righteous.

231
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,760
In order to preserve this God Realm,

232
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,270
you didn’t even take a god
with great spiritual power.

233
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,320
Stop talking rubbish!

234
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,470
You have been planning for 70,000 years

235
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,630
and have known the Tribulation of Chaos
for a long time.

236
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,710
And you deliberately let Shanggu
die for you.

237
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,150
I will never let you go!

238
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,470
So what?

239
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,560
I have cultivated the God power
day and night.

240
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,710
Why should I die
instead of the entire God Realm?

241
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,360
Is it my life

242
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,630
inferior to that of other gods?

243
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,680
Both as the Chief God of Chaos,

244
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,630
you are like a piece of trash

245
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,830
compared with Shanggu.

246
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
You are like dried dung!

247
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,510
If we were defeated in this battle,

248
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,270
the God Realm would be overthrown.

249
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,680
All gods and soldiers.

250
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,710
Yes!

251
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,800
Guard the God Realm!

252
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes!

253
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,390
Oh no!

254
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,880
There must be a war in the God Realm.

255
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,510
That God light is like Master Bai Jue’s.

256
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,920
And that black power…

257
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,150
Report to gods.

258
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,510
Please go to the Barrier Gate
to resist quickly.

259
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,360
The Devils are attacking.

260
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,120
The Devils?

261
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,470
No.

262
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,800
After tens of thousands of years,

263
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,200
you still only have this ability.

264
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,920
Listen to my advice.

265
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,560
You two should stop guarding
the God Realm.

266
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,270
How about

267
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,800
delivering the Three Realms

268
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
all to me?

269
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
I have endured for 70,000 years.

270
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,360
Today I’ll let you see

271
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,030
how poor a god is

272
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,950
and how capable a devil is!

273
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,440
All gods, follow the order
and leave quickly!

274
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,760
The God Realm has difficulties now.

275
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,240
We won’t stand idly by.

276
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,830
All gods were sad and touched
after Shanggu’s death.

277
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,590
If there really is
a Tribulation of Chaos,

278
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,120
it should also be all gods’ tribulation!

279
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,950
For the same reason,

280
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,950
let’s fight together

281
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,440
against the invasion of the Devils.

282
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,590
We won’t leave this time!

283
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
All gods, listen! Set the formation!

284
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,150
Oh, no! Overlord!

285
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,440
You froze me
with the Power of the Original Being.

286
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,350
Your spirit will be destroyed
as the end!

287
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,480
I have no regrets

288
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,350
since I met Master Bai Jue in this life.

289
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:48,990
It’s impossible!

290
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,870
I have survived
the Tribulation of Chaos.

291
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,680
I have already broken the Rules.

292
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,800
I will never lose!

293
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,840
You gathered the power of the gods,

294
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,320
but only to fight like this.

295
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,110
Today I will show you

296
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,440
how they disappear one by one.

297
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,110
I will make this world

298
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,720
without any Master or Hall!

299
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,680
Master is here.

300
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,150
I am in charge of the thunder
and lightning in the Three Realms.

301
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,920
Today I will not allow this devil

302
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,800
to make trouble in the Three Realms!

303
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,960
I am in charge of all disasters
in the Three Realms.

304
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,680
Today I will use my spirit
to help Master in this battle.

305
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:36,960
Master Bai Jue.

306
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,230
I am in charge of the rain
in the three realms.

307
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,560
I would also like to use my spirit
to help Master in this battle.

308
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,110
A life for a life!

309
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,390
Master!

310
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,350
Hongri has been a Divine Beast for you
for over a hundred thousand years.

311
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,320
Now you want to destroy the Devils.

312
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,990
How can I not help you?

313
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,990
In the future,

314
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,840
I hope Master take good care
of your health...

315
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,600
Hongri!

316
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,750
And take good care of all beings!

317
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,510
Hongri!

318
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,080
God of Four Seasons, together with Gods
of Wind, Rain, Thunder and Lightning,

319
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,990
congratulate Chief God on the succession
of Chief God of Chaos.

320
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,080
God of Stars congratulates Chief God on
the succession of Chief God of Chaos.

321
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
I thought

322
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,680
teaching a group of little kids

323
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,150
could make you more gentle.

324
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,630
I didn’t expect you to be the same
after ten thousand years of absence.

325
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,390
Bai Jue?

326
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,350
It’s been over 100,000 years…

327
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,270
This is the first time
you joked with me!

328
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,960
The lives of common people
are too important and I have no choice.

329
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,630
Bai Jue,

330
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,030
I’ll leave

331
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,230
the Three Realms to you.

332
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,680
I promised Shanggu

333
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,680
to protect the God Realm for her.

334
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,080
I made it.

335
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,870
Master said that

336
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,920
the stars in the sky are all gods.

337
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,440
Look.

338
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,870
There are so many stars tonight.

339
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,080
Could it be that the gods are fighting?

340
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,200
Will you and I become stars
in the future?

341
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,680
Master said that

342
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,440
if we practiced hard,

343
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,200
we could become immortals.

344
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,750
Master also said to take us
to the Human Realm to play.

345
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,510
When did it count?

346
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,230
Look, how bright that star is!

347
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,780
(Sixty thousand years later)

348
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,960
I heard from Heavenly Father that

349
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
there once was the God Realm

350
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,920
above the Immortal Realm,

351
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,800
named the Shanggu Realm.

352
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,680
It’s a pity that in the Tribulation
of Chaos 60,000 years ago,

353
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,320
the gods of Shanggu Realm

354
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,750
almost all died.

355
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,350
And the Power of Chaos
left by the Chief God

356
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,990
brought the Human Realm here

357
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,110
replacing the exterminated Devil Realm,

358
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,840
the Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm,

359
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,870
and becoming the new Three Realms.

360
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,920
The new Three Realms
should have coexisted amicably.

361
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,920
But because of the Demon God’s
Destruction in the past,

362
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,440
the immortals and demons
quarreled endlessly.

363
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,840
It lasted for 60,000 years.

364
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,800
Now it’s not clear to judge
the right from wrong

365
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,270
and the good from evil.

366
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,680
There is only one Demigod in the
Demon Realm, Sen Jian, the Demon King.

367
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,960
And in the Immortal Realm today,

368
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,390
there are four Gods.

369
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,600
The first three are Gods
left from the Shanggu Realm.

370
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,390
But the origin of the fourth God

371
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,270
started with a famous marriage
in the Heavenly Realm.

372
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,030
How can the Heavenly Palace
be so extravagant?

373
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,560
How many Sacred Beads will it cost?

374
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:34,990
The King of Heaven is

375
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,150
God Muguang who inherited
the blood of the Gold Dragons.

376
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,600
The Queen of Heaven is the patriarch
of the Phoenix Clan, Goddess Wu Huan.

377
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,080
Extravagance is reasonable.

378
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,720
Have they invited God Gu Jun
from the Qingchi Palace?

379
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,080
When True God Zhiyang

380
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,480
handed over the Immortal Realm
to the Three Gods,

381
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,080
he did not specify who’s in charge.

382
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,270
Qingchi Palace and Heavenly Palace
are separate.

383
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,200
Not to mention

384
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,320
the marriage and divorce
have their destiny.

385
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,800
Just with the temper of God Gun Jun,

386
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,270
can this be held successfully?

387
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,600
Let’s go.

388
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,320
Let’s go.

389
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,350
Do you think he will come?

390
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,800
I spoke sincerely in the invitation.

391
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,200
I hope that Gu Jun
can disregard the past grudges.

392
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,350
Hope so.

393
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,080
Today is our wedding day.

394
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,230
Don’t mention him anymore.

395
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,630
Heaven and earth as evidence,

396
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,560
all immortals as witnesses,

397
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,200
the King and Queen
will marry each other.

398
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,230
The Three Realms will be peaceful.

399
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,110
Greetings to God Gu Jun.

400
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,320
Stand up.

401
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,510
Gu Jun.

402
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,200
You are here.

403
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,080
Ling Juan.

404
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,800
Yes.

405
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,920
What can I do for you?

406
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,630
This is the daughter
of the Queen and me.

407
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,350
Her name is Houchi.

408
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,110
How come the Queen…

409
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,200
Even the Gods can’t escape love affairs.

410
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,030
The poorest

411
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,990
is the child in that egg.

412
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,990
You are in charge of every being’s fate.

413
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,110
You do me a favor. Please let me know

414
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,990
what destiny my daughter will have.

415
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,350
Well…

416
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,200
I don’t think it is necessary.

417
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,440
What?

418
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,630
My daughter is not worthy of you
to tell?

419
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,480
I dare not.

420
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,080
Report to Your Majesty.

421
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,680
Report to Master.

422
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,080
The Little Master…

423
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,510
The Little Master will be a God.

424
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,480
This…

425
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,350
How could it be God’s fate?

426
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,230
How come there’s another God?

427
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,320
This…

428
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,350
Ling Juan.

429
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,990
As we all know,

430
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,110
after the God Realm was closed,

431
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,350
there are only three Gods in the world.

432
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,840
You should watch your words.

433
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,750
Report to Your Majesty.

434
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,960
I dare not tell lies.

435
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,960
The Little Master will indeed be a God.

436
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,750
Have you got any objection to this,
Your Highness?

437
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,580
I…

438
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,840
How about Your Majesty?

439
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,990
Okay.

440
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,600
Today all immortals witness this.

441
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,230
My daughter Houchi will be

442
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,270
another God in the future,

443
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,230
with the sun and moon as evidence,

444
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,200
as well as heaven and earth
as witnesses.

445
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,480
Congratulations to God Houchi.

446
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,660
(Houchi)

447
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,270
It took me 40,000 years
to break my shell.

448
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,230
It has been 20,000 years
since my foundation was built.

449
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,870
I have practiced for 60,000 years.

450
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,390
Why am I still a lower immortal?

451
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,440
Your Grace, you’re back from practicing!

452
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,320
You must’ve worked hard, Your Grace.

453
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,420
(Claim No Credit)

454
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,720
Lord Boxuan often said that

455
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,230
it wouldn’t matter if the cultivation
didn’t go well.

456
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,480
As long as Your Grace is happy.

457
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,320
Everything depends on fate.

458
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,350
Today is the same as yesterday.

459
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,750
I have no improvement.

460
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,680
When will my fate come?

461
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,680
Look at you!

462
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,110
You always say the wrong thing.

463
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,440
How about I ask Lord Fengran

464
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,720
not to test your spiritual power today?

465
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,750
No need.

466
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,150
I asked Fengran
to supervise my practice.

467
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,960
Isn’t it just punishment?

468
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
I’ve long been used to it.

469
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,800
It’s all my business.

470
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,390
I’m going to find Fengran now.

471
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,600
The sooner I finish the test,

472
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,350
the sooner I’ll be scolded.

473
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,350
Then I can go to bed earlier.

474
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,920
Wu Xu,

475
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:45,790
look at that!

476
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,760
The barrier of Qilian Mountains
has been opened unexpectedly.

477
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,110
What a rich Spiritual Spring!

478
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,070
The Qingchi Palace’s Spiritual Spring is
said to be the best in the Three Realms.

479
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,070
The rumors are true.

480
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,590
I... I think it’s getting late.

481
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,830
We’d better go back quickly.

482
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,200
Don’t delay the important event of Lord.

483
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,680
What’s the hurry?

484
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,440
There are still a few days
before Lord Donghua’s birthday banquet.

485
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,150
If we drink such rich spring,

486
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,720
our cultivation will definitely increase
by a thousand years.

487
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,790
You’re not tempted at all?

488
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
What are you afraid of?

489
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,070
The Qingchi Palace
has long been dilapidated.

490
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,630
Let’s go in quietly

491
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,920
and take it out quickly.

492
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,760
Who can find us out?

493
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,920
But now Lord Fengran is
in charge of the Qingchi Palace.

494
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,920
She has old grudges
with our Zijin Mansion.

495
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,920
So what?

496
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,440
Our Lord Ziyuan

497
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,070
is the most popular person
in the Heavenly Palace.

498
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,440
Even if Fengran meets us,

499
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,350
she has to step back.

500
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,310
Houchi.

501
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,350
I’ll put the harsh words in front today.

502
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,000
You should have taken the exam
a few days ago.

503
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,920
But you told me
that you hadn’t mastered the spells.

504
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,000
You delayed it for three days.

505
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,000
(Fengran)
If you failed again today,

506
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,630
I wouldn’t be soft on you.

507
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,760
Sure. Sure.

508
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,440
I’ll be scolded by you anyway.

509
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,790
I’ve long been used to it.

510
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,480
Houchi.

511
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,310
Still Spell.

512
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,920
- She made it. She made it!
- She made it!

513
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,760
Great!

514
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,680
Your Grace, you made it!

515
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,720
Your Grace, you finally made it!

516
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,960
Your Grace, you finally made it!

517
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,480
Not bad.

518
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,390
Another one.

519
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,520
Control Spell.

520
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,480
No, no, no.

521
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,390
I haven’t tried that spell.

522
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,200
You’ll know if you try it.

523
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,830
Gather your spiritual power
and use it on this thing.

524
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:00,790
Her Grace is so great!

525
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,630
- It’s great!
- It’s great!

526
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:03,760
Not bad.

527
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,350
Your Grace, you finally made it!

528
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:05,960
Yes.

529
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,390
Your hard work hasn’t been in vain
over the past ten thousand years.

530
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,110
I’ll teach you more powerful spells
tomorrow.

531
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,390
Your Grace.

532
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,280
Did you hear that?

533
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,760
Fengran never lied!

534
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,520
Even she praised you
for practicing well.

535
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,630
Your spiritual power

536
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,070
has really improved!

537
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,240
Yeah, that’s right!

538
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,390
Unbelievable! I made it!

539
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,790
I have practiced for so many years.

540
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,110
Why did I make it only this time?
