00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,340
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,050
Except for the undeserved
title of Goddess,

4
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,570
I’m not special at all.

5
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,730
Yet you keep making advances to me.

6
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,130
Why?

7
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,480
Who said you were not special?

8
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,440
Instead of asking about this,

9
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,400
why don’t you ask

10
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,280
who doesn’t say that about me

11
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,490
in the Three Realms?

12
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,490
Allow me to remind you that

13
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,890
both immortals and demons
value strength.

14
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,130
I’m not good enough for you.

15
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,330
Please do not bring it up again.

16
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,560
Come with me.

17
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,210
Taking a walk?

18
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,760
Where are they taking a walk?

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,010
No one is here in the woods.

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,370
Paper boy?

21
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,560
Paper boy!

22
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,210
Jingyuan must have found it.

23
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,560
Who are you?

24
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,690
How dared you stalk me!

25
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,040
North Sea Lord, please spare me.

26
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,210
I’m not a bad guy.

27
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,570
I’m Jiaye from the Qingchi Palace.

28
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,760
Jiaye?

29
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,890
Houchi told me about you.

30
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,930
I never expected a lord like you

31
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,930
to know me.

32
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,250
It’s my honor.

33
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:47,680
No.

34
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,930
My great honor.

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Why did you stalk me?

36
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,130
Don’t worry.

37
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,530
I didn’t mean any harm.

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,610
I just didn’t expect

39
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,810
to see you in person.

40
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,890
You mean I’m famous
in the Qingchi Palace?

41
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,850
Yes, you are.

42
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,960
All storybooks we read

43
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,320
are about you.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,210
You met the princess in the Heavenly
Palace when you were drunk.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760
You swept girls off their feet
only by wielding the sword.

46
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,000
All right. Stop it.

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,760
People made those stories up.

48
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,640
They’re not true.

49
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:16,890
Tell me.

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,360
Now that you heard such rumors,

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,170
did Houchi hear them, too?

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,210
She didn’t.

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,290
She focused on cultivation
over the past tens of thousands of years

54
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,610
and she wasn’t interested
in such stories.

55
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,570
That’s fine, then.

56
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,360
Lord,

57
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,000
you mean

58
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,250
you truly like

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,290
Her Grace?

60
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,250
Sure, I do.

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
Does she know?

62
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,650
I’ll let her know now.

63
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,730
Can you do the Condensing Spell?

64
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,090
Show me.

65
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,090
Try again.

66
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,850
Why?

67
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,010
In the Xuanjing Palace, I found that

68
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,520
there was a strong seal
inside your body.

69
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,800
Because of it,

70
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,730
your spiritual power’s been suppressed.

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,210
But this bracelet

72
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,490
gives you enough power
to protect yourself.

73
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,240
Houchi,

74
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,850
go to the Demon Realm with me

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
and I’ll try to break the seal.

76
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,850
Then you’ll understand

77
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,800
what Bai Jue’s soul said was true

78
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,130
when you were on Mount Lookout that day.

79
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,010
You should have been
the most respected one.

80
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,220
(Always Acquire New Knowledge)

81
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Go to the Demon Realm

82
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,370
and get my spiritual power back?

83
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,730
If I’m as powerful
as a Goddess should be,

84
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,400
maybe,

85
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,880
the Qingchi Palace
will return to normal.

86
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,370
After searching
the entire Qilian Mountains,

87
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,040
I found the most beautiful flowers.

88
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,370
They’re for you.

89
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,130
There’s something

90
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,730
I’ve kept in my mind for a long time.

91
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,400
I want to tell you...

92
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,010
Where did you

93
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,400
get the flowers?

94
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,850
In the west behind the mountains.

95
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,450
Did you only find some there,

96
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,370
rather than any other place?

97
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,400
How do you know?

98
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,130
I picked all of them.

99
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,680
They’re the priceless treasure

100
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Chang Que begged for
from the Flood Dragons

101
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,960
and they’re used as medicine.

102
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,760
It took him over a hundred years

103
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,240
to have finally grown them
on Qilian Mountains.

104
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,680
There’re only a few of them.

105
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
He has been expecting day and night

106
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,450
to see them bear fruits
after they wither.

107
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,330
But what have you done?

108
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,730
You’ve destroyed them.

109
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,290
Shall... Shall I...?

110
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,450
Shall I put them back?

111
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,920
I don’t think they’ll survive.

112
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,800
Who on earth

113
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,240
stole my flowers?

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,330
What’s wrong with him?

115
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,730
Are these flowers for picking?

116
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,050
I...

117
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,450
I’ll find the seeds for him.

118
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,770
Idiot.

119
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,010
Now that Qingmu has owned
the Taicang Spear,

120
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,480
he’s really become
the strongest immortal.

121
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,170
Heavenly Mother,
what do you think of him?

122
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,800
According to your father,

123
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,920
you adore him?

124
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,920
I’ve never adored anyone
like that before.

125
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,570
All I want is to spend my life with him

126
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
and love each other forever.

127
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,130
Many immortals like you.

128
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,170
Why do you like him only?

129
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,130
I’ve been the princess
in the Heavenly Palace.

130
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,130
All immortals flatter me or fear me

131
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,130
every time they see me.

132
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,890
Only Qingmu is different.

133
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,800
He’s neither humble nor pushy to me.

134
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,330
When he told Jingjian about his journeys
in the Three Realms,

135
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,960
he gave animated narratives.

136
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,290
I like how free he feels.

137
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,480
I hope that

138
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,080
I can go travelling with him

139
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,200
and be a happy couple.

140
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,330
But forced love does not last.

141
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,800
I heard that

142
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,570
Houchi took him away.

143
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,330
Don’t believe rumors, Heavenly Mother.

144
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,640
In the Three Realms, I know him best,

145
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,240
second to Jingjian.

146
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,450
He never got close to girls.

147
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,800
Houchi must have used some spells

148
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,360
to lure him away.

149
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,450
Heavenly Mother,

150
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,890
I’m your own daughter.

151
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,800
Don’t show partiality for Houchi.

152
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,520
Why would I be partial to her?

153
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,890
I just don’t want you to lose
in the relationship.

154
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,960
I know.

155
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,080
You gave me the Feather Umbrella

156
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,400
so that I wouldn’t lose to Houchi again.

157
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,520
But on Mount Lookout,

158
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,850
it felt as if
it weren’t of one mind with me.

159
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,360
It didn’t take my order for a while.

160
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,050
Really?

161
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,200
Take it out

162
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,570
and let me check.

163
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,770
I’ll kill you!

164
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,890
It’s him!

165
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,480
Demon Power?

166
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,890
Heavenly Mother,

167
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,570
who was able to put Demon Power

168
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,850
on your weapon?

169
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,770
Leave me alone.

170
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,480
Yes.

171
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,860
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

172
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,020
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

173
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,600
Since the God Realm was closed,

174
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,570
the Pilgrimage Hall came down
to the Heavenly Realm.

175
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,280
I had thought that

176
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,770
I, Muguang,

177
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,010
and Gu Jun were the last Gods.

178
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,770
Unexpectedly, he...

179
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,160
Sixty thousand years have passed.

180
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,280
Four True Gods are forever sealed
with the God Realm.

181
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,240
Even if you’re Tianqi, so what?

182
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,770
In the existing Heavenly Realm,

183
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,450
I won’t let you enjoy your life.

184
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:30,890
Qingmu,

185
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,530
why are you here?

186
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,450
Where’s Jiaye?

187
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,090
I sent him away.

188
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,770
I want to make a good breakfast for you.

189
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,890
I’m making some pear soup.

190
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,360
I don’t think there’re pears here.

191
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,720
Where did you get them?

192
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,360
I got up early and bought them
in the Human Realm.

193
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,410
You haven’t recovered yet.

194
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,010
Why did you...?

195
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,090
Be seated.

196
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,130
You know what?

197
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,840
It’s complicated to make such soup.

198
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,240
I could have used the Fire Spell

199
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,410
to control the degree of heating.

200
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,010
However,

201
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,650
it’s our way to cook.

202
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,450
I’d like to use the way humans do.

203
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,970
Leave the soup to simmer.

204
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,890
It takes a long time, then.

205
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,770
It’ll taste good
when it’s crispy and soft.

206
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,840
Why are you staring at me?

207
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,720
I never expected that

208
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,600
apart from that you look handsome

209
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,360
and you have strong power,

210
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,010
you even cooked well.

211
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:32,970
I didn’t cook well.

212
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,360
I just learnt it.

213
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,010
Last time when I made
steamed stuffed buns for you,

214
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,840
I nearly burned the Xuanjing Palace.

215
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,650
No matter what you cook for me,

216
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,240
I’ll enjoy it.

217
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,130
I’ll cook for no one but you.

218
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,280
Let me help you.

219
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,920
All right.

220
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,410
It’s almost done, isn’t it?

221
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,450
Let me try some.

222
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,330
What?

223
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,720
Nothing.

224
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,240
It’s not good enough yet.

225
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,600
It needs to be simmered longer.

226
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,800
Who? Come out!

227
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,210
Who on earth are you?

228
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,280
Why don’t you dare to show your face?

229
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,650
I never expected Demon Lord Ziyue

230
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
to collude with the Qingchi Palace.

231
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,280
Now that you came,

232
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,160
never dream to leave.

233
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,210
You don’t dare to fight me?

234
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,530
Why?

235
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,720
In case I recognize you?

236
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,300
Such strong spiritual power.

237
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,240
Wait for me here.

238
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,480
It’s you?

239
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,240
Before I go see you,

240
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,920
how dare you come to me!

241
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,330
Considering your existing power,

242
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,920
you can’t scare me!

243
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,240
Who are you?

244
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,530
How dared you intrude into
the Qingchi Palace!

245
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,890
Bai Jue?

246
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,010
No.

247
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,010
He isn’t Bai Jue.

248
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,600
He’s just Qingmu.

249
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,240
Who was it?

250
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,450
Just a humble phoenix.

251
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,010
Houchi, are you hurt?

252
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,770
Your Highness.

253
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,240
Is something bothering you,
Your Highness?

254
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,800
I went to the Qingchi Palace today.

255
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,480
I found out that Demon Lord Ziyue

256
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,330
used to be Tianqi.

257
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,720
The Demon God of Destruction?

258
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,570
Wasn’t he executed by Master Bai Jue

259
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,330
sixty thousand years ago?

260
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,090
I don’t know why he’s still alive.

261
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,480
But luckily,

262
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,680
he hasn’t got back
the power of True God.

263
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,890
He isn’t a threat yet.

264
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,240
Your Highness, you’d better

265
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,680
tell His Majesty about it.

266
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,450
When the Demon God of Destruction
is alive,

267
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,600
it’s a threat to the Three Realms.

268
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,450
He knows one of my secrets

269
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,680
and he could threaten me with that.

270
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,800
I can’t let His Majesty know that.

271
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,890
You mustn’t tell anyone else, either.

272
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,240
I’m loyal to you alone

273
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,090
and I won’t ever betray you.

274
00:16:59,010 --> 00:16:59,800
Fengnyu,

275
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,160
I picked you as my personal maid
from the Feng Clan.

276
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,130
I trust you.

277
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,480
But I can’t let Demon Lord Ziyue live.

278
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,720
All I can do now

279
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,410
is keep making enemies of demons

280
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,890
and never give him a breathing spell.

281
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,330
But immortals and demons have been
in a stalemate for years.

282
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,570
His Majesty wants a peace negotiation.

283
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,130
What can we do?

284
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,800
Qingmu.

285
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,010
The Taicang Spear.

286
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,480
We don’t know who Qingmu really is.

287
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,840
If he really is Bai Jue,

288
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,920
maybe I can make use of him

289
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,130
to fight the demons.

290
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,770
If he isn’t,

291
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,330
I can also use him

292
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,650
to fight for me.

293
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,680
Heavenly Mother.

294
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,890
Leave us.

295
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,090
Yes.

296
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,280
Greetings, Heavenly Mother.

297
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,210
Why are you saluting like this?

298
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,770
I want to beg you for something.

299
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,800
Please ask Heavenly Father

300
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,920
to...

301
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,970
to grant me a marriage.

302
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,530
Who on earth is she?

303
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,840
Why did she come to my Qingchi Palace?

304
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,720
Ignore it.

305
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,600
I’m her target.

306
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,240
Now that she saw me,

307
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,720
she wouldn’t come again.

308
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
She’s an immortal

309
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,130
and she broke into my Qingchi Palace.

310
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,440
I’m afraid I can’t ignore it.

311
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,200
Don’t overthink.

312
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,130
If you get too much time,

313
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,770
why not bother about my love affairs?

314
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,480
She’s your old sweetheart?

315
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,170
That low phoenix...

316
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,010
It’s none of your business, anyway.

317
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,840
I’ll take care of it.

318
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,410
Can I not take care of it

319
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,130
or do you think

320
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,200
I’m too weak to take care of it?

321
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,770
Both.

322
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
You said that

323
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,960
you could remove the seal in me?

324
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,320
Yes.

325
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,720
We must pay a price for everything.

326
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,560
Now that you found the seal in me,

327
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,890
my father must have found it, too.

328
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,440
Yet he didn’t tell me.

329
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,770
Must I pay the price

330
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,930
if I want to remove the seal

331
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,770
from my body?

332
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,440
It’s wise of you.

333
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,720
Houchi,

334
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,720
there’s this Spiritual Strength
sleeping in your body.

335
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,560
To have it sealed,

336
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,650
your spiritual veins are sealed, too.

337
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,720
If you want to unseal it

338
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,480
and cultivate your power,

339
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,690
when you do it,

340
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,890
the Spiritual Strength wakes up, too.

341
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,130
If it wakes up,

342
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,480
what will happen to me?

343
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,600
I’m not sure.

344
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,480
Maybe you can exist with it.

345
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,770
Or maybe you two will become one

346
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,010
and you will no longer be
who you are now.

347
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,650
Lord Qingmu,

348
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,480
however powerful you are,

349
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,560
you can’t get her back
by staring at the door, can you?

350
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,240
Houchi,

351
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,360
if it’s unsealed,

352
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,410
you’ll become the most powerful being.

353
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
It will protect you

354
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,480
and the Qingchi Palace.

355
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,170
No one can bully you again.

356
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,480
I simply pushed you.

357
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,240
Why are you bleeding already?

358
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,010
I was just raided and injured.

359
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,130
Now you...

360
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,440
Houchi,

361
00:20:59,130 --> 00:20:59,930
don’t leave.

362
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,080
It hurts.

363
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
I’m not leaving.

364
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,930
I’ll stay with you.

365
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,170
Feeling better?

366
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,410
Much better.

367
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,650
Let me check.

368
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,360
Houchi!

369
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,560
Qingmu.

370
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,360
Now that you’re injured,

371
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,890
go back for some rest.

372
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,650
Don’t catch a cold.

373
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,650
I was injured in this Qingchi Palace.

374
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,010
Houchi should take responsibility.

375
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,560
North Sea Lord,
aren’t you interfering too much?

376
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,240
Qingmu, stop it.

377
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,010
What a blood deficiency
and vein disorder!

378
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,440
It’s a sign of death.

379
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,440
You’re indeed badly injured.

380
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,600
Houchi,

381
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,010
I’m too weak to leave.

382
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,010
I’m afraid I have to stay here

383
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,890
for a few more days.

384
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,840
Sure.

385
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,690
Stay here for recuperation.

386
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,560
I don’t think

387
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,770
ordinary medicine can cure you.

388
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,130
You need acupuncture.

389
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,410
Houchi,

390
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,130
where are your needles?

391
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,930
How can you cure me

392
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,170
with a mere medical skill
from the Human Realm?

393
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,600
I have great medical skills.

394
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,600
You have more spiritual power than me.

395
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,130
But you were injured
in the Qingchi Palace.

396
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,130
It’s my duty to cure you.

397
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,690
Aren’t you an immortal
from the Heavenly Palace?

398
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,010
What do you have to do
with the Qingchi Palace?

399
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,170
It had nothing to do with me before.

400
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,840
But from now on,

401
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,010
its problem is also mine.

402
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,080
Houchi,

403
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,960
I want to go back to my room for a rest.

404
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,440
Demon Lord, do you feel better?

405
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,420
(Fuyao Hall)

406
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,010
Heavenly Father,

407
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,050
I thought a lot when I was grounded.

408
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,170
I was so shortsighted

409
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,410
that I valued Ziyuan
to pay my personal favor

410
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,600
and caused disharmony among immortals.

411
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,240
I was wrong.

412
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,080
I’m relieved

413
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,050
to hear that.

414
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,320
You’re my eldest son.

415
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,240
You must value the Three Realms
above everything else.

416
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,770
Don’t act on impulse again.

417
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,720
Yes, Heavenly Father.

418
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,440
You may rise.

419
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,840
We know where the Twin Spear is.

420
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,560
The Taicang Spear has picked its owner.

421
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,410
The Demon King also allowed me

422
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,410
to look for the Purple Moon Whip
in the Demon Realm.

423
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,050
Now, I want you and Jingjian

424
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,690
to look for the Ancestral Sword.

425
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,560
Let Jingyang do it.

426
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,130
Yeah.

427
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,080
What a poor memory I have!

428
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,240
Jingjian,

429
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,480
stay here.

430
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,960
We’ve got another mission for you.

431
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,810
It’s been many years
since people gossiped

432
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,810
about Jingzhao and the North Sea Lord.

433
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,960
Jingzhao was young.

434
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,720
But now she has grown up.

435
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,930
As her parents,

436
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,320
we should care more about that.

437
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,600
Now that North Sea Lord
doesn’t want to come,

438
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,560
go invite him for us.

439
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,050
Now, he owns the Taicang Spear

440
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,770
and he means a lot to us.

441
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,240
I want him to come
and command the armies.

442
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,600
Now that Jingzhao likes him,

443
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:00,890
Jingjian,

444
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,010
go to the Qingchi Palace with my edict

445
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,320
which makes him the commander

446
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,010
and grants him the marriage
with Jingzhao.

447
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,010
It’s wise of you, Your Majesty.

448
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,930
When he’s the commander of armies,

449
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,170
he’s good enough for our daughter.

450
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,810
Heavenly Father.

451
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,690
Heavenly Mother.

452
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,010
Qingmu always lives a free life.

453
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,840
I don’t think he wants
to be the commander.

454
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,200
Besides,

455
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,840
the thing between him and Jingzhao

456
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
is just a rumor among troublemakers.

457
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,440
Don’t take it seriously.

458
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,960
But Jingjian,

459
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,650
I’m serious.

460
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,440
Jingzhao,

461
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,080
if Qingmu really loved you,

462
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,690
he would have come and proposed to you,

463
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,560
instead of hiding in the Qingchi Palace.

464
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,840
Heavenly Father,

465
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,240
Jingzhao is an excellent girl.

466
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,170
She will have a good husband.

467
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,410
Why must we force Qingmu?

468
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,170
Jingjian,

469
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,010
you’re my own brother!

470
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:50,840
Jingjian,

471
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,130
you mean

472
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,130
Jingzhao isn’t up to
Qingmu’s preference?

473
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,010
Heavenly Father, that’s not true.

474
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:58,770
Jingzhao.

475
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,290
Jingjian,

476
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,240
you’re a close friend of Qingmu’s.

477
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,720
But it’s about love stuff.

478
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,930
How do you know

479
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,560
he’ll turn us down?

480
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,890
But he...

481
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,930
Say no more.

482
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,650
Just go and invite him.

483
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:20,960
Yes.

484
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
Mother knew Qingmu wouldn’t agree.

485
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,410
Why did she force me to invite him?

486
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,440
Isn’t she making me unwelcome?

487
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,320
If I tell them why I come,

488
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,890
Fengran will blame me.

489
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,130
How about this?

490
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,720
When I reach the Qingchi Palace,

491
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,560
I’ll tell Qingmu about it secretly

492
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
and ask him to write a letter

493
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,440
to decline the offer.

494
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,560
Your Highness,

495
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,200
the Queen of Heaven ordered us

496
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,770
to go to the Qingchi Palace with you.

497
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,840
Do we really need so many people?

498
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:00,770
The Queen of Heaven said that

499
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,890
demons often made trouble

500
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,530
to harass the Heavenly Realm.

501
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,960
She didn’t want you to get hurt.

502
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,440
She wasn’t worried
when I went to the Demon Region.

503
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,810
But she is worried
when I’m going to the Qingchi Palace.

504
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,810
Leave me alone.

505
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,530
I’m going by myself.

506
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,650
What?

507
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,200
Didn’t I make myself clear?

508
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,080
Don’t blame us, Your Highness.

509
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,530
We’re taking the order.

510
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,720
We dare not disobey the order.

511
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Your Highness,
please don’t embarrass us.

512
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,770
Demon Lord Ziyue is fastening
on Houchi every day.

513
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,530
I can’t just wait and do nothing.

514
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,170
I’m taking her to Dibei Town
in the Human Realm

515
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,530
where no one could disturb us.

516
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,560
I can then tell her

517
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,410
all my feelings.

518
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,690
Do you think she’ll turn me down?

519
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,840
If she turns me down,

520
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,080
I’ll burn you.

521
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,170
Houchi.

522
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,010
Lord Qingmu.

523
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,130
Where’s Houchi?

524
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,010
Demon Lord Ziyue said
he didn’t feel well

525
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,600
and early this morning,
he asked Her Grace

526
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,050
to take a walk with him
behind the mountains.

527
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:40,960
What a demon!

528
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
He always tricks her.

529
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,890
Why did you bring it out?

530
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,320
Be careful!

531
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,960
Be careful!

532
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:52,890
Luckily, it’s not broken.

533
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,050
Lord Qingmu,

534
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,360
give it to me

535
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,530
and let me put it back.

536
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,600
It’s her treasure

537
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,690
that she never allows anyone to touch.

538
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,050
Treasure?

539
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,080
It contains no spiritual power at all

540
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,290
and it’s her treasure?

541
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,530
Lord Boxuan gave it to her.

542
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,560
She values it.

543
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,170
Boxuan gave it to her?

544
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,840
For her birthday
every five thousand years,

545
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,480
Lord Boxuan

546
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,360
would carve something
and give it to her.

547
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,290
It’s a birthday present for Houchi?

548
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,320
Yes.

549
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,050
(The sixth of the ninth lunar month)

550
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,360
The sixth of the ninth lunar month.

551
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,130
Today?

552
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,050
Today is Houchi’s birthday?

553
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,050
Lord Qingmu,

554
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,200
don’t mention the birthday thing

555
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,360
in front of Her Grace.

556
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:32,560
Why?

557
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,010
After Lord Boxuan left,

558
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,650
she hated the birthday thing most.

559
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,240
She didn’t allow us
to celebrate it for her.

560
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,290
If anyone dared to mention it,

561
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,360
she would not speak to him
for half a month.

562
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,890
Father is travelling around
to find treasures for me

563
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,890
and he seldom comes back.

564
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,770
Fengran wasn’t there yet.

565
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,240
The Qingchi Palace was cold and lonely.

566
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,770
No one accompanied me, but Boxuan.

567
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,600
Later, Boxuan left, too.

568
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,890
I never left Qingchi Palace.

569
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,080
So,

570
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,240
that’s how

571
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,050
you grew up.

572
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,770
I kind of envy you sometimes

573
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,130
that you lost your memories.

574
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,690
Jiaye,

575
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,170
could you do me a favor?

576
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,960
Are you sure
you’ll celebrate her birthday?

577
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,170
We didn’t forget her birthday,

578
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:30,890
but she...

579
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:31,650
I know.

580
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,200
She doesn’t like to celebrate it.

581
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,480
Then why do you take the trouble?

582
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,810
From this day on,

583
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,480
I’ll celebrate
all her birthdays with her.

584
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,240
You’d better keep your promise.

585
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,410
As for the seal inside me,

586
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,320
I’ve made up my mind

587
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,770
not to unseal it.

588
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,170
I’m Houchi.

589
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
I’m not going to be anyone else.

590
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,290
Keep this instruction feather.

591
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
If you’re in trouble,

592
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,050
you can find me with it.

593
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,080
Thank you, Demon Lord Ziyue.

594
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,010
But we’re always neutral

595
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,290
and we won’t show partiality for demons.

596
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,930
What are you thinking about?

597
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,960
This thing is my personal belongings.

598
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,360
It represents my friendship towards you,

599
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,840
instead of anything else.

600
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:22,600
But...

601
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,410
Demon Lord Ziyue.

602
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,650
Houchi,

603
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,600
it’s my...

604
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,540
Your Grace,

605
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,740
I know you’re busy.

606
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,460
But you have many men around you.

607
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,700
Shouldn’t you be equal?

608
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,780
You can’t ignore someone, can you?

609
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,420
What do you mean?

610
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,540
What’re you here for?

611
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,940
Come with me and you’ll know.

612
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,700
Let’s go.

613
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,580
Houchi.

614
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,540
What’s he doing?

615
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,420
What else can he do?

616
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,900
Just something for you.

617
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,420
Look.

618
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,340
I wonder if she’ll like
the birthday noodles.

619
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,140
Birthday noodles?

620
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,780
You told him?

621
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,340
I didn’t.

622
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,540
The noisy rabbit did.

623
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,540
I didn’t tell him anything.

624
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,780
Houchi?

625
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,660
The noodles taste best now.

626
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,540
Try some.

627
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,420
Are you hungry?

628
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,580
I don’t celebrate my birthday.

629
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,340
Try some.

630
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,180
Come on.

631
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,580
Taste good?

632
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,020
If they do, I’ll cook them
for you every year.

633
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,300
Don’t tease me.

634
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,700
I’m serious.

635
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,900
I’ll make birthday noodles
for you every year.

636
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,020
Not only on birthdays.

637
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,700
Whenever you want some,

638
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,780

Come on.

642
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,220
Qingmu,

643
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,940
why did you take me here?

644
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
You like fireflies.

645
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,700
There’re many fireflies
on Qilian Mountains.

646
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,300
But it’s indeed hard to catch some

647
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,180
in the daytime.

648
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,060
It took me much trouble

649
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,180
to find 9,900 fireflies for you.

650
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,820
Now that it took much trouble,

651
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,300
why did you still do that?

652
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,820
Because you like them.

653
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,300
I’ll do anything that you like.

654
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,700
And I’ll avoid anything you don’t like.

655
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,700

656
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,900
I’ll go travelling with you to enjoy it.

657
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,060
If you like a peaceful life,

658
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,940
I can live a peaceful life with you

659
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,220
