00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:28,420
=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,940
Whatever the truth is,

4
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,860
the priority now is to get the Spear.

5
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,260
Mount Lookout is in the spotlight now.

6
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,500
The Demons may be attracted there.

7
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,720
Donghua,

8
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,700
pass my edict immediately.

9
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,300
Every immortal lord can fight
for the Spear.

10
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,180
Whoever makes the Spear choose him

11
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,740
will own it.

12
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,820
But Your Majesty,
when immortals and demons come,

13
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,180
I’m afraid there’ll be a disturbance.

14
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,100
Don’t worry.

15
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,220
I’ll also be there.

16
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,580
If any disturbance occurs,

17
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,340
I’ll personally handle it.

18
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,540
Yes.

19
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,380
Why did the Taicang Spear reappear?

20
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,060
The Fire Kylin?

21
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,340
Is Bai Jue really alive?

22
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,540
Anyway,

23
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,500
you were far too impetuous.

24
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,220
That was Demon King Sen Jian!

25
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,420
Luckily, you survived.

26
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,660
I was trying to save you.

27
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,300
You could have used many other ways.

28
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,020
If you risk yourself
like that once more,

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,780
I won’t take care of you ever again.

30
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,900
Do you hear me?

31
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,540
Yes.

32
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,300
May I talk now?

33
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,260
It’s the life-saving pellet
my father gave me.

34
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,700
Eat it.

35
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,140
Feed me.

36
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,340
How cruel!

37
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,180
If I were choked to death,

38
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,140
you would regret.

39
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,660
North Sea Lord,

40
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,100
during the fight,

41
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,100
you went too far several times.

42
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,940
If you talk nonsense again,

43
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,260
during the long life,

44
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,180
I won’t mind making you mute

45
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,620
for more tens of thousands of years.

46
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,300
Houchi,

47
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,980
since we met on Mount Lookout,

48
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,380
I’ve felt we knew each other before.

49
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,620
I know you don’t believe this

50
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,700
and you don’t like it
when I follow you without permission.

51
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,460
But we went through
a life-and-death fight.

52
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,780
What’s your point?

53
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,860
I mean

54
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,780
it’s my first time to like someone.

55
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,540
I adore you.

56
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,220
North Sea Lord,

57
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,340
I have no other feelings for you.

58
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,060
I’m too busy with important things

59
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,140
to get stuck in love.

60
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,900
I know.

61
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,260
You’re looking for Boxuan.

62
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,260
But now that I confessed to you,

63
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,260
I won’t take it back.

64
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,300
If you still feel upset about it,

65
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,220
I’ll stick to you and won’t leave.

66
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,420
Who’s upset about it?

67
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,060
Then why are you staring at me?

68
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,500
Are you blackmailing me?

69
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,220
Yeah.

70
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,220
Like you said,

71
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,740
I’m the plaster.

72
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,100
I should stick to you.

73
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,700
What if I won’t change my mind?

74
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,300
Then I’ll learn from Xiaoli

75
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,100
to pretend to be sick
and let you take care of me.

76
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,260
I’m not Sen Yu.

77
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,620
I won’t be easily softhearted.

78
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,580
Take the pellet regularly.

79
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:14,940
Houchi.

80
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,420
Why is Prince Jingjian still here?

81
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,460
Fengran, don’t you hate the ones
from the Heavenly Palace?

82
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,340
I was so careless

83
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,140
that I fell into his trap.

84
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,860
Goddess Houchi,

85
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,180
enjoy yourselves.

86
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,420
Pretend I weren’t here.

87
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,820
Greetings, Goddess Houchi.

88
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,580
Greetings, too.

89
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,900
Please be seated over there.

90
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,340
Thank you for helping us last time

91
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,740
and for letting Qingmu stay here
for recovery.

92
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,700
I’m quite grateful.

93
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,740
You’re welcome, Goddess.

94
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,540
I didn’t help much.

95
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,140
Now that you’re Fengran’s friend,

96
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,980
call me Houchi.

97
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,020
All right, then.

98
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
How’s Lord Qingmu doing?

99
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,340
He’s tough.

100
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,420
We don’t need to worry.

101
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,100
Lord Qingmu has deep feelings for you.

102
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,660
He’s a good man rare to be seen.

103
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
Your Grace,

104
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,260
you should cherish such love.

105
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,140
Don’t overthink.

106
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,580
We’re just friends.

107
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,860
Through the last fight,

108
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,660
I changed my view towards him.

109
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,580
I think he’s a straightforward man

110
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,700
and he’s nice to you.

111
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,660
In the Heavenly Realm,

112
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,220
most men say they love you,

113
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,340
but run away in case of danger.

114
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,700
In a life-and-death fight,

115
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,620
how many men could protect us
with their lives?

116
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,700
I’m not as lucky as you

117
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,020
to meet such a loyal man.

118
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:58,980
Chang Qin,

119
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,060
I heard that the fox confessed

120
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,580
she was pretending to be sick

121
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,020
and Sen Yu exiled her to garrison
the Demon Region.

122
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,180
You’re even so well-informed

123
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,460
about what happens
in the Xuanjing Palace?

124
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,420
I’ve got many friends.

125
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,740
She mostly get gossips.

126
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,580
Houchi.

127
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,140
Qin,

128
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,340
if you hesitate, you lose.

129
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,380
Maybe it’s not the one you can’t forget,

130
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,420
but the old days when you were with him.

131
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,180
You’re a girl yearning for freedom.

132
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,220
Never should you be stuck
in the Xuanjing Palace.

133
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,780
After you’re done with your business,

134
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,100
come to the Qingchi Palace.

135
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,820
Let’s drink and get hammered.

136
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,460
You’ll be warmly welcomed

137
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,700
to the Qingchi Palace.

138
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,580
Take care.

139
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,060
Besides that,

140
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,580
I also heard something important,

141
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,660
about Boxuan.

142
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,060
Tell me about it.

143
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,180
Who just mocked me for gossiping?

144
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,180
Tell me!

145
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,580
Tell me first

146
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,740
what happened

147
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,380
to you and Qingmu lately?

148
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,500
Why don’t you tell me

149
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,820
what happened to you and Jingjian?

150
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,700
I...

151
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,620
Master,

152
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,620
if Wu Huan hadn’t tricked Goddess Yuemi,

153
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,460
she wouldn’t have died a tragic death
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

154
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,460
These years, Wu Huan did
countless dirty things

155
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,500
when she tried to annex the Demons.

156
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,900
Muguang and she are birds of a feather.

157
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,740
Why must we negotiate peace with them?

158
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,020
Since I woke up,

159
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,140
I’ve been failing to return to True God

160
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,340
because of the thin spiritual aura
in the Demon Realm.

161
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,220
But Muguang and Wu Huan
have cultivated themselves

162
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,740
in the Heavenly Palace
for sixty thousand years.

163
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,300
They’re much more powerful than before.

164
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,020
Don’t say that, Master.

165
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,660
If you didn’t sacrifice
your Purple Moon Power

166
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,180
for all demons’ cultivation,

167
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,940
regardless of your own,

168
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,100
we would have been annexed.

169
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,940
How would we still live in peace?

170
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,980
I hear Bai Jue’s Taicang Spear

171
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,140
has appeared on Mount Lookout?

172
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,340
Yes.

173
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,180
Muguang sent his son
for peace negotiations,

174
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,780
simply because he wants
the Purple Moon Whip

175
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,540
so that he can reopen the God Realm
with Four Weapons.

176
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,540
But that year,

177
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,100
you activated the Destruction Formation

178
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,620
and was known as a guilty man.

179
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,420
Even if the God Realm is reopened,

180
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,100
it does no good to you.

181
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,740
I know you’re loyal to me.

182
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,420
But if they get the Taicang Spear,

183
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,780
the Immortals will stand
a better chance.

184
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,140
How about exchanging
the peace negotiations

185
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,900
for the chance to get the Spear?

186
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,860
That’s the best plan.

187
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,460
You’re right, Master.

188
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,940
I was far too short-sighted.

189
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,860
I’ll go get it done immediately.

190
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,980
So, such a big thing happened

191
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,220
on Mount Lookout.

192
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,140
You said that

193
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,620
there was God power of Fire in Boxuan.

194
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,140
The Fire Kylin is
an ancient Divine Beast.

195
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,060
It has the power of fire, too.

196
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,620
Boxuan was missing on Mount Lookout,

197
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,980
and now the Fire Kylin appeared on that.

198
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,140
Are they related?

199
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,060
When I check on Mount Lookout,

200
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,620
I’ll know if the Fire Kylin is Boxuan.

201
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,180
Go with Jingjian to the Heavenly Palace
to untie the Magic Rope.

202
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,740
As for Qingmu,

203
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,620
let him stay here for recuperation.

204
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,580
No!

205
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,540
If you’re going to look for Boxuan,

206
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,060
I must go with you.

207
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,940
You just had a big fight
with the Demon King.

208
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,740
You shouldn’t go on a long trip.

209
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,740
Mount Lookout is in the teeth
of the storm,

210
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,980
where immortals and demons gather.

211
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,140
You might be in danger if you go alone.

212
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,700
You’re badly wounded.

213
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,340
Stay for recuperation

214
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,300
and take care of yourself.

215
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,620
I just ate the pellet you gave me

216
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,980
and I’m feeling much better.

217
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,740
Pellets from the Qingchi Palace
are really extraordinary.

218
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,740
Don’t give me that.

219
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,500
Go back and lie in bed.

220
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,980
Lady Fengran.

221
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,220
Don’t call me.

222
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,380
I’m on her side

223
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,100
and I can’t help you.

224
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,580
Jingjian, say something for me.

225
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,380
He’s calling you.

226
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,220
I won’t listen.

227
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,380
I won’t listen.

228
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,860
Why are you all staring at me?

229
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,740
I hear the Fire Kylin
hurt Lord Xianshan,

230
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,860
the disciple of Lord Donghua.

231
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,940
It’s a fierce beast.

232
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,980
I’ll worry if you go alone.

233
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,060
How about

234
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,540
letting Qingmu go with you?

235
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,860
Just because it’s a dangerous trip,

236
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,300
I don’t want to take him.

237
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,580
You don’t know him.

238
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,620
He loves defending the weak.

239
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,340
If he gets into any conflict,

240
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,060
he’ll be wounded again

241
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,740
and his further cultivation
will be harmed.

242
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,100
I didn’t know you cared about him.

243
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,300
I don’t.

244
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,580
Jingjian!

245
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,340
It’s a misunderstanding.

246
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,340
A misunderstanding.

247
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,500
The Magic Rope just pulled me

248
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,980
so that I touched the door accidentally.

249
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,540
Shall I cut off your hand, then?

250
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,860
You won’t have the same trouble again.

251
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,980
No, no, don’t bother.

252
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,820
I’ll leave you alone.

253
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,820
It’s your fault!

254
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,700
You insisted on eavesdropping

255
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,260
and got me scolded, too.

256
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,060
Remember.

257
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,900
You owe me ten jars
of North Sea iced liquor.

258
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,060
Rest assured.

259
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,220
You’ll have them.

260
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,860
It’s a useful rope.

261
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,900
Do you have another one?

262
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,700
Give it to me

263
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,220
so that I can be tied to Houchi.

264
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,500
We haven’t met
for only a couple of days,

265
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,140
and why do you sound so...?

266
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,260
You have no idea.

267
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,700
Houchi and I had a predestined fate.

268
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,220
Where did you learn it?

269
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,220
From the story book in the Human Realm?

270
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,860
You don’t trust me?

271
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,620
Absolutely not.

272
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,540
Aren’t you not good at
getting close to any lady?

273
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,820
Do you remember the sword grave
on Mount Lookout?

274
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,900
You couldn’t see it,

275
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,060
but I could.

276
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,700
She could get in there, too.

277
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,820
Also,

278
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,180
this is her bracelet.

279
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,540
It’s the same as mine.

280
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,740
They were made by the same man.

281
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,540
So,

282
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,980
this is why

283
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,580
you fell in love with her?

284
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,020
She’s sometimes clumsy,

285
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,300
sometimes stubborn

286
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,220
and sometimes clever.

287
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,580
She’s indeed lovely.

288
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,820
I...

289
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,820
Anyway, when staying with Houchi,

290
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,540
I did many fantastic things.

291
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,500
I never expected to see you in love

292
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,620
before I died.

293
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,020
I’ve got my life worth.

294
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,900
When your sister said she liked me

295
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,700
and tried to see me with excuses,

296
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,020
I didn’t understand

297
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,460
and I felt annoyed.

298
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,500
But now,

299
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,940
I indeed experience

300
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,260
how she was feeling.

301
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,660
My poor sister.

302
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,740
She ignores many other immortals,

303
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,020
but only likes you...

304
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,900
In love,

305
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,380
no one can be forced.

306
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,740
How does Houchi feel for you?

307
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,180
Does she adore you, too?

308
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,660
I won’t give up, anyway.

309
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,900
Got it.

310
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,060
Let me help you.

311
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,900
Excuse me,

312
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,940
may I have a word?

313
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,940
My father has gone to Mount Lookout now.

314
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,340
Lady Fengran and I will go to him

315
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,940
to untie the Magic Rope.

316
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,100
Why don’t we four go together

317
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,380
so that we can take care of each other?

318
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:35,900
Yeah.

319
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,580
You make sense.

320
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,260
I think Qingmu is too stubborn

321
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,820
to let you go alone.

322
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,180
Why don’t you

323
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,220
just satisfy him?

324
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,420
All right, then.

325
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,980
Let’s go together.

326
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,340
I’ve received
my father’s instruction feather,

327
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,620
and he’s in the Daze Mansion.

328
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,660
Let’s get up the mountain.

329
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,780
Fengran,

330
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,860
go with Prince Jingjian to see
the Heavenly Emperor

331
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,340
and ask him to untie the Magic Rope.

332
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,940
I’ll wait for you behind the mountain.

333
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,900
Houchi,

334
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,020
my father often mentioned

335
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,740
his old friendship with Lord Gu Jun.

336
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,740
And we’ve been expecting a chance

337
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,380
to mend fences with the Qingchi Palace.

338
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,100
Jingjian,

339
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,380
go with Fengran to see your father.

340
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,140
I’ll stay and accompany Houchi.

341
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,260
All right.

342
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,540
See you later behind the mountain.

343
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,220
Before the Spear picks its owner,

344
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,660
the Heavenly Emperor must be here.

345
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,300
Jingzhao will also come, I guess.

346
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,780
How long can you still avoid them?

347
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,500
Who told you I was avoiding them?

348
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,020
I’m not scared of Jingzhao.

349
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,820
You’re not?

350
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:47,940
Let’s go, then.

351
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,500
No.

352
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,660
I’m not going with you.

353
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,340
I don’t want to be hated by all ladies.

354
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,700
All right.

355
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,700
This time,

356
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,740
I’ll announce to everyone.

357
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,900
What?

358
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,660
No one can get me,

359
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,380
but Goddess Houchi.

360
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,500
How dare you!

361
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,780
I risked my life for you.

362
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,980
For the sake of that,

363
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,340
shouldn’t you defend me from the ladies?

364
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,020
Nonsense.

365
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,540
I’m not speaking to you.

366
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,460
All right. Don’t get angry.

367
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,220
I know.

368
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,820
You don’t want to see anyone
from the Heavenly Palace.

369
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,140
I’ve got an idea.

370
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,140
What is it?

371
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,300
Jingzhao will not recognize you.

372
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,580
What do you think?

373
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,660
Then I can carry you

374
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,300
in my sleeve.

375
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,420
Qingmu,

376
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,260
how dare you turn me into a frog!

377
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,860
You...

378
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,260
What about now?

379
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,180
Qingmu, don’t push it!

380
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,220
All right. No more joke.

381
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,660
Are you satisfied now?

382
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,060
Good.

383
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,020
(Daze Mansion)

384
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,500
Heavenly Father.

385
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,340
Heavenly Father,

386
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,260
Lady Fengran and I were tied

387
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,620
to the Magic Rope by accident.

388
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,260
Could you please untie us?

389
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

390
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
It’s been years
since I last visited the Qingchi Palace.

391
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,460
Is Gu Jun back from his journey?

392
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,580
He isn’t back ever.

393
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,980
Now that you left the Qingchi Palace,

394
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,260
what about Houchi?

395
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,740
Is everything all right with her?

396
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,620
Yes, it is.

397
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,100
Thank you for the concern, Your Majesty.

398
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,700
Jingjian,

399
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,500
you did a good job

400
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,700
in the Demon Realm.

401
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,620
When you were on your way back,

402
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,460
the Demon King sent a letter to us

403
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,140
and agreed on the peace negotiations.

404
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,100
I’ve proclaimed to everyone that

405
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,580
demons are allowed to come
to Mount Lookout

406
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,020
and fight for the Taicang Spear.

407
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,740
I didn’t do much.

408
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,020
I’m also surprised that

409
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,660
they agreed on the peace negotiations.

410
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,780
Sen Jian is the Demon King.

411
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,060
The old hatred can’t be as important

412
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,100
as all the beings in the Three Realms.

413
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,500
You’re right, Heavenly Father.

414
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,660
It’s a blessing for the Three Realms

415
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,620
when immortals and demons make up.

416
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,720
Why?

417
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,100
Why can’t we get in?

418
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,580
Yeah.

419
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,340
That’s right.

420
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,580
Everybody, calm down.

421
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,300
His Majesty proclaimed that

422
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,740
you could come to look for the Spear.

423
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
But for your safety concern,

424
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,540
please stay here for some rest.

425
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,220
When the Spear appears,

426
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,460
we’ll invite you in.

427
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,060
The Feather Umbrella?

428
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,940
You’re Princess Jingzhao?

429
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,020
I’m glad you know me.

430
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,100
You want the Taicang Spear, don’t you?

431
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,180
I don’t think you need to get in.

432
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,300
Let’s have a fight here.

433
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,340
If you lose,

434
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,980
you don’t need to get in.

435
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,700
Your Grace,

436
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,740
we shouldn’t fight demons...

437
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,660
Say no more!

438
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Leave immediately!

439
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,580
Or I’ll get your demon cores!

440
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,140
Wait here for me.

441
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,380
I’ll go have a look.

442
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,540
Qingmu!

443
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,660
You also came for the Taicang Spear?

444
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,580
I won’t compromise to you today.

445
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,780
Let’s fight for it.

446
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,180
But if I get it,

447
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,420
I’ll hold a banquet for everyone.

448
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,100
Do come to the Heavenly Palace
and congratulate me.

449
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,180
Your Grace,

450
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,060
why did you badly wound these demons?

451
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,340
They made rude remarks.

452
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,500
The Demon King punishes the demons.

453
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,820
But you’re the princess
of the Heavenly Palace.

454
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,020
How can you punish them
on behalf of the Demon King?

455
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,220
I...

456
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,260
Thank you for helping us.

457
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,940
You’re welcome.

458
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,340
Not all immortals are

459
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,420
as unreasonable as her.

460
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,620
Qingmu,

461
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,740
what do you mean?

462
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,700
Now that the Demons agreed on
the peace negotiations,

463
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,300
the Immortals should behave generously.

464
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,060
If the princess takes the lead
to make trouble,

465
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,900
I’m afraid even the Heavenly Emperor
will be mocked.

466
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,580
You’re right, Lord Qingmu.

467
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,540
I am?

468
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,900
Then why did you just watch,

469
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,620
instead of stopping her?

470
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,220
As the saying goes in the Human Realm,

471
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,260
whoever breaks the law
should be punished.

472
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,300
Even children can tell right from wrong.

473
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,860
But immortals like you

474
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,900
turned a blind eye to that.

475
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,140
That was funny.

476
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,900
Qingmu,

477
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,500
even when I was finicky,

478
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,260
you hadn’t been so strict on me.

479
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,900
Today, the demons were aggressive.

480
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,700
I badly wounded them,

481
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,620
in a fit of anger.

482
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,140
Father.

483
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,340
Father, who is this old lady?

484
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,380
Why is she so bad-tempered?

485
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,580
What... What did you call him?

486
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,620
Father.

487
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,300
Old lady,

488
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,740
why are you getting so close
to my father?

489
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,140
Don’t you know

490
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,220
he has a wife?

491
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,940
Since when has he got a wife?

492
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,540
Why doesn’t anyone know?

493
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,740
Little girl, don’t talk nonsense.

494
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,740
All right.

495
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,500
Don’t make fun of her.

496
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,940
This is Princess Jingzhao.

497
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,980
Qingmu, is she really your...?

498
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,460
I stayed in the North Sea

499
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,940
and have never come out before.

500
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,940
This time, Father took me here
to see the Spear.

501
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,780
I didn’t know it could be so fun.

502
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,620
You’re Princess Jingzhao?

503
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,460
Greetings, Old Master Jingzhao.

504
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,060
Who do you mean “old”?

505
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,540
You naughty girl!

506
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,900
How dare you!

507
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,540
Am I wrong?

508
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,940
I hear you’re more than
twenty thousand years old.

509
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,020
But my father is
only a few thousand years old.

510
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,740
In this way,

511
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,180
if you got married early,

512
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,380
your son would be as old as my father.

513
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,060
You’re certainly an old master to me.

514
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:15,900
You...!

515
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,820
She’s just kid.

516
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,380
She’s just kid.

517
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,740
Am I wrong?

518
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,420
You’re a grown-up.

519
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,100
You must be polite

520
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,420
so that others will respect you.

521
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,420
I saw what you just did.

522
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,020
I didn’t do anything.

523
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,980
My father is upright.

524
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,900
And how handsome he is!

525
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,140
Don’t worry.

526
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,460
I won’t act wildly
like this old lady did.

527
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,420
That’s good, then.

528
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,460
You little girl,

529
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,060
you’re his daughter,

530
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,340
but you have no spiritual power at all.

531
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,900
I’m sure

532
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,540
your mother is a mortal

533
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,620
who wants to become an immortal
by giving birth to you.

534
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,140
What a plan!

535
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,020
You make sense, Your Grace.

536
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,340
Your parents are Gods

537
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,900
and you’re a noble princess.

538
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
But why are you still not a Goddess

539
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,460
when you’re twenty thousand years old?

540
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,660
I hear Houchi from the Qingchi Palace

541
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,740
became a Goddess
even before she was born.

542
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,220
You...!

543
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,540
Naughty girl.

544
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,980
How dare you keep humiliating me!

545
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,340
See how I’ll teach you a lesson!

546
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,780
She’s mine.

547
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,700
I’ll instruct her.

548
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,660
Don’t bother.

549
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,660
For the sake of your father,

550
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,980
as long as you salute
and apologize to me,

551
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,700
I’ll forgive you.

552
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,140
All right.

553
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,420
You just want me to salute to you?

554
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,180
Do you want me to kneel

555
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,820
or make a deep bow?

556
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,060
Your Grace,

557
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,460
I can salute to you.

558
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,180
But I fear you can’t

559
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,500
receive it.

560
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,020
Your mother can be a very humble woman.

561
00:23:46,222 --> 00:23:47,177
Why can’t I receive

562
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:48,660
your salute?

563
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,580
Hope you won’t regret.

564
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,820
Who are you?

565
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,340
How can you bring the thunder?

566
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,300
I told you

567
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,180
you couldn’t receive my salute.

568
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,220
You...!

569
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,140
You’re Houchi?

570
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,700
Your Grace, it’s good for you.

571
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:18,688
It’s my first time to know

572
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:19,911
someone forcing a Goddess

573
00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:21,540
to salute to her.

574
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,820
I guess you forgot

575
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,020
how you were punished by thunder

576
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,740
on Mount Lookout last time.

577
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,460
What’s your relationship with Qingmu?

578
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
Why are you with him?

579
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,140
Your Grace,

580
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,780
it’s my privacy.

581
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,060
Qingmu.

582
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Even if he’s cold to me,

583
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,180
he’s never been so rude.

584
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,820
You must have done something to him.

585
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,420
If you talk nonsense again,

586
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,100
I won’t mind issuing another edict

587
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,220
to the Heavenly Palace.

588
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,540
You think you can?

589
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,740
I’ll show everybody

590
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,820
what you are on earth

591
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,060
as the Goddess!

592
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,460
Your Grace,

593
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,900
Houchi is a Goddess.

594
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,180
You can’t fight her.

595
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,460
If you insist,

596
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,820
don’t blame me for being rude.

597
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,900
You’ll protect her?

598
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,140
Well, I won’t let her go!

599
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,700
Stop!

600
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,060
Heavenly Father.

601
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,540
Are you all right?

602
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,820
From this day on,

603
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,780
pick good immortals

604
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,780
and cultivate good ones
for the God Realm.

605
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,060
I’m Muguang,

606
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,300
a Gold Dragon from Mount Tianci.

607
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,060
I’m God of Stars.

608
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,620
Chief God of Chaos, congratulations.

609
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,060
I’m the Chief God of Chaos.

610
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,820
It’s my duty

611
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,620
to protect the world.

612
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,060
Your Majesty.

613
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,100
Houchi,

614
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,660
I didn’t know you had grown up.

615
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,980
Your Majesty,

616
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,780
now that you have come,

617
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,900
I’ll leave everything

618
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,220
to you.

619
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,740
We usually don’t interfere with fights
between immortals and demons.

620
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,460
I was just angry about that.

621
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,500
Excuse me.

622
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:15,900
Let’s go.

623
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,900
About the peace negotiations
between immortals and demons,

624
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,340
the Demon King and I
have reached an agreement.

625
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,460
From this day on,

626
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,820
whoever harms the peace

627
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,620
will be

628
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,100
severely punished!

629
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

630
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,460
Who was that man

631
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,740
behind Houchi?

632
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,500
For your information,

633
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,220
he’s my good friend, Qingmu.

634
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,860
You personally made him

635
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:55,820
North Sea Star Lord.

636
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,300
It’s such fine liquor.

637
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,820
Where did you get it?

638
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,820
Donghua sent his disciple
to bring it to me.

639
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,740
He’s a smart man.

640
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,420
Indeed,

641
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,980
we should mark today.

642
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,340
My father is upright.

643
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,860
And how handsome he is!

644
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,140
Stop it.

645
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,100
Jingzhao looked like

646
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,500
she was going to eat me.

647
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,100
Fruit?

648
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,300
When I was travelling
in the Human Realm,

649
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,260
I learnt some small tricks.

650
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,740
Are you trying to make me happy?

651
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,780
You’re a Goddess, instead of a kid.

652
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,740
Fruit can’t make you happy.

653
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,540
Every time I was unhappy

654
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,740
when I was a kid,

655
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,420
Boxuan made me happy with food.

656
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,740
If you want to talk about the past,

657
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
I’m all ears.

658
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,180
If you don’t,

659
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,180
you can just sit like this.

660
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,220
Why did you

661
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,380
leave with me today?

662
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,860
If you stayed, you would talk to

663
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,700
the Heavenly Emperor,

664
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,020
the strongest and most powerful man.

665
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,860
So what?

666
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,660
When I wanted to leave, I left.

667
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,940
I can tell that
Jingzhao really cares about you.

668
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,700
It’s power and wealth
others can’t even beg for.

669
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,340
You really don’t want any?

670
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,940
I simply need enough food
and accommodation.

671
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,300
What do I need the wealth for?

672
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,700
I accepted the title,

673
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,500
simply because Jingjian was my friend

674
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,620
and I couldn’t reject him.

675
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,180
Don’t brag.

676
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,180
I’m serious.

677
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,740
After I had the title,

678
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,180
I should’ve gone to the Heavenly Palace
to express my gratitude.

679
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,700
But I was travelling in the Human Realm

680
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,780
and didn’t go there.

681
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,980
You stood the Heavenly Emperor up?

682
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,180
In the Heavenly Palace,

683
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,380
there’re too many rules.

684
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,900
I’ll feel uneasy

685
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,260
and uncomfortable.

686
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,500
Why are we talking about me?

687
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,020
What happened between you and Jingzhao?

688
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,060
You’re not unreasonable.

689
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,620
She has nothing to do with the past.

690
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,780
You’re even kind to Jingjian.

691
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,420
Why are you so hostile to her?

692
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,300
It wasn’t my first time

693
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,580
to meet her on Mount Lookout.

694
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,180
You’re Houchi?

695
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,500
Do you know who I am?

696
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,460
I’m talking to you!

697
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,700
Don’t you hear me?

698
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,660
Look how weak you are.

699
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,780
How dare you talk back!

700
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,500
Simply because you have little
spiritual power,

701
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,220
Mother abandoned you

702
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,220
and the Qingchi Palace.

703
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,620
You’re a shame to the Qingchi Palace

704
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
and to Mother!

705
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,340
What happened later?

706
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,300
Luckily, Boxuan came in time

707
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,620
and got me out of the water.

708
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,060
Otherwise, I would have been
the first Goddess

709
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,900
that was drowned.

710
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,420
From then on, I’m scared of water.

711
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,260
I haven’t learnt to swim yet.

712
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,620
I don’t mean this.

713
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,740
I mean...

714
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,660
You mean my spiritual power?

715
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,020
Jingzhao is right.

716
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,340
I have little spiritual power.

717
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,020
It took me forty thousand years
to come out of the shell.

718
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,620
No matter how hard I try,
I can’t gather the spiritual power.

719
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,340
Father is traveling around
to find treasures for me

720
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,380
and he seldom comes back.

721
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,100
Fengran wasn’t there yet.

722
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,740
The Qingchi Palace was cold and lonely.

723
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,220
No one accompanied me, but Boxuan.

724
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,100
Later, Boxuan left, too.

725
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,540
I never left the Qingchi Palace.

726
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,060
I don’t care if I’m humiliated.

727
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,460
But I don’t want my father to be mocked.

728
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,740
So,

729
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,540
that’s how you grew up.

730
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,420
I kind of envy you sometimes

731
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,860
that you lost your memories.

732
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,100
Your parents

733
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,780
are among the best immortals.

734
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,060
You should have enough spiritual power.

735
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,180
Is your body sealed by something?

736
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,020
If it were,

737
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,380
my father would have noticed that.

738
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,180
All right. Don’t try to persuade me.

739
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,380
No matter what you say,

740
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,020
I won’t be nice to Jingzhao.

741
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,300
Now that she bullied you,

742
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,860
she should bear the consequences.

743
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,060
I didn’t know it before.

744
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,620
But from now on,
I won’t interfere with you two.

745
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,180
I thought you would advise me

746
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,500
not to hate her

747
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,980
because she was a little girl
at that time.

748
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,620
Why must I say that?

749
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,180
You’re the only one I...

750
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,380
Drop it.

751
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,020
I won’t give you more burden.

752
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:11,820
Look.

753
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,260
Make a wish.

754
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,060
It’s simply the light of cloud riding.

755
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,940
Why shall I make a wish?

756
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,980
Only when you believe in something,
it can come true.

757
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,700
Haven’t you heard of it?

758
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,780
Be quick.

759
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,460
I wish Houchi will be a real Goddess

760
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,820
and be invincible.

761
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,140
Nonsense.

762
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,780
Come on. Make a wish.

763
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,820
I wish Lord Qingmu could have
his wish come true.

764
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
I made two wishes.

765
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,780
What’s the second one?

766
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,740
Not telling you.

767
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,420
But I’m sure it will come true.

768
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Don’t get me wrong.

769
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,460
It’s...?

770
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,900
The Taicang Spear is coming out.

771
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:13,980
The flame...

772
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,220
It must be the Kylin.

773
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,660
Qingmu,

774
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,780
if the Kylin is Boxuan,

775
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,100
he’ll protect the Taicang Spear.

776
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,740
Those who fight for the Spear

777
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
will not let him go.

778
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,940
I have little spiritual power

779
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,140
and I can’t defend him.

780
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,900
No matter what happens,

781
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,740
you must protect him.

782
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,780
Don’t worry.

783
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,660
I’ll let no one hurt him.

784
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,780
It’s really Hongri.

785
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,180
Donghua,

786
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,940
when I saw that Houchi looked

787
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,620
so much like Master Shanggu,

788
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
I was too excited

789
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,140
to control myself.

790
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,300
When I calm down now,

791
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,620
I have confusions.

792
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,940
Please help me out.

793
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,460
You’re being too polite, Your Majesty.

794
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,060
I understand your confusions.

795
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,300
When I first saw Goddess Houchi,

796
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,300
I also felt familiar

797
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,420
because of her appearance.

798
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,180
But speaking of temperament,

799
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,460
the air of Chaos or her origin,

800
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,620
she may not be Master Shanggu.

801
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,780
I agree with you.

802
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,020
But beside her,

803
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,300
there’s Lord Qingmu

804
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,260
who looks the same as Master Bai Jue.

805
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,940
I don’t think it’s that simple.

806
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,460
You said that

807
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,660
Master Bai Jue might have come
to the lower realm.

808
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,780
If Master Bai Jue is still here,

809
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,300
he shouldn’t look like Lord Qingmu.

810
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,500
If we think

811
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,300
Qingmu is Master Bai Jue’s offspring,

812
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,060
he doesn’t have parents

813
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,260
to be tracked down.

814
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,300
No matter what the truth is,

815
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,140
I think we have hope
to reopen the God Realm.

816
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,060
Your Majesty, why not find a chance

817
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,580
to fight Lord Qingmu

818
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,140
and see how much he has inherited

819
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,580
from Master Bai Jue?

820
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,980
Sounds like a good idea.

821
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,060
As for Goddess Houchi...

822
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,900
Lord Gu Jun is travelling around.

823
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,780
Maybe the Queen of Heaven
can tell you something.

824
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,940
I don’t think so.

825
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,740
When she left Houchi,

826
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,300
Houchi hadn’t come out of the shell yet.

827
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,780
I’m afraid we can’t figure it out

828
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,140
until Gu Jun comes back.

829
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,780
Heavenly Father.

830
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,700
Heavenly Father.

831
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,900
The Taicang Spear has come out.

832
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,940
Even demons are fighting for it.

833
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,020
But why haven’t you gone there yet?

834
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,420
The Spear belongs to immortals.

835
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,460
We can’t let any demon have it.

836
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,220
I stressed it many times that

837
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,900
there was no difference
between immortals and demons.

838
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,780
Why does True God Bai Jue’s weapon

839
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,780
have to belong to immortals?

840
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,780
Heavenly Father!

841
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,460
The Demon King and I agreed that

842
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,300
we wouldn’t interfere with the Spear.

843
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,020
You can go with Jingjian.

844
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,300
The Spear has spirit.

845
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,780
No matter who has it,

846
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,220
as long as we can
disregard previous enmities

847
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,140
and reopen the God Realm together,

848
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,580
it’ll be a good thing

849
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,220
for the Three Realms.

850
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,700
Yes.

851
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,980
Jingjian, protect your sister.

852
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,180
Yes, Heavenly Father.

853
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,500
Yeah.

854
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,380
As in the legend,

855
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,660
who gets an ancient weapon
will become a God.

856
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,340
Jingjian,

857
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,140
help me.

858
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,900
I must become a Goddess this time.

859
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,660
Jingzhao,

860
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,460
the Spear is guarded by the Kylin.

861
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,620
Let’s see and don’t be impulsive.

862
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,700
Lord Xianshan,

863
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,060
has the Kylin turned up?

864
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,620
Not yet.

865
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,340
You think you can fight
for Taicang Spear?

866
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,580
I’d like to see

867
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,140
who dares to fight with me for it.

868
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,860
Hongri?!

869
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,420
He’s not Hongri.

870
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,740
But how come?

871
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,340
It’s Hongri’s spiritual aura.

872
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,900
It’s simply a piece of his soul.

873
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,900
How dare you ordinary beings

874
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,980
break into the cultivation place
of True God

875
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,420
and offend him.

876
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,660
Leave immediately!

877
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,220
What do you think?

878
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,660
He isn’t Boxuan.
