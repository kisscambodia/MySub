=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 13=

3
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,680
Fortunately,

4
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,720
we both were born with God bones.

5
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,120
From this day on,

6
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,760
I’ll give you the rest of my life.

7
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,530
When the Three Realms are there

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,890
and the world is there,

9
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,250
I’ll be there,

10
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,560
all right?

11
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,330
Master,

12
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
you have no idea
how nervous Her Grace was yesterday.

13
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,410
She even went to the Phoenix Clan,

14
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,360
asking for the Pith of the Plane Tree
as your medical usher.

15
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,970
I’m so happy for you.

16
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,760
Bai Jue.

17
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,170
I brought you something to eat.

18
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,970
Later, you...

19
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,560
Your clothes...

20
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,000
What’s this?

21
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,090
Hongri just gave it to me.

22
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,560
(Report)
It records the treasure Zihan stole.

23
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,120
Let me have a look.

24
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,920
What happened?

25
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,610
It’s not possible.

26
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,300
(Report)

27
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,530
If Tianqi stole these things,

28
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,170
he’s going to set up
the Destruction Formation,

29
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,170
to destroy the Immortal, Demon
and Devil Realms.

30
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,000
What’s the Destruction Formation?

31
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,480
When Devils rebelled,

32
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,530
the God Realm was nearly destroyed.

33
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,610
To defeat them,

34
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,330
the Ancestral God created a formation,

35
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,050
based on the Three Rocks,

36
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,610
instruction feather of Chief God,

37
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,970
Original Being of True Gods

38
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,050
as well as the air of chaos
from Immortals and Demons.

39
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,360
With the sacrifice of everything,

40
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,200
the one who uses the Formation

41
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,450
will become mighty God of Chaos.

42
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,320
Once he becomes God of Chaos,

43
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,530
he’ll outstrip the Ancestral God

44
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,440
and become the most powerful man.

45
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,920
Why have I never heard
about such a formation?

46
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,640
It’s quite inhuman

47
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,920
to sacrifice everything in the world.

48
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,040
So, the Ancestral God didn’t use it.

49
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,480
Instead, he defeated the Devil God
by exhausting all his power,

50
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,600
and then suppressed Devils.

51
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,970
Then Tianqi took away the Three Rocks...

52
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,440
No way.

53
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,600
Tianqi isn’t that cruel.

54
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,920
He must have another purpose

55
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,440
or he was on impulse.

56
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,690
We must trust him.

57
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,290
He wouldn’t make such a big mistake!

58
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,130
If he wanted to be the Chief God,

59
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,200
powerful as he was,

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,010
he needn’t have waited until now.

61
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Yeah.

62
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,640
I don’t believe that, either.

63
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,160
But...

64
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,090
But he did.

65
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,290
I’m going to ask him in the lower realm.

66
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,920
No way.

67
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,730
You can’t go see him.

68
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,850
If you go there rashly,

69
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,250
you’ll get yourself in danger.

70
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,640
Now,

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,690
Gods are gossiping about his escaping.

72
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,040
If you go see him,

73
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,480
you’ll make the Pilgrimage Hall
the target for all.

74
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,090
Everyone is panicky in the God Realm.

75
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,690
They’re all afraid that
Devils will start a war again.

76
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,850
As the Chief God,

77
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,160
you should pacify them first.

78
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,280
But...

79
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:29,820
Don’t worry.

80
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,090
Zhiyang and I will figure out the reason

81
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,200
and stop Tianqi.

82
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,730
Why did you summon me?

83
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,880
Any news about Tianqi?

84
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,410
What happened?

85
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,920
Why do you look so serious?

86
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,290
What happened?

87
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,600
Nothing.

88
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,600
I just want to borrow
you Immortal-seeking Bell.

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,090
To look for Tianqi?

90
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,250
Yes.

91
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,850
You let him go for your old friendship.

92
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,530
Why do you want him back now?

93
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,530
Do you know he stole the Three Rocks

94
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,530
from the Hidden Pavilion?

95
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
The Destruction Formation?

96
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,970
No way.

97
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,970
Tianqi is never competitive.

98
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,810
How would he set up
the Destruction Formation?

99
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,090
Even if we believe him,

100
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,410
how will other Gods believe him?

101
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,720
If I figure out what he’s after,

102
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,090
we’ll be risking everyone
in the lower realm.

103
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,690
Will you simply ask him

104
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,410
or will you get him back?

105
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,880
If he really sets up
the Destruction Formation,

106
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,090
what will you do to him?

107
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,010
Yuemi,

108
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,360
I know

109
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,690
how nice he’s to me.

110
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,600
If he didn’t,

111
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,920
I would have ordered to get him back.

112
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,970
Tianqi and I have known
for ten thousand years.

113
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,530
I know he’s quite loyal.

114
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,810
But everyone in the God Realm thinks

115
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,040
he betrayed us.

116
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,530
I feel so sad for him.

117
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,360
You’ve never been so sad before.

118
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,200
Do you...?

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,410
But he only treats me as a friend.

120
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,040
He cares for no one, but you.

121
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,920
I only care for Bai Jue.

122
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,200
You know that.

123
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,480
If I knew you liked him,

124
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,530
I would...

125
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,090
I know.

126
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,570
I know you only regard him as a brother.

127
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,360
I also know

128
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,360
it’s not your fault.

129
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,850
But Shanggu,

130
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,530
you know what?

131
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,160
Do you know how much I envy you?

132
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,640
You don’t want someone

133
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,200
I could wish for.

134
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,010
I also envy you
for your mutual love with Bai Jue.

135
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,410
But Tianqi...

136
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,920
He never cares for me.

137
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,730
You take me as your close friend.

138
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,850
But I never realized
your feeling for him.

139
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,290
In love,

140
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,970
no one can be forced.

141
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,760
All I want is to accompany him
and stay with him.

142
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,010
Even he can’t think of me
when he’s happy,

143
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,250
I don’t care.

144
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,850
As long as I can get drunk with him

145
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,440
when he’s sad,

146
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,600
that’s enough for me.

147
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,730
That’s not enough.

148
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,810
You’re such a good girl.

149
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,130
You deserve the best love in the world.

150
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,920
After I handle this problem,

151
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,610
I’ll tell him how you feel for him.

152
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,730
Don’t bother.

153
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,120
For some question,

154
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,880
I’ve already known the answer.

155
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,320
Telling him or not

156
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,170
makes no difference.

157
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,240
All I want

158
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,000
is to keep him safe.

159
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,680
Shanggu,

160
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,410
I can lend you
the Immortal-seeking Bell.

161
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,120
But please promise me something.

162
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,530
No matter what happens,

163
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,530
keep him alive.

164
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,880
I beg you.

165
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,640
Yuemi,

166
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,530
you don’t need to

167
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,440
beg me like this.

168
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,970
Don’t worry.

169
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,290
I won’t let anyone kill him.

170
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,120
Master,

171
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,880
you just recovered.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,880
Would you like to have some rest

173
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,680
and look it up tomorrow?

174
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,420
(Destruction Formation)

175
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,970
The Destruction Formation
has never been used before.

176
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,760
I must look up in the books
for the solution.

177
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,610
I can’t feel relived

178
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,000
until it’s solved.

179
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,120
Master,

180
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,490
think about it.

181
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,560
Master Tianqi sometimes
went a bit too far.

182
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,170
But why did he do
what the Devil God did?

183
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,050
Before we know the truth,

184
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,290
don’t gossip.

185
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,410
I never expected you

186
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,930
to find me so quickly.

187
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,930
You’ve grown up

188
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,560
and you’ve been more powerful.

189
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,440
Tianqi,

190
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,760
where are you? Come out!

191
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,800
Look what a condition you’re in.

192
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,490
Why are you still joking?

193
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,640
You must explain to me.

194
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,760
You stole the Three Rocks,

195
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,320
embezzled the instruction feather
of Chief God,

196
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,120
and rebelled with Demons.

197
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,050
What on earth do you want?

198
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,290
Now that you know the answer,

199
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,930
why bother to ask?

200
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,440
I don’t believe that.

201
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,800
You’ve made great efforts

202
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,050
to manage the Immortal and Demon Realms.

203
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:11,930
I don’t believe

204
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,440
you want to destroy them.

205
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,050
Listen.

206
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,530
You sound so benevolent.

207
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,560
You’re really
a good disciple of Bai Jue.

208
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,640
But he forgot to teach you that

209
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,050
Gods

210
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,050
could also pretend.

211
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
You think you matter so much to me

212
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,410
that you can talk me over

213
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,200
and I’ll give up?

214
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,490
Shanggu,

215
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,440
are you getting too dizzy

216
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,440
after being the Chief God for long?

217
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,930
When you were a baby,

218
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,200
I was already commanding Gods.

219
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,000
I simply pretended to be close to you

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,410
in the past ten thousand years,

221
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,050
but you take it seriously?

222
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,490
Eyes don’t cheat people.

223
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,050
If you want to be the Chief God, be it.

224
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,640
You don’t need to do this.

225
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,410
How innocent you are!

226
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,490
I’m a Demon God.

227
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,240
Even if you want me to be it,

228
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,490
how will other Gods agree?

229
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,410
I can’t be

230
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,490
the most powerful Chief God of Chaos

231
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,560
and reign the whole world with a reason

232
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,370
unless I set up
the Destruction Formation

233
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,800
and absorb the spiritual power
in the lower realm.

234
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,320
Now that I’ve come,

235
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,200
I’ll take you back

236
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,800
so that you won’t make more mistakes.

237
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,290
Tianqi,

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,880
go back with me.

239
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
You hurt me?

240
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,730
I’m just telling you that

241
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,560
you can’t do whatever you wish.

242
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,760
Get out of the Abyssal Ridge Swamp!

243
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,760
What if I don’t?

244
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,490
Shanggu,

245
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,490
listen.

246
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,120
I never liked you.

247
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,930
Everything I’ve done for you

248
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,200
is simply to make you alive

249
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,440
until you get the instruction feather
of Chief God.

250
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,560
I’ll always be your brother.

251
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,970
No matter what happens between us

252
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,170
or what we experience,

253
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,760
I’ll always be by your side.

254
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,170
Get back to the God Realm!

255
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,200
When I become
the most powerful Chief God,

256
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,170
I may keep you alive,

257
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,170
for the sake of our old friendship.

258
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,680
Don’t let those stupid Gods come again!

259
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,090
Or I’ll also do

260
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,200
what Xuanyi did.

261
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,640
Your Grace,

262
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,320
how were you hurt?

263
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,200
I’m fine. Don’t let others know.

264
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,000
Master,

265
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,490
True God Bai Jue asked to see you.

266
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,640
Take him to my study.

267
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,050
Don’t tell him I’m hurt.

268
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,800
Yes, Your Grace.

269
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,370
Master.

270
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,290
Did anything happen
in the God Realm again?

271
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,440
No.

272
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,050
Where’s Shanggu?

273
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,440
Still sleeping?

274
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,290
Her Grace didn’t sleep last night.

275
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,730
She just woke up.

276
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,410
Leave us.

277
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,050
Why did you suddenly come?

278
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,970
You’re hurt?

279
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,800
Let me check.

280
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,930
He hurt you?

281
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,610
Where’s he?

282
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,850
Don’t go.

283
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,490
He’s made up his mind.

284
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,240
You won’t change anything.

285
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,530
I’ll just make him know

286
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,730
he can’t hurt you
without paying a price.

287
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,120
I’ve made a mistake

288
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,090
that can’t be forgiven.

289
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,880
Even if he didn’t hurt me, I would...

290
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,930
He made the mistake.

291
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,560
Don’t blame yourself.

292
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,050
But that day,

293
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,560
I let him go.

294
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,610
He told me that

295
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,850
he accompanied me

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,090
for all these years,

297
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,050
simply to get the instruction feather
of Chief God.

298
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
He’s my closest brother.

299
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,170
I never expected us

300
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,680
to end up like this.

301
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,370
Maybe,

302
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,930
I shouldn’t have come back
from the Nether World.

303
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,850
Go somewhere with me.

304
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,970
Why are you taking me here?

305
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,090
Before you were born,

306
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,400
Tianqi and I often drank in this place.

307
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,090
Gods at that time

308
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,800
all helped the Ancestral God
to create the God Realm

309
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,160
and bred everything in the world.

310
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,730
We were so close

311
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
that we could live and die
with each other.

312
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,730
On the eve of the last battle
against Devils,

313
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,520
we also came here.

314
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,610
But most of them

315
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,770
have gone.

316
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,320
After the battle,

317
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,890
I blamed myself

318
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,560
for not protecting more people.

319
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,650
But our life is very long.

320
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,890
We can’t be stuck in regret.

321
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,490
If we keep missing the past,

322
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,200
what can we do about future?

323
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,800
You’re right.

324
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,200
Even if there’s a battle for sure,

325
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,200
I can’t waste my time now.

326
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,130
When we still stay together,

327
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,040
let’s enjoy the scenery,

328
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,250
drink some wine,

329
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,090
and have a nice talk.

330
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,490
Immortals in the lower realm think

331
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,370
Gods like us enjoy ourselves so much.

332
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,090
We move the world with one thought

333
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,560
and change everything with one thought.

334
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,920
But they never know

335
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,730
the destiny is like an invisible hand.

336
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,320
Even if we reign the Three Realms,

337
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,650
there’s something we can’t do.

338
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,250
Bai Jue,

339
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,970
if one day,

340
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,730
I make such a capital crime,

341
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,730
what will do you do?

342
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,560
With me around,

343
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,730
this day never comes.

344
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,970
What if it comes?

345
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,040
If you asked before,

346
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,320
I would tell you

347
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,650
principles mattered more
than personal relationship.

348
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,970
But now I don’t know how to reply.

349
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,650
Maybe you’ve got a reason for that.

350
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,370
I’d like to be punished with you.

351
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,130
When I hear an impartial God like you

352
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,250
say this,

353
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,090
I’d die without anything to regret.

354
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,520
Don’t talk nonsense!

355
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,160
You’re the Chief God.

356
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,400
You exist with the Three Realms.

357
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,970
But no matter how important
Tianqi is to me,

358
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,730
I can’t forget the safety
of the whole world

359
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,610
for my personal feelings.

360
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,090
Because I’m the Chief God.

361
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,970
Shanggu.

362
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,250
Don’t worry.

363
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,200
I’ll stop him from destroying the world,

364
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,440
not only for him,

365
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,650
but also for my own duty.

366
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,370
The Formation can really arouse
the Power of Chose in the lower realm.

367
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,560
It’s the Formation
the Ancestral God created.

368
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,560
It wouldn’t go wrong.

369
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,130
But it takes at least 24 hours

370
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,800
before the Formation is completely done.

371
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,890
Gods won’t give us such a long time.

372
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,490
I’ll stay here

373
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,730
and catalyze the Formation
with Power of the Original Being.

374
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,320
Out of the Abyssal Ridge Swamp,

375
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,090
I’ll leave it to you.

376
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,400
I won’t let you down, Master.

377
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:20,850
Zihan,

378
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,130
once the Destruction Formation is done,

379
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,320
the Demon Realm will be ruined, too.

380
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,400
That’s your homeland.

381
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,440
Don’t you hate me for that?

382
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,250
- They...
- Master.

383
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,250
Every spiritual power in the Demon Realm

384
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,890
comes from the Demon God.

385
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,370
Once the Demon God is gone,

386
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,400
what’s the point of the Demon Realm?

387
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
The True Gods are your friends.

388
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,250
So are we.

389
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,200
When you give an order,

390
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,680
even if we’ll be universally condemned

391
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,650
or forever cursed,

392
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,850
we’ll always follow you.

393
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,160
Your Grace,

394
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,040
before Tianqi’s problem is settled,

395
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,770
you rang the Chaos Bell.

396
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,370
What on earth happened?

397
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,370
Right.

398
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,920
We kept asking to see you but failed.

399
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,850
Please explain to us.

400
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,490
Today, I summoned you,

401
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,770
to tell you something.

402
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,520
Bai Jue and I figured out that

403
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,010
Demon God Tianqi would set up
the Destruction Formation

404
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,770
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

405
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,560
He’s powerful

406
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,160
and has the instruction feather
of Chief God.

407
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,520
When he wants to destroy the world,

408
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,370
who can stop him?

409
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,280
We haven’t figured out how he escaped.

410
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,650
Your Grace, are you going to let it go?

411
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,920
Right.

412
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,250
I let him go,
for the sake of our friendship.

413
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,250
I confess and I’ll take the blame.

414
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,680
Our priority is

415
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,650
to get Tianqi back to the God Realm

416
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,680
and stop him from initiating
the Destruction Formation.

417
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,320
Bai Jue,

418
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,200
assemble troops
and head for the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

419
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,130
Zhiyang.

420
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,320
Yes, Your Grace.

421
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,970
The God Realm is the base of everything.

422
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,010
Guard the Heaven and Earth Platform
with other Gods

423
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,200
and keep everything safe.

424
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,890
I see.

425
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,040
Gu Jun,

426
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
go with me to the South Sea
in the lower realm

427
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,770
and put down the disturbances.

428
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,090
Yes.

429
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,560
Your Grace,

430
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,770
I’d like to go to with Master Bai Jue

431
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,370
and get Tianqi back.

432
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,090
Please let me go.

433
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,010
Nothing can go wrong in the world.

434
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,650
After thinking it over carefully,

435
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,130
I think

436
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,890
only Bai Jue can be impartial enough

437
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,680
to handle the problem.

438
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,370
In the battle against Devils
ten thousand years ago,

439
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,040
eleven apostles and I
were the vanguards.

440
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,560
When the world is in danger,

441
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,520
we can’t keep out of it.

442
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,680
Your Grace, please let me go.

443
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,560
Now that you want it,

444
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,560
go with Bai Jue.

445
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,280
Thank you, Your Grace.

446
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,920
The God Realm is heavily guarded.

447
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,770
I don’t care
if you want to make trouble.

448
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,850
But you mustn’t make trouble for me.

449
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,680
Why are you so nervous, Goddess of Snow?

450
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,970
All Gods are trying
to protect themselves.

451
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,370
Other Gods are busy with their affairs.

452
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,010
They have no time to bother about you.

453
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,040
By the way,

454
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,370
Shanggu summoned all Gods
with the Chaos Bell.

455
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,040
Did anything happen?

456
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,440
Your Overload cares a lot
about the God Realm.

457
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,200
He wants the same as you.

458
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,280
He certainly cares.

459
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,850
You don’t need to sound it out.

460
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,560
I can tell you directly.

461
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,520
Shanggu told all Gods that

462
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,400
Tianqi stole the Three Rocks.

463
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,770
She sent Bai Jue and Yuemi
to the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

464
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,160
and get Tianqi back.

465
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,730
She would go to the lower realm

466
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,850
and stabilize it with the Power of Chaos

467
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,650
so that it couldn’t be ruined.

468
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,200
However,

469
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,730
if the Demon God
destroys the lower realm,

470
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,320
the Nether World will be ruined, too.

471
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,130
What on earth does Overload want?

472
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,160
Now that Bai Jue will go
to the lower realm,

473
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,770
the Destruction Formation
wouldn’t be done.

474
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,400
Master Bai Jue led the troop
to the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

475
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,920
If you dare play any trick,

476
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,090
I won’t spare you!

477
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,680
Don’t worry.

478
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,040
Considering his power,

479
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,400
who’s able to hurt him?

480
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,130
As long as you complete your mission,

481
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
you can get

482
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,320
whatever you want.

483
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,160
Plum blooming in the snow.

484
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,040
Good name.

485
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,490
Plum blooming in the snow.

486
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,440
It’s what made me wait

487
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,560
for thirty thousand years.

488
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,490
It’s not what I said

489
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,920
that made you wait,

490
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,610
but you own obsession.

491
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,970
Master. Master. Master!

492
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,250
Do you know how many efforts I made

493
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,400
to come back to the God Realm?

494
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,370
Master,

495
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,280
why do you still not glance at me?

496
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,850
Master, Master!

497
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,680
Master, I adore you,

498
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,490
but you only care for her.

499
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,730
Don’t blame me for that.

500
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,130
The God Realm is in trouble.

501
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,440
All registered Gods have work to do.

502
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,680
Wu Huan, you’re in charge
of the Pilgrimage Hall.

503
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,010
But why don’t you have anything to do?

504
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,650
That’s weird.

505
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,280
In case I’m in danger,

506
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,130
or someone makes trouble here,

507
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,280
Her Grace asked me to stay.

508
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,890
Sounds like a good reason.

509
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,280
I was from a humble clan,

510
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,200
but I’m not stupid.

511
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,200
If you’re bored,

512
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,130
go back home and lock yourself up.

513
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,130
Why do you bother to be sarcastic?

514
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,770
I told you about the Queen of Phoenix

515
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,970
in the Pilgrimage Hall.

516
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,730
It’s true, isn’t it?

517
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,010
I just want to tell you that

518
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,680
your master is born to be heartless.

519
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,010
If you don’t want to be expelled

520
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,090
and go back to your clan,

521
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,800
serving as a maid again,

522
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,090
you need to do something for yourself.

523
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,130
What do you mean?

524
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,400
Today’s battle is your best chance.

525
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,560
If you can stop Tianqi
from destroying the world,

526
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,250
you’ll have an extraordinary position

527
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,770
in the God Realm.

528
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,730
When you and I want
to get a firm foothold

529
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,520
or get higher,

530
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,970
we must depend on ourselves.

531
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,090
Weak as I am,

532
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,160
I can’t even defeat Zihan.

533
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,130
How can I stop the Demon God?

534
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:25,970
Devil Weapon?

535
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,010
It was the Sky Bow

536
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,770
an elder devil lost in the battle.

537
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,250
I’ve been keeping it.

538
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,920
It can even hurt a True God.

539
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,320
I’ll lend it to you.

540
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,770
Wu Huan,

541
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,490
you’re a smart girl.

542
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,090
You decide

543
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,040
if you’ll serve or be served
in the God Realm.

544
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,780
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

545
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,520
I’m ashamed.

546
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,680
I should have led the troop

547
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,560
to get Tianqi back.

548
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,280
But so far,

549
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,970
I still don’t want to believe it

550
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,440
or make the ruthless decision.

551
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,200
The Abyssal Ridge Swamp
is plagued by crises.

552
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,160
You must be very careful.

553
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,320
If Tianqi refuses to stop...

554
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,250
I know.

555
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:18,970
Say no more.

556
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,970
Yuemi,

557
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,770
I won’t worry if you deal with anyone,

558
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,320
but Tianqi.

559
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,160
What?

560
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,320
You only allow yourself
to care for the world?

561
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,730
In your heart,

562
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,440
I care more for love than business?

563
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,850
I don’t mean that.

564
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:37,650
All right.

565
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,800
I was just joking.

566
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,680
Be careful not to be
as stubborn as Bai Jue

567
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,490
after you stay with him for long.

568
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,400
Wait and see.

569
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
I’ll go get Tianqi back.

570
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,010
I’ll punch him

571
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,610
to work off your anger.

572
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,250
Why are you here?

573
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,610
I hear Her Grace ordered you

574
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,370
to have a battle with Demons
in the lower realm.

575
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,970
I don’t want to stay here alone.

576
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,850
Take me with you.

577
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,770
Don’t be absurd!

578
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,560
It’s dangerous. Go back.

579
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,560
Even you think I’m too weak

580
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:53,890
to do anything important

581
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,280
and all I can do is trifles?

582
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,440
I don’t mean that.

583
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,010
Master Tianqi set up
the Destruction Formation

584
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,010
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

585
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,890
A battle between Gods and Demons
is unavoidable.

586
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,490
I don’t want you to be in danger!

587
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,400
Yes.

588
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,320
I have weak power.

589
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,280
But I also want to fight

590
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,680
for Her Grace.

591
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,890
If I stay and do nothing,

592
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,730
how can I be relieved?

593
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,040
How can I stay in the God Realms?

594
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,250
In case of fight,

595
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,680
you must follow the order

596
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,010
and never take any action
without permission.

597
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,320
Understand?

598
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,520
Don’t worry.

599
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,650
I won’t make trouble for you.

600
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,160
Without my order,

601
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,850
no one should take rash action!

602
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,040
Yes.

603
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,010
Yes.

604
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,160
Let’s go!

605
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,770
Zihan,

606
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,400
Her Grace ordered us

607
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,770
to arrest the Demon God Tianqi.

608
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,680
Go back to the Demon Realm
with your men,

609
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,890
and we won’t hurt you!

610
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:32,800
In your dream!

611
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,730
We only take orders for the Demon God.

612
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,090
If he destroys the lower realm,

613
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,560
you’ll die, too.

614
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,970
Why do you help him?

615
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,250
Cut the crap

616
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,370
and just fight!

617
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,970
You won’t get in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

618
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,200
unless you get over me!

619
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,130
Since when was a ﻿Demigod
among the Demons?

620
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,090
He has Tianqi’s Power
of the Original Being.

621
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,560
Looks like Tianqi made him a Demigod

622
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,800
by using ten thousand years
of his lifespan.

623
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,160
I’m Sen Jian, chief of Tiger Demons.

624
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,440
I’d like to fight as the vanguard.

625
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,250
I won’t stop fighting until I die.

626
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,090
Zihan!

627
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,370
Master Bai Jue doesn’t want
to fight Demons!

628
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,650
Neither do I!

629
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,610
It’s not up to you.

630
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,650
The Destruction of Formation
is nearly done.

631
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,320
They’re stalling for time.

632
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,040
I’ll get in and persuade him.

633
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,850
Even Shanggu failed to persuade him.

634
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,000
What can you do?

635
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:55,800
Half an hour.

636
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,370
Give me half an hour.

637
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,280
Trust me.

638
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,690
Tianqi isn’t the man
who doesn’t care for the world.

639
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,280
I will persuade him.

640
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,520
All right.

641
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,040
You have half an hour.

642
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,960
No matter what you get,

643
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,520
I’ll meet him personally.

644
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,210
All right.

645
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,210
She got into the Abyssal Ridge Swamp
behind others.

646
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,240
Does she collude with the Demon God?

647
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,040
If I find the evidence
for their collusion,

648
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,240
and stop the Destruction Formation,

649
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,850
I’ll see who dare
look down on me again.

650
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,170
Screwed.

651
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,650
The spiritual power is disappearing.

652
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,720
We must fight, or it’ll be too late.

653
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,370
- Charge!
- Charge!

654
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,410
Go!

655
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,000
Enough!

656
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,370
We shouldn’t have been enemies.

657
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,720
All Gods, on my command!

658
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:47,890
Protect your Original Being

659
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,720
and never let the spiritual power
disappear again.

660
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,890
The barrier of the lower realm cracked.

661
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,650
If we don’t seal it immediately,

662
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,000
beasts will run out of the Wasteland

663
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,560
and bring disaster.

664
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:22,890
All Gods, on my command.

665
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,480
Enhance the seal.

666
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,090
Master,

667
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,480
if the south sea bursts its banks,

668
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,090
the sea water will flow backward.

669
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,610
There’ll be a disaster
in the Immortal Realm.

670
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,800
We can’t let the flood
hurt the immortals.

671
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,130
Make up the seal.

672
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,040
Set up the formation.

673
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:56,760
Yes.

674
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:28,930
Tianqi,

675
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,480
when will you stop?

676
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,650
How can you ignore the lives
in the lower realm?

677
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,000
Shut up!

678
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,520
I don’t want to listen!

679
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,960
If you come to persuade me,

680
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,130
leave immediately.

681
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,090
The Destruction Formation
has been set up.

682
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,960
I’ll soon have the air of chaos
in the lower realm.

683
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,280
Even if the other True Gods
come personally,

684
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,090
they can’t defeat me.

685
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,320
No way!

686
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,170
It’s not what you are.

687
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,280
I don’t believe you would do this!

688
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,650
Haven’t I made myself clear?

689
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,000
Get out!

690
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,650
Well,

691
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,320
let me help you, then.

692
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:09,930
Yuemi,

693
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,610
what are you doing?

694
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,130
Even if others don’t believe you,

695
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,650
I do!

696
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,370
I never fail anything I want.

697
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,690
Now that I can’t take you back,

698
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
I’ll die in the Destruction Formation!

699
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,000
You think I’ll care

700
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,760
for your own life?

701
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,650
Now that you don’t care,

702
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,370
why don’t you let me die?

703
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:33,960
All right.

704
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,650
Die as you wish.

705
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,520
But don’t stain my place!

706
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:47,610
Master,

707
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,610
the power of the Destruction Formation
seems to decline.

708
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,850
Hope they can stop Tianqi.

709
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:56,960
Master,

710
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,000
are we going to the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

711
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,930
to help with Master Bai Jue?

712
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,610
The barrier isn’t totally fixed yet.

713
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,930
We can’t leave

714
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,320
until we ensure the safety
of the lower realm.

715
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,450
Yes.

716
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,130
I know

717
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,280
you wouldn’t let me die.

718
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,000
It’s enough when I go crazy alone!

719
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,410
Why did you come?

720
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,320
Tianqi,

721
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,000
no matter what reason you have,

722
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,210
I’m on your side, at least.

723
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,520
Go back with me.

724
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,280
We can solve every problem in the world.

725
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,720
We have Bai Jue, Zhiyang

726
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,410
and Shanggu.

727
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,320
Since you left,

728
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,650
Shanggu has never smiled again.

729
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,370
Gods keep condemning her every day.

730
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,960
