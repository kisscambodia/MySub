00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,200
Tianqi!

4
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,710
No matter what troubles you,

5
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,760
at least you’ll have me stand
by your side.

6
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,030
Please come back with me!

7
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,950
There’s no problem that
we can’t solve it in this world!

8
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,630
You also have Bai Jue, Zhiyang

9
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
and Shanggu!

10
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,120
Shanggu has been

11
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,480
very sad since you left!

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,030
The people in the God Realm
condemn us every day.

13
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,670
Don’t you care about her anymore?

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,310
When we were in the God Realm,

15
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,560
you followed around me every day.

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,710
And the way you are behaving now

17
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,200
annoys me even more!

18
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,680
I’ll say it one more time.

19
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,320
Get out!

20
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,080
And don’t let me see you again!

21
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,680
You are lying!

22
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,910
You always

23
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,110
avoid my eyes

24
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,320
when you lie to me!

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,680
Tell me

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,240
what happened exactly.

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
Does it have anything to do
with Shanggu?

28
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,350
Maybe…Maybe…

29
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,160
Maybe I can…

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,750
You can what?

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,110
As coward as you are,

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,400
you think you can help a traitor God?

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,040
Tell me

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,550
why you set off
the Destruction Formation.

35
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,270
If it really has anything to do
with Shanggu…

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
No one

37
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,440
is able to understand me.

38
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,320
So what?

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,800
We’ve overcome

40
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,190
so many difficulties together
over the years.

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,320
How do you

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,110
I can’t help if you don’t let me?

43
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,910
Yuemi,

44
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,190
we are not ignorant kids anymore.

45
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,710
If I get you involved,

46
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,750
you’ll be in trouble!

47
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,750
Then let it be!

48
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,040
I’m not even afraid of death,

49
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,710
let alone the things related to you!

50
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,240
But…

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,190
No buts!

52
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,240
It’s been hundreds
of thousands of years!

53
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,440
We were born and grew up together.

54
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,080
We fought side by side.

55
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,440
We went through thick and thin together.

56
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,880
We got drunk together.

57
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,240
We experienced joy and sorrow together.

58
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,630
In fact, I like…

I just wanted to stop the Demon God
from destructing the world!

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,830
I’ll kill you!

64
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,550

Shanggu is right.

77

A God’s length of life is too long.

78

Yuemi, it’s my fault!

94
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,470
I was being selfish

95
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,190

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,160
Master Tianqi!

191
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,110
You’ve fulfilled your duties today.

192
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,750
When the Three Realms are rebuilt again,

193
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,400
Sen Jian,

194
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,520
you will no longer be the Head
of the Tiger Demons,

195
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,160
instead, I’ll have you in charge

196
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,750
of the entire Demon Realm!

197
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,990
Master Tianqi!

198
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,480
Go ahead!

199
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,550
Master!

200
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,160
If he really killed Yuemi,

201
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,280
I will not let him get away with it!

202
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,630
Let’s break
his Destruction Formation first!

203
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,990
How did Yuemi die?

204
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,750
Tianqi,

205
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,550
don’t make any more mistakes!

206
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,360
Bai Jue,

207
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,160
you and I are both true Gods

208
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,430
and created by the Ancestral God.

209
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,230
It’s not your place

210
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,990
to judge me!

211
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,550
Then I’ll take you back to the God Realm

212
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,360
and let Shanggu decide!

213
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,750
Are you really going

214
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,750
to fight me for these people?

215
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,160
Don’t forget that only

216
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,990
the four of us share the same ancestor!

217
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,430
These people?

218
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,160
These people are the ones who made

219
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,280
great contributions to the God Realm!

220
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
The Destruction Formation will destroy

221
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,480
everything that the Ancestral God
and all deities created,

222
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,160
as well as all the beings
of the Three Realms!

223
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,190
So what?

224
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
The Three Realms

225
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,960
can be rebuilt,

226
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,040
but some things can never

227
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,160
be replaced once they are gone!

228
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,750
Is that what the Three Realms
mean to you?

229
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,790
Since when did you become so ruthless?

230
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,400
I should’ve left you in the God Realm,

231
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,720
Yuemi wouldn’t have been killed
if I had!

232
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,600
You have no right to talk about her,

233
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,790
much less accusing me of being ruthless!

234
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,680
Tianqi,

235
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,110
stop making mistakes!

236
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,280
Shut up

237
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,720
Muguang,

238
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,750
calm down!

239
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,360
Let’s wait till Master
finds out the truth!

240
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,670
Hongri,

241
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,310
if the one who died were Master Bai Jue,

242
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,550
would you still be able to stay calm?

243
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,160
Tianqi,

244
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,230
I promised Shanggu
that I’d bring you back.

245
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,040
For the sake of Yuemi,

246
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,480
Shanggu

247
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,630
and all beings of the world,

248
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,870
don’t make mistakes anymore, Tianqi!

249
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,600
I’ll let you pay for my Master’s death!

250
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,520
Stop!

251
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,430
Today I’ll let you know

252
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,080
that I am the ruler of everything!

253
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,360
Because of you, the Three Realms
are in disorder

254
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,960
and people are dead.

255
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,480
Tianqi,

256
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,040
I can’t let you live anymore.

257
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,430
Bai Jue,

258
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,360
you’ll regret it!

259
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,400
One day

260
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,310

tens of thousands of years.

340
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,910
I failed in protecting them.

It’s not your fault.

342
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,600
I’m the Chief God of the Three Realms.

343
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,430

Why didn’t you ask me to join you?

349
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
He killed too many Gods.

350
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,910
I had to end his life.

351
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,390
Yuemi,

352
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,510
I failed in protecting you,

353
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,790
and I failed
in fully understanding Tianqi.

354
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,080

355
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,190
for everything.

356
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,910
If you hold a grudge,

357
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,760
don’t blame Tianqi,

358
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,910
just come to me.

359
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,310
I was brought up by you and Tianqi.

360
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,910
Tianqi

361
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,190
was a careless man

362
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,600
who joked around all the time.

363
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,000
Yuemi,

364
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,270
could you come to my dreams

365
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,760
and tell me

366
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,190
why Tianqi wanted to destruct the world

367
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,790
and what he kept from us?

368
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,720
Your Grace.

369
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,600
Has your wound healed?

370
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,720
Thank you for your care, Your Grace.

371
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,360
It’s much better now.

372
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,120
Alright.

373
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,270
I’m a light drinker anyway.
I should go back.

374
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,390
You should go back and take a rest, too.

375
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,550
Your Grace,

376
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,080
the night before my Master left,

377
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,550
she asked me

378
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,390
to bring you a message

379
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,390
if she couldn’t come back.

380
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,880
What did she say?

381
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,480
She said

382
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,550
in her whole life she’s been pursuing

383
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,030
happiness,

384
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,510
fine wine,

385
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,880
and a clear conscience.

386
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
But there’s one thing

387
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,270
she did feel sorry about.

388
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,240
She’d never done

389
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,720
anything she should feel sorry about.

390
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,790
The day when you prepared
her birthday banquet,

391
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,190
she took you to the Taoyuan Forest

392
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,080
and told you about what happened
to Master Bai Jue

393
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,310
for her own benefit.

394
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,480
She hoped that you’d forgive
Master Bai Jue

395
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,270
and that the Demon God

396
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,960
could give up on you.

397
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,960
My Master had been feeling sorry
about that

398
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,720
and she didn’t know how to tell you

399
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,480
or how to face the Demon God.

400
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,860
Pass my decree,

401
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,940
no new owner

402
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,900
shall be assigned

403
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,220
to the Taoyuan Forest of the Moon Hall,

404
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,040
which will forever belong to
the Goddess of Moon & Stars.

405
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,510
Yes, Your Grace!

406
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
From now on,

407
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,080
I’ll light up the stars
in the God Realm for you.

408
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,480
As long as I’m here

409
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,670
and the God Realm exists,

410
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,310
the Goddess of Moon & Stars

411
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,840
will always be yours.

412
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Thank you, Your Grace!

413
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,880
Are you here to comfort me?

414
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,080
No.

415
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,150
Come with me.

416
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,190
Yuemi!

417
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,620
Yuemi!

418
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,910
What happened in there exactly?

419
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
How did Yuemi die?

420
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,720
If you lie to me,

421
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,270
I won’t forgive you!

422
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,390
it was the Demon God!

423
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,310
He pushed Goddess Yuemi

424
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,080
into the formation core.

425
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,640
I witnessed the God power

426
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,240
of Goddess Yuemi being shattered!

427
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,480
I’ll kill you!

428
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,720
My injury is self-inflicted.

429
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
Would they really trust me?

430
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:25,000
(Moon Hall)

431
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,670
Muguang.

432
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,910
What are you doing here?

433
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,550
Goddess Yuemi was killed.

434
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:36,760
I…

435
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,910
I’m concerned about you.

436
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,550
Goddess Yuemi and Master Tianqi
were very close.

437
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,150
Although I saw it in person,

438
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,840
it’s still hard for me to believe

439
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,030
that Master Tianqi killed Goddess Yuemi.

440
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,080
Don’t call him Master anymore.

441
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,240
He’s not worthy of it!

442
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,600
Master Bai Jue has ended his life.

443
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,150
He deserved to die!

444
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,000
What’s wrong?

445
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,550
When thinking about

446
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,510
Goddess Yuemi had loved the Demon God

447
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,310
Tianqi for all those years,

448
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,270
I feel sorry for her.

449
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,670
It was obvious

450
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,000
that my Master loved the Demon God,

451
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,600
who, however, always

452
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,960
played dumb.

453
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,670
It’s cold at night.

454
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,270
And you have an injury.

455
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,120
Please go back and rest.

456
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,720
I’m sorry about your loss!

457
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,790
Why did you bring me
to The Hidden Pavilion?

458
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,670
I need your help.

459
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,150
The Purple Jade Whip!

460
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,240
I was going to put it
in The Hidden Pavilion,

461
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,390
but…

462
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,240
You can’t handle
such a small thing like this?

463
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,880
I’m not in the mood for jokes.

464
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,840
It’s weird.

465
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,600
Your cultivation base is the highest
among the Three Realms,

466
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,310
yet you can’t control
the whip with your power?

467
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,840
The Purple Jade Whip has its own spirit.

468
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,360
It wouldn’t obey the person
who killed its owner.

469
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,030
The others must see you

470
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,550
as a cold-blooded person

471
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,910
who doesn’t feel sorry and sad

472
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,430
about killing his brother.

473
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,190
But actually, you feel sorry the most

474
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,600
that you stabbed him dead
with your Taicang Spear.

475
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,270
I’ve had people investigate.

476
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,000
Nothing major happened in Taichu Hall

477
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,080
before Tianqi set off
the Destruction Formation.

478
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,640
I’m afraid
he really had no other choice.

479
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,510
I’ve put a seal on it.

480
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,030
It won’t make trouble anymore.

481
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,430
Thank you!

482
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,270
And this is yours.

483
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,430
Xuanyi used to be chosen
as the Chief God,

484
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,000
but he betrayed and left the God Realm

485
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,880
right before he took over
the instruction feather of Chief God.

486
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,880
Tianqi had never been
an aggressive person,

487
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,550
but he made such a mess
before I took over

488
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,550
the instruction feather.

489
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,510
How I wanted to take over
the instruction feather before,

490
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,030
but now it makes me uneasy

491
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,600
when I see it.

492
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,390
I’m tired.

493
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:52,880
I’ll go back and rest.

494
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,310
Bai Jue, you’ll regret it!

495
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,030
One day you’ll regret it!

496
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,720
Xuanyi betrayed and ran away.

497
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,640
Tianqi was going to destruct the world..

498
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,000
It all comes down to the succession
to the instruction feather of Chief God.

499
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,670
Is there any connection
between the two incidents?

500
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,080
A thousand years ago,

501
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,960
Zhiyang told me

502
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,510
that the Power of Chaos
in the lower realm was vanishing,

503
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,190
and he urged me to cultivate the power

504
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,030
and become the Chief God of Chaos.

505
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,790
Bai Jue thus came to me

506
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,640
and taught me patiently.

507
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,960
This time, I can’t let them down again!

508
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,310
Why is the Power of Chaos

509
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,790
in the lower realm vanishing so quickly?

510
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,310
Why are there
only few spiritual veins left?

511
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,310
Because all the Three Realms are waiting

512
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,760
for the day when you can

513
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,550
take over the instruction feather
of Chief God.

514
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,270
Why did Zhiyang and Tianqi who always
allowed me to have my fun

515
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,600
suddenly ask Bai Jue to teach me?

516
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,760
What fills the heaven and the earth

517
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,670
are all living beings,

518
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,720
which can compensate the air of chaos.

519
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,310
But I finally understand

520
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,720
that Bai Jue has his reason to make you

521
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,960
practice in the Nether World
to accelerate

522
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,840
your cultivation of the Power of Chaos.

523
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,360
Bai Jue could have

524
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,600
taught me little by little,

525
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,030
but why would he ask me
to master a power that usually takes

526
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,880
ten thousand years to cultivate
within only one thousand years?

527
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,550
You carry the responsibility
of the Power of Chaos.

528
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,430
You should be aware of that
all the time.

529
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,670
When you take over
the instruction feather of Chief God,

530
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,600
you’ll be responsible
for all living beings

531
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,310
and for creating the Human Realm.

532
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,030
Why

533
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,640
would Xuanyi give up a righteous way

534
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
of ruling the Three Realms,

535
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,080
instead, choose to betray
and leave the God Realm first?

536
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,670
Why did Tianqi who’d loved me so much

537
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,720
act like a totally different person?

538
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,510
I am the most powerful God
in the God Realm!

539
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,360
And I will become the most

540
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,760
rightful Chief God in the God Realm!

541
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:24,960
Why?

542
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,080
Why?

543
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,190
There must be something I don’t know.

544
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,190
I can’t lose anybody anymore
for no reason!

545
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,880
Master.

546
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,390
What is it?

547
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,080
The Pilgrimage Hall
just issued a decree,

548
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,670
Master Shanggu will close the hall
for a day

549
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,120
to cultivate the instruction feather
of Chief God.

550
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,790
It’s been 70,000 years.

551
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,680
The Chief God of Chaos
will finally be born!

552
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,510
Ring the Chaos Bell

553
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,710
and inform all Gods

554
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,920
of the arrival
of the Chief God of Chaos!

555
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,270
The Chief God of Chaos will be born!

556
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,230
Congratulation, Overlord!
Your wish will soon come true!

557
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,880
Overlord!

558
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,230
Take this magic weapon to
the Heaven and Earth Platform,

559
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,790
and show them

560
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,120
what a chaos tribulation is all about!

561
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,200
Yes, Overlord!

562
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,880
I didn’t expect that the first thing

563
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,230
the Chief God of Chaos would do
after getting rid of the Demon God

564
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,880
is to take over the Chief God position.

565
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,510
Such a quick move is surely

566
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,510
like something a ruler of
the God Realm would take.

567
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,080
My Master is doing this
following the Heaven’s will.

568
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,680
You are in no position to judge her,
Goddess of Snow!

569
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,750
And who do you

570
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,990
think you are

571
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,440
to talk back to me?

572
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,990
The Demon God made trouble

573
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,920
and threatened the lives of all beings.

574
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,510
The God Realm needs to be rebuilt.

575
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,080
We need the Chief God of Chaos
to lead us.

576
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,270
Taking over the instruction feather
of Chief God at this critical time

577
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,600
shows the real courage of a ruler.

578
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,880
If I’m right,

579
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,990
you are the disciple of
the Goddess of Moon & Star.

580
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,920
You’ve become a God already?

581
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,750
Struggling as you are,
you sound so arrogant!

582
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,600
How will Goddess Yuemi

583
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,750
and the eleven apostles feel
in the heaven?

584
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,950
Goddess of Snow, as a senior,

585
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,920
please watch your mouth.

586
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,270
You are just an insignificant disciple!

587
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,400
How dare you be rude to me?

588
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,200
So you know you should show respect!

589
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,880
You…

590
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,270
Goddess Yuemi died
for all living beings.

591
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,680
My Master has issued a decree yesterday

592
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,080
that Muguang is promoted
from one of the 12 stars

593
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,710
to the God of Moon & Stars.

594
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,990
From now on,

595
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,470
he’ll also be a Magic God,

596
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,920
just like you!

597
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,950
The Wasteland of the Demon Realm.

598
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,750
Tianqi!

599
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,750
Master,

600
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,510
the Qiong Qis that startled Her Grace

601
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,880
escaped from here?

602
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,440
Tianqi!

603
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,680
Let’s walk around and take a look.

604
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,710
I can’t believe Zhiyang.

605
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,950
Just a few Qiong Qis.

606
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,550
What’s the big deal?

607
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,550
Say, about Bai Jue,

608
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,950
what are the odds of such thing?

609
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,030
He went to the Lower Realm

610
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,270
and bumped into Shanggu?

611
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,750
He must’ve followed her.

612
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,550
Apparently he likes Shanggu,

613
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,160
but he pretends that he doesn’t.

614
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,790
Master,

615
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
now that we are here,

616
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,790
let’s take a look at it.

617
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,440
Take a look at what?

618
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,270
So troublesome!

619
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,920
Ancestral God’s Barrier of Chaos
is broken!

620
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,310
That’s weird!

621
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,510
Although there’s a small sign
of Devilish Energy,

622
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,750
the seal seems

623
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,310
to lift itself.

624
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,360
The Barrier of Chaos in the wasteland
was made of the Power of Chaos.

625
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,880
Except for Her Grace,

626
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,640
no one else is able

627
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,840
to control the Power of Chaos

628
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,230
and break the barrier.

629
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,640
Could it be…

630
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,200
Master?

631
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,950
Do you remember

632
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,200
the warning that the Ancestral God
left when he was falling?

633
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,950
When he was falling

634
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,550
he warned us that the Tribulation
of Chaos would come soon.

635
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,640
The tribulation can only

636
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,680
be avoided when Her Grace
becomes the Chief God.

637
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,750
Master, you are saying

638
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,880
the barrier is broken

639
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,230
because of the tribulation?

640
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,750
But Her Grace has mastered
the Power of Chaos.

641
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,680
Tomorrow she will take over
the instruction feather of Chief God.

642
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,080
Why is the Power of Chaos
in the Lower Realm still vanishing?

643
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,680
Something’s not right!

644
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,060
Come on.

645
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,880
Let’s go
to the Heaven and Earth Platform.

646
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,030
Master,

647
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,400
are you going to consult
the Ancestral God with Yingsheng Stone?

648
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,600
At this point,

649
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,270
this is our only way to find out

650
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,680
what the warning really means.

651
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,120
But usually, we’d wait for the Ancestral God
to send us instructions.

652
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,230
- If we ask the Heaven ourselves…
- It concerns Shanggu.

653
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,680
We can’t afford any risk.

654
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,550
I’ll be responsible for

655
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,030
any consequences.

656
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,750
Ancestral God,
what is Tribulation of Chaos?

657
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,080
Master!

658
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,600
Go away!

659
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,920
Master! Master!

660
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,550
Ancestral God,

661
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,710
what is Tribulation of Chaos?

662
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,710
Master!

663
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,120
Master!

664
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,510
When the tribulation occurs,

665
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,750
the God Realm will be destructed.

666
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,360
All living beings will die

667
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,400
unless the Chief God of Chaos
sacrifices herself to the tribulation.

668
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,510
You evil

669
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,400
old jerk!

670
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,920
You made Shanggu cultivate so hard
to master the Power of Chaos

671
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,160
and take over the Chief God position

672
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,310
so that

673
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,360
she can die for your living beings?
