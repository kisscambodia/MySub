=Episode 27=

3
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,310
- Greetings, Goddess Houchi.
- Greetings, Goddess Houchi.

4
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,620
- Greetings, Lady Fengran.
- Greetings, Lady Fengran.

5
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,550
We’re fairy maidens
in the Heavenly Palace.

6
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,790
What are you doing here
in broad daylight?

7
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,180
For your information, Lady Fengran,

8
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,870
we’re here to see Goddess Houchi.

9
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,070
Me?

10
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,710
You’re a Goddess,

11
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,900
but you seldom appear in public
in the past sixty thousand years.

12
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,710
Ridiculous!

13
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,260
What do you think Goddess Houchi is?

14
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,500
A rare beast?

15
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,500
Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you.

16
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,580
Please punish me.

17
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,260
Don’t panic.

18
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,550
Now that you came to see me,

19
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,070
and you have seen me,

20
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,140
you may leave
if there’s no other business.

21
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:05,940
Yes.

22
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,270
You were rumored to be vulgar.

23
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,910
After they saw you today,

24
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,620
they would know the rumor wasn’t true.

25
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,140
Lord Qingmu and Jingjian are back?

26
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,870
Yes,

27
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,720
Your Grace.

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,660
They must have saved Jingyang.

29
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,940
I knew

30
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,620
nothing could stop him.

31
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,340
Your... Your Grace.

32
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,070
Why are you faltering?

33
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,260
What else is it?

34
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,510
The heavenly guard reported that

35
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,980
Lord Qingmu was back

36
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,470
with Goddess Houchi and Lady Fengran.

37
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,340
What did you say?

38
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,390
How dare he!

39
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,030
Heavenly Father has got us engaged.

40
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,470
How could he bring Houchi back

41
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,710
in such an imposing manner?

42
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,070
Where are they?

43
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,940
Prince Jingjian took them
to the Zisong Hall

44
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,030
before he went to see His Majesty

45
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,150
with Lord Qingmu.

46
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,980
Heavenly Father?

47
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,900
Jingyang was saved.

48
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,540
The Three-head Fire Dragon was stopped
from becoming a God.

49
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,110
It’s all ascribed to you.

50
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,980
I’ll greatly reward you.

51
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,390
Heavenly Father,

52
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,300
Lord Qingmu saved the day

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,580
during the fight
against the Three-head Fire Dragon.

54
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,430
I don’t dare to claim the credit.

55
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,710
Don’t be too modest, Jingjian.

56
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,940
Lord Qingmu made a contribution
to the Three Realms.

57
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,390
Now I’m giving you the North Sea
as your possession,

58
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,350
and you’ll enjoy the great glory
in the Heavenly Palace.

59
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,390
Your Majesty.

60
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,580
What do you mean, Lord Qingmu?

61
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,350
Your Majesty, do you remember

62
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,060
you granted me a promise

63
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,660
before I left the Heavenly Palace?

64
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,190
Sure, I do.

65
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,140
What?

66
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,420
The possession isn’t enough?

67
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,500
What I want

68
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,060
isn’t any territory.

69
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,940
What do you want, then?

70
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,350
Feel free to tell me.

71
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,630
Please call off the engagement
between Princess Jingzhao and me.

72
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,140
No!

73
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,470
Heavenly Father.

74
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,270
Don’t, Heavenly Father!

75
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,140
Qingmu!

76
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,030
Qingmu!

77
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,060
Jingzhao.

78
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,700
Back off!

79
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,470
Heavenly Father,

80
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,750
don’t!

81
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,630
He wants to call off the engagement?

82
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,350
It’s such good luck for him,

83
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,470
but he doesn’t want it?

84
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,910
How arrogant!

85
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,420
Qingmu, do you really mean

86
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,580
what you just said?

87
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,660
Yes.

88
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,350
Why?

89
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,630
Is my daughter not good enough for you?

90
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,270
I don’t mean that.

91
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,420
Princess Jingzhao is noble.

92
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,660
I don’t dare to disrespect her.

93
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,030
But I’m in love with a girl.

94
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,550
I’ll marry no one, but her.

95
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,390
If I marry Princess Jingzhao,

96
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,940
it’ll be unfair to her.

97
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,830
Your Grace, please forgive me.

98
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,630
Your Majesty, thank you,

99
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,110
but I can’t marry her.

100
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,910
Heavenly Father.

101
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,300
Your Majesty.

102
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,420
Lord Qingmu,

103
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,300
I’d like to know

104
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,270
who the girl is.

105
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,300
You want to marry her,

106
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,660
even when you have to
give up the North Sea and Jingzhao.

107
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,910
The girl I adore

108
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,750
is Goddess Houchi of the Qingchi Palace.

109
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,860
I’ll marry no one, but her.

110
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,230
Please grant us, Your Majesty.

111
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,260
It’s really her.

112
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,530
How daring Qingmu is!

113
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,040
Yeah.

114
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,750
Heavenly Father,

115
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,140
please don’t grant him!

116
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,860
If my engagement is called off,

117
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,860
how disgraced I’ll be!

118
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,100
Your Majesty,

119
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,980
you never change your edict.

120
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,420
How could you change it for him?

121
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,230
I promised that

122
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,230
as long as Qingmu brought Jingyang back,

123
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,420
I would grant him a promise.

124
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Immortals witnessed it.

125
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,260
How can I

126
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,140
break my own promise?

127
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:27,980
Your Majesty,

128
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,420
then the Taicang Spear...

129
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,820
Forget it.

130
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:34,950
Qingmu,

131
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,750
I’m calling off your engagement today.

132
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,420
From this day on,

133
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,070
on your marriage...

134
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,070
Heavenly Father!

135
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,700
You can make your own decision.

136
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

137
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,420
Worried about Qingmu?

138
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,030
Immortals are always tough.

139
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,380
Even if Qingmu has a plan,

140
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,100
I still worry there’ll be an accident.

141
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,380
After staying in the Qingchi Palace
for so many years,

142
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,470
I’ve thought of you as my sister.

143
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,790
I’m not as thoughtful as you are

144
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,070
and I can’t help much now.

145
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,470
But I want you to know that

146
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,510
no matter what danger there is,

147
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,580
or how we may end up,

148
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,980
I’ll stay with you.

149
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,100
Heavenly Father called off
the engagement

150
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,540
between Qingmu and Jingzhao.

151
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,630
Qingmu can make his own decision

152
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,030
on his marriage.

153
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,510
Didn’t you want Qingmu
to call off the engagement?

154
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,750
He made it,

155
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,630
but why do you look unhappy?

156
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,190
What they’re doing

157
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,190
reminds me of my sister.

158
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,860
Qingmu.

159
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,260
Qingmu, what’s the matter?

160
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,610
Qingmu!

161
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,260
Qingmu!

162
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,670
- Qingmu, what’s wrong with you?
- Qingmu!

163
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,670
- Qingmu!
- Qingmu!

164
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,540
- Qingmu, are you all right?
- Qingmu, what’s the matter?

165
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,070
Jingjian,

166
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,750
what’s the problem with him?

167
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,070
He was all right, wasn’t he?

168
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,750
It is the dragon breath
of the Three-head Fire Dragon.

169
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,510
It is weird and dominant.

170
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,190
When it first entered his body,

171
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,030
it was like some normal spiritual power

172
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,910
and was hard to notice.

173
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,910
But when it was noticed,

174
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,670
it had already intruded into his veins.

175
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,910
What’s wrong?

176
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,300
Nothing. Let’s go.

177
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,910
Is there any cure for him?

178
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,980
The Three-head Fire Dragon
was a Demigod.

179
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,100
Normal power can hardly
detoxify the breath.

180
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,860
Qingmu can’t be saved

181
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,190
unless the power of a God
is put into his body.

182
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,280
Then no one can save him,

183
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,140
but the Emperor or Queen, right?

184
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,630
I’ll go beg His Majesty.

185
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,350
Houchi,

186
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,030
after the meeting at the hall,

187
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,790
Heavenly Mother kept quarreling
with Heavenly Father

188
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,910
for Qingmu’s calling off the engagement.

189
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,070
Heavenly Father was so annoyed

190
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,350
that he locked himself for seclusion
in the Pilgrimage Hall.

191
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,100
The Pilgrimage Hall?

192
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,790
That’s the shrine of the Heavenly Palace

193
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,820
with a barrier outside it.

194
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,260
Only a God can step in.

195
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,910
If anyone breaks in,

196
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,860
he’ll be killed by the barrier power.

197
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,190
Once Heavenly Father is there,

198
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,860
it takes at least several months

199
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,950
before he comes out.

200
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
And Qingmu is badly injured.

201
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,380
If he can’t be cured
by this time tomorrow,

202
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,350
I’m afraid he’ll die.

203
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,550
Now, no one can save Qingmu,

204
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,940
but Heavenly Mother.

205
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,700
I’ll go beg her.

206
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,110
Wait.

207
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,180
I’ll go.

208
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,430
Don’t, Houchi.

209
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,500
Qingmu just called off
the engagement with Jingzhao.

210
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,940
She will embarrass you.

211
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,380
You know she’s mad at that.

212
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,230
Even if Jingjian begs her,

213
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,580
she won’t let it go.

214
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,230
For me, Qingmu

215
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,470
gave up the marriage

216
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,820
and the possession of the North Sea.

217
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,550
I can’t just wait and do nothing.

218
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,700
As long as I can save him,

219
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,790
I’m willing to do anything.

220
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,700
And I’ll take any consequence.

221
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,940
I’m Houchi from the Qingchi Palace.
I request to see Her Highness.

222
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,820
It’s you, Goddess Houchi.

223
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,180
I didn’t recognize you
before you came near.

224
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,110
I thought it was a maid.

225
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,700
Please kindly report to Her Highness.

226
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,380
I’m sorry to tell you that,

227
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,910
but Her Highness is having a rest.

228
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,910
Please wait here.

229
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,350
Wait a second.

230
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,260
How long will the rest be?

231
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,110
How am I supposed to know

232
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,230
how long Her Highness wants it to be?

233
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,700
Sometimes one hour.

234
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,940
But when she’s upset,

235
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,820
she doesn’t see anyone
for three or five days.

236
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,060
By the way,

237
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,350
I heard that someone
made trouble in the hall

238
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,580
and annoyed Her Highness.

239
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
I’m afraid you have to wait
for a few more days.

240
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,380
Her Highness can refuse to see me.

241
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,940
But what if it’s about the safety
of the Heavenly Palace

242
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,180
and about immortals and demons?

243
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,470
Heavenly Mother,

244
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,030
they humiliated me like that!

245
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,470
You must defend me!

246
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,700
Qingmu called off the engagement,

247
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,820
but he hasn’t married Houchi yet.

248
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,230
You still have a chance.

249
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,580
But I want to ask you something.

250
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,060
What is it, Heavenly Mother?

251
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,470
You’re the princess,

252
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,580
with the bloodline of the Gold Dragon.

253
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,870
You’ll inherit the Heavenly Palace.

254
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,060
Must you marry him, but no one else?

255
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,350
Heavenly Mother,

256
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,620
I want no one,

257
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,870
but him.

258
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,350
Even if he doesn’t like you

259
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,820
and hates the marriage?

260
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,180
He hasn’t realized how good I am yet.

261
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,500
I believe that

262
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,580
I’m not inferior to Houchi at all.

263
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,910
As long as Qingmu marries me,

264
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,700
and we can live a quite long life,

265
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,870
I will make him

266
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,820
fall in love with me.

267
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,820
Good.

268
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,620
You’re indeed my daughter.

269
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,030
I had ups and downs in my life,

270
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,870
but I never gave up.

271
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,580
You shouldn’t give up, either.

272
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:26,990
But,

273
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,580
Heavenly Father already granted him.

274
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,350
Your Highness,

275
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,790
Goddess Houchi is outside the hall.

276
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,550
She’s here to see me in person.

277
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,940
Looks like

278
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,060
you still have a chance.

279
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,550
How do you feel?

280
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,060
What’s wrong with me?

281
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,110
You were poisoned with the dragon breath
of the Three-head Fire Dragon.

282
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,870
Do you know it’s fatal

283
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,790
and it may kill you?

284
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,790
Don’t worry.

285
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,500
Houchi went to see my mother.

286
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,670
As long as she helps,

287
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,140
you’ll be safe.

288
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,820
Jingjian!

289
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,430
What?

290
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,620
How could you let Houchi...?

291
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,180
I’m Houchi from the Qingchi Palace.
Greetings, Your Highness.

292
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,380
Shanggu?

293
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,740
No.

294
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,310
She just looks like Shanggu,

295
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,870
but her temper and bearing

296
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,580
are quite different.

297
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,670
Your Highness.

298
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,260
Speaking of rank, we’re both Goddesses.

299
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,820
The fist-and-palm salute is enough.

300
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,230
But I’m your senior.

301
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,790
And you gave no salute to your mother.

302
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,940
Is this what your father taught you?

303
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,260
I grew up in the Qingchi Palace.

304
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,230
I only have my father, Gu Jun.

305
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,310
I never heard about my mother.

306
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,140
You’re a noble queen.

307
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,310
I don’t dare to call you Mother.

308
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
You’ve got

309
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,260
your father’s temper.

310
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,260
Tell me.

311
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,380
What are you here for?

312
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,260
I’m here

313
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,110
to make a deal with you.

314
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,430
A deal?

315
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,620
It’s been sixty thousand years.

316
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,550
I wondered if you
had forgotten the Qingchi Palace.

317
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,580
But you just mentioned my father.

318
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,140
I guess you remember why we exist.

319
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,470
When the God Realm was closed,

320
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,500
Master Zhiyang asked you,
His Majesty and my father

321
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,470
to manage the lower realm.

322
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,620
There have been battles
between immortals and demons

323
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,820
with continuous conflicts.

324
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,470
We’re always impartial

325
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,990
and are never restrained by either side.

326
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,500
That’s why the Three Realms coexist

327
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,500
and stay in peace.

328
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,430
I’m right. Don’t you think so?

329
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,470
You’re right.

330
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,140
Today, I’m here for something big

331
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,500
for both immortals and demons.

332
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,550
If you grant my request,
I’ll take my men

333
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,910
to pay allegiance to the Heavenly Palace

334
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,030
so that we can
fight against demons together.

335
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,110
On Qilian Mountains
are massive spiritual veins.

336
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,430
If we have them,

337
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,380
we’ll gain more power.

338
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,990
In less than a hundred years,

339
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,620
there’ll be a few more Gods.

340
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,060
By then, demons can’t fight us anymore.

341
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,670
Your offer

342
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,380
really sounds attractive.

343
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,580
But you’re so generous.

344
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,940
I guess you offered it
for something more important.

345
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,260
Let me guess.

346
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,500
For North Sea Lord Qingmu?

347
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,550
I indeed offered it for him.

348
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,620
He was poisoned with the dragon breath
of the Three-head Fire Dragon.

349
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
Only the power of a God or a Goddess
can save him.

350
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,350
I’m really curious.

351
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,700
If your father were here

352
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,470
and saw his daughter
he had been caring for

353
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,030
give Qilian Mountains out
to someone else,

354
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,180
simply for a man,

355
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,230
how would he feel?

356
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,430
You’re wrong, Your Highness.

357
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,350
In this world,

358
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,230
not only power is the most attractive.

359
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,350
If my father were here,

360
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,260
he would want me to stick to my feelings

361
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,180
and do what I want to do

362
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,620
for whom I like.

363
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,060
You usually value strength.

364
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:30,940
For this,

365
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,740
you attempted to force Lord Qingmu
many times

366
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,990
to work for you.

367
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,740
I think

368
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,990
I’m just satisfying you.

369
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,060
If you pledge loyalty to us,

370
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,670
demons will no longer be a threat.

371
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,470
It’s indeed satisfying me.

372
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,110
But Houchi,

373
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,060
at this moment,

374
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,060
I won’t grant your request.

375
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,140
Why?

376
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,990
Because you haven’t offered

377
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,820
what I really want.

378
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,500
You overestimated the Qingchi Palace

379
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,580
and also yourself.

380
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,060
I haven’t taken back Qilian Mountains

381
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,740
simply for old friendship.

382
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,620
If I send an army,

383
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,260
do you think you can stop me

384
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,260
with all that you can do?

385
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,910
You want

386
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,940
Qingmu to marry Jingzhao?

387
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,350
Exactly.

388
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,990
It’s been sixty thousand years.

389
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,230
You’re known as my mother,

390
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,910
but you never visited me.

391
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,500
When you have seen me today,

392
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,260
you still don’t care for me.

393
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,500
I wonder

394
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,980
except for your past with my father,

395
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,380
what else makes you

396
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,830
hate me so much?

397
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,620
I don’t care about you at all.

398
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,500
But what I have seen today

399
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,950
brought me much interest in you.

400
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,140
You look proud,

401
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,590
but have to yield to me.

402
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,710
I feel quite happy to see it.

403
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,260
Qingmu,

404
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,140
you don’t need to worry.

405
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,340
My mother is annoyed
because you called off your engagement.

406
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,140
But she isn’t unreasonable.

407
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,950
Houchi is her daughter, after all.

408
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,430
She won’t embarrass Houchi.

409
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,980
If she could really let go of it,

410
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,340
why did she say those words earlier?

411
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,100
Because...

412
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,880
- But Qingmu,
- Because...

413
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,590
Houchi is begging the Queen of Heaven
to save your life.

414
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,830
What if you break in

415
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,980
and annoy her?

416
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,140
If the Queen of Heaven
really wants to save me,

417
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,740
I’ll admit I misunderstood her

418
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,710
and I’ll take any punishment

419
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,190
by myself.

420
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,140
The Heavenly Emperor allowed Qingmu

421
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,980
to call off his engagement
with Jingzhao.

422
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,430
If you get them engaged again,

423
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,220
don’t you fear you’ll be mocked?

424
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,190
If Qingmu proposes to Jingzhao

425
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,260
and explains to everyone that

426
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,460
he was joking about the calling off,

427
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,500
His Majesty is always kind

428
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,340
and he may grant it.

429
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,220
Qingmu told everyone that

430
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,830
he liked me.

431
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,830
How will you explain that?

432
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,070
All immortals know that

433
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,430
you’re known as a Goddess,

434
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,260
but you have as weak power
as a low immortal.

435
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,830
But North Sea Lord Qingmu
was already the strongest lord

436
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,980
as early as a thousand years ago.

437
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,100
Speaking of strength,

438
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,980
how can you be good enough for him?

439
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,430
In my opinion,

440
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,380
he loves you,

441
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,070
possibly just for a while.

442
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,460
Jingzhao knew him before you.

443
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,740
In the Heavenly Palace,

444
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,070
there have always been rumors
about their relationship.

445
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,590
When I spread some rumors,

446
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,830
others will think

447
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,740
you kept bothering him.

448
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,670
By then,

449
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,670
I don’t know

450
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,260
if you’ll be mocked.

451
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,670
So,

452
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,740
you got a plan long ago?

453
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,950
I’m sorry to have disturbed you.

454
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,980
To tell you the truth,

455
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,860
it’s easy for me to save Qingmu.

456
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,500
But you humiliated Jingzhao
over and over again,

457
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,500
which annoyed me!

458
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,220
If you want me to help,

459
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,500
kneel right here for a couple of hours.

460
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,830
When I get happy,

461
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,260
perhaps,

462
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,500
I’ll help you.

463
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,620
What?

464
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,380
We’re both Goddesses.

465
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,830
But I’m tens of
thousands of years older.

466
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,740
Can’t you kneel to me?

467
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,430
In the existing Heavenly Palace,

468
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,380
I’m the queen
while you’re the subordinate.

469
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,710
I’m the senior while you’re the junior.

470
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,100
I’m the superior
while you’re the inferior.

471
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,140
You are supposed to kneel to me.

472
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,340
Besides, don’t you want to save Qingmu?

473
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,430
Don’t kneel to her!

474
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,140
Goddess Houchi and Your Highness
are both Goddesses.

475
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,830
There’s no such thing
as superior or inferior.

476
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,070
She doesn’t need to kneel.

477
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,340
Qingmu, you haven’t recovered.

478
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,140
Who allowed you to come?

479
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,860
If I didn’t come,

480
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,710
would you really do such a stupid thing?

481
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,980
Lord Qingmu, you came at late night.

482
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,260
Didn’t you make enough trouble
earlier today?

483
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,500
I’m humble,

484
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,140
but I’m also stubborn.

485
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,500
I don’t want Houchi to grovel for me,

486
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,500
do anything she doesn’t want

487
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,500
or flatter anyone
she doesn’t want to see.

488
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,310
Qingmu.

489
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,460
Do you know what crime it is
to break into my Fuyao Hall at night?

490
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,980
I’m sorry,

491
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,620
but I don’t understand.

492
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,980
You’re the queen, but why must you

493
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,030
go against ethics to break us up?

494
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,910
Simply because we love each other,

495
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,070
you want to force us with your power

496
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,790
and threaten her with my life?

497
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,190
Fine. Now that you disobey His Majesty

498
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,100
and force me to marry Jingzhao,

499
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,590
I won’t mind being accused

500
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,380
of disrespecting you.

501
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,830
I’m dying, anyway.

502
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,980
Qingmu,

503
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:16,860
don’t be stupid.

504
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,980
Let’s go.

505
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,860
I don’t want to stay
for even a single second.

506
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,140
You’re indeed brave.

507
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,430
When did I say

508
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,790
I would disobey His Majesty?

509
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,380
However,

510
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,140
I won’t help you

511
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,950
unless Houchi kneels to me.

512
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,430
She won’t ever kneel to you!

513
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:34,980
Houchi,

514
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,740
didn’t you say

515
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,790
you had deep love for Qingmu?

516
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,030
His Majesty is in the Pilgrimage Hall.

517
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,980
If you don’t want to kneel,

518
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,950
you can go ask him for help.

519
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,030
The Pilgrimage Hall?

520
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,260
It’s said that
the Pilgrimage Hall is shielded

521
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,070
in the barrier from the Shanggu Realm.

522
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,100
Whoever breaks in will be killed,

523
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,740
unless he’s a God.

524
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,740
Your Highness,

525
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,670
you’re trying to kill her.

526
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,950
Which one of you will live?

527
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,500
It’s all up to you.

528
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,190
Let’s go.

529
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,540
How was it?

530
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,710
Did Her Highness agree to save you?

531
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,310
She almost did,

532
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,910
but...

533
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,260
If you dare to go
to the Pilgrimage Hall,

534
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,590
I’ll be mad at you.

535
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,790
It’s about your life.

536
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,140
I must go there

537
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,140
and ask His Majesty to save you.

538
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,190
No way.

539
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,190
I won’t let you go.

540
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,030
Let me go and get Heavenly Father back.

541
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,030
I have the power from him.

542
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,310
I guess I won’t be hurt.

543
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,550
If anyone should go, that’s me.

544
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,310
I’m stronger than you.

545
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,340
No.

546
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,430
Stay here and look after Qingmu.

547
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,830
I’m going to the Pilgrimage Hall now.

548
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,950
I’m known as a Goddess.

549
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,740
Enough.

550
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,220
Houchi,

551
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,430
since we departed from
the Qingchi Palace,

552
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,430
we haven’t had a good time together.

553
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,550
Death isn’t terrible to me.

554
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,140
As long as you’re by my side,

555
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,430
I’ll die without regret.

556
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,140
I want to go to the North Sea.

557
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,980
Could you go there with me?

558
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,030
It’s where we pledged love.

559
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,590
I’m never tired of looking at it.

560
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,950
Qingmu,

561
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,070
let’s go back.

562
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,500
Houchi,

563
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,550
in fact, I knew you

564
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,590
earlier than you thought.

565
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,220
A thousand years ago,

566
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,620
I woke up in the North Sea

567
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,100
without any memory.

568
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,500
But I kept dreaming of a girl.

569
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,860
What girl?

570
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,950
She has your face

571
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,070
and stands in the thunder.

572
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,500
How can it be me

573
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,950
in your dream?

574
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,310
It is you.

575
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,830
Maybe our love story

576
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,830
had begun before we met each other.

577
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,820
♪Loving you greatly♪

578
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,140

579
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,740
After I knew you,

580
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,670
I finally got to understand annoyance,

581
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,860
happiness,

582
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,620
and all the other emotions.

583
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,260
Fate made us meet at this moment

584
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,860
and it’s already my luck.

585
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,950
I’m satisfied.

586
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,140
But I...

587
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,550
If there’s the next life,

588
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,030
I wish you could meet me

589
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,830
before I meet you.

590
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,790
What if there’s no next life?

591
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,910
Where can I find you, then?

592
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,740
Then live a good life alone.

593
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,220
I don’t expect the next life.

594
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,710
I only want this life.

595
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,340
I don’t want you
to give up the Qingchi Palace for me.

596
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,340
Nor do I want you
to give up your dignity and life.

597
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,910
Even if you keep me alive,

598
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,980
I’ll spend the rest of my life
in regret and guilt.

599
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,260
I just want you to be happy.

♪Tears turn into clouds♪

601
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,500
Qingmu,

602
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,590
let’s get back to the Heavenly Palace.

603
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,140
I must save you.

Jingzhao,

607
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,260
what did Heavenly Mother say?

608
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,830
She won’t see you.

609
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,460
She said she wouldn’t save Qingmu

610
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,790
unless Houchi agreed to leave him.

611
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,220
Jingzhao,

612
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,910
I know you feel aggrieved.

613
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,070
But Qingmu is dying.

614
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,340
If you really like him,

615
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,430
you should care about his life first,

616
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,830
instead of being self-willed.

617
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,500
Jingjian,

618
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,670
I know his life matters most.

619
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,190
But no matter how hard
I begged Heavenly Mother,

620
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,260
she didn’t agree to compromise.

621
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,070
Does she really want him to die?

622
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,430
Don’t talk nonsense.

623
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,980
Heavenly Mother is always proud,

624
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,030
and she loves you.

625
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,740
Maybe she’s just discontent

626
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,140
because she saw you get humiliated.

627
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,220
All right.

628
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,740
I’ll keep begging her

629
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,550
until she changes her mind.

630
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,260
They’re back.

631
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,790
Where’s Houchi?

632
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,030
Qingmu is dying.

633
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,380
Now that Houchi isn’t here,

634
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,550
she must have gone
to the Pilgrimage Hall.

635
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,500
Considering her weak spiritual power,

636
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,710
she’ll get killed.

637
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,860
No way. I have to go save her!

638
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,980
Stay here and transfer power to him

639
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,860
to keep him alive.

640
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,830
I’m going to the Pilgrimage Hall.

641
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,220
It’s our business.

642
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,310
Considering your embarrassing identity,

643
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,460
if you’re involved,

644
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,430
you’ll be blamed for being
disloyal and unfilial.

645
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,140
Fengran!

646
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,060
(Fuyao Hall)

647
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,740
Heavenly Mother,

648
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,190
you are still in the mood
for watching portraits?

649
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,910
If Qingmu isn’t saved tonight,

650
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,590
he may really die.

651
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,860
Come and look.

652
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,310
This is Yuran of the Feng Clan.

653
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,790
He became a lord when he was
three thousand years old.

654
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,140
His grandfather is Fengyun,
the former head of the Feng Clan.

655
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,670
He’s good-looking

656
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,620
and has strong power.

657
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,980
He’s kind of noble, too.

658
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,460
Heavenly Mother,

659
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,950
what do you mean?

660
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,030
I’ve changed my mind.

661
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,190
Qingmu is far too stubborn.

662
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,030
Even if you marry him,

663
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,980
you can’t change him.

664
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:57,910
Heavenly Mother.

665
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,260
I’m not eager to marry Qingmu now.

666
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,260
I beg you to save him.

667
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,550
I love no one, but Qingmu.

668
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,860
No one can replace him!

669
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,030
Your Highness,

670
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,140
something big happened.

671
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,340
What happened?

672
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,500
Houchi is trying to break
into the Pilgrimage Hall.

673
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,710
Now she’s confronting
the heavenly soldiers.

674
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,910
Houchi is really risking her life?

675
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,860
How dare they cause trouble

676
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,710
in our territory!

677
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,550
The Pilgrimage Hall is our shrine!

678
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,190
Even if you’re a Goddess
from the Qingchi Palace,

679
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,550
you mustn’t break in!

680
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,070
Houchi, are you all right?

681
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,460
Fengran, stop them for me.

682
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,260
Houchi.

683
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,620
Houchi!

684
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,740
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

685
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,550
Houchi!

686
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,190
Greetings, Your Grace.

687
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,830
The barrier of the Pilgrimage Hall

688
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,550
doesn’t block her at all?

689
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,310
What are you waiting for?
Kill the trespasser!

690
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,310
Jingjian, what do you mean?

691
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,190
Heavenly Mother,

692
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,550
it’s my idea to let them come here.

693
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,310
If you want to punish Lady Fengran,

694
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,430
please punish me, too.

695
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,710
Your idea?

696
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,620
Do you think it’s easy to fool me?

697
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,910
Don’t lie to me

698
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,460
simply to show off your courage!

699
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,830
Heavenly Mother,

700
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,860
Qingmu is my close friend.

701
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,670
Fengran...

702
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,910
Fengran is the girl I like.

703
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,740
Today,

704
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,190
I don’t dare to let you in

705
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,550
and I can’t let you in.

706
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,790
If you insist on
entering the Pilgrimage Hall,

707
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,670
please... punish me first.

708
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,340
I’m Houchi from the Qingchi Palace.

709
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,830
I request to see you, Your Majesty.

710
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:10,990
Your Majesty!

711
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,980
Your Majesty!

712
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,590
He’s meditating.

713
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,670
I can’t wake him up
unless I talk with spiritual power.

714
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,070
But I have weak spiritual power.

715
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,550
Forget it.

716
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,710
I can’t care that much.

717
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,590
Your Majesty,

718
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,830
Qingmu is poisoned
with the dragon breath.

719
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,190
No one can save him, but you.

720
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,500
Please lend a helping hand.

721
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,310
Please save Qingmu!

722
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,500
For the sake of my father!

723
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,350
Houchi!

724
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:00,790
Houchi!

725
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,830
What makes me inferior to her?

726
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:07,980
Why is it you?

727
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,150
Where’s Houchi?

728
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,790
To marry you,

729
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
I ignored my parents’ order.

730
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,550
But what did she do?

731
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,220
You’re so badly injured because of her,

732
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,070
but you still want her?

733
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,630
Qingmu, look at me.

734
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,350
It’s me who’s saving your life!

735
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:32,350
Don’t hurt her. Don’t hurt her!

736
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,030
You don’t want me to haunt you,

737
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,500
but I insist on saving you.

738
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,110
I’ll not only save you,

739
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,150
but also make you never forget me!

740
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,830
Houchi?

741
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,830
Don’t be anxious.

742
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,310
You have weak spiritual power.

743
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,740
Let me pass some power to you

744
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,310
and you’ll feel better.

745
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,150
What...?

746
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,070
The Pilgrimage Hall is choosing Houchi
as its owner?

747
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,030
Bad Bai Jue,

748
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,830
you keep me cultivate myself here,

749
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,660
but you’re enjoying himself
in the lower realm!

750
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,310
When I take over the instruction feather
of Chief God,

751
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,110
I’ll kick you to the lower realm first,

752
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,940
let you live in the deepest part
of the North Sea

753
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,180
for ten thousand years, no...

754
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,180
for sixty thousand years

755
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,940
and you won’t come out forever.

756
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,310
Houchi!

757
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,150
No.

758
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,660
She may not handle the Power of Chaos.

759
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,350
If it continues,

760
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,460
she’ll be in danger.

761
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,180
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

762
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,660
Your Grace, happy birthday!

763
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,830
What do you think?

764
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,030
Are you satisfied?

765

(The Pilgrimage Hall)

766
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,220
Impossible!

767
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,310
