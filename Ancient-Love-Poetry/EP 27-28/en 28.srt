00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 28=

3
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Impossible!

4
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,410
This is impossible!

5
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,200
Houchi.

6
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,880
How is Houchi?

7
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,240
Don’t worry.

8
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
The Pilgrimage Hall has selected her
as the master

9
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,160
and transferred
all its spiritual power to her.

10
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,200
She needs at least days

11
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,330
or at most years

12
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,450
to absorb the spiritual power.

13
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,370
Take her to have a rest now.

14
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,800
The Pilgrimage Hall has selected her
as the master?

15
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,920
It’s impossible!

16
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,010
In front of so many people,

17
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,280
Houchi absorbed the spiritual power
of the Pilgrimage Hall.

18
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,800
Why is it impossible?

19
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,160
The Pilgrimage Hall
is a treasure for the Immortals.

20
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,690
We can’t let others own it.

21
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,130
Gu Jun is a disciple of Master Shanggu.

22
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,880
Hadn’t the Pilgrimage Hall fallen
to the Heavenly Palace,

23
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,600
it should have been hers long ago.

24
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,690
Wu Huan,

25
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,730
tens of thousands of years ago,

26
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,850
we were sorry to Gu Jun,

27
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,410
and Houchi.

28
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,770
Let’s give her the Pilgrimage Hall

29
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,850
to compensate for it.

30
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,210
Where is Qingmu now?

31
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,520
Heavenly Father,

32
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,360
Qingmu is at the Zisong Hall.

33
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,410
Please visit him there.

34
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,360
Your Highness,

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,130
if His Majesty knows

36
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,080
you did nothing
to save the North Sea Lord...

37
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,410
It’s dawn now.

38
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,770
No matter how capable Qingmu was,

39
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,850
he’s dead, with nothing left.

40
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,850
It can’t be changed.

41
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,570
What can His Majesty do about it?

42
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,360
Yes.

43
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,080
Heavenly Father, please.

44
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,520
What...?

45
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,290
So weird!

46
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,970
His spiritual power was messy

47
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,000
and twisted not long ago.

48
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,880
How come he’s recovered suddenly?

49
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,880
Jingzhao...! Nonsense!

50
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,360
Heavenly Mother,

51
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,160
I love Qingmu so much.

52
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,080
I can’t watch him die.

53
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,160
Heavenly Mother,
please ask Heavenly Father

54
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,770
not to blame me anymore.

55
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,440
Jingzhao, do you know

56
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,850
you’ll lose your cultivation
without the dragon core,

57
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,880
and you’ll be the same as a mortal?

58
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,490
I don’t care what you did before,

59
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,210
but it’s a serious thing,

60
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,290
how could you make a decision
by yourself?

61
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,930
Do you know

62
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,160
you may die

63
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,520
if anything goes wrong?

64
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,170
Jingzhao, you’re so stupid.

65
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,010
The dragon core is your essence.

66
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,890
It contains all your cultivation

67
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,480
and it’s the basis for you
to become a Goddess.

68
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,890
It can detoxify various poisons,

69
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,130
but how could you be so generous

70
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,010
to give it to others?

71
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,200
Jingyang,

72
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,890
help Jingzhao get up.

73
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,320
She’s weak now.

74
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:07,890
Jingzhao.

75
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,890
Don’t bother.

76
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,610
Jingzhao,

77
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,610
there are so many good men in the world,

78
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,410
why do you only want him?

79
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,080
I like him for so many years.

80
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
I can’t extricate myself from him.

81
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,760
But you could have waited for

82
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,080
Heavenly Father to save him.

83
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,890
Why did you choose this way?

84
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,760
You’re not loving him.

85
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
You’re forcing him.

86
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,520
He would rather die

87
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,410
than marry me.

88
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,450
I’m as light as a feather in his mind.

89
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,290
How could I force him?

90
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,290
Jingzhao,

91
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,760
it’s just a man,

92
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,520
and a blind man.

93
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,890
No matter how much you love him,

94
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,200
you can’t give up yourself

95
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,480
for him.

96
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,890
I could only use this way

97
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,450
to let him remember me forever.

98
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,800
How could I miss it?

99
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,850
Even he’ll marry Houchi,

100
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,200
with my dragon core on him,

101
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,640
he’ll never forget me.

102
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,010
He can never avoid me.

103
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,570
Jingzhao,

104
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,690
what you do is not love.

105
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,130
Listen to me,

106
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,970
let him go,

107
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,320
and let yourself go.

108
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,890
Let him go?

109
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,970
If I can’t get him,

110
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,170
others

111
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,410
can’t, either.

112
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,010
Jingyang,

113
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,520
put Jingzhao in the Fairy-locking Tower!

114
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,410
Without my order,

115
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,290
never release her!

116
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,570
Your Majesty,

117
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,730
she’s so weak now,

118
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,170
how could she go there?

119
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,690
It’s what she deserves!

120
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,240
Heavenly Father,

121
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,890
Jingzhao did take a wrong move,

122
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,320
but with her health condition now,

123
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,850
she may lose her life if we do so.

124
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,730
Life?

125
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,360
Your mother and I

126
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,890
spent so much time and effort on her.

127
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,850
What she becomes now

128
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,570
is what she deserves!

129
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,040
Heavenly Father,

130
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,730
I only like Qingmu.

131
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,970
If you don’t agree,

132
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,360
then,

133
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,040
kill me.

134
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,360
Jingzhao!

135
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,570
Get out.

136
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,450
I don’t want to see you.

137
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,800
Get out!

138
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,360
Heavenly Father!

139
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,080
- Jingzhao.
- Heavenly Father.

140
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,010
Heavenly Father!

141
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,040
Jingzhao was obedient since childhood.

142
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,320
How could she become like this?

143
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,850
She’s grown up

144
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,520
and has her own ideas.

145
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,920
As parents,

146
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,130
we have to make a plan for her.

147
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,890
What’s most important now

148
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,920
is her health.

149
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,640
Without the dragon core,

150
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,290
Jingzhao can’t cultivate herself
anymore.

151
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,520
A mortal can’t bear the spiritual power.

152
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,290
I surely know this.

153
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,640
But what can we do now?

154
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,480
Huan,

155
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,920
you could have saved Qingmu,

156
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,850
but why didn’t you do it?

157
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,200
If you had saved Qingmu,

158
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,850
Jingzhao wouldn’t have become like this.

159
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,680
Qingmu

160
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,080
refused our marriage proposal
in front of all immortals.

161
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,050
I wanted to give him a lesson.

162
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,760
How could I really watch him die?

163
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,050
But I didn’t expect that

164
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,250
Jingzhao loved him so much

165
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,520
that she even gave him her dragon core.

166
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,640
If the True God is still alive,

167
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,410
maybe he can save Jingzhao,

168
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,760
but sadly...

169
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,170
Your Majesty,

170
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,490
no matter how hard it is,

171
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,850
we must find a way.

172
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,260
We can’t

173
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,640
let Qingmu leave here

174
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,290
before we find the way

175
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,170
to save Jingzhao.

176
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,200
That’s all we can do now.

177
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,640
Qingmu.

178
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,640
Houchi.

179
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,290
How do you feel?

180
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,410
You’re awake.

181
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,080
I thought I’d never see you again.

182
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,250
Don’t cry.

183
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,760
I’m fine now.

184
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,760
I’m still alive.

185
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,580
Look,

186
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,200
I’m in perfectly good condition.

187
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,320
As Goddess Houchi

188
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,850
from the Qingchi Palace,

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
you’re well-known
even in the Heavenly Palace.

190
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,410
If anyone else sees you

191
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,850
cry and laugh,

192
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,170
what should you do?

193
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,170
Does the wound in your chest still hurt?

194
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,880
No.

195
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,250
It’s cured.

196
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,120
I’m all good after seeing you.

197
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,760
You don’t have

198
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,930
any dragon breath left in your body.

199
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:55,760
And

200
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,370
your spiritual power

201
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,120
seems stronger.

202
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,680
Yeah.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,370
It’s a blessing in disguise.

204
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,120
Luckily, the Heavenly Emperor

205
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,440
saved me in time.

206
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,560
Not only the Heavenly Emperor,

207
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,320
Jingjian and Fengran

208
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,680
also helped a lot.

209
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,810
I must ask Chang Que to pick
some best spiritual materials

210
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,120
and send them here

211
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,410
to thank them.

212
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,880
Good idea.

213
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,680
But I have to stay more days here

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,680
to attend the birthday banquet.

215
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,970
Birthday banquet?

216
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,440
I was saved from the dragon breath

217
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
thanks to the Heavenly Palace.

218
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,050
I have promised Jingjian

219
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,170
I’ll leave after the birthday banquet.

220
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,320
You refused the marriage proposal

221
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,250
and then broke into
the Fuyao Hall at night.

222
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,490
And after what happened
in the Pilgrimage Hall,

223
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,000
the Heavenly Emperor still saved you.

224
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,970
It’s reasonable

225
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,730
for both of us
to attend the birthday banquet.

226
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,410
You can’t attend it.

227
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,170
Why?

228
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
The Heavenly Emperor
invited me before on Mount Lookout.

229
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,760
Why can’t I?

230
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,760
I don’t want you to do anything
you don’t like.

231
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,320
But...

232
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,050
All right.

233
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,200
There is no “but”.

234
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
You have absorbed the spiritual power
of the Pilgrimage Hall.

235
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,560
You need a good rest now.

236
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:04,970
When you stabilize the spiritual power,

237
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,250
go back to the Qingchi Palace
to wait for me.

238
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,080
I’ll boil the medicine for you.

239
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,760
Heavenly Mother,

240
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,320
Qingmu is my close friend.

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,730
Fengran...

242
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,050
Fengran is the girl I like.

243
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,930
Today,

244
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,370
I don’t dare to let you in.

245
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,320
Your Highness.

246
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,760
Greetings, Lady Fengran.

247
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,760
I want to talk to you.

248
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:01,930
Please sit.

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,970
- Yester...
- Yester...

250
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,810
You first, please.

251
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,410
Yester...

252
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,760
Yesterday...

253
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,370
I know what you said

254
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,490
was to save me.

255
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,250
Don’t worry.

256
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,290
I won’t harass you
with unreasonable demands.

257
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,050
You’re young and capable.

258
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,170
As a prince in the Heavenly Palace,

259
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,370
you have to consider your reputation.

260
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,440
After Houchi and I
go back to the Qingchi Palace,

261
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,370
I won’t disturb you a bit anymore.

262
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:40,850
But...

263
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,610
Don’t worry.

264
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,930
Others may discuss it for days,

265
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,490
but they will forget it one day.

266
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,730
You can marry others then.

267
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,760
I was just worried about
imaginary troubles.

268
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,320
Anyway,

269
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
from now on,

270
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,200
I won’t blame you for Jingyang.

271
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,760
This is glossy Ganoderma
from Endless Mountain.

272
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,850
I will send it and the others

273
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,320
to Princess Jingzhao now.

274
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,640
It’s all my fault.

275
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,520
Jingzhao is spoiled
and got bold and reckless.

276
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,610
Now,

277
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,410
she’ll suffer a lot.

278
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,170
His Majesty has ordered

279
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,170
Qingmu not to leave here.

280
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,120
He’ll be dealt with.

281
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,320
You’re worried about the princess,

282
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,080
but don’t hurt your health.

283
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,170
It’ll be good if it’s so simple.

284
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,760
It’s easy to make another dragon core
for Jingzhao.

285
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,970
Cultivating herself from a mortal

286
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,760
will take her tens of thousands of years

287
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,760
to become an immortal.

288
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,410
If it ends with nothing serious,

289
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,560
it’ll be too merciful for them.

290
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,520
Fengnyu,

291
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,560
do you think Houchi

292
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,320
is similar to Gu Jun?

293
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,810
Your Highness.

294
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,880
Goddess Houchi is stubborn
and indifferent.

295
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,810
It’s exactly the same as God Gu Jun.

296
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,760
But Gu Jun is so charming

297
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,520
that he can impress anyone who sees him.

298
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,370
In terms of appearance,

299
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,120
Goddess Houchi is a little ordinary.

300
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

301
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,410
Shanggu?

302
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,880
No.

303
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,200
She just looks like Shanggu,

304
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,850
but her temper and bearing

305
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,970
are quite different.

306
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,320
This is such a coincidence.

307
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,680
Maybe Goddess Houchi

308
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,610
resembles her birth mother.

309
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,290
She has weak spiritual power.

310
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,050
Her birth mother must be a mortal.

311
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,850
I don’t know who her birth mother is.

312
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,370
This is the daughter
of the Queen and me.

313
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,080
Her name is Houchi.

314
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:23,880
How come the Queen...

315
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,560
Even the Gods

316
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,320
can’t escape love affairs.

317
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,170
The Heavenly Emperor felt sorry for him

318
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,200
and couldn’t do anything to him.

319
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,810
So, I became the egg’s mother

320
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,730
in front of all the Gods,

321
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,170
giving her a good identity.

322
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,080
Gu Jun is a flood dragon.

323
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,490
If Houchi is really his daughter,

324
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,120
I have a way to get back

325
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,170
Jingzhao’s dragon core.

326
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,760
Are you planning to...

327
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,970
Fengnyu,

328
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,490
do you remember

329
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,370
the Huajing Pond,

330
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,610
a restricted area in the Qingchi Palace?

331
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,170
Except for Gu Jun,

332
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,120
no one else is allowed to get in.

333
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,370
Yes, I do.

334
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,170
One day, I went to the garden with you

335
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,560
and almost entered the Huajing Pond.

336
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,970
God Gu Jun was very angry.

337
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,610
Maybe there is

338
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,410
the secret about Houchi’s birth mother.

339
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,760
Or why Gu Jun doesn’t allow
anyone else to enter?

340
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,170
It seems

341
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,810
it’s not me
who betrayed our relationship first.

342
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,490
Fengnyu,

343
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,680
Gu Jun isn’t there now.

344
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,730
Go check it for me.

345
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,010
Yes.

346
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,160
Why are you looking at me like this?

347
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,610
Because you’re beautiful.

348
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,490
But we’ve known each other
for a long time.

349
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,370
Why didn’t you praise me before?

350
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,800
I didn’t praise you like this before?

351
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,650
It was my fault.

352
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,010
From now on,

353
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,650
I’ll praise you three times a day,

354
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,200
for twenty thousand years.

355
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,890
Are we even now?

356
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,400
Well, from now on,

357
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,560
I’ll beat you three times a day.

358
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,890
Then, we’ll be even.

359
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,490
Seriously?

360
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
In the past,

361
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,250
you had weaker power than me.

362
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,730
Now you have the same power as me.

363
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,320
Of course, it’s quite different.

364
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,730
Let me see, is it serious?

365
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,560
Look.

366
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,730
You tease me with such a simple trick.

367
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,890
That’s because you have me in your mind,

368
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,800
or I can’t make it.

369
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,250
Don’t talk.

370
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,970
Let me hug you like this for a while.

371
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,140
♪Time disturb my feelings♪

372
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,650
I thought you’d die this time.

373
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,730
I’m fine now.

374
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,010
Until then, I realized

375
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,010
how much I love you.

376
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,200
It’s a pity
that we can’t be born together,

377
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,440
but I hope we can die together.

378
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,130
It’s exactly the same

379
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,370
as the love story of the mortals.

380
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,920
Houchi,

381
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,320
if I become a mortal one day,

382
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,850
what will you do?

383
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,680
I’d like to give up all my cultivation

384
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,970
and become a couple with you as mortals.

385
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,130
Even if we can only live 100 years?

386
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,250
100 years are good enough.

387
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,490
Without you,

388
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,490
to live 1,000 years or 10,000 years,

389
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,560
or even become an immortal

390
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,440
means nothing.

391
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,440
If you’re not with me,

392
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,130
foreverness is meaningless.

393
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,340
♪For a little talk♪

394
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,940
♪If it’s such a good time
and such a beautiful scenery♪

395
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,180
♪Hope♪

396
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,620
♪Go with me♪

397
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,490
I promise you,

398
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,730
I will accompany you forever.

399
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,400
From now on,

400
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,650
we’ll never separate.

401
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,370
Tell me,

402
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,970
when will you return
the dragon core to Jingzhao?

403
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,010
If you refuse to answer it,

404
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,010
I’ll kill you to take it back now.

405
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,010
Jingyang.

406
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,920
You can’t solve the problem by this.

407
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,250
Why are you always helping an outsider?

408
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
The future of Jingzhao

409
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,560
has been ruined by this guy.

410
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,250
Your Highness,

411
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,400
the birthday of the Queen of Heaven
is coming.

412
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,320
At that time,

413
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,800
I’ll give the Heavenly Palace
an answer.

414
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,250
Remember what you said.

415
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,370
If I can’t return the dragon core,

416
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,440
I’ll compensate for it
with all my cultivation.

417
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,850
You needn’t do anything.

418
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,250
If you don’t do it,

419
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,320
I will kill you!

420
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,730
I only remembered power of the God

421
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,970
could detoxify you.

422
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
But I forgot

423
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,650
the dragon core also could
detoxify various poisons.

424
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,650
Jingzhao went to your room

425
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,850
and told me Mother
went to the Pilgrimage Hall.

426
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,490
I was afraid Houchi and Fengran
would be embarrassed,

427
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,890
and went there too in a rush.

428
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,650
Unexpectedly,

429
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:55,890
I hurt her

430
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,370
and you.

431
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,800
Jingjian,

432
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,490
it’s not your fault.

433
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,490
I asked you here

434
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,730
because I want to meet Lord Donghua.

435
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,250
He may have other solutions.

436
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:17,650
Houchi,

437
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,010
you looked at the chessboard
for a long time.

438
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,800
What were you thinking?

439
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,440
I can hide nothing from you.

440
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,490
Fengran,

441
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,010
look,

442
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,040
the Fuyao Hall of the Queen of Heaven

443
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,440
has a similar layout
with the Pilgrimage Hall.

444
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,200
Does the Queen of Heaven have
relationship with the Pilgrimage Hall?

445
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,320
You don’t know

446
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,080
that the Queen of Heaven
was from the Pilgrimage Hall.

447
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,320
So she manages the Heavenly Palace
as the God Realm.

448
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,080
If so,

449
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,370
the Queen of Heaven knew
True God Shanggu.

450
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,530
True God Shanggu?

451
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,250
Why are you mentioning
the master of all Gods?

452
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,280
When I was absorbing the power
of the Pilgrimage Hall,

453
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,370
I saw True God Shanggu.

454
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,610
She looks exactly the same as me.

455
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,530
How could it be?

456
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,850
Where did she appear?

457
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,530
I don’t know.

458
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,610
I’ve never been there.

459
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,490
It’s not the Immortal Realm
or the Demon Realm,

460
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,530
neither the Human Realm.

461
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,130
The God Realm?

462
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,890
Maybe.

463
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,890
But it has been closed for 60,000 years.

464
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,680
Maybe it’s just a dream.

465
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,440
I don’t know why,

466
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,250
but I have a messy mind recently.

467
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,400
Maybe because you have
redundant spiritual power.

468
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,800
You’ll be fine in a few days.

469
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,250
Demon Lord Ziyue said

470
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,920
that I had a seal in my body.

471
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,370
If the seal is broken,

472
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,080
I may not be me anymore.

473
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,370
What? I don’t understand.

474
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,200
You’re who you are.

475
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,730
How absurd Jingyuan is!

476
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,010
In my childhood,

477
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,250
whenever I asked my father
about the Queen of Heaven,

478
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,320
he would say nothing

479
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,040
and looked very sad.

480
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,530
I couldn’t bear it.

481
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,160
So, I stopped asking him.

482
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,920
Now it seems

483
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,400
what happened

484
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,770
is not that simple.

485
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,250
Houchi,

486
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,440
don’t think too much, all right?

487
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,770
Forget it. Go pack our things.

488
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,680
We’ll leave here tonight.

489
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,370
Tonight?

490
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,080
What about Qingmu?

491
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,680
Qingmu will stay to attend the
birthday banquet of the Queen of Heaven.

492
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,010
He insisted on this.

493
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,490
I think he’s hiding something from me.

494
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,440
Forget it.

495
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,770
We’ll be happy

496
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,490
once we leave this place.

497
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,080
Don’t you have any reluctance?

498
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,530
Why should I?

499
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680
Because of Jingjian.

500
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,200
Houchi,

501
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,080
you’ve gone bad with Qingmu.

502
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,610
If I don’t teach you a lesson,

503
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,680
you don’t remember

504
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,370
I’m the Lady of the Qingchi Palace,

505
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,040
do you?

506
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,730
Stop it. Stop it.

507
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,440
Come here.

508
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,920
I stop. I stop.

509
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,730
Houchi.

510
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,130
Why are you here?

511
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,730
Jingjian hasn’t come back.

512
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,970
If you want to find him,

513
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:45,920
go somewhere else.

514
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,130
No.

515
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,250
I’m coming to find you.

516
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,560
I want to have a talk with you alone.

517
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,680
Houchi.

518
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,890
No worries.

519
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,490
This is the Heavenly Palace.

520
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,920
I’ll be fine.

521
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,650
Sorry that I’m delayed

522
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,370
for something.

523
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,890
Please forgive me.

524
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,130
It doesn’t matter.

525
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,850
This is a beautiful park.

526
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,160
I was watching the scenery here.

527
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,440
It’s good.

528
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,770
I invited you here

529
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,730
because I have a difficult question
to ask you.

530
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,770
The Gold Dragons

531
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,530
were in the heyday in ancient times,

532
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,160
but have declined now.

533
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:24,490
A lot of things

534
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,560
are not known by others.

535
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,130
You’re a senior of ancient times.

536
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,650
Do you know the dragon core?

537
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,650
You’re in the Heavenly Palace already.

538
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,920
But you don’t ask His Majesty.

539
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,080
Is this

540
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,770
related to Princess Jingzhao?

541
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,770
Yes.

542
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,730
It’s related to her.

543
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,320
I was poisoned by the dragon breath
days ago.

544
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,890
To save me,

545
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,850
Princess Jingzhao
gave me her dragon core.

546
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,770
It’s a big favor.

547
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,890
But I don’t deserve it.

548
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,200
So, I can’t accept it.

549
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,970
Please tell me

550
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,490
how to take the dragon core out.

551
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,440
The dragon core will disperse

552
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,530
once entering someone else’s body.

553
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,130
Except the True God,

554
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,680
no one

555
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,610
can take it out.

556
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,320
However,

557
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,160
I have a method.

558
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
But it’s too dangerous.

559
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,160
Dare you have a try?

560
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
Please tell me.

561
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,800
It’s known that

562
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,370
immortals who practice enough

563
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,920
can become Gods.

564
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,010
After enduring 49 thunder strikes

565
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,890
on his body,

566
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,530
he can extract a core

567
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,610
and form a small circle in his body,

568
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,680
turning five elements

569
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,400
into spiritual power continuously.

570
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,680
The Green Dragon Platform
in the Heavenly Palace

571
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,680
is the place for the immortals
to become Gods.

572
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,850
But it hasn’t been opened

573
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,200
for 60,000 years.

574
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,650
If you practice enough,

575
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,610
you can make a core

576
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,440
and replace the dragon core

577
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,010
to solve the problem
of Princess Jingzhao.

578
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,530
Although Qingmu has outstanding
spiritual power,

579
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,400
he’s far from becoming a God.

580
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,890
In the past 60,000 years,

581
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,730
no immortal became a God successfully.

582
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,040
If he goes to the Green Dragon Platform,

583
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,490
I’m afraid he’ll die with nothing left.

584
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,080
It’s not a good idea.

585
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,040
Is there any other solution?

586
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,920
Do you know

587
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
why I come to you today?

588
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,490
Tell me if you want to.

589
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,730
Leave here if you don’t want to.

590
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,080
I’m not interested in guessing you.

591
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,560
As a Goddess,

592
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,850
can’t you find

593
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,250
my difference from before?

594
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,280
I can’t.

595
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,080
Houchi,

596
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,250
I’ve lost all my spiritual power

597
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,490
and my spiritual root.

598
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,400
I’m even not as good as you were before.

599
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,850
Are you satisfied?

600
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,920
You should go to the Queen of Heaven
or the Heavenly Emperor.

601
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,800
Why do you come to me?

602
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,770
What if I tell you

603
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,320
I lost all my spiritual power

604
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,160
because of Qingmu?

605
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,730
Thank you, Lord Donghua.

606
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,730
Sorry for disturbing you. Farewell.

607
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,850
Wait.

608
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,320
Where did this yellow dog come from?

609
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,080
I discovered it on Mount Lookout.

610
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,250
It’s smart.

611
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,440
But

612
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,320
I took it with me for a long time,

613
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,770
it still doesn’t like me.

614
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,560
If you like it,

615
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,730
you can take it.

616
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,560
With its qualification,

617
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,530
it’ll become your Spirit Beast

618
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,040
within 100 years.

619
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,080
Spirit Beast?

620
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,370
It’s too precious!

621
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,530
How could I take it?

622
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,610
You’re young and capable.

623
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,040
You obtained your Taicang Spear

624
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,730
from my Mount Lookout.

625
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,650
There is destiny

626
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,490
between you and me.

627
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,970
Please don’t refuse it.

628
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:46,800
Okay.

629
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:47,850
But

630
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,610
Lord Donghua,

631
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,800
if I die on the Green Dragon Platform,

632
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,650
can I leave this yellow dog
to my beloved Houchi?

633
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,850
You are virtuous and stood by heaven.

634
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,280
You will be fine finally.

635
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,250
Prince Jingjian!

636
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,560
Your Highness,

637
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,320
something may happen at the Zisong Hall.

638
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,730
The status of Goddess,

639
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,610
Qingmu,

640
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,650
and everything I failed to get,

641
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,040
you get them easily.

642
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,680
Now I make it out that

643
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,040
there are many ways to beat you.

644
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,530
It’s not bad to be a thorn

645
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,530
in your heart.

646
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,890
What did you do to Qingmu?

647
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,320
I detoxified his dragon breath.

648
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,320
I saved his life.

649
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,080
I gave my dragon core to him.

650
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,610
We will accompany each other

651
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,370
and will never separate this life.

652
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,400
Jingzhao!

653
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,530
Why did you do this?

654
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,920
If you don’t tangle with Qingmu,

655
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,250
you have nothing else to do?

656
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,160
It should be my question.

657
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,440
You couldn’t even break your shell.

658
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,490
You were abandoned by Mother.

659
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,160
Why do you always compete with me?

660
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,010
Houchi!

661
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,560
This time, he will marry me,

662
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
not you.

663
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,040
You’re joking, Your Highness.

664
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,370
About the marriage,

665
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,610
I’ve made it clear.

666
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:24,970
This life,

667
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,080
I’ll only marry her.

668
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,160
I’ll never regret it.

669
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:28,970
Qingmu...!

670
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,800
Jingzhao!

671
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,650
Jingzhao!

672
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,080
Why don’t you have a rest
at the Xiuyang Hall?

673
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,250
You shouldn’t have come out.

674
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,970
Come on, go back with me.

675
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,130
No.

676
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:48,650
Be good.

677
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,770
No!

678
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,800
Houchi.

679
00:31:58,970 --> 00:31:59,850
When did it happen?

680
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,680
The day before yesterday.

681
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,920
Why didn’t you tell me?

682
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,800
I...

683
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,080
Your Highness,

684
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
at the bottom of the Huajing Pond
was a room.

685
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,400
Obviously, someone lived there.

686
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,160
Why is there nothing special?

687
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,160
There are a lot of books,

688
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,610
recording what happened
in the God Realm of ancient times.

689
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,440
Apart from them,

690
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,130
nothing special.

691
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,010
Maybe the portrait in the room

692
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,890
has something to do
with the room’s owner.

693
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,920
Why does Gu Jun hide his identity?

694
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,080
He’s related to the God Realm.

695
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,400
Who is he?

696
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,010
Houchi. Qingmu.

697
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,680
Shanggu. Bai Jue.

698
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,770
They look so much alike.

699
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,730
Is it really a coincidence?

700
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,560
Never mention

701
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,770
what happened today.

702
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,160
Go back now.

703
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,800
Yes.

704
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,770
I don’t believe it’s a coincidence.

705
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,730
Even the Pilgrimage Hall
belongs to Houchi now.

706
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,610
I’d rather kill the wrong,

707
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,200
instead of letting go.

708
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:34,970
Three-head,

709
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,890
you achieved your cultivation so fast

710
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,040
because of Master’s Purple Moon Power.

711
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,800
But you didn’t report to Master

712
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,130
what happened in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

713
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,440
and only followed Sen Jian’s order.

714
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,400
Did you forget who your master is?

715
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,680
I dare not.

716
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,680
It’s the Demon King’s order.

717
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,920
Demon King has strong spiritual power.

718
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,560
I’m not his match.

719
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,890
You said

720
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,730
what you shouldn’t have said.

721
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,280
Master, forgive me!

722
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,610
I’m guilty.

723
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,280
Please punish me, Master.

724
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,040
You know I value Houchi the most,

725
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,490
but you hid her conditions from me.

726
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,080
Sen Jian,

727
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,080
do you have a different mind from me?

728
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,400
Master,

729
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,490
what I did

730
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,090
is all for your safety.

731
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,730
Now your identity

732
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,090
has been exposed to Wu Huan.

733
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,530
If you come into contact
with the Heavenly Palace

734
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,050
because of Houchi,

735
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,730
I’m afraid... you may invite trouble.

736
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,530
How dare you!

737
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,250
60,000 years have passed.

738
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,490
You’ve forgotten my temper, haven’t you?

739
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,970
Although I lost some God power,

740
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,880
I still have a lot of measures

741
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,440
to control the Demons.

742
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,250
Master,

743
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,810
I’m absolutely

744
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,090
loyal to you.

745
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,570
Back then, I could ruin all the beings

746
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,400
in the Three Realms for her,

747
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,730
not to mention the Heavenly Palace now.

748
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,010
Sen Jian,

749
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,810
if you dare to act
beyond your power again,

750
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,200
I’ll give all the honors

751
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,570
to someone else.

752
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,840
Did the hitting

753
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,010
hurt your God veins?

754
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,400
I’m fine. I’m fine.

755
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,330
I have to say,

756
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,530
you should remember it.

757
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,360
No matter what happens to Goddess Houchi

758
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,330
from the Qingchi Palace,

759
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,440
you must report it to Master.

760
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,490
That Three-head

761
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,330
only told me that

762
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,200
he hurt Qingmu
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp,

763
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,010
without mentioning Houchi.

764
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,920
It’s my fault.

765
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,490
Qingmu is also counted.

766
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,970
Any news about these two

767
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,090
must be dealt with carefully.

768
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,920
Do you still blame Master?

769
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,200
How dare I?

770
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,090
I just think that

771
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,570
he cares so much about Houchi,

772
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,010
I’m afraid he may be misled by love.

773
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:58,970
You have no idea.

774
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,400
Goddess Houchi may have
all kinds of connections

775
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,200
with Master Shanggu.

776
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,840
I can’t tell you more details.

777
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,440
Just keep it in mind that

778
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,090
without the Demon God,

779
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,290
the Demons will lose protection.

780
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,570
The Demon God is the foundation
of the Demons.

781
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,250
It was my mistake.

782
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,400
Master is kind to the Demons.

783
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,330
He even ignores the recovery
of his own power,

784
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,090
supporting demons for so long.

785
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,050
I don’t care about others,

786
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,570
but if only I am alive,

787
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,920
I won’t I betray Master.

788
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,400
Master knows you well.

789
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,440
He asked me to give it to you.

790
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,400
Take it.

791
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,010
You’ll be fine within a month.

792
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,360
The Purple Moon Pill?

793
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,330
Master cares about you.

794
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,050
Don’t disappoint him.

795
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:50,730
I understand.

796
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,490
Houchi,

797
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,400
stop being angry.

798
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,330
Although Qingmu did it wrong,

799
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,920
he did it out of kindness.

800
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,570
You’ve experienced so much together.

801
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,570
You can’t be mad at him for Jingzhao.

802
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,810
I am not mad at him.

803
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,570
Why don’t you agree to meet him?

804
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,050
I’ve been thinking

805
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,250
how to solve the matter

806
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,570
about the dragon core.

807
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,090
Have you found a way?

808
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,010
Almost.

809
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:24,840
In my opinion,

810
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,570
Jingzhao is really contemptible.

811
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,250
Even she saved Qingmu,

812
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,570
she’s too shameless!

813
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,250
Anyway,

814
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,810
she saved Qingmu.

815
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,970
We should thank her.

816
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,530
How about this?

817
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,570
Let’s go back to the Qingchi Palace

818
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,090
and close the protection barrier

819
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,330
for tens of thousands of years.

820
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,490
It will pass then.

821
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,400
We can’t withdraw

822
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,770
in the face of everything.

823
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,010
If we leave here tonight,

824
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,570
how can the Qingchi Palace

825
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,570
gain a foothold in the Three Realms

826
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,880
in the future?

827
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,050
You talk

828
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,570
more and more like a Goddess.

829
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,730
I like it.

830
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,770
Houchi.

831
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,330
You look so anxious.

832
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,570
Are you thinking about
how to please me?

833
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:46,970
Do you want fish soup?

834
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,330
It’s a new dish I learned recently.

835
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,120
When did I become a glutton

836
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,440
in your eyes?

837
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,010
No, no, no. You’re not gluttonous.

838
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,600
It’s just that

839
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,920
I want to cook some tasty food for you.

840
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,440
Since you studied the menu

841
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,530
for me carefully,

842
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,010
I forgive you.

843
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,680
Houchi.

844
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,120
I heard long ago

845
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,250
that the Milky Way in the Heavenly Realm

846
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,570
is stunningly beautiful.

847
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,770
It’s composed of stars
in the Human Realm.

848
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,120
Would you like to go with me to see it?

849
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,050
Of course.

850
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,970
I’d like to watch it with you
however long it may be.

851
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:18,570
