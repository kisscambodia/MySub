00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:28,140
=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,060
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,120
Qiong Qi appeared in the lower realm?

4
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,480
It’s true.

5
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,230
I saw it with my own eyes.

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,160
Now the Southsea in Immortal Realm
is in a mess.

7
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,000
If True God Shanggu

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,870
and True God Bai Jue weren’t there,

9
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,550
I’m afraid
there would have been disaster.

10
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,720
Bai Jue and Shanggu
went to the Immortals?

11
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,630
Tianqi.

12
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,870
True God Shanggu ordered me
to return to the God Realm quickly

13
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,480
and report to you.

14
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,800
Please thoroughly investigate
Qiong Qi’s case.

15
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,590
You may leave.

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,550
Yes.

17
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,800
Stop frowning.

18
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,360
Qiong Qi is an ancient beast.

19
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,080
But Shanggu and Bai Jue are there.

20
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,080
Nothing will happen.

21
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,800
I’m afraid it’s not that simple.

22
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,000
Don’t you forget that

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,110
Qiong Qi came to invade
the God Realm last time,

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,030
which could be seen
as the Devils’ trick.

25
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,630
But now Qiong Qi appears
in the lower realm.

26
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,630
There must be something wrong
in the Demon Realm.

27
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,960
Fine.

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,360
I’ll go have a look and we’ll know.

29
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,550
The Demon Realm is originally of mine.

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,080
If anyone dares to make chaos
on my territory,

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,470
I will teach him a good lesson.

32
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,360
Let me give you some God power.

33
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,160
No need.

34
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,800
It’s just an old wound.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,030
I’ll recover soon back in the God Realm.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,360
Use your God power to take over

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,960
the instruction feather of Chief God.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,190
Now there is an abnormal change
in the Immortal Realm.

39
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,630
We have to go back to the God Realm
as soon as possible.

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,320
Did you think

41
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,080
I am still as useless as I was
a thousand years ago?

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,910
Today’s fight is a real one.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,960
I had a good time.

44
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,720
We have a better tacit understanding

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
than we were at Mount Lookout.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,880
Now your God power
has greatly increased.

47
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,190
You indeed have the prestige
of Chief God of the Three Realms.

48
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,360
Qiong Qi and its clan
have been living in

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,080
the Wasteland of the Demon Realm
sealed by Ancestral God.

50
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,110
They were led by the Devils
to the God Realm before.

51
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,110
I thought it was weird.

52
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,630
I didn’t expect them to break through
the barrier to come here again today.

53
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,360
I think Zhiyang and Tianqi

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,440
already went to the Demon Realm
to investigate.

55
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,600
No need to worry.

56
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,750
Let’s go back to the God Realm first.

57
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,420
(Bai Jue)

58
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,820
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

59
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,320
Shanggu,

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,910
tomorrow you will take over
the instruction feather of Chief God.

61
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,470
Then, all the gods in the God Realm

62
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,190
and the giants in the lower realm
will come to watch the ceremony.

63
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,240
The Inheritance Ceremony
will be complicated.

64
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,270
Rest assured.

65
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,240
I already learned the ancient rituals
by heart a few days ago.

66
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,630
It won’t go wrong.

67
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,160
All right.

68
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,320
And also,

69
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,470
the instruction feather
of Chief God contains

70
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,030
the Power of Rules
and the Power of Chaos.

71
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,040
Be careful when you take it over.

72
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,720
The Power of Chaos in my body

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,270
has merged with the Power of Rules.

74
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,350
The instruction feather of Chief God
can’t hurt me.

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,440
That’s good.

76
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,350
True God Bai Jue.

77
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,760
Do not worry.

78
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,390
I will successfully take over
the position of Chief God

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
and inherit the God Realm.

80
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,950
I know. They were just kind reminders.

81
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
If goddesses who like you are here,

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,040
seeing True God Bai Jue

83
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,640
turn into an old man who likes to nag,

84
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,510
do you think
they will fall in love with others?

85
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,110
Why should I care about them?

86
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,920
I’m going back to have a rest. Just go.

87
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,230
Wait.

88
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,760
When you take over
the instruction feather of Chief God,

89
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,600
can you go to Taoyuan Forest with me?

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,070
I have something

91
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,640
hiding in my heart for long.

92
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,040
I want to tell you about it there.

93
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,760
An appointment between True Gods.

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
I will definitely go there.

95
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,380
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

96
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,230
Master,

97
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
are you really going to…?

98
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
No need to ask.

99
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,790
I have made up my mind.

100
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,160
This is the only way.

101
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,920
But we can tell Master Zhiyang

102
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,040
and Master Bai Jue.

103
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,200
Zhiyang and Bai Jue’s

104
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,270
destinies are to take care
of all beings.

105
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
Between Shanggu and billions of beings,

106
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,440
which do you think they will choose?

107
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,670
What?

108
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,550
You’ve just finished using me,
Goddess of Snow.

109
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,480
And now you want to
go back on your word?

110
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,460
Don’t panic, Goddess of Snow.

111
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,340
Now you are about
to fall into the Devils.

112
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,200
Counting it up,

113
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,350
you and I are of the same clan.

114
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,390
Nonsense!

115
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,350
I am Goddess of Snow!

116
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,270
How could I be of you Devils!

117
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,040
It’s okay.

118
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,640
You have enough time to think about it.

119
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,510
But don’t forget what you promised me.

120
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,200
In the Inheritance Ceremony tomorrow,

121
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,440
you will be the Eye of the Overlord.

122
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,390
We have helped you
return to the God Realm.

123
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,760
This small request
isn’t too much, is it?

124
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,790
Wu Huan.

125
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,950
Elder.

126
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,920
I haven’t seen you for years.

127
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,550
How are you?

128
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,160
Everything is fine.

129
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,880
Elder, please come in.

130
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,640
Okay.

131
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,440
Wu Huan.

132
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,440
Now she is glamorous,

133
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,230
totally different from when she was in
the Phoenix Clan thousands of years ago.

134
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,230
Just like a small man
being intoxicated by success.

135
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,070
When Queen of Phoenix
returns from Nirvana,

136
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,670
there will be no place for her
in the Pilgrimage Hall.

137
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,720
Of course.

138
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,760
Wu Huan, help me get changed.

139
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,390
Wu Huan.

140
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,710
Why... are you here?

141
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,150
I thought it was getting late.

142
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,550
But I couldn’t find you.

143
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,790
So I came here to find you.

144
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,400
Wu Huan said you didn’t want to get up

145
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,400
and asked me to get you up.

146
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,790
Your Grace.

147
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,640
Your Grace.

148
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,760
It’s getting late now.

149
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,200
You should get up and freshen up

150
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,200
to meet the gods from the lower realm
at the Barrier Gate.

151
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,790
I am Chief God.

152
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,590
Why should I go to greet them? You go.

153
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,080
You go for me.

154
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,880
Even if you don’t go to the Barrier Gate
to greet them,

155
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,320
you also should get up.

156
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,280
All people of our Pilgrimage Hall
are gonna go down soon

157
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,470
to the Heaven and Earth Platform
to prepare for the Inheritance Ceremony.

158
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,550
Your Grace, who in the hall
can serve you then?

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,590
I’ve learned everything
in the Nether World.

160
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,400
You go mind your business first.

161
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,960
I’ll stay in bed for a while.
Just for a while.

162
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,440
Then... you’d better
get up quickly later.

163
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,320
A period for a stick of incense at most.

164
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,000
It’ll be improper if you’re late.

165
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,880
You overslept, right?

166
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,230
No way.

167
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,000
I am the one who will be Chief God.

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,520
How could I

169
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,280
be so ridiculous on the day
of the Inheritance Ceremony.

170
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,110
I just took a nap.

171
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,710
Just a nap.

172
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,200
Yes.

173
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,000
Chief God is in charge of everything.

174
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,080
You should take a nap.

175
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
You just said
you looked for me everywhere.

176
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,960
For what?

177
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,520
Divine Brocade.

178
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,670
I found some to make your robes.

179
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,030
You can use it
after you become Chief God.

180
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,470
Only it can be worthy of
Chief God of Chaos.

181
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,230
The silk brocade
which can only be weaved

182
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,350
by goddesses from Endless Mountain
for ten thousand years!

183
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,910
Where did you find it?

184
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,760
I heard that in the entire God Realm,

185
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,030
there is not a piece of clothing
made of Divine Brocade.

186
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,550
A few years ago,

187
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,350
I knew that

188
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,110
one day you would inherit
the position of Chief God.

189
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,150
I prepared it for you then.

190
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,590
A few years ago?

191
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,080
Many years ago,

192
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,230
I read a handwritten note
written by a little girl.

193
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,910
There was a little girl
who was born with blocked God vessels,

194
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,520
but she wanted to practice seriously
more than anyone else.

195
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,030
She didn’t have the God power
to redeem all beings.

196
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,590
But she quietly wrote down

197
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,230
all the sufferings in this world.

198
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,700
When she didn’t have the God power
of Chief God of Chaos,

199
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,320
she had the heart
to benefit the common people.

200
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,280
Along the way,

201
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,960
she hid everything in her heart.

202
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,230
But I saw her desire to advance
and hard work.

203
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,470
Everything she put efforts in,

204
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,030
I understand it
better than anyone else in this world.

205
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,840
Since that day,

206
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,910
I’ve believed

207
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,590
she will be able to be

208
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,550
Chief God of Chaos who cares about
all the beings in the world.

209
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,440
I waited for this day

210
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,080
for a thousand years.

211
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,030
Go get changed.

212
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,590
I’ll accompany you
to the Heaven and Earth Platform.

213
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,220
(The Hidden Pavilion)

214
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,670
Greetings, God Zihan.

215
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,230
Why did God Zihan come to
the Hidden Pavilion today?

216
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,710
Does Master Tianqi

217
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,320
need more treasures
to cultivate his magic weapons?

218
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,440
You are clever.

219
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,200
Yes.

220
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,230
Master Tianqi got
a new piece of obsidian.

221
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,590
He plans to forge a magic sword.

222
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,150
So I come here to get some Sacred Grass.

223
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,110
God Zihan.

224
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,400
You forgot to give us

225
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,550
the warrant of True God Zhiyang.

226
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,640
Oh, yes.

227
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,520
I must have arrived too hurriedly

228
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,790
and left it in the Taichu Hall.

229
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,520
How about this?

230
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,000
I’ll give it to you later.

231
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,280
This won’t work.

232
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,000
You must have the warrant

233
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,110
from True God Zhiyang
to enter the Hidden Pavilion.

234
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,640
There are too many treasures
and most evil things

235
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,520
in the Hidden Pavilion.

236
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,280
We can’t afford this responsibility.

237
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,760
Okay.

238
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,760
Then I will go back

239
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,440
and fetch it for you.

240
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Thank you.

241
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,100
(The Hidden Pavilion)

242
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:02,880
Who is there?

243
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,220
God Zihan!

244
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,760
God of Four Seasons, together with Gods
of Wind, Rain, Thunder and Lightning,

245
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,440
congratulate Chief God on the succession
of Chief God of Chaos.

246
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,590
God of Stars congratulates Chief God on
the succession of Chief God of Chaos.

247
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,280
Congratulate Chief God on the succession
of Chief God of Chaos.

248
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,880
May Chief God long live
and the Three Realms prosper.

249
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,080
May Chief God long live
and the Three Realms prosper!

250
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,910
Feel free.

251
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,550
Thank you, Chief God.

252
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,230
Brothers, thanks for all your
kind teaching for thousands of years.

253
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,350
I will bear it in my mind.

254
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,280
It’s the time.
Please take out the Yingsheng Stone.

255
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,320
Chief God of Chaos,
please open the Yingsheng Stone

256
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,030
and take over
the instruction feather of Chief God.

257
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,280
Tianqi?

258
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,400
Tianqi!

259
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,950
Tianqi, what are you doing?

260
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,710
Tianqi.

261
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,640
I’ve been planning for this for tens of
thousands of years! You’re ruining it!

262
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,070
Tianqi.

263
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,710
This is not a place where you can joke.

264
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,470
Return the instruction feather
of Chief God right now.

265
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,520
Don’t come over.

266
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,280
What if I don’t give it to you?

267
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,920
Tianqi, don’t mess around today.

268
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,070
Why she was born to have
the instruction feather of Chief God?

269
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,040
Am I not qualified
to be in charge of the God Realm?

270
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,880
Tianqi, the instruction feather
of Chief God is the God Realm’s Seal.

271
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,590
Only Chief God of Chaos can have it.

272
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,160
If you snatch it, this is a big crime.

273
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,310
So what?

274
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,760
You also said that

275
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,190
the instruction feather of Chief God
is the Seal of the God Realm.

276
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,590
Now this instruction feather is mine.

277
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Given time,

278
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,880
I will be the most powerful God
in the God Realm.

279
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,830
And I will become
the most honorable Chief God

280
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,400
of the God Realm!

281
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,830
Tianqi!

282
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,680
You stay at
the Heaven and Earth Platform,

283
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,920
and I will get him back.

284
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,760
Report to you, True God.

285
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,000
God Zihan broke into the Hidden Pavilion

286
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,950
and killed the guardians.

287
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,560
Now he’s heading
towards the Barrier Gate.

288
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,880
Pass my order.

289
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,110
Ring the Chaos Clock.

290
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,310
Never let the instruction feather
of Chief God leave the God Realm.

291
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,760
Yes!

292
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,110
Bai Jue, you lead the guardians

293
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,950
and arrest Zihan back.

294
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,160
You are way too much today.

295
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,350
When are you going
to stop making trouble?

296
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,000
Step aside.

297
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,710
I don’t want to fight with you.

298
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,710
Me either.

299
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,230
But in front of others,

300
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,350
I have to give an explanation
to the gods.

301
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,640
Explanation?

302
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,190
Do you know what I will suffer

303
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,710
if I fall into their hands?

304
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,560
You can’t be clearer that

305
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,590
how they treated Xuanyi
70,000 years ago.

306
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,190
But you are not Xuanyi.

307
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,710
In their eyes,

308
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,880
the True God who is not loyal
to the God Realm

309
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,350
is the second Xuanyi.

310
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,950
Shanggu, if you still miss
our friendship of the past.

311
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,000
Let me go.

312
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,830
I promise you that

313
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,680
I only borrow the instruction feather
of Chief God temporarily.

314
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,400
When the matter is over,

315
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,470
I will definitely return it to you.

316
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,760
Tianqi,

317
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,230
what trouble exactly do you have?

318
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,230
Can’t you talk to us?

319
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,190
My trouble is much bigger
than you may think.

320
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,350
In the lower realm,
you can still worship the God for help.

321
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,470
But what should the True Gods do
if they are in trouble?

322
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,920
Let me think.

323
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,070
It’s too late, Shanggu.

324
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,070
Do you really want to watch me

325
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,400
being asked for accountability
by the gods

326
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,000
and doomed eternally?

327
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,190
Zihan.

328
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,760
What happened in the Hidden Pavilion?

329
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,560
Did you really kill the guardians?

330
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:56,920
What?

331
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,400
The guardians died?

332
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,110
I did not do that!

333
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,640
That’s good.

334
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,470
At least you didn’t kill any god.

335
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,310
Come back with me

336
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,680
and explain the things
happened in the Hidden Pavilion clearly.

337
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,400
No.

338
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,400
I can’t go back.

339
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,470
Zihan.

340
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,950
Tianqi has rebelled the God Realm.

341
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,230
If you continue to make trouble,

342
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,470
you will only hurt him.

343
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,760
True God Bai Jue.

344
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,560
Master entrusted me with a crucial task.

345
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,470
I can’t go back.

346
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,070
Excuse me.

347
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,430
How come the Purple Jade Whip
is in your hands?

348
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,470
Zihan, you dare to instigate
the Demons to cause chaos.

349
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,230
Are you insane?

350
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,920
What exactly is Tianqi’s plan?

351
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,000
If you really want to help him,

352
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,000
just go back with me.

353
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,680
True God Bai Jue,

354
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,470
I have no choice.

355
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,710
You will understand it in the future.

356
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,760
Idiot.

357
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,070
I ordered you to keep a close eye
on the God Realm

358
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,830
and let Shanggu inherit the throne
of God smoothly.

359
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,000
How dare you let Tianqi
ruin my ideal plan!

360
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,760
Please calm your anger down, Overlord.

361
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
It’s my fault.

362
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,760
How will we end now?

363
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,830
If only Shanggu were dead,

364
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,760
there would still be three people left
to deal with. It’d still be troublesome.

365
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,680
But since Tianqi rebelled the God Realm,

366
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,950
we will just take this opportunity

367
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,950
to let the gods fight themselves.

368
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,070
Then the situation
will be better for us.

369
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,800
Yes!

370
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Tianqi.

371
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,760
Now that you have broken
the Rules of God Realm,

372
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,160
you will be killed
by the hands of all gods.

373
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,830
Master Tianqi has snatched
the position of Chief God openly.

374
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
He’s so unrestrained.

375
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,710
Please pass the order

376
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,830
of severe punishment for Tianqi.

377
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,000
Master Zhiyang,

378
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,800
how could Tianqi betray the God Realm?

379
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,680
Don’t you know his temperament?

380
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,920
He always dodges the political affairs
you asked him to do.

381
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,950
How could it be possible that he wants
to snatch the position of Chief God?

382
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,640
Shanggu and Bai Jue have gone
to capture them.

383
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,470
I don’t believe they can escape
from the God Realm.

384
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,280
The Trial of the Three Halls
hasn’t come out an answer yet.

385
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,760
The truth about the Hidden Pavilion
has not been found out.

386
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,280
We can’t easily condemn Tianqi.

387
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,920
Master Zhiyang, do you want to
cover up for the Taichu Hall?

388
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,710
Goddess of Snow,

389
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,800
be careful with what you say.

390
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,590
Master Zhiyang,

391
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,520
I’m just worried about the God Realm.

392
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,110
If it weren’t for Tianqi instructing Zihan
to rebel the God Realm,

393
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,560
why did he commit the crime
of killing gods?

394
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,040
That’s right, Master Zhiyang.

395
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,520
The witness of Zihan’s crime
is still there.

396
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,760
If you didn’t make a decision early,

397
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,880
I’m afraid the disaster 70,000 years ago
would reappear.

398
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,640
Master Tianqi fought for the God Realm
in the north and south,

399
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,800
making great contributions.

400
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,230
If he hadn’t encountered
an extremely difficult thing,

401
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,760
he wouldn’t have got to this point.

402
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,160
Even if you don’t believe in him,

403
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,520
I do.

404
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,520
If all gods don’t protect him, I will!

405
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,760
Quiet.

406
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,430
Don’t talk nonsense in the Chaos Hall.

407
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,590
God of Wind.

408
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,760
Did you mean that

409
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,710
Tianqi should be sentenced to death?

410
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,350
I dare not to say that.

411
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,560
I know all your worries.

412
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,160
I will never believe that

413
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,680
Tianqi will be like Xuanyi back then.

414
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,430
Before God’s punishment comes,

415
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,640
he is still the master of Taichu Hall.

416
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,520
A True God of the God Realm.

417
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,230
I and the other two True Gods
will find out the truth

418
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,470
and give a satisfactory answer to you.

419
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,430
Yes.

420
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,640
Hurry up and report to the True God!

421
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,000
Tianqi has escaped from the God Realm!

422
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,430
Bai Jue.

423
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,920
How could you get hurt so badly?

424
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,520
Just now at the Barrier Gate,
in order to resist the Purple Jade Whip,

425
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,950
I used the Power of the Original Being.

426
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,040
My old wound of spirit got hurt.

427
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
It seems that I can no longer use

428
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,400
the Power of the Original Being
in a short time.

429
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,110
Tianqi has escaped from the God Realm.

430
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,350
You let him go?

431
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,590
Yes.

432
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,590
Have you ever thought about it?

433
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,920
If you did this,
the gods would no longer respect you.

434
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,640
Even if you took back the Chief God’s
instruction feather in the future,

435
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,920
you might not be able
to take over the God Realm.

436
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,430
But I can’t stand it

437
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,950
watching you and Zhiyang
cut his God bones

438
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,190
and imprison him in the Nether World.

439
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,470
Zhiyang and I would never do that.

440
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,470
But even if he is exempt from death,

441
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,350
a severe punishment is inevitable.

442
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,590
Bai Jue.

443
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,350
Ten thousand years ago, I was born
on the Heaven and Earth Platform.

444
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,560
The first person I saw was Tianqi.

445
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,560
He and Yuemi accompanied me every day

446
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,470
and took care of me when I grew up.

447
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,280
He is my closest elder brother.

448
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,190
He’s also the person I trust most
among the Three Realms.

449
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:26,920
Shanggu.

450
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,430
We don’t know
what Tianqi is going to do now.

451
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,160
Only if he stays in the God Realm
can we save him.

452
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,590
I only know that

453
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,230
if he really wanted to be Chief God,

454
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,280
in these ten thousand years,

455
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,040
he would have countless opportunities
to kill me

456
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,800
and defect.

457
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,000
He wouldn’t choose today.

458
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,950
Yeah, I know.

459
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,640
Tianqi is stubborn and obstreperous.

460
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,590
Even if the position of Chief God
were given to him,

461
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,520
he wouldn’t accept it.

462
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,950
His deeds today…

463
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,000
Master!

464
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,230
There must be something else hidden.

465
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,800
Your Grace,

466
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,710
what’s wrong with Master?

467
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,920
His spirit is extremely damaged.

468
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,920
The Pith of the Plane Tree
from the Phoenix Clan

469
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,190
and the Original Being of Chaos
should be used together

470
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,190
to heal his injury.

471
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,350
I’ll go to the Phoenix Clan in a while.

472
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,680
You must guard Changyuan Hall.

473
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,470
No one is allowed to come inside
until I come back.

474
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,430
Yes, Your Grace.

475
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,470
Hongri,

476
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,710
tell me everything
that happened to your Master

477
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,710
these one thousand years.

478
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,560
Tell me in detail.

479
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,400
As long as she is safe,

480
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,070
let alone ten thousand years’ lifespan,

481
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,560
even if it’s
a hundred thousand years’ lifespan,

482
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,230
I won’t mind.

483
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,520
So you got hurt so badly
because of protecting me

484
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,880
in the Nether World.

485
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,560
You’ve always been with me.

486
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,640
Your injuries are all because of me.

487
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,710
However, I have been here
for thousands of years

488
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,350
suffering from gains and losses.

489
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,760
You obviously love me.

490
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,000

I have shown you
the Inheritance Ceremony.

505
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,230
What else do you want me to do?!

506
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,430
Why a rare beauty like Goddess of Snow

507
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,280
still so unrefined?

508
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,040
You and I are both of Devils.

509
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,920
If you kept being so noisy,

510
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,040
could it be that you hope
the entire God Realm

511
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,040
find you have fallen into the Devils?

512
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,560
Nonsense!

513
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,760
It’s all your fault!

514
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,680
If you hadn’t done something to me

515
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,800
in the Nether World,

516
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,430
how could I have been contaminated
with the Devilish Energy?

517
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,560
Such a pity.

518
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,880
Even though you have returned
to the God Realm now,

519
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,470
you still can’t get True God Bai Jue.

520
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,950
What is the delicacy for?

521
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,640
As long as you cooperate
with me obediently,

522
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,680
Overlord will definitely help you

523
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,190
achieve whatever you want.

524
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,230
Wu Huan.

525
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,190
I didn’t know Goddess of Snow
would suddenly arrive. Forgive me.

526
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,590
What can I do for you?

527
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,000
You are really loyal to her.

528
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,070
No wonder you are from the lower realm.

529
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,070
You are really silly.

530
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,430
I heard that right after
she returned to the God Realm,

531
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,070
she ordered you to go
to Mount Kunlun to cultivate yourself.

532
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,310
Does she know
how hard you have been working on

533
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,190
taking care of the halls of True Gods?

534
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,640
You have to attend to
the dignity of Chief God

535
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,230
and balance the relationships
with the gods from other halls.

536
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,880
This is much harder

537
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,470
than cultivating yourself.

538
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,640
Does Goddess of Snow
come to the Pilgrimage Hall

539
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,160
specially to care about me?

540
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,110
Wu Huan.

541
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,110
I just want to tell you
that I understand you.

542
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,920
Chief God is in the high position.

543
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,560
She has big things to deal with.

544
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,400
She could leave you
in the Pilgrimage Hall

545
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,310
without gratitude.

546
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,280
Does she know how hard it is to manage
the Pilgrimage Hall for the first time?

547
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,040
Has she ever cared about you?

548
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,800
Does she know what you did for her?

549
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,880
I have no leisure time. Excuse me.

550
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,520
By the day,

551
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,640
the spirit of Queen of Phoenix
is about to be reborn from Nirvana.

552
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,430
By then,

553
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,640
will Shanggu still have
a miscellaneous phoenix

554
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,640
around?

555
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,830
Without the blessing
of the Pilgrimage Hall,

556
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,830
you will live worse
than a thousand years ago.

557
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,590
Her Grace won’t treat me like that.

558
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,560
You don’t have to sow discord here.

559
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,040
We’re the same poor people.

560
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,470
Just to remind you.

561
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,430
Did you know that Shanggu
is going to the Phoenix Clan?

562
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,760
You can go back and ask her

563
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,310
whether it’s true or not.

564
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,830
It’s my own business.

565
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,400
I won’t bother you, Goddess of Snow.

566
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,520
Shanggu.

567
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,830
Yuemi.

568
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,160
Shanggu,

569
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,000
Did you really let Tianqi go?

570
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,590
I did it alone.

571
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,160
But I have something urgent
to deal with right now.

572
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,950
When I come back,

573
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,280
I will explain to the gods.

574
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
At this critical moment,

575
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,190
where are you going?

576
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,560
What?!

577
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,430
How could his spirit be seriously injured
and he be in a coma?

578
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,280
I suffered several times
in the Nether World.

579
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,040
It was his power of spirit
to help me out.

580
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,800
I didn’t expect Bai Jue

581
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,040
to be more affectionate
than you were back then.

582
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,190
But the situation in the God Realm
is so tense now.

583
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,920
Don’t let others know
that Bai Jue is injured.

584
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,280
Otherwise, everyone in the God Realm
will feel insecure.

585
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,710
Just because of this,

586
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,830
he kept hiding his injury.

587
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,760
The Four True Gods
are being questioned right now.

588
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,230
So there has to be no problem at all.

589
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,880
Luckily, the Pith of the Plane Tree from
the Phoenix Clan can heal his injury.

590
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,760
I will go get it now.

591
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,950
Before I’m back,

592
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,430
I hope you can stay
in the Pilgrimage Hall

593
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,680
and help Wu Huan preside over
the overall situation.

594
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,000
I’m afraid of her being bullied.

595
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,040
Do not worry.

596
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,710
I’ll guard the Pilgrimage Hall for you.

597
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,710
And I won’t let others
embarrass Wu Huan.

598
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,800
The situation of the Demons
is not clear now.

599
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,640
You must be careful

600
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,520
on your way to the Phoenix Clan.

601
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,920
There is one more thing
I want to remind you of.

602
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,950
I heard that Feng Yan
is about to reborn from Nirvana.

603
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,470
When you get to
the Phoenix Clan this time,

604
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,110
why don’t you bring her back with you?

605
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,070
The spirit of Queen of Phoenix is fake.

606
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,430
Even after another thousand years,

607
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,590
she won’t reborn.

608
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,040
What’s wrong?

609
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,880
Is there any problem?

610
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,920
I know you pity Wu Huan.

611
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,310
But now the God Realm is in chaos,

612
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,520
with her alone,

613
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,400
it’s hard for her to contend with
Xueying and the other gods.

614
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
To keep her guarding the Pilgrimage Hall

615
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,230
will do no good to her.

616
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,430
And over the years,
I have witnessed her temperament.

617
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
She’s still surly

618
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,280
and she needs to temper herself more.

619
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,230
Moreover, the Phoenix Clan is the head
of all the clans of the Divine Beasts.

620
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,040
With the help of Queen of Phoenix,

621
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,160
your authority of the Pilgrimage Hall
can be as firm as a rock.

622
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,280
I understand what you said, Yuemi.

623
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,470
Wait for me to come back.

624
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,800
Let’s discuss it then.

625
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,230
Alright.

626
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,520
The Phoenix Clan.

627
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,430
Queen of Phoenix.

628
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,710
Yuemi.

629
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,710
I said it before.

630
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,630
Don’t let Her Grace go down
to chase Tianqi.

631
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,840
Who knows what kind of relationship
is between those two?

632
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,900
That’s it.

633
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,940
She just let that traitor

634
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,660
escape from the God Realm so easily.

635
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,840
I heard that the Demons
are already full of barriers.

636
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,360
And the Demons have already rebelled.

637
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:07,950
What do you think this place is?!

638
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,710
How dare you be so ignorant!

639
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,760
Yuemi.

640
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,910
Although you are Chief of Gods of Stars,

641
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,560
here is the Chaos Hall.

642
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,870
It’s not your turn to give us orders.

643
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,080
Where is Her Grace?

644
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,230
Tianqi escaped from Her Grace.

645
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,520
Why didn’t Her Grace
give us an explanation?

646
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,870
Greetings, Master.

647
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,280
As you said,

648
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,800
I asked Shanggu to capture Tianqi.

649
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,230
Could it be that I am also the one
who let go of Tianqi?

650
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,150
I dare not mean it.

651
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,120
Shanggu went down to the lower realm

652
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,800
to find traces of Tianqi.

653
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,470
She’s not in the Pilgrimage Hall.

654
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,600
If you dare to mess around here,

655
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,950
don’t blame me for being impolite.

656
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,430
In my opinion, it is inappropriate
for Master to do so.

657
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,560
Tianqi’s case is serious.

658
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,760
Hesitation will only cause chaos.

659
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,630
Watch your mouth!

660
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,870
You’re not qualified to judge
the affairs in the God Realm.

661
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,080
I dare not.

662
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,470
My words are all for
the God Realm’s good.

663
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,600
Chief God is still young.

664
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,470
Considering her relationship
with True God Tianqi,

665
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,870
she wouldn’t want to punish
the Taichu Hall severely.

666
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,870
We can understand that.

667
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,760
But Master and Master Bai Jue

668
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,470
both have experienced the rebellion
of the Devil God 70,000 years ago.

669
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,320
Do you want that devastating disaster

670
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,000
to repeat in the God Realm?

671
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,910
How could the God Realm and all beings

672
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,840
be safe at that time?

673
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,630
What Goddess of Snow said is true.

674
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,360
Please take the world
as the most important thing, Master.

675
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,520
Please take the world
as the most important thing, Master.

676
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,230
So, Goddess of Snow,

677
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,800
what do you think we should do
with Tianqi?

678
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,150
According to the Rules,

679
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,280
remove his title,

680
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,430
give him God’s punishment,

681
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,280
cut his God’s bones,

682
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,560
imprison him in the Nether World

683
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,190
and never let him out of it.

684
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,120
Rest assured, all gods.

685
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,800
The disaster happened 70,000 years ago

686
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,520
will never replay.

687
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,670
The disaster caused by Tianqi this time

688
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,520
affects the entire God Realm,

689
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,560
I am willing to accept the result
on behalf of him.

690
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,230
Master Zhiyang has always been fair.

691
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,710
Since Master has a word,

692
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,000
then we’ll wait for Her Grace
to come back

693
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,320
and decide on this accordingly.

694
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,760
I finally came to the God Realm
from the Phoenix Clan.

695
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,560
No one can let me go back.

696
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,150
No one.

697
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,280
Wu Huan.

698
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,150
It was such a mess outside.

699
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,910
Why didn’t you go out and help Master?

700
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,470
Her Grace did let go of Master Tianqi.

701
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,040
I was afraid the gods
would make it difficult for me.

702
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,190
I didn’t know how to deal with it
for a while.

703
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,120
If so, I would let the gods
see the weakness.

704
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,630
Even if they made things difficult,

705
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,150
we would have Master protect us.

706
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,040
What are you afraid of?

707
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,280
I…

708
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,630
Her Grace is Chief God.

709
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,840
Even if she made a mistake,

710
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,190
no one would dare to judge her.

711
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,630
But you and I
would be treated differently.

712
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,950
We are just the low-grade
in the God Realm.

713
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,040
If the gods blamed it,

714
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,040
I’m afraid we couldn’t afford
the consequences.

715
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,150
Master treats you and me very kindly.

716
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,430
She trusts us deeply.

717
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
If something really happened,

718
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,470
Master would definitely protect us.

719
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,710
You must believe in her.

720
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,280
I... I believe in Her Grace indeed.

721
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,520
It’s just that...

722
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,520
I really panicked at that scene.

723
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,150
It can’t blame you.

724
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,670
But now the situation is so tense.

725
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,910
We must keep the Pilgrimage Hall
for Master.

726
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,080
Your Grace.

727
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,630
This is the Pith of the Plane Tree.

728
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,630
Thank you, Elder.

729
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,390
The Pith is extremely hard.

730
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,670
Only with fig wine,

731
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,760
refining it with Chaos Fire,

732
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,040
can produce curative effect.

733
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,600
Elder.

734
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,000
Is it the spirit of Feng Yan
in the canopy?

735
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
Exactly.

736
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,150
Calculating by time,

737
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,800
after a few more months,

738
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,080
Queen of Phoenix will be reborn.

739
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,910
Although you have mercy

740
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,080
and don’t fuss about
the origin of my Phoenix Clan,

741
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,630
after Queen of Phoenix’s Nirvana,

742
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,000
she will go to the God Realm

743
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,950
to be your Divine Beast.

744
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,190
Elder,

745
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,230
I want Wu Huan to accompany me always.

746
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,000
Well…

747
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,360
Your Grace.

748
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,470
Wu Huan was just
a Colorful Phoenix after all.

749
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,000
Her God power is limited.

750
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,360
I’m afraid
she won’t be a great assistant to you.

751
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,520
I know her talent for cultivation
is not much.

752
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,120
But since I chose her,

753
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
I would wait for her.

754
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,080
I am Chief God of the God Realm.

755
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,280
If I abandon her
because of her weak God power

756
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,430
and choose Queen of Phoenix,

757
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,360
then in the future,

758
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,390
if there are someone else
stronger than Queen of Phoenix,

759
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,000
what choice should I make then?

760
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,560
Your Grace is right.

761
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,560
All right.

762
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,150
I just hope
she can concentrate on cultivation

763
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,870
and win honor for my Phoenix Clan.

764
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,670
Thank you for your understanding, Elder.

765
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,360
Then, after Feng Yan is reborn,

766
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,760
she…

767
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,280
Just let her be carefree

768
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,360
and grow up freely.
