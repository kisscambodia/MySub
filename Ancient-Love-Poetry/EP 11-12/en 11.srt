00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
=Episode 11=

3
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,520
Master.

4
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,240
How dare you escape from
the Nether World,

5
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,800
inciting Qiong Qi and them
to break in the God Realm?

6
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,270
You asked for it.

7
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,720
Master.

8
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,830
Welcome back.

9
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,160
Your Grace.

10
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,670
Welcome back.

11
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,390
It’s been a thousand years.

12
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,390
How have you been?

13
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,550
Today, your behavior was heroic.

14
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,550
But I have one doubt.

15
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,350
You were supposed to guard
the Nether World.

16
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,790
Where did you hear from the news
of Qiong Qi?

17
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,390
Master.

18
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,550
Today, Her Grace broke the barrier
and went out.

19
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,440
I was meant to greet her.

20
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,510
Then I saw a demon sneaked out
of the barrier.

21
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,600
I worried that he’s up to something.

22
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,720
So I followed him.

23
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,510
That’s how I found
out Qiong Qi’s behavior.

24
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,550
It seems like after exiling
for a thousand years,

25
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,320
you’ve learned a lot.

26
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,950
I should praise you for today.

27
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,320
I’m incredibly honored.

28
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,550
I was trapped in love
a thousand years ago

29
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,790
and made a huge mistake.

30
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
All I did today was to atone for it.

31
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,200
If you can understand,

32
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,000
please allow me to go back to God Realm.

33
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,230
I will never cause any trouble again.

34
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,110
Well.

35
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,550
God Realm’s always been righteous
on reward and punishment.

36
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,640
From now on, you can resume your post

37
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,760
to be in charge of four seasons again.

38
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,480
Thank you, Master.

39
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,070
I was practicing in
the Deicide Flower Field that day.

40
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,790
All of a sudden, a bunch
of Demons attacked me.

41
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,160
Countless arrows aimed at me.

42
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,920
(The Pilgrimage Hall)
I had no chance to take a break.

43
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,720
During the fight,

44
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,790
someone wanted to sneak attacked me

45
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,350
while I got blew up.

46
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,760
Sharp sighted as I was,

47
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,070
I grabbed a branch.

48
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,480
When I was about to steady myself,

49
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,640
the branch broke.

50
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,590
Broke?

51
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,150
Did you get hurt?

52
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,200
Weirdly,

53
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,520
an inexplicable spiritual power
caught me.

54
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,470
Spiritual power?

55
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,400
There’s more than that.

56
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,110
During the past thousand years,

57
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,030
a familiar voice has always lingered
in my ears.

58
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,080
Shanggu.

59
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,200
He always gives me strength

60
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,150
when I’m helpless.

61
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,440
I guess

62
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,150
it’s from one of you.

63
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,440
You came to the Nether World
to help me cultivate.

64
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,440
Who do you think

65
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,590
it’d be among the three of us?

66
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,400
It’s you. Ice Cube.

67
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,030
Bai Jue.

68
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,710
Maybe it’s God’s will which helped you

69
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,080
out of the danger.

70
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,880
Yeah, Shanggu.

71
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,760
You and Devil God sat the barrier
outside the Nether World.

72
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,640
Even we can’t break in.

73
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,230
But I saw that man’s figure.

74
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
You saw Bai Jue?

75
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,550
Not only Bai Jue,

76
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,030
but also Zhiyang, Wu Huan,

77
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,760
Gu Jun and Yuemi.

78
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,230
I guess

79
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,880
you just missed us too much.

80
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,000
Shanggu.

81
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,520
You’ve had a hard time

82
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,520
in the Nether World.

83
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,760
Though it’s hard,

84
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,350
it brought me fortune.

85
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,910
Without having cultivated in there,

86
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,230
my spiritual power wouldn’t
improve this much.

87
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,280
Here.

88
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,400
Let’s raise our glasses.

89
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,640
To Shanggu’s spiritual power.

90
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,350
How come you can’t drink

91
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,110
as much as before now?

92
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,440
I can’t hold the liquor.

93
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,000
Ice Cube.

94
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,640
What a bummer.

95
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,440
You knew Shanggu was coming back

96
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,350
but you hurt your spirit.

97
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,910
You hurt your spirit?

98
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,640
It’s nothing.

99
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,790
I practiced too hard.

100
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,710
Shanggu.

101
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,760
Now you’ve acquired
the power of chaos, you should

102
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,080
take over the instruction feather
of Chief God now.

103
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,230
You only care if I can

104
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,230
take over the instruction feather.

105
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,280
Bai Jue.

106
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,670
You were too impatient.

107
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,400
We have waited for tens
of thousands of years.

108
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,350
Give it a few more days.

109
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,710
Shanggu.

110
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,910
Take a good rest.

111
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,150
Then we’ll talk about the rest.

112
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,520
Yeah.

113
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,470
Ice Cube.

114
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,150
If you can’t drink more,

115
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,670
go back to sleep.

116
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,030
I know that

117
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,520
the Lower Realm’s spiritual power
is losing.

118
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,030
You’ve been waiting for me for long.

119
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,350
I pity all living creatures.

120
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,840
As Bai Jue wishes,

121
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,710
I’ll take over

122
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,440
the instruction feather
after half a month.

123
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,470
That day will be a day
of a brand new start.

124
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,590
I have other business to do. See you.

125
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,670
Bai Jue.

126
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,880
Never mind.

127
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,640
His presence would make it awkward.

128
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,910
Luckily I’ve got you two.

129
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,910
Let’s enjoy tonight!

130
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,400
Enjoy tonight!

131
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,470
Here. Let’s drink hammered.

132
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,280
Master.

133
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,150
I’m fine.

134
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,790
You are the best at making bed.

135
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,440
You also prepared my favorite
Goddess Incense.

136
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
I can finally have a good sleep tonight.

137
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,910
Your Grace.

138
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,280
You’ve suffered a lot
in the Nether World.

139
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,710
You should take a good rest
for some days.

140
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,230
Let me take good care of you.

141
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,080
I know it’s been harder for you.

142
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,640
Those immortals are always snobbish.

143
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,960
I left in a rush.

144
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,230
You were inexperienced.

145
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,590
I guess it wouldn’t be easy for you

146
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,150
to be in charge of the Pilgrimage Hall.

147
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,080
No matter how hard I had to work,

148
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,880
I’ve never felt wronged.

149
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,960
Now, Your Grace has gained
the spiritual power

150
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,640
and is taking over
the instruction feather.

151
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,150
The Pilgrimage Hall

152
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,470
is finally becoming the primary hall.

153
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,000
It doesn’t matter if it is.

154
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,470
It’s all nonsense that I used to say.

155
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,590
Don’t worry. Now that I’m back,

156
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,080
I’ll definitely protect you
in the future.

157
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,880
From now on,

158
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,710
just relax and focus on cultivating.

159
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,640
In my opinion,

160
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
your power can’t compete
with Muguang and Gu Jun.

161
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,640
Does Your Grace think
my power is too weak

162
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,470
to be in charge of the Pilgrimage Hall?

163
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,230
Silly. That’s not it.

164
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,910
God Realm always respects those
who are powerful.

165
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,670
The newly promoted immortals

166
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,520
all have great power.

167
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,320
Now you’re in charge
of the Pilgrimage Hall.

168
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,440
They seemingly show respect to you.

169
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,790
But if you don’t improve your power,

170
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,550
they won’t be convinced.

171
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,470
Except for Yuemi and Gu Jun,

172
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,400
you are my closest one.

173
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,110
My wish for you is

174
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,760
that even if you leave the hall someday,

175
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,080
you can still be a qualified Goddess.

176
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,080
I’m not smart enough.

177
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,590
Your Grace thinks highly of me.

178
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,350
I will surely

179
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,200
not let you down.

180
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,760
Well.

181
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,470
It’s been a long day.

182
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,670
Now, go and have a rest.

183
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,080
Wu Huan’s personality

184
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,640
needs to be more cultivated.

185
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,880
I’ve thought about you
for a thousand years.

186
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,320
But you...

187
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,700
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

188
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,150
Wu Huan.

189
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,790
What are you thinking?

190
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,030
Chief God left for a thousand years.

191
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,670
Did you really think

192
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,960
you can stay in the Pilgrimage Hall

193
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,670
forever?

194
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,790
A fake would always be a fake.

195
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,910
It’d never be real forever.

196
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,340
(Changyuan Hall)

197
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,840
Can you report to Master

198
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,710
that I’m here to see him?

199
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,110
Master Bai Jue is
no longer your teacher.

200
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,840
I used to be Master
Bai Jue’s apprentice.

201
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,520
Now I’m back to God Realm.

202
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,400
I ought to pay him a visit.

203
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,030
Go. Go. Go.

204
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,910
It’s very late now.

205
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,150
Master has gone to bed.

206
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
You should leave.

207
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,590
Hongri.

208
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,320
Master.

209
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,400
Master.

210
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,400
Greetings, Master.

211
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,030
After so many years,

212
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,110
Master is still elegant.

213
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,590
You’ve fought your way back
to God Realm.

214
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,230
You should mind your business.

215
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,670
Don’t cause any trouble anymore.

216
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,000
Don’t come here again.

217
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,080
I don’t want

218
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,110
to see you anymore.

219
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,710
Master.

220
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,200
Master.

221
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,910
Master!

222
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,280
- You can’t break in.
- Master!

223
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,800
Do you know how much effort I spared

224
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,040
to come back to God Realm?

225
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:16,950
Master.

226
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,040
Why don’t you want to see me?

227
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,000
Master. Master.

228
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,260
(Changyuan Hall)
Master.

229
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,500
Let it go.

230
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,000
Just forget it.

231
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,880
Master.

232
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,800
No matter what you do,

233
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,520
Master has made up his mind.

234
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,590
You are not the one in his heart.

235
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,920
Stop doing this.

236
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,520
If you continue to do so,

237
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,070
I would despise you as well.

238
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,180
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

239
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,800
Here.

240
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,000
What do you think?

241
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
Are you satisfied with it?

242
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,190
You are the honorable Chief God
of the Three Realms.

243
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,430
It’s such an honor for you
to prepare for my birthday party.

244
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,070
I couldn’t be happier.

245
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,040
This is to celebrate your
one hundred thousandth birthday.

246
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,310
I’m afraid you wouldn’t be satisfied

247
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,520
if I don’t throw you a big party.

248
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,520
I’m thrilled with all of this.

249
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,590
However,

250
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,830
when have you become a fan

251
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,760
of such big occasions?

252
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,190
It’s to make you look good.

253
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,070
So pretty.

254
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,310
It’s so much better.

255
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,110
Yeah.

256
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,340
- Happy Birthday
- Happy Birthday

257
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,520
- to Goddess of Moons & Stars.
- to Goddess of Moons & Stars.

258
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,400
You sure seized the chance.

259
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,880
You’re having a baby now.

260
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,950
If it weren’t

261
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,350
for Yuemi’s credit,

262
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,190
we wouldn’t have a chance to be married.

263
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,280
Thank you.

264
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,760
Your love is solid as gold.

265
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,470
I only provided you a chance.

266
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,950
Today is the Goddess’s birthday.

267
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Don’t be restrained.

268
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,760
Enjoy as much as possible.

269
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,760
I brought you a birthday gift
from the Nether World.

270
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,710
I will show you

271
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,190
after they leave.

272
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,590
What is it?

273
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,400
Well, it took me three whole days
to prepare it.

274
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,640
Your birthday gift

275
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,800
has to be the most precious thing
in this world.

276
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,110
Shanggu.

277
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,070
Thank you for the party.

278
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,760
I have a gift for you, too.

279
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,190
What is it?

280
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,470
Let’s go. Let me show you.

281
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,070
Wu Huan.

282
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,400
Take good care of the guests for us.

283
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,920
Yes, Goddess Yuemi.

284
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,640
Let’s go.

285
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,920
What a scenery!

286
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,310
No wonder it’s the Taoyuan Forest.

287
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,920
Well?

288
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,160
Is this the gift

289
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,190
for me?

290
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,430
What if it is?

291
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,000
Of course I’d like

292
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,230
the gift you give me.

293
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,470
I’m happy, too.

294
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,230
I saw the God of Night and God of Day.

295
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,470
It reminded me

296
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,040
Puhua once held

297
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,950
the Dating Event here.

298
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,430
It feels like yesterday.

299
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,590
Who’d know

300
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,040
a thousand years have passed.

301
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,190
Do you still remember it?

302
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,310
How come you suddenly
thought about that?

303
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,400
Do you feel lonely?

304
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,590
Puhua went to the Lower Realm
for practice.

305
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,430
When he’s back,

306
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,800
I’ll ask him

307
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,430
to set you up with many blind dates.

308
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,470
In this life,

309
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,310
I don’t think I’ll ever meet the one.

310
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,040
You’ve only lived for tens
of thousands of years.

311
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Your life is still long.

312
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
It’s too early to say.

313
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,950
How about you?

314
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,400
How about your love life?

315
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,350
It’s been a thousand years.

316
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,230
Do you still think about that Ice Cube?

317
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,590
In his mind,

318
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,640
the Three Realms matter more
than his personal emotion.

319
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,880
I’d rather give other people a chance

320
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,920
than just focusing on his.

321
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,590
Do you mean it?

322
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,920
Of course not.

323
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,470
I practiced hard for a thousand years

324
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,350
just to be as good as him.

325
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,310
But I don’t want to be swayed

326
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,710
by emotions like I used to.

327
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,310
Shanggu.

328
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,230
I asked you out

329
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,520
to say something to you.

330
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,400
What do you want to say so seriously?

331
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,880
Actually,

332
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,640
during the time you left,

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,590
I could rarely see Bai Jue in God Realm.

334
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,350
He only showed up on serious occasions.

335
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,560
But whenever I saw him,

336
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,070
he’s always pale.

337
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,590
It looked like he was weak.

338
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Weak?

339
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,520
What else did you see?

340
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,950
Nothing much.

341
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,710
You know him.

342
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,350
He doesn’t like being close to others.

343
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,160
He’s always alone.

344
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,070
I didn’t dare to ask about it.

345
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,680
However,

346
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,640
I think there must be something wrong.

347
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,280
During the past thousand years,

348
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,040
a familiar voice has always lingered
in my ears.

349
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,470
He always gives me strength

350
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,400
when I’m helpless.

351
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,190
Original being comes to one.

352
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Break the three pure ones together.

353
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,680
I guess

354
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,400
it’s from one of you.

355
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,830
You came to the Nether World
to help me cultivate.

356
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,230
Maybe it’s God’s will which helped you

357
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,070
out of the danger.

to help me in the Nether World,

361
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,710
it’d be a huge damage
to his original being.

362
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,310
I wonder...

363
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,040
What are you thinking about?

Marry him?

00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,800
you want to marry Bai Jue?

Yes.

To marry an ordinary immortal

425
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,760

Goddess Yuemi.

438
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,640
Her Grace went to the Lower Realm
a few days ago.

439
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,760
She asked me

440
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,950
to give you the instruction feather

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,310
I was inspecting the Lower Realm today.

454
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,710
But surprisingly there was Qiong Qi
in the Southsea, too.

455
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,190
I fought with them already.

456
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,680
But I wasn’t enough to beat them.

457
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920

No... It’s too late.

463
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,710

468
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,430
Your power is too weak.

469

Just stay here and guard

471
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,070
I’ll go to the Chaos Hell

Stay here. I’ll go.

Just some Qiong Qi.

474
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,160

475
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,310
she can handle them all.

492
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,560
If anyone’s wood carving

493
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,520
can exceed my craftsmanship.

494
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,800

I’ve only won a few treasures here.

504
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,880
I think the collectors

505

You are so articulate.

507
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,710
I brought my family ancestral
wood carvings today.

508
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,800
- Family wood carving?
- Is it better than yours?

509
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,470
This treasure is perfect.

510
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,920

511
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,430
It looks good.

to come here for a tour?

523
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,160
What a coincidence!

524
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,880
It’s destined that

525
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,680
we met here.

526

How about we travel together?

527
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,310
Nonsense. Go back.

528
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,310
Stop it.

529
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,520

530

Do you know each other or not?

531
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,350
- Right
- Right.

532
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,230
Do you know each other?

533
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
Dear Immortals,

534
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,400
a thousand years ago,

535
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,470
I started to learn from him.

536
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,040
Unexpectedly I fell in love with him.

537
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,430
But I did not know how to confess.

538
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,640
So I paid all my attention

539
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,070
to him.

540
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,070
As a result,

541
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,470
he decisively pushed me away

542
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,830
for various reasons.

543
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,400
I was hurt deeply.

544
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,430
So I decided to forget him

545
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,470
and travel all around the world
for years.

546
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,800
Guess what?

547
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:11,950
Now he regrets it

548
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:12,680
and comes to me.

549
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,950
Pestering me all the time.

550
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,190
But

551
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,560
I don’t know if I should forgive him.

552
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,160
What should I do?

553
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,310
Immortal.

554
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,400
A man of integrity never
regrets things given up.

555
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,070
Ignore him.

556
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,230
- Yeah...
- Ignore him!

557
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,920
But I think

558
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,310
he is still in love with her.

559
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,760
I have swore

560
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,710
and made up my mind

561
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,400
to not go back together with him.

562
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,070
But whenever I see him,

563
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,800
the feelings in my heart
got aroused by him again.

564
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,190
You see.

565
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,280
He likes wood carvings.

566
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,310
So I wanted to gather
all the traditional handicrafts

567
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,520
of the Three Realms to him.

568
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,760
Tell me.

569
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,590
How come I’d be so obsessed with him?

570
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,190
Did he go too far?

571
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,000
He doesn’t know how
to cherish a good relationship

572
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,520
and misses it.

573
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,560
It’s too bad, isn’t it?

574
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,640
Right.

575
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,520
- Be together!
- Yeah!

576
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:05,230
Be together! Be together! Be together!

577
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,310
I didn’t expect that True God Bai Jue

578
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,760
would have such an awkward moment.

579
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,760
How does it feel?

580
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,310
It’s unpleasant to
be misunderstood, right?

581
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,950
It’s too miserable.

582
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,920
But there’s someone who’s willing
to endure it for a thousand years.

583
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,040
Do you think this person deserves it?

584
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,110
I did not push you away ruthlessly.

585
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,680
Not to mention pestering you
all the time.

586
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,230
This is a new storybook I read.

587
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,680
Do you think I was talking about you?

588
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,000
This is a relief of Donghuang.

589
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,350
This is a root carving of Qingqiu.

590
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,830
Shanggu.

591
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,310
You’re about to take over the place
of the Chief God.

592
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,800
Don’t waste your time around anymore.

593
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,760
Wasting my time?

594
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,400
There was a man who’s worse
than me a thousand years ago.

595
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,830
He often showed up and disappeared

596
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,830
from time to time.

597
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,880
There is no one else here.

598
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,640
You can say whatever you want to say.

599
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,190
He just doesn’t like the crowd.

600
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,400
Not only that.

601
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,880
He’s not good at getting close
with others, too.

602
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,950
Then how do you think

603
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,760
that person should do?

604
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,680

I used to think

you value my position of Chief God

626
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
more than your feelings for me.

627
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,110
You care more about if I can take
the responsibility of the Three Realms.

628
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,160
It seems that every day
you stayed with me

629
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,280
was to make sure I inherit
the instruction feather.

630
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,470
Shanggu...

631
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,000
For example, you opened
my vessels for me

632
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,840
to improve my strength.

633
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,950
I also took credit for sealing
Overlord Xuanyi.

634
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,000
You helped me subdued the Feng Clan
and took over Gu Jun.

635
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,630
It was to calm the God Realm’s doubt
to me as the Chief God.

636
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,470
You asked me to go to the Nether World

637
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,670
to practice a thousand years
for self-improvement,

638
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,840
and deal with the crisis of the collapse
of the chaos power in the Three Realms.

639
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,910
Shanggu.

640
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,670
You are the God of Chaos.

641
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,870
It’s your duty to succeed to the throne.

642
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,430
The later you take over the throne,

643
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,470
more dangerous the Lower Realm would be.

644
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,840
I know.

645
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,280
All beings in the Three Realms
are my duties.

646
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,360
But I’m afraid that when I become
the Chief God,

647
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,710
it’s harder for you to say
how you feel about me.

648
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,840
You will think that the duty
of the Chief God comes first.

Nothing else matters.

Do you want to go out for a stroll?

665
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,560
The feeling of being struck
back and forth

666
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,390
is not pleasant, is it?

667
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,870
But you are not a fish.

(Fairy lantern)

00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:14,630
Yes.

671
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,670
It’s beautiful.

672
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,230
Right.

673
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,760
Didn’t you love the peach
blossom stuffing before?

674
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
I’m used to the spring and fruits
in the Nether World.

675
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,710
I don’t like these sweet things
any more.

676
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,150
Let’s go. Let’s go over there.

677
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,910
Will you buy the latest
rabbit lantern for your sister?

678
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,870
Excuse me.

679
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Why did you say that?

680
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,280
You should say that the two
of us make a good couple.

681
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,760
And we should buy a pair
of Mandarin duck lanterns.

682
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,190
Don’t mislead me.

683
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,280
I have seen all kinds of immortals.

684
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,470
But you don’t

685
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,670
look like a couple.

686
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,230
Why did you say that?

687
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,600
You stayed so far away from each other.

688
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,950
So you don’t look like a fairy couple.

689
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,600
I will buy them all.

690
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,870
Great. Great.

691
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,040
Which one do you like?

692
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,910
I do not like these.

693
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,630
You don’t like these?

694
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,560
Then you must like this.

695
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,560
How did you get this kite?

696
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,600
Guess.

697
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:36,870
What are you doing?

698
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,360
Don’t you even know this?

699
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,470
Immortals will write the lover’s name

700
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,430
on the lanterns.

701
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,190
Then put the lanterns into the water.

702
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,670
They’ll sincerely pray to us

703
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,710
to bless them for a lifetime of love.

704
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,520
So that they can get what they want.

705
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,950
But Puhua is still in
the reincarnation path.

706
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,280
What is the point of writing these?

707
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:54,950
If you keep talking nonsense,

708
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,320
I’ll throw your kite in the water.

709
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,630
How did you get this kite?

710
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,470
It wasn’t just this kite.

711
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,950
Someone’s been

712
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,230
keeping my beloved toy

713
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,080
and the notes I wrote

714
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,470
in his study room.

715
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,950
It’s been a thousand years.

716
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,190
Why do you think he

717
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,430
saved my stuff like this

718
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,670
as if they were treasures?

719
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,950
What do you want to say?

720
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,360
I’ve said what I want

721
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,870
a thousand years ago.

722
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,150
I wanted to say in the Taoyuan Forest,

723
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,840
and in the Mount Lookout.

724
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,910
Bai Jue.

725
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,760
I...

726
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,150
Who is it to interrupt
my romantic moment?

727
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,230
Your Grace.

728
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,280
I didn’t know Your Grace and True
God Bai Jue came to the Lower Realm.

729
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,560
Sorry for meeting you so late.

730
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,000
I am the God of Water

731
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,760
I did not call you out.

732
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,910
Just now, I received the lanterns
from Your Grace.

733
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,470
The lantern also says...

734
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,950
- That Bai...
- Shut up!

735
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,120
I must have written it
too fast to be clear.

736
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,560
This night is dark without light.

737
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,560
You didn’t see it clear either, did you?

738
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,190
What do you want to say?

739
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,390
What is written on the lantern?

740
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,080
It’s not important. It’s really not.

741
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,560
I also arranged a lot of fun activities.

742
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,840
Qiong Qi! Qiong Qi is coming.

743
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,560
Qiong Qi?

744
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,000
- Hurry up and go!
- Go! Quickly.

745
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
So the chaos by Qiong Qi is true.

746
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,800
It seems that the seal
of the Demon Realm is broken.

747
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,950
So Qiong Qi has been
causing troubles all around.

748
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,040
Muguang and Gu Jun just returned
from the Wasteland.

749
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,950
How? How come it happened again?

750
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,120
When we find out the truth,
everything will be clear.

751
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,950
Go to the God Realm
and report to Master Zhiyang.

752
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,600
Tell him that

753
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,390
Bai Jue and I are here
to suppress the rebellion.

754
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,000
Ask Tianqi and Master Zhiyang.

755
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,630
to go check the seal of the Demon Realm

756
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,190
and see what happened
in the Demon Realm.

757
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:03,800
Yes.

758
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,950
You have not yet recovered.

759
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,870
Let me do it.

760
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,710
I’m fine.

761
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,600
We must trap and kill Qiong Qi.

762
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,840
If we let one go,

763
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,150
there will be a great disaster
in the Immortal Realm.

764
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,360
The natural chaos power
in the Heavenly Realm has thinned.

765
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,710
It’s unsuitable to use spiritual power.

766
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
If you and I fight them now,

767
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,190
this place will be in ruins.

768
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,630
What should we do then?

769
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,950
Do you remember the swordsmanship
I taught you on the Mount Lookout?

770
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,710
You mean to use the sword power
of the Ancestral Sword?

771
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,190
Right.

772
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,950
The Ancestral Sword is one
of the four Divine Weapons.

773
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,600
Add it with your power,

774
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,950
I think the power on the Ancestral Sword

775
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,520
would be enough to kill Qiong Qi.

776
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,520
