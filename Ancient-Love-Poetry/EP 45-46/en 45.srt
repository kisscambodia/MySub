=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 45=

3
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,000
Please punish me.

4
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,040
Houchi?

5
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,120
Who is that?

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,080
After I woke up,

7
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
the Three Realms have all changed.

8
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,120
My memory still remains
at the Nether World.

9
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,680
The Nether World?

10
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,360
We haven’t met for long.

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,630
As my servant,

12
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,120
you didn’t even greet me.

13
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,190
I’m sorry.

14
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,510
You just awakened.

15
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,950
Do you

16
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,590
feel well?

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,190
I am energetic,

18
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,630
full of the Power of Chaos.

19
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,550
Never mind.

20
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,800
Since it’s all in the past,

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,080
I’d say something else.

22
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,030
Over these 60 thousand years,

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,550
have you been the Leader
of the Feng Clan?

24
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,360
Master, you don’t know.

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,440
When the God Realm was in chaos,

26
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,030
the Feng Clan was in a panic.

27
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,830
Elder Feng Yun appointed me
to be the Leader.

28
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,960
I could not refuse

29
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,670
but accepted.

30
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,320
It’s known by the Three Realms.

31
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,630
If you don’t believe it,

32
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,320
you may ask other immortals.

33
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,600
Since you’re the Leader
of the Feng Clan,

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,190
why did you kill Wuxi and Feng Yan?

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,630
I am wronged, Master.

36
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,910
It’s Elder Danfeng who killed Feng Yan.

37
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,960
Who is Elder Danfeng?

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,110
What’s the feud
between Feng Yan and her?

39
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,240
Elder Danfeng has killed herself.

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,960
I didn’t know the truth.

41
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,470
You mean,

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,720
there is no evidence for these things?

43
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,000
I didn’t mean that.

44
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,270
After 60 thousand years,

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,390
you’ve changed a lot.

46
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,750
No.

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,190
I just underestimated you

48
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,750
from the very beginning.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,520
Wu Huan.

50
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,750
I don’t wanna see you again.

51
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,750
When the God Realm is reopened,

52
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,160
you shall not enter it.

53
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,110
Yes, Master.

54
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,140
(Daze Mansion)

55
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,270
Do you eat this?

56
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,000
I wanna eat this.

57
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,270
This? Okay.

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,550
Here.

59
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,000
It’s good.

60
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,540
Is it?

61
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,190
Did Master Shanggu really awaken?

62
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,270
If it’s true,

63
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,240
wasn’t the wedding
of True God Bai Jue...?

64
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,670
Things have changed.

65
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,600
The Heavenly Palace
would have a disaster.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I am Donghua.

67
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,510
My respect, Master.

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,550
Aunt, did you help me get revenge?

69
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,830
I wouldn’t let you suffer.

70
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,270
You may all rise.

71
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,600
It’s Lord Donghua’s birthday today.

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,790
I came in a hurry.

73
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,160
Yuanqi dirtied your Spiritual Spring.

74
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,790
We are so sorry.

75
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Your presence

76
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,350
has been a great honor for me.

77
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,440
I refined this elixir

78
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,670
when I was bored.

79
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,670
It was made as candy for Yuanqi.

80
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,510
Now I give it to you

81
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,270
as a gift.

82
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,070
It’s refined by True God.

83
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,390
It can ascend an immortal to a god.

84
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,000
It’s a great gift.

85
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,160
Thank you, Your Grace.

86
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,760
You are welcome.

87
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,480
Fengran told me

88
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,390
you’re of great potential.

89
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,200
I guess you’ll soon ascend to a god.

90
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,790
After your ascension,

91
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,760
you may visit the Pilgrimage Hall

92
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,480
when you’re free.

93
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,040
Thanks for your blessings.

94
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,200
Do you mean

95
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,760
you’ll soon go back to the God Realm?

96
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,920
But it was closed

97
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,200
60 thousand years ago.

98
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,110
I have a plan for it.

99
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,320
Let’s go.

100
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,270
My respect, Master.

101
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,040
Jingzhao.

102
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,270
Are you the daughter
of Muguang and Wu Huan,

103
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,200
the woman Bai Jue just married?

104
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,760
Yes.

105
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,640
I slept for tens of thousands of years.

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,640
I know little about the things
in the Immortal Realm.

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,640
I wonder how old you are.

108
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,640
I am 20 thousand years old.

109
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,230
20 thousand years old?

110
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,320
You’re no longer young.

111
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,510
Let me ask you.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,270
Have you ever taken charge of
the Three Realms

113
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,550
and benefited the people
as your father did?

114
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,600
No.

115
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,070
Have you ever set up a sect,

116
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,070
cultivated disciples as Donghua did

117
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,670
and made contributions
to the Three Realms?

118
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,000
You neither earned honor

119
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,950
nor made contributions.

120
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,200
Do you have the right to see me?

121
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,760
Just because you are

122
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,830
the Princess of Heavenly Palace?

123
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,390
Don’t you want to know
this kid’s identity?

124
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,830
- His mother is...
- Jingzhao.

125
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,160
Mother.

126
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,880
Yuanqi.

127
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Who hit you just now?

128
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,560
Mother.

129
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,640
Wu Huan.

130
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,480
You are the Heavenly Empress.

131
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,550
I’ll show you some respect.

132
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,230
You shall disciple your daughter

133
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,720
and never repeat

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,390
the same mistake.

135
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,440
Mother.

136
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,830
Did she really slap Wu Huan?

137
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,720
What was her look?

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,270
Did her face

139
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,160
turn purple with rage?

140
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,000
You don’t allow us
to go to Mount Lookout, do you?

141
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,670
Why are you asking?

142
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,720
Do you want a weapon or not?

143
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,200
It depends on what it is.

144
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,390
You...

145
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,320
That Wu Huan

146
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,920
was slapped by my aunt.

147
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,510
Her face swelled like a pig.

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,270
How could Bai Jue

149
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,390
marry that woman Jingzhao?

150
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,550
Yuanqi is a good kid.

151
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,270
Poor boy.

152
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,640
Shanggu.

153
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,440
Be honest.

154
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,350
Do you mind that
Bai Jue married another woman?

155
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,350
He’s so cruel to his own son.

156
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,790
Isn’t it ridiculous
if I still care about

157
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,200
the old affections?

158
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,050
By the way,

159
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,350
is Yuanqi’s birth mother named Houchi?

160
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,640
How did you know it?

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,760
Can’t I know it?

162
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,510
Do I have anything to do with Houchi?

163
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,920
You shouldn’t go to Mount Lookout.

164
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,400
She has passed away.

165
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,200
You don’t have to know.

166
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,520
Just 60 thousand years.

167
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,440
Why is everyone so strange?

168
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,350
Strange?

169
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,520
I’m the same as ever.

170
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,000
I have no secret to you.

171
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,840
Tianqi.

172
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,470
The thing about reopening
the God Realm...

173
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,590
Since you’ve awakened

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,790
and all things are set,

175
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,880
it’s time to reopen the God Realm.

176
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,710
I’ll cultivate hard

177
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,960
and recover my power.

178
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,030
Then we may have a try

179
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,030
at the Bronze Bridge.

180
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,030
Sure.

181
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,440
That boy.

182
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,080
I have to repair it for him.

183
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,350
Yuanqi.

184
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,470
Aunt.

185
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,110
What is it, Aunt?

186
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,200
Keep an eye on your uncle.

187
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,710
If he has any move,

188
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,880
tell me immediately.

189
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,550
Uncle Tianqi?

190
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,640
Is it okay?

191
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
When it’s done...

192
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,400
The delicious wonton in Southsea.

193
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,710
Deal.

194
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,550
Hadn’t Muguang gotten in my way,

195
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,440
I could’ve killed Houchi.

196
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,030
There would be no shame like this!

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,710
Wu Huan.

198
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,710
Master Shanggu awakened.

199
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,710
That’s a huge matter.

200
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,590
I was going to the Xuantian Hall

201
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,110
to tell you about it.

202
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,670
At the Mount Lookout,
Chief Goddess told me

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,960
she’d cultivate in seclusion
in Qingchi Palace.

204
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,400
The day to reopen the God Realm
will soon come.

205
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,110
In that case,

206
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,230
I might not disturb her.

207
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,710
Well, I have something to ask you.

208
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,470
Go ahead, Your Majesty.

209
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,960
Where is Fengnyu?

210
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,590
Fengnyu?

211
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,840
She told me she’d cultivate
in the mortal world.

212
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,590
I agreed.

213
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,590
She might’ve gone back
to the Parasol Forest.

214
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,790
Don’t you surely know it?

215
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,470
I dare not deceive you.

216
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,280
The Immortal Realm
isn’t peaceful lately.

217
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,910
Many immortals were murdered.

218
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,200
According to investigation,

219
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,110
their death has something
to do with Fengnyu.

220
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,840
Fengnyu is kind by nature.

221
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,710
How could she kill them?

222
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,200
Your Majesty.

223
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,440
Be sure to look into it.

224
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,790
I hope she didn’t.

225
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,710
I’m going to the Dome.

226
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,350
If there’s any news about Fengnyu,

227
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,400
let me know immediately.

228
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,440
Shanggu is already strong.

229
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,080
The fight against True God
must not be delayed.

230
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,080
Now,

231
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,280
we must estrange them

232
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,470
to turn the tide.

233
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,590
Go to the Demon Region.

234
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,710
I need more evil force.

235
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes.

236
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,470
I’m not missing you.

237
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,350
I’m just used to wearing it.

238
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,910
My wrist feels light if it’s taken off.

239
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,280
Aunt.

240
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,350
Why haven’t you gone to bed?

241
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,030
Shouldn’t it be my question?

242
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,760
I’ve done my job well.

243
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,440
I saw Uncle Tianqi sneaking
out of Qingchi Palace.

244
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,840
He seldom hangs out all these years.

245
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,760
He has no friends.

246
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It’s fishy.

247
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,470
You can still catch up with him.

248
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,790
When I’m back,

249
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,230
I’ll take you to Southsea
for wonton.

250
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,710
It’s great to have a mother.

251
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,550
Aren’t they unacquainted?

252
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Why did Tianqi give Ancestral Sword
to Bai Jue?

253
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,000
Find a chance to open the God Realm.

254
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,230
Shanggu is already suspecting.

255
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,400
If this continues,

256
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,960
she’d recall her past with you.

257
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,320
I’ll watch over Jingzhao.

258
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,710
She won’t say anything more.

259
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,670
If Shanggu comes again,

260
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,230
just give her the cold shoulder.

261
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,320
If it doesn’t work,

262
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,910
play some tricks.

263
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,440
Tricks?

264
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,840
What are they talking about?

265
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,440
I can’t hear clearly.

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,790
What are you doing?

267
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,910
If I remember correctly,

268
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,550
I’ve told you

269
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,150
not to come to the Dome.

270
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,470
Where is my Ancestral Sword?

271
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,590
Why can’t I sense it?

272
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,280
Is it your excuse to get in my room?

273
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,470
I saw

274
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,550
Tianqi and you plotting something.

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,880
If it doesn’t work,

276
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,590
play some tricks.

277
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,150
Our relationship long ended
60 thousand years ago.

278
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,320
You keep harassing me.

279
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,400
I feel troubled.

280
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,470
I’ve died once

281
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,440
in the battle with Xuanyi.

282
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,230
Thus,

283
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,000
I meant it

284
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,080
when I told you
that I wanted a new life.

285
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,470
If you can’t forget me,

286
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,910
I’m glad to have some pleasure.

287
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,550
Bai Jue.

288
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,760
You are so disgusting now.

289
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,110
Disgusting?

290
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,030
Those girls all like it.

291
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,110
Don’t take yourself so seriously.

292
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,760
Tianqi and you must hide something
from me.

293
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,960
I’ll figure it out.

294
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,350
Master.

295
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,110
Muguang and Sen Yu are here.

296
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,110
Yuanqi.

297
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,670
Where’s your mother?

298
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,670
I can’t find her so early.

299
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,790
Where did she go?

300
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,520
Uncle Tianqi has come back.

301
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,110
Why hasn’t my mother been back?

302
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,080
Didn’t she tell you?

303
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,280
I just got up.

304
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,670
I don’t know where she went.

305
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,670
Never mind.

306
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,400
Given your mother’s power,

307
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,150
she’s unrivalled in the Three Realms.

308
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,880
She must be bored

309
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,520
and hang out alone.

310
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,320
That’s nonsense.

311
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,000
She won’t go alone.

312
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,030
She’ll take me along

313
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,230
if she hangs out.

314
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,590
Yuanqi.

315
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,230
What’s the matter?

316
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,000
Tell me the truth.

317
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,030
Are you hiding something from me?

318
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,400
No.

319
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,590
No?

320
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,910
Why do I feel

321
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,960
you’ve gotten ungrateful

322
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,790
since your mother awakened?

323
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,440
If I help you,

324
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,840
I’d be truly ungrateful.

325
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,440
You and your mother

326
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,840
cheated me once.

327
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,400
Are you doing it again?

328
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,760
Don’t be oversensitive.

329
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,200
Be honest.

330
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Where has your mother gone?

331
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,160
Uncle Tianqi.

332
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,590
I wanna eat
the delicious wonton in Southsea.

333
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,470
Tell me first.

334
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,400
I get dizzy when I’m hungry.

335
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,430
I can’t recall anything.

336
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,190
Mother said

337
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,430
the wonton in Southsea is the best.

338
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,560
I wanna eat it now.

339
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,110
You...!

340
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,950
You’re so tricky.

341
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:37,760
Wait here.

342
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,740
(Changyuan Hall)

343
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,560
You said I indulged my subordinates.

344
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,640
Any evidence?

345
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,830
Show me.

346
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,280
Is it groundless?

347
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,880
Alright.

348
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,190
We’ve talked for a while.
It’s already noon.

349
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,710
Why don’t we eat something

350
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,070
as we talk?

351
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,280
How is it?

352
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,190
Are you dizzy now?

353
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,680
I think of it.

354
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,680
My mother went out last night.

355
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,310
But I don’t know

356
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,230
where she went.

357
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,000
Last night?

358
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,470
What time was it?

359
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,710
Why didn’t I notice it?

360
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,710
You just sneaked out of Qingchi Palace.

361
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,920
Of course you didn’t.

362
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,000
How did you know I sneaked out?

363
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,000
I happened to see it. A coincidence.

364
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,190
Coincidence?

365
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,800
You should’ve gone to bed.

366
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,880
I went out to pee.

367
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,310
Did she tail me

368
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,470
last night?

369
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,710
Tell me honestly.

370
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,710
She thought you’re fishy,

371
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,160
so she let me keep an eye on you.

372
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,000
I saw that you went out.

373
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,880
So she followed you.

374
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,710
You...!

375
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,640
Are you so obedient to her?

376
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,560
I can’t be ungrateful, can I?

377
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,680
You can’t betray her?

378
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,190
I shouldn’t be so nice to you.

379
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,710
Give it back.

380
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,470
Uncle Tianqi.

381
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,310
These are my dried fruits

382
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,640
and snacks I saved.

383
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,230
Take them.

384
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,400
Uncle Tianqi.

385
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,710
Don’t be angry with me. Okay?

386
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,710
Ouch! Ouch!

387
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,800
Only this time.

388
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,920
Don’t do it again.

389
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,350
You have my word.

390
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,710
These are your favorite.

391
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,920
Have them yourself.

392
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Did you do anything wrong

393
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,160
that you don’t want her to know?

394
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,660
(Endure the Hardship)

395
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,680
Why can’t I sense the Ancestral Sword?

396
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,590
Who are you?

397
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:58,950
Chief Goddess.

398
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,470
Sorry, I didn’t know it’s you.

399
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,710
Please punish me.

400
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,830
Do you know me?

401
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,040
It’s windy here.

402
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,590
Don’t catch a cold.

403
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,430
In terms of your vibe, appearance,

404
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,640
and power,

405
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,190
you’re not half as good as Hongri.

406
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,400
I’m humble,
from the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

407
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,710
I’m not on a par with God Hongri.

408
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,000
You look ingratiating.

409
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,190
You are indeed the type Bai Jue likes.

410
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,400
I’m flattered.

411
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,090
You may rise.

412
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,560
Thank you.

413
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,560
My master is having dinner
with Muguang and Sen Yu.

414
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,000
He doesn’t wanna see me.

415
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,430
I don’t wanna see him either.

416
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,590
Master.

417
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,430
You are noble.

418
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,070
And you are close to my master.

419
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,160
You can come and go as you please.

420
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,560
Right?

421
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,590
That’s pleasant to hear.

422
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,830
I’m flattered, Master.

423
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,350
When the God Realm is reopened,

424
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,800
please do take care of me.

425
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,680
Back then

426
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,350
when you were badly injured
and got unconscious,

427
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,710
I was the person

428
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,560
who escorted you back to Qingchi Palace.

429
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,680
Was I badly injured?

430
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,710
Who injured me?

431
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,510
Well...

432
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,620
Tell me!

433
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,640
I did it only on orders.

434
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,000
I knew nothing.

435
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:14,950
Nothing.

436
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,680
What’s the sound?

437
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,590
It could be the dancers

438
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,310
at my master’s banquet.

439
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,680
He does have the mood.

440
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,560
I’m going to report.

441
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,430
Hold on.

442
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,560
What’s the order, Master?

443
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,470
I’m hungry,

444
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,710
but I don’t wanna contact
with these people.

445
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,000
If you don’t mind,

446
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,000
you may go with my look.

447
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,310
Eat and then just leave.

448
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,800
Good idea.

449
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,350
What’s your name?

450
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,000
Three-head Fire Dragon.

451
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,470
You are clever.

452
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,230
Lead the way.

453
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,400
This way, please.

454
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,470
Greetings, Mother.

455
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,430
Mother.

456
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,400
What’s the hurry to summon me here?

457
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,640
Master Bai Jue

458
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,950
grounds me for one year,

459
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,350
for I brought up Houchi
to Master Shanggu.

460
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,800
I came secretly.

461
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,160
What?

462
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,590
Just because

463
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,000
we offended Shanggu yesterday
at Donghua’s birthday party?

464
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,560
Yes.

465
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,310
Is Father angry with you?

466
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,040
It seems

467
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,400
you no longer have a position
in the Dome.

468
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,520
You cannot gain respect

469
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,280
in the name of Bai Jue.

470
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,280
Not that serious.

471
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Even for the sake

472
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,430
of my father,

473
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,680
- he would...
- I know your father well.

474
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,920
Other than the men,

475
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,190
we must rely on ourselves.

476
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,310
Mother, what do you mean?

477
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,560
I’ll let you be the Master of the Dome.

478
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,920
Mother.

479
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,110
Are you killing a god?

480
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,640
Are you crazy?

481
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,710
Jingzhao.

482
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,480
Jingzhao.

483
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,040
You no longer have affections
to Bai Jue.

484
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,160
Why don’t you gamble on it?

485
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,160
Let me go.

486
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,950
No.

487
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
- Let go! Let go!
- Jingzhao.

488
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,560
I wouldn’t risk our lives

489
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,280
if it’s not guaranteed.

490
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,310
What’s wrong with Master?

491
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,880
He drinks today,

492
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,470
and even watches the dance.

493
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,000
It’s too odd.

494
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,880
Could it be a trap plotted by Master
and Muguang?

495
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,640
A trap.

496
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,590
It must be a trap.

497
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,920
They want me to withdraw troops

498
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,400
by pleasing me.

499
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,950
I’m starving.

500
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,040
Disgusting.

501
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,710
Ignore him.

502
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,950
The braised pork is fat but not greasy.
Good.

503
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,950
Hey. You say it.

504
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,350
Master.

505
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,280
I have something to say.

506
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,640
Cultivation

507
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,400
is all about improving power.

508
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,920
The demons only mean to
improve their cultivation.

509
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,090
Yes.

510
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,680
We went too far.

511
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,350
For the good wine,

512
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,920
I’ll bear with it.

513
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,590
If the immortals can retreat first

514
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,560
and lend your land to us

515
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,070
for cultivation,

516
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,920
we will be good.

517
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,310
Dream on.

518
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,880
Demons and immortals
are of the same origin.

519
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,190
Now

520
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,430
you occupy the land of power,

521
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,000
while we have to cultivate

522
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,400
at the barren land.

523
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,470
It’s unfair.

524
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,830
Good land belongs to the capable.

525
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,520
It’s been a rule

526
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,190
since the ancient time.

527
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,800
If you don’t agree,

528
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,430
try to take it!

529
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,120
You...!

530
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,830
Demon King. Heavenly Emperor.

531
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,070
You must be drunk.

532
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,400
A war comes with casualties.

533
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,800
You may both compromise.

534
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,000
The demons should compromise first.

535
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,160
What are you talking about?

536
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,590
You are a demon!

537
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,000
Take your time.

538
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,470
I’m going to pee.

539
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,760
Wait.

540
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,880
You took 1,000 Sacred Beads
and promised to help me.

541
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,680
Do you deny it?

542
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,400
Like master, like servant.

543
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,680
Demon King.

544
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,830
What are you whispering with him?

545
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,800
Why don’t you tell me?

546
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,310
Okay, I’ll cut to the chase.

547
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:57,950
Master.

548
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,110
He complained to me

549
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,160
how hard the cultivation was

550
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,280
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

551
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,830
Now he said otherwise.

552
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,070
I think

553
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,230
he must’ve been coerced by someone.

554
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,350
Sen Yu.

555
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,160
Don’t forget you’re a junior.

556
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,640
Nor should you forget

557
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,470
where you are.

558
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,590
Isn’t it the Dome?

559
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,680
A corrupted place.

560
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,800
A den of iniquity.

561
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,920
True Gods indulge themselves.

562
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,000
Divine Beasts bribe.

563
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,680
Immortals and demons are
at each other’s throats.

564
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,310
Is it something new

565
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,070
during my 60-thousand-year sleep?

566
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,160
Master.

567
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,400
You may all leave.

568
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

569
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,640
Bai Jue used to be my master.

570
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,560
You like drinking with girls.

571
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,230
As your disciple,
I should serve you.

572
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,640
Come on, Master Bai Jue.

573
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,710
A toast to you.

574
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,590
What?

575
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,590
You drank with dancers.

576
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,230
Wouldn’t you drink with me?

577
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:28,880
The wine...

578
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,710
The wine is for heartless men.

579
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,040
It will kill them.

580
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,830
Are you a heartless man as well?

581
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:38,830
It’s fine.

582
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,110
I can make a cure for you.

583
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,710
It won’t take long,

584
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,350
just 60 thousand years.

585
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,430
Is it fun

586
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,680
to make me a fool?

587
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,680
Do you have no heart?

588
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,070
Was the wound on your chest

589
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,950
made by Yuanqi’s mother?

590
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,470
What do you mean?

591
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,920
If I were her,

592
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,040
I’d stab you too.

593
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,760
You have no heart to Jingzhao,

594
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,160
or to Yuanqi’s mother.

595
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
You’re even so cruel

596
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,520
to your own son.

597
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,230
I laughed at myself.

598
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,590
Back in the Nether World,

599
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,190
I foolishly

600
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,470
wished to be the right person for you.

601
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,000
Drink no more.

602
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,190
I wished to see you when I woke up,

603
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,560
to tell you what I experienced

604
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,680
in the Nether World
60 thousand years ago.

605
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,680
But what about you?

606
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,400
Two marriages.

607
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,710
A son who hates your guts.

608
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,470
You’re unfaithful.

609
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,830
Given what you did,

610
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,800
how should I face you?

611
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,350
What should I face my affections to you?

612
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,350
♪Blocked between my eyebrows♪

613
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,760
My love to you

614
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,520
is built up bit by bit.

615
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,680
Now it’s all deducted by you.

616
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,110
Isn’t it what you expected?

617
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,190
As you wish.

618
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:24,820

630
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,160
Slowly, Master. Mind the steps.

631
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,520
Don’t follow me. I’m not drunk.

632
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,950
I won’t tell anyone

633
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,950
what happened today.

634
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,040
You are smart.

635
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,830
I don’t worry about that.

636
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,830
Did you take 1,000 Sacred Beads
from him?

637
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,950
2,000.

638
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,040
1,000 from Muguang.

639
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,230
1,000 from Sen Yu.

640
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,800
No wonder you asked me to go.

641
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,520
Bai Jue and you are a perfect match.

642
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,680
I’m flattered.

643
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,400
My respect, Master.

644
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,470
Have you forgotten what I said

645
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,760
at the Mount Lookout?

646
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,230
I’m humble.

647
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,310
I shouldn’t show up in front of you.

648
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
But I

649
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,190
have something

650
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,560
that you should know.

651
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,920
Your Grace.

652
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,430
What are you doing?

653
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,920
Do you forget Master Bai Jue’s order?

654
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,760
Master is intelligent.

655
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,560
Even if I don’t say it,

656
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,800
I guess you’ve suspected it.

657
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,000
Am I right?

658
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,350
Master.

659
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,190
Princess Jingzhao
is meeting with Master Shanggu.

660
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,040
Master.

661
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,710
You have the Three Realms,

662
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,760
yet I only have Master Bai Jue.

663
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,470
I beg you to leave him,

664
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
and leave the Dome.

665
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,000
If you agree,

666
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
I’ll tell you everything.

667
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,280
Are you threatening me
with my curiosity?

668
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,350
I dare not.

669
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,400
I just wanna tell you
Qingmu and Houchi’s stories,

670
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,520
and exchange Bai Jue’s past

671
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,140
for a favor from you.

672
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,640
Please fulfill my wish.

673
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,920
Why do I need you

674
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,600
to tell me our affairs?

675
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,470
I shouldn’t have come today.

676
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,190
I’ve never seen you in such a hurry.

677
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,430
What?

678
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,430
Is here something
that I can’t see

679
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,080
or are you afraid that
Jingzhao has told me something?

680
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,150
I’ll tell you

681
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,190
what you want to know.

682
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:36,950
Okay.

683
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,520
Tell me then.

684
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,710
What’s the relationship
between Houchi and me?

685
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,800
Who is Qingmu?

686
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,230
The God Realm was sealed.

687
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,390
You didn’t involve in it.

688
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
I was badly hurt and got in sleep.

689
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,080
My body conceived Qingmu in North Sea.

690
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,560
Are you Qingmu?

691
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,670
Am I Houchi?

692
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,040
Qingmu has vanished.

693
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,000
I don’t accept average vessels.

694
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,560
Houchi was in Qingchi Palace,

695
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,760
and met Qingmu.

696
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,000
They fell in love

697
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,800
and married in the mortal world.

698
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,360
Is Yuanqi our child?

699
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,870
Not ours.

700
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
He’s theirs.

701
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,230
You made yourself innocent.

702
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,800
Qingmu and Houchi
were ordinary immortals.

703
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,630
Now we’ve awakened.

704
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,150
And they no longer exist.

705
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,600
Certainly,

706
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,800
nor do their affections.

707
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,150
Was your wound
made by Yuanqi’s mother?

708
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,600
Well done.

709
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,120
You’re right.

710
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,390
With the stab,

711
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,950
I’m even with that ordinary couple.

712
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,360
Don’t you feel sorry for them?

713
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,040
Yes or no,

714
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,080
it has ended.

715
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,190
It doesn’t matter.

716
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,430
Why did you keep it from me?

717
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,520
I didn’t mean to.

718
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,560
It doesn’t matter anymore.

719
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,040
I don’t wanna bring it up.

720
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,080
Doesn’t it matter?

721
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,360
You don’t wanna bring it up?

722
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,080
Did Tianqi tell you this?

723
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,320
Over the 60 thousand years,
Gu Jun sees Houchi as his daughter.

724
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,040
He cared about her a lot,

725
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,560
and even died for her.

726
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,870
Tianqi told me

727
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,320
Gu Jun was in the God Realm.

728
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,230
Why did he lie to me?

729
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,710
What do you think?

730
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,230
He thought it didn’t matter.

731
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,910
There’s no need to bring it up.

732
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,120
You’ve awakened.

733
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,280
You should cultivate hard
and restore the past.

734
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,190
The past relationship

735
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,870
doesn’t matter anymore.

736
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,670
Now

737
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,910
I no longer need any reason.

738
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
You’ve changed.

739
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,360
You were

740
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,560
cold,

741
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,840
but you were kindhearted.

742
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,670
Your theories about
justice and righteousness

743
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,800
didn’t feel like empty talk.

744
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,360
Now

745
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,670
you are heartless

746
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,600
and ruthless.

747
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,150
Do you really care about the beings?

748
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,800
I’m always responsible
for all the beings.

749
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,190
It never changes.

750
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,670
You ignore the past.

751
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,000
But Yuanqi is still a kid.

752
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,670
He’s left in the Qingchi Palace,

753
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,430
and knows he’s abandoned

754
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,870
by his father.

755
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,670
How should he face it in the future?

756
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,560
Haven’t I made it clear?

757
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,910
I despise the love
between Qingmu and Houchi.

758
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,320
Their love

759
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,670
was a mistake to me.

760
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,560
And Yuanqi is the consequence.

761
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,120
Seeing him,

762
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,870
I’d think of

763
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,320
those unbearable memories.

764
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,470
You’re the True God,

765
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,470
the Master of all beings.

766
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,190
I’m going to tell Yuanqi

767
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,120
his birth father is
North Sea Lord Qingmu.

768
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,000
You

769
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,470
are not.

770
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,080
You and I

771

after you went to the Nether World.

Yes, I read
the Classic of Mountains and Seas.
