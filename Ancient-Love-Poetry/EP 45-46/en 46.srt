2
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 46=

3
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,550
Bai Jue, you call yourself True God?

4
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,630
Lord of the World?

5
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,440
I’ll tell Yuanqi

6
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,350
his biological father
is North Sea Lord, Qingmu.

7
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,950
You don’t

8
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,520
deserve him.

9
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,350
I won’t see you

10
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,630
or think about you

11
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,840
ever again.

12
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,480
Tell me everything.

13
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,710
That day,

14
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,870
I did go to the Dome

15
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,120
with the Ancestral Sword to see Bai Jue.

16
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,070
In my defense, I was only there
to reopen the God Realm.

17
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
There was no conspiracy whatsoever.

18
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Have you got any proof?

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,870
As unreliable as I seem,

20
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,480
I wouldn’t sink so low to work with him.

21
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,430
That’s more like it.

22
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,200
What else?

23
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,790
What do you mean?

24
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,280
What else are you keeping from me?

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,510
Nothing.

26
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,870
Really?

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,950
Yes!

28
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,510
Yuanqi,

29
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,430
what do I always say to you?

30
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,400
Being honesty is the fundamental law.

31
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,200
Where’s Gu Jun?

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
He...

33
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,040
He’s supporting the God Realm.

34
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,950
Tianqi,

35
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,120
why are you still lying?

36
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,920
Do you also think
an immortal’s life is nothing?

37
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,070
No, Shanggu...

38
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,790
I...

39
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,790
I start to think

40
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Yuemi and Zhiyang

41
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,790
aren’t in the God Realm as you said.

42
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,150
That’s another lie, isn’t it?

43
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,760
Aunt, don’t cry.

44
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,510
You’re making me cry, too.

45
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
Uncle Tianqi knows he’s wrong.

46
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,510
Yuanqi,

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,590
tell me

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,670
who named you.

49
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,950
At first, I was called “Qi”,

50
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,590
meaning abandon.

51
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,790
Mother left me.

52
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,670
Father abandoned me,

53
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,120
hence that name.

54
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,430
Yuanqi,

55
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
listen,

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,840
all parents in the world
love their children.

57
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
I’m sure yours loved you dearly.

58
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,120
You’re more important than everything,

59
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,000
including their own lives.

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,800
If he asks you about his parents,

61
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,150
just tell him

62
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,150
his father is North Sea Lord, Qingmu.

63
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,960
He was a hero

64
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,550
who always fought for
the weak against the strong.

65
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,590
He was dedicated
to his love and justice.

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,680
Your mother

67
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,640
led a wonderful life.

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,640
She had close friends...

69
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,920
She has a caring Father and a loving husband.

70
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,680
She was carefree throughout her life.

71
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,870
She had a caring Father
and a loving husband.

72
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,310
She was carefree throughout her life.

73
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,390
Shanggu,

74
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,460
does that remind you of something?

75
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,700
Are you afraid it does?

76
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,680
Uncle Tianqi told me

77
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,710
my Father is Qingmu and Bai Jue.

78
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,710
They’re the same person.

79
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,430
Bai Jue brought you up yesterday.

80
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,480
What... what did he say?

81
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,110
He said

82
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,760
it’s not that he didn’t want you

83
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,200
or love you.

84
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,480
But he can’t forgive himself

85
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,590
because of guilt.

86
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,990
He told me

87
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,960
he isn’t good enough for you.

88
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,870
I’ve never looked down on him.

89
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,270
You’re his flesh and blood, Yuanqi.

90
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,390
One day,

91
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,110
he’ll get over the past

92
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,990
and let it go.

93
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,080
Then he’ll come to you.

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,550
Will he?

95
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,710
When have I ever lied to you?

96
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,550
Uncle Tianqi.

97
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,680
Yuanqi,

98
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,310
this whole thing is too complicated.

99
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,640
I was going to tell you

100
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,430
once you’re old enough to understand.

101
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,640
Yuanqi,

102
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,800
when your mother Houchi
gave birth to you,

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,110
my Spiritual Strength was inside her.

104
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,110
Yuanqi,

105
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,390
from now on,

106
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,710
I’ll be your mother, alright?

107
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,760
Mother.

108
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,310
Mother!

109
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,310
Mother!

110
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,960
Mother!

111
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,270
Mother!

112
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,200
Mother!

113
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,990
Mother!

114
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,080
Mother!

115
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,760
Mother!

116
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,360
Congratulations, Your Highness!

117
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,270
You’ve gained devil power!

118
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,870
After the Tribulation,

119
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,240
you’ll become the Overlord.

120
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,200
This day has finally come.

121
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,640
We’ve been living in constant fear

122
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,150
year after year.

123
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,240
Now, all that will come to an end.

124
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,520
60,000 years ago,

125
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,590
in the God-Demon battle,

126
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,270
Xuanyi was outnumbered

127
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,430
and crushed by Gods.

128
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,040
This time,

129
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,520
I’ll take the three True Gods
down one by one.

130
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,240
All Three Realms will be in my pocket.

131
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,390
The world

132
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,390
will be under my feet!

133
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,190
What?

134
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,750
The Nether World is unstable.

135
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,440
Your Majesty, have you wondered

136
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,070
why that devil became powerful enough

137
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,270
to be the new Devil God

138
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,240
after hiding for 100 years?

139
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,950
Lord,

140
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,560
what are you implying?

141
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,480
According to those

142
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,560
ancient books and records I read,

143
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,040
one whose power reaches God’s level

144
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,880
can conceal the Devilish Energy.

145
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,920
I killed Yuemi.

146
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,190
What did you say?

147
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,070
I’ve lied to you for 60,000 years.

148
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,000
So all these years,

149
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,710
you’ve never changed.

150
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,680
Murder,

151
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,680
jealousy,

152
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,590
fear,

153
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,360
greed,

154
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,360
all those sins

155
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,240
have demonized you long ago.

156
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
That battle 100 years ago

157
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,440
killed and injured

158
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,710
tons of Demons.

159
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:31,920
Thanks to your company

160
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,830
these years,

161
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,270
we can recuperate.

162
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,950
I wouldn’t take credit for it.

163
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,190
All that owes to Master Bai Jue.

164
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,320
Your Majesty, you’ve been through a lot.

165
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,270
Your Majesty...

166
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,680
Qin,

167
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,510
I did tons of stupid things

168
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,270
that hurt and disappointed you so much.

169
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,480
Since Father left,

170
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,270
all I have is you.

171
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,360
Without you,

172
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,830
I wouldn’t have come this far.

173
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,590
Qin,

174
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,390
once we return to Xuanjing Palace,

175
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,070
I’ll ask the Fox Clan to marry you.

176
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,630
You’ll be my empress.

177
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,590
Hold on.

178
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,240
Don’t turn me down so soon.

179
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,630
I’ve meant to do that for so long.

180
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,710
Please give me a chance.

181
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,560
I’ll show you

182
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,190
the old Sen Yu is gone.

183
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,390
The man you see today

184
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,000
will only belong to you
forever and ever.

185
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,480
What do you think?

186
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,360
Could you

187
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,120
give me some time?

188
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,000
Sure.

189
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,800
I’ll wait.

190
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,390
Report!

191
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,800
Prince Jingjian from
the Heavenly Palace is outside.

192
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,560
I knew that old fart

193
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,390
would ask him to be the messenger.

194
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,270
Greetings, Prince Jingjian, Fengran.

195
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,150
Prince Jingjian,

196
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,880
don’t give me your Father’s crap,

197
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,710
or our newly restored peace

198
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,360
would be gone.

199
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,950
You should’ve seen him in the Dome.

200
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,040
He was such a hypocrite!

201
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,360
Let’s not point fingers first.

202
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,270
You should keep the promise

203
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,800
you made to Master Bai Jue

204
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,510
and withdraw your troops immediately.

205
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,950
The longer the confrontation,

206
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,950
the bigger the risk.

207
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,590
That’s a flagrant violation
of our peace agreement.

208
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,750
Sen Yu is still upset about
what happened in the Dome.

209
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,070
Please don’t mind him.

210
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,360
I know him well.

211
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,240
Immortals way crossed the line!

212
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,750
I couldn’t just suck it up.

213
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,560
I sincerely apologize to you

214
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,920
on behalf of them and my father.

215
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,880
Save it.

216
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,190
I hate that kind of routine.

217
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,320
I know

218
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,360
we’re sort of to blame

219
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,040
by disturbing the Human Realm.

220
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,040
Still, you...

221
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,590
Well...

222
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,800
Well... this tastes good.

223
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,880
Have a bite.

224
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,070
Sen Yu knows it’s your favorite.

225
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,070
He picked them himself
in the third heaven

226
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,590
and he was going to bring them to you.

227
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,830
That’s too kind of you, Sen Yu.

228
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,120
It’s nothing.

229
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,560
You saved my life.

230
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,390
Jingjian,

231
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,830
may I speak to you in private?

232
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,590
Please.

233
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,750
Come here.

234
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,590
Have a seat.

235
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,510
Jingjian,

236
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,880
I’d like to

237
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,680
ask you something.

238
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,630
Go ahead.

239
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,320
Rumor has it

240
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,680
that Fengran and your mother
are mortal enemies.

241
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,750
Is that true?

242
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,480
It is.

243
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,590
Then how come you two

244
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,270
are still so sweet

245
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,360
and close as a whole all these years?

246
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,590
My mother is unforgivable,

247
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,390
but Fengran is lenient enough

248
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,800
to ignore her.

249
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,750
It does sound like

250
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,510
you choose your wife over your mother.

251
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,320
You don’t know what happened

252
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,040
and I can’t tell you that.

253
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,150
How about this?

254
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,190
Let me ask you a few questions.

255
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,440
Fire away.

256
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,800
Can anyone decide their births

257
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,000
or parents?

258
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,150
Of course not.

259
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,590
Can anyone hide their feelings

260
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,070
to not be hurt by love?

261
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,480
No.

262
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
If you were me,

263
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,120
could you find a way

264
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,750
to bury the hatchet
between my love and my mother?

265
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,150
No.

266
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,630
Since there’s nothing you can do,

267
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,240
why not let it go?

268
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,830
I used to

269
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,560
think too much.

270
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,950
Fengran is much better
than me in that regard.

271
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,880
She abhors evil.

272
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,950
She knows what to love and hate.

273
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,750
She taught me not to
run away from difficulties.

274
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,560
I’m more than content

275
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,270
to have her in my life!

276
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,750
I was eager to kill Wu Huan,

277
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,950
but I chose not to

278
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,040
for Jingjian’s sake.

279
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,880
Chief Goddess Shanggu is back.

280
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,920
She never tolerates anything evil.

281
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,270
I’m sure she’ll bring justice
to my parents

282
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,190
and restore peace in all Three Realms.

283
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,920
I’m happy for you.

284
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,070
About what?

285
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,710
That you’ve finally
found the love of your life.

286
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,800
How are you and Sen Yu?

287
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,630
He proposed to me just now.

288
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,560
I didn’t say yes.

289
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,240
You made the right choice.

290
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,120
Let him wait for another
eight or nine hundred years.

291
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,920
Fengran,

292
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,960
something bad is happening. Let’s go.

293
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,600
I’ve checked.

294
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,230
They all died of energy loss.

295
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,200
They look the same as those

296
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,600
killed by Devilish Energy
in the Parasol Forest.

297
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,150
Did that killer kill them too?

298
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,080
Did anyone see how they died?

299
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,990
No.

300
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,440
This place is only one kilometer
from your camp.

301
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,080
That’s right.

302
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,200
So?

303
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,150
How come our soldiers died here?

304
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,080
Jingjian,

305
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,920
Demons are aboveboard.

306
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,270
We’d admit to our murder.

307
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,870
I understand
your father doesn’t trust us,

308
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,470
but you too?

309
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,870
Then they could only
be killed by immortals.

310
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
You think she did it?

311
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Soldiers died
right before the withdrawal.

312
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,440
The killer must’ve done that

313
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,150
to incite another war
in the Demon Region.

314
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,600
I’ll go back to report to Father.

315
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,320
Jingjian,

316
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,200
don’t you think

317
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,230
there’s another possibility?

318
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,080
Please enlighten me, Father.

319
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,350
The one who killed the three soldiers

320
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,680
isn’t an Immortal

321
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,870
or a Demon,

322
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,990
but a Devil.

323
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,470
Earlier today,

324
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,040
reports came in from
the three lower realms

325
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,390
that Devilish Energy
had wreaked havoc everywhere.

326
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,870
I’m afraid a new Devil God
has appeared in the Nether World.

327
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,870
Devil God?

328
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,230
Is he behind the massacre
of the Feng Clan 100 years ago?

329
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,800
I believe so

330
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,720
even without any proof.

331
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,800
Who is it?

332
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,720
What are you talking about?

333
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,920
You didn’t even notice I came in.

334
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,800
What brings you here?

335
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,720
I’ve prepared food at Fuyao Hall.

336
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,080
Jingzhao and Jingyang are already there.

337
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,350
It’s a family dinner.

338
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,990
It’s been a while

339
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,800
since we sat together

340
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,390
and talked to each other.

341
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,110
I made this soup for you.

342
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,230
Jingyang,

343
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,390
when you were little,

344
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,270
you always took food from your siblings.

345
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,080
A big bowl of fish soup wasn’t enough.

346
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,040
I was naughty.

347
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,720
I always thought others’ food

348
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,600
tasted better.

349
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,230
Come to think of it,

350
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,840
I haven’t cooked for 60,000 years.

351
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,630
Does the fish soup still taste the same?

352
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,630
Father,

353
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,390
the Demon Region needs me.

354
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,110
Please excuse me.

355
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,600
Good day.

356
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,720
Jingjian,

357
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
we’re having a family dinner.

358
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,150
It won’t take long.

359
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,390
Must you leave now?

360
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,840
I can’t remember the last time

361
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,040
we had dinner together.

362
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,560
Whatever business you have,

363
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,870
finish the soup first.

364
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,390
I’m not hungry.

365
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,870
Jingjian!

366
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,040
Are you turning your back on us

367
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,840
for that woman?

368
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,510
Just enjoy the food

369
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,470
without me.

370
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,390
Jingjian!

371
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,720
I’m sick of his attitude!

372
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,510
Forget about him.

373
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,040
Let him go.

374
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,630
Are you done with your soup?

375
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,110
Three more soldiers were killed
in the Demon Region.

376
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,320
The cause of death is unknown.

377
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
I have a reason to believe that

378
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,390
someone killed them
for ulterior motives.

379
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,720
Jingyang,

380
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,200
why do you think

381
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,960
anyone would kill them?

382
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,230
I guess

383
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,110
maybe...

384
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,870
maybe Demons killed them to...

385
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,630
Demons again.

386
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,350
What’s your problem with them?

387
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,750
Or are you covering for someone?

388
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,110
Jingzhao,

389
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,870
the Nether World
has shown strange signs.

390
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,630
Nowhere can see them
more clearly than the Dome.

391
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,270
Why didn’t you tell me?

392
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,350
Father,

393
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,110
I didn’t notice anything.

394
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,350
Being with Master for the past 100 years

395
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,870
has taught you nothing

396
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,870
but only made you overbearing.

397
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,720
Wu Huan,

398
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,960
taking only three lives is so not you.

399
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,720
You have to do more

400
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,390
to play Immortals and Demons off
against each other.

401
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,870
What are you talking about?

402
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,630
When did I kill them?

403
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,040
Other than those three soldiers,

404
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,110
Fengran’s parents,

405
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,960
Bi Xi, who guarded
the Ghost Suppressing Tower,

406
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,630
Elder Danfeng

407
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,320
and my master Yuemi
all died in your hands.

408
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:03,270
I cannot cover for you again,

409
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,750
or I’d fail as the Heavenly Emperor

410
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,230
and a father.

411
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,150
You’re right.

412
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,870
I killed them all.

413
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
It’s really you.

414
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,630
I can’t find
any Devilish Energy on you,

415
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,600
but we can go to Master Shanggu.

416
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,110
Let her check

417
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,150
if you’ve really become a devil.

418
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,110
Even if she comes,

419
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,560
I’m not afraid of her,

420
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,270
let alone you.

421
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,920
It was you

422
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,920
who dumped me

423
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,320
into the Nether World.

424
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,800
I was so desperate to survive

425
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,390
that Devilish Energy
got the better of me.

426
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,870
It’s all your fault!

427
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,150
Mother!

428
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,150
Jingyang,

429
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,270
you’re always on my side.

430
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,320
Move!

431
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,800
I can do anything for you,

432
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,630
but now, you...

433
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,720
I’m doing this for our family.

434
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,510
Your Father is tired.

435
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,600
Let him rest.

436
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,230
Jingyang!

437
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,840
Jingyang!

438
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,680
You’re a Goddess.

439
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,440
True Gods entrusted you

440
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,720
with the safety of the Three Realms!

441
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,440
So what if they’re True Gods?

442
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,110
Devil God was one of them.

443
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,750
When creating the universe,
Qingtian said

444
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,720
all six worlds are a whole.

445
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,680
Gods and Devils are equal.

446
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,110
But there are good and bad ones.

447
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,350
Without Devils,

448
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,110
the four True Gods
wouldn’t have perished.

449
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,230
The God Realm wouldn’t have collapsed.

450
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,040
Devils are our mortal enemies!

451
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,920
You’re stupid!

452
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,750
Muguang,

453
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,390
aren’t the Three Realms thriving

454
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,920
under our leadership?

455
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,080
We’ve established
total supremacy for 60,000 years.

456
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,750
Once the God Realm reopens

457
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,680
and Shanggu returns to power,

458
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,870
we’ll go back to the pathetic old days

459
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,960
and grovel to others.

460
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,200
But without the God Realm

461
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,230
and True Gods,

462
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,350
we’ll dominate the Three Realms forever!

463
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,510
Why did you

464
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,270
become like this?

465
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,630
I shall be the head

466
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,960
of this household.

467
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,150
Father! Father!

468
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,960
One day, you’ll understand

469
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,270
that I made the right choice.

470
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,510
In the Three Realms,

471
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,270
only the winner gets to make rules.

472
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,350
Being a devil or not

473
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,630
isn’t important.

474
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,720
I’m powerful enough

475
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,990
to battle any True God.

476
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,750
Jingzhao,

477
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,080
nothing can hold you back.

478
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,990
Once Bai Jue is gone,

479
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,320
victory can be expected.

480
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,440
It’s cold outside.

481
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,920
Why weren’t you resting inside?

482
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,350
I couldn’t sleep.

483
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,870
We were so close to
withdrawing the troops,

484
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,720
but Immortals accused Demons

485
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,350
of killing their soldiers.

486
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,200
The tension is on again.

487
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
They’ve been against each other
for thousands of years.

488
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,200
The long-running feud

489
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,560
isn’t that easy to be resolved.

490
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,870
Prince Jingjian.

491
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,960
We were going to retreat,

492
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,840
but Immortals were hostile

493
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,470
and wouldn’t do the same.

494
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,800
What do you suggest?

495
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,560
I’ve reported the deaths

496
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,350
of the three soldiers to Father.

497
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,800
Please give me some more time.

498
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,870
It’s difficult to remove overnight
all the grievances

499
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,040
accumulated over the years.

500
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,600
I understand.

501
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
But let me be clear.

502
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:07,870
If the war is on,

503
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,920
we’ll battle it out with you.

504
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,680
Calm down.

505
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,200
We must find the cause of their deaths

506
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,920
for the crisis to subside.

507
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,200
Sen Yu, trust me.

508
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,960
I’ll do my utmost

509
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,320
to stop another war.

510
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,920
After all,

511
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,750
the last thing we want to see
is more deaths.

512
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,270
Fine.

513
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,350
If you won’t strike,

514
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,920
neither will I.

515
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,720
Look.

516
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,080
The drum has been beaten so many times

517
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,800
that it’s cracking.

518
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,390
It contains spiritual power.

519
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,870
Self-healing can take

520
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,600
thousands of years.

521
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,920
I wish it was intact.

522
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,510
Don’t worry.

523
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,870
Just wait for it.

524
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,840
It’ll be as good as new.

525
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,230
Yuemi,

526
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,440
I’ve told Shanggu you’re
in the God Realm so many times,

527
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,150
that I almost
start to believe that myself.

528
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,510
Back then, I ignored your feelings.

529
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,230
So many years have passed.

530
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,560
I’m still alone.

531
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,720
That’s probably karma.

532
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,840
Now, Shanggu regards Yuanqi as her son

533
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,720
as I expected.

534
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,680
Bai Jue becomes a complete villain.

535
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Things play out

536
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,150
as we imagined.

537
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,080
The problem is

538
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,800
Shanggu will regain
her memory sooner or later.

539
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,560
I wonder how she will feel

540
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,720
about Bai Jue’s plan
over the past 60,000 years.

541
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,840
I won’t judge them.

542
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,560
Let’s drink.

543
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
It’s too late to regret.

544
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,920
Why would you rather
be with her in the first place?

545
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,920
Yuemi,

546
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,470
is it really you?

547
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,630
Look at the night sky.

548
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,510
It’s starry.

549
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,470
Tianqi, I’m back.

550
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,460
♪How much luck do I need♪

551
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,990
You’re really back!

552
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,320
Yuemi!

553
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:35,840
Yuemi!

554
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,990
It’s my fault.

555
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,040
You died because of me.

556
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,510
Tianqi,

557
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,630
don’t blame yourself.

558
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,920
It was heaven
that played a cruel joke on us.

559
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,960
But don’t worry.

560
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,080
From now on,

561
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,560
I won’t leave you ever again.

562
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,320
You...

563
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,040
You aren’t Yuemi!

564
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,150
I should’ve killed you long ago.

565
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,270
He just died like this?

566
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,040
Tianqi is the God of Water.

567
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,470
His death

568
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,720
will change the sky.

569
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,990
My devil power is invincible.

570
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,440
The Three Realms

571
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,080
shall prepare for a new ruler!

572
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:11,870
Master.

573
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,800
Tianqi still hasn’t come back?

574
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,560
Yes.

575
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,870
I’m getting worried.

576
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,270
Don’t be.

577
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,040
If you find the wind
and the rain too strong,

578
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,750
I’ll activate the barrier

579
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,110
to block them.

580
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,960
It’s still early in autumn.

581
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,150
How come it’s freezing?

582
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,040
Greetings, Master.

583
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,600
What can I do for you?

584
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,150
Devil God has appeared,

585
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,600
damaging the Three Realms
with the Devilish Power.

586
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,350
You must’ve heard that

587
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,110
in the Heavenly Palace.

588
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,080
Father is also concerned about it.

589
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,840
He said he’d come to consult you.

590
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
I found

591
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,720
that Devil God is as powerful as Xuanyi.

592
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,870
Immortals must work together
to get rid of that devil.

593
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,110
None of us

594
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,870
can beat the Devil God alone.

595
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,350
Tomorrow,

596
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,510
I’ll invest the power of the Dome

597
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,560
in the battle.

598
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,750
Just leave now.

599
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,270
You can no longer stay here.

600
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,040
Master,

601
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,470
I understand I’m insignificant.

602
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,750
But over the years,

603
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,630
I’ve been serving you
with my heart and soul.

604
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,350
I need to ask you something

605
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,150
before leaving.

606
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,270
Have you ever had any feelings for me?

607
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,840
Jingzhao,

608
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,720
you’re still young.

609
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,990
It’s not wrong to be vain,

610
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,150
but greed can bury you.

611
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,200
You’d better let go of your obsession

612
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,680
and find a new way
to cultivate yourself.

613
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,270
Honestly,

614
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,870
if there’s any regret in my life,

615
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,470
that is, we didn’t have

616
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,680
the cross-cupped wine
on our wedding day.

617
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,440
I might not be able to
see you again.

618
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,800
We’ve been together for 100 years

619
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,390
as if we’re a couple.

620
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,110
All I’m asking for

621
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,470
is to drink with you before departure.

622
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,670
That’ll be our farewell drink.

623
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,880
Please.

624
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,040
What’s in the drink?

625
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,990
How dare you poison me!

626
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,880
Your drink was poisoned

627
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,470
by the seed of Decide Flower

628
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,430
and my Mother’s devil power.

629
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,320
You’ll be gone

630
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,510
in a few minutes.

631
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,600
How come the snow is so heavy?

632
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,840
What is happening?

633
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,670
The frozen earth

634
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,640
indicates that fire is dying out.

635
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,270
That’s Bai Jue’s power.

636
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,710
Is he in danger?

637
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,670
Heavenly Emperor’s edict is as follows:

638
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,600
True God Bai Jue died of
unbalanced energy.

639
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,270
Princess Jingzhao

640
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,910
will take over the Dome hence.

641
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,160
Master,

642
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,910
are you happy

643
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,360
with that announcement?

644
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,990
Who do you think you are?

645
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,080
I’m no longer a humble maid.

646
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,430
Who do you think you are?

647
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,750
Just so you know,

648
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,750
Tianqi already died before you.

649
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,430
After you,

650
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,750
Shanggu will be my next target.

651
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,640
From this moment on,

652
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,360
I’ll be the supreme lord
of all Three Realms!

653
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,640
Master.

654
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,360
Look!

655
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,640
That’s from the Dome.

656
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,160
How come the Devilish Energy
is so strong?

657
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:30,990
Chang Que,

658
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,670
stay and watch
the Qingchi Palace and Yuanqi.

659
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,190
Close the gate.

660
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,360
No one shall get in or out.

661
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,270
Yes.

662
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,990
I’m announcing to the world
that we’re mourning for

663
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,800
(Changyuan Hall)
True God Bai Jue for three years.

664
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,120
Yes, Your Highness.

665
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,600
Are you blind?

666
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,080
That woman is a devil!

667
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,120
Rebels,

668
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,400
gossipers

669
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,840
and blasphemer

670
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,910
shall all be executed!

671
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,470
Look!

672
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,470
How did Devils get
the Demon Gathering Streamer?

673
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,880
We aren’t able to stop her.

674
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,600
If we don’t get the Streamer back,

675
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,120
they won’t stop moving

676
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,510
until death.

677
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,950
That’ll cause catastrophic damage

678
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,400
to both Demons and Immortals.

679
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,320
