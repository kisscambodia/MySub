=Episode 47=

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,630
Look.

4
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,550
Why do the devils
have the Demon Gathering Streamer?

5
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,590
Even the Demon Gathering Streamer
was taken away.

6
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,040
I’m too ashamed to live.

7
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,720
Sen Yu!

8
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,270
You’re the Demon King.

9
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,360
At this moment, you must be determined.

10
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,640
Under such circumstances,

11
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,600
we can’t stop the war,

12
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
unless we do the dismemberment.

13
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,470
Master, after sixty thousand years,

14
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,360
I never expected you
to be still so powerful.

15
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,110
You’re the Heavenly Empress
and a goddess.

16
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,080
But you became a devil?

17
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,800
Wu Huan, you really let me down.

18
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,800
You should’ve been dead in the Tribulation
sixty thousand years ago.

19
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,440
You let me down, too.

20
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,080
Sixty thousand years ago?

21
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,030
Dead in the Tribulation?

22
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,000
Wu Huan,

23
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,030
you deliberately started the war
in the Demon Region?

24
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,280
It’s wise of you.

25
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,950
But however wise you are,

26
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,470
you never expected

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,310
to be killed by me,

28
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,910
your humblest maid
in the Pilgrimage Hall.

29
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,640
Taicang Spear?

30
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,830
What did you do to Bai Jue?

31
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,190
In such a cruel world,

32
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,440
how will I let Bai Jue live?

33
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,950
Devilish Energy?

34
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,720
Your Highness,

35
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,390
Overlord asked you to leave

36
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,670
and keep yourself safe.

37
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,000
Fengnyu?

38
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,920
Mother?

39
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,600
Why does Fengnyu
have so much devil power?

40
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,110
My mother must have given it to her.

41
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,070
My mother

42
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,110
is the new Overlord in the Nether World.

43
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,160
Fengran,

44
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,510
guard the formation for me.

45
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,550
I don’t care what reason you had

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,350
or why you became a devil,

47
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,510
for public and private purposes,

48
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,070
I can’t let you live.

49
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,350
You don’t have to say this

50
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,630
before you defeat me.

51
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,390
Give up.

52
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,320
Then you don’t need to be tortured.

53
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,230
Your power

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,110
is far less than mine.

55
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,230
There’s justice in the world.

56
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,440
Evil can never prevail over good.

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,160
Why can you represent justice?

58
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,390
Why can you represent the good?

59
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,600
Why can’t low phoenixes

60
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,280
control their own lives?

61
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,880
Why can’t I be the lord of the world?

62
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,070
I’m not convinced!

63
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,350
Bai Jue?

64
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,550
From this day on,

65
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,070
I’m the lord of the Three Realms!

66
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
You’re still alive?

67
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,720
You can’t be!

68
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,550
I killed you in person.

69
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,480
There’s no way you’re still alive!

70
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,160
Tianqi?

71
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,110
You...

72
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,280
I can not only hold my liquor,

73
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,600
but have also improved in acting.

74
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,670
Didn’t I just pretend to be dead?

75
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,480
Now that you prepared the wine
to fake my death,

76
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,830
why didn’t you prepare

77
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,280
a set of armor for me?

78
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Wu Huan is cunning.

79
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,320
If she suspected you,

80
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,790
you would have been dead.

81
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,480
Ice Cube,

82
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,230
since you woke up,

83
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,480
you’ve been doing annoying things.

84
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,350
It hurts!

85
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,200
Now Wu Huan has been unmasked.

86
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,720
After dealing with her,

87
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,790
I can leave without concern.

88
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,880
The formation can only last for a while.

89
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,790
Unless the Demon Gathering Streamer falls,

90
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,600
they’ll break into the Demon Region
sooner or later.

91
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,000
What will you do?

92
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,950
I’ll protect immortals.

93
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,320
I’ll protect you, too.

94
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,440
How dare you!

95
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,440
Fengran,

96
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,000
don’t blame me.

97
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:15,920
Jingjian!

98
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,160
Jingjian!

99
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,440
Don’t!

100
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,550
Don’t!

101
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,480
My mother started this.

102
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,720
I should pay for it.

103
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
If you dare,

104
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,480
I’ll kill Wu Huan in person
to avenge my parents!

105
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,430
I will totally forget you

106
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
and never think of you again!

107
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,040
Fengran,

108
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I’ll leave the Immortal Realm

109
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,120
to you.

110
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,870

what is good?

What is evil?

155

And what is justice?

156
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,030
I don’t need to explain, do I?

157
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,520
I lost, so what?

158
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,030
If I guess correctly,

159
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,670
you came back to life,

160
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,760
because of the Tribulation.

161
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,000
Bai Jue,

162
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,790
you had a careful plan.

163
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,440
You really think this will bring

164
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,230
the least harm to her?

165
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,760
Shut up!

166
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,710
After she knows the truth,

167
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,320
what you have done

168
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,030
will haunt her like Devilish Energy

169
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,590
and torture her.

170
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,080
Then she’ll regret all her life.

171
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,840
When someone is heartbroken,

172
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,280
the longer she lives,
the more she suffers.

173
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,320
What’s she talking about?

174
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,710
Flame of Queen of Phoenix?

175
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,550
Fengran is in trouble.

176
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,000
I beg you, Master.

177
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,150
Save him, please.

178
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,000
He used the dismemberment.

179
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,590
Since ancient times,

180
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,470
if immortals or demons use it,

181
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,710
they will lose their souls

182
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,400
and can’t have the reincarnation.

183
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,520
Even I...

184
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,670
I can’t help.

185
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,150
In the Three Realms,

186
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,000
I can’t find him anymore.

187
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,880
Jingjian.

188
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,520
Jingjian!

189
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,440
Jingjian!

190
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,880
It’s you!

191
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,350
You killed him!

192
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,350
You hate me for taking away your throne.

193
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,000
So, you killed my son!

194
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,200
Jingjian.

195
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,200
Wu Huan,

196
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,960
no one killed Jingjian,

197
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,840
but you.

198
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,190
Master.

199
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,190
Master,

200
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,680
I beg you!

201
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,680
I beg you to save him!

202
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,800
You used to care for me most,
didn’t you?

203
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,800
I will take any punishment.

204
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,880
I beg you.

205
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,110
Please save my son!

206
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,400
Save him!

207
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,070
Jingjian.

208
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,310
Even Shanggu

209
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,430
can’t bring a man back to life
when his soul is gone.

210
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,430
It’s been sixty thousand years.

211
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,430
Time to reveal the truth
to the Three Realms.

212
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,950
All immortals are here

213
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,040
and the Heavenly Emperor has come.

214
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,710
What’s your point?

215
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,680
Wu Huan,

216
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,880
tell me.

217
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,640
During the Destruction Formation
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp,

218
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,520
how did Yuemi die?

219
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,950
Yuemi...

220
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,430
She is dead?

221
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,470
Isn’t she sleeping in the God Realm?

222
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,710
Right.

223
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,800
I killed Yuemi.

224
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,190
Everybody says that

225
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,520
True Gods are incomparably wise
and powerful.

226
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,230
But over the past sixty thousand years,

227
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,430
I still managed to deceive you,

228
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,430
made Tianqi an enemy of the Three Realms

229
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,710
and let you four fight each other.

230
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,230
Your Grace,

231
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,070
you’re finally awake.

232
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,950
Who are you?

233
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,760
I’m Wu Huan,

234
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,950
from the Feng Clan.

235
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,160
Wu Huan,

236
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,430
for the coming thousand years,

237
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,920
do you want to be my Divine Beast

238
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,040
and go back to the God Realm with me?

239
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,430
I...

240
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,310
I do.

241
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,070
Wu Huan,

242
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,190
you’re my Divine Beast now.

243
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,280
Now that you’re in my hall,

244
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,520
you’re one of us.

245
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,000
Don’t bother how you were bullied
in the Feng Clan.

246
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,800
Cultivate yourself carefully

247
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,680
and impress those bad men.

248
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,640
Isn’t it great?

249
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,350
Yes, Your Grace.

250
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,560
You little phoenix,

251
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,880
shortly after you came,

252
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,920
you’re getting bold

253
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,950
and you dare to mock me.

254
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,800
I don’t dare.

255
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,590
By then, our Pilgrimage Hall

256
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,950
will be the strongest
in the God Realm for real.

257
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,590
Your Grace,

258
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,830
cultivate yourself carefully.

259
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,800
I’ll take care of the Pilgrimage Hall

260
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,880
so that you and Gu Jun
won’t be distracted.

261
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,160
I brought you back
to the Pilgrimage Hall.

262
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,520
When I was in the Nether World,

263
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,430
Yuemi taught you carefully
for a thousand years.

264
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,160
How did you have the heart to kill her?

265
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,560
Right.

266
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,400
You took me back
to the Pilgrimage Hall, so what?

267
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,560
In your eyes,

268
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,680
I was always a substitute for Feng Yan.

269
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,470
In Yuemi’s eyes,

270
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,430
I was always imperfect!

271
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,110
She even advised you to wait
for the return of the Queen of Phoenix.

272
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,400
Forget it.

273
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,800
What’s done is done.

274
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,000
I didn’t let it go at that time.

275
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,590
After sixty thousand years,

276
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,430
I no longer care.

277
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,680
The winner takes all.

278
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,400
I’ll take the punishment.

279
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,400
Shanggu knew

280
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,760
Wuxi and Feng Yan lived in seclusion.

281
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,160
She also gave Feng Yan’s fake spirit

282
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,110
to Elder Feng Yun.

283
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,880
What did you say?

284
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,830
Since she took you
to the Pilgrimage Hall,

285
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,160
she had never wanted you
to be replaced.

286
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,950
That’s not true.

287
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,640
That’s not true!

288
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,310
Three-head,

289
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,950
what on earth did Wu Huan do?

290
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,400
Tell everybody about it.

291
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,880
Master,

292
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,950
in the past years,

293
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,440
Wu Huan started all the wars

294
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,230
between immortals and demons
for her selfish motives,

295
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,880
because she wanted
to cultivate her devil power

296
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,760
with the evil force in the war.

297
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,280
Father.

298
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,950
Wu Huan, do you admit your guilt?

299
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,190
Wu Huan, you killed gods

300
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,190
and cultivated devil power.

301
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,640
You started wars for selfish motives.

302
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,800
You’re too wicked to be pardoned.

303
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,590
In three days,

304
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,950
I’ll execute you personally
on Green Dragon Platform

305
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,040
to stem everyone’s anger.

306
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,880
I’m too wicked to be pardoned?

307
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,000
Yes. I’m too wicked.

308
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,680
I deserve to be killed. What about you?

309
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,800
Who will convict you?

310
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,070
As the Chief God of Chaos,
you stole the Spirit Gathering Bead,

311
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,400
the Ghost Suppressing Tower
and the Demon Gathering Streamer.

312
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,920
You ignored the Three Realms
for selfish motives.

313
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,160
Now that you punish people
on behalf of the heaven,

314
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,640
why don’t you punish yourself?

315
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,680
Shut up!

316
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,350
Let her continue.

317
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,400
You keep the secret from everyone.

318
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,190
Others dare not say it.

319
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
But I dare.

320
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,470
Shanggu,

321
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,110
you think you’re superior

322
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,070
and you’re the Chief God.

323
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,830
Funny.

324
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,950
Everyone else knows something, but you.

325
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,280
You were discarded
by the man closest to you.

326
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,310
You’re a goddess, so what?

327
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,590
You’re the Chief God, so what?

328
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
You’re the biggest joke
in the Three Realms!

329
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,560
Even poorer than me.

330
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,710
How dare you!

331
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,280
Master!

332
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,160
Even if you kill me,

333
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,310
you can’t change her fate.

334
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,400
Wu Huan,

335
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,760
this is what you accuse me of?

336
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,350
The Spirit Gathering Bead,
the Ghost Suppressing Tower

337
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,430
and the Demon Gathering Streamer
were generated from my Power of Chaos.

338
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,830
These three things

339
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,110
belong to me.

340
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,760
When I wanted

341
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,710
such three weapons,

342
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,400
I didn’t need to steal them.

343
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,470
I’m afraid you’ve been away
from the God Realm for too long

344
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,400
and you’ve forgotten everything.

345
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,800
About anything else,

346
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,830
whether I know it

347
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,950
or I don’t,

348
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,070
you have no right to judge.

349
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,350
I’m now imprisoning you in Fuyao Hall.

350
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,920
Muguang,

351
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,350
you’ve been her husband
for sixty thousand years.

352
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
I’ll keep her alive for three days

353
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,920
for your sake.

354
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,230
Thank you, Master.

355
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,110
Everybody, leave,

356
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,800
except True God Bai Jue.

357
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,110
Shanggu.

358
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,350
Why did I lose my memories?

359
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,160
As the Chief God,

360
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,280
I wasn’t sick or hurt.

361
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,280
But I was asleep for as long
as sixty thousand years.

362
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,560
After I woke up,

363
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,230
even Wu Huan and Jingzhao

364
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,110
dare to judge me.

365
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,880
They mocked and humiliated me
with their ignorance.

366
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,590
Wu Huan didn’t mean you,

367
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,560
but Houchi.

368
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,590
Don’t take it to your heart.

369
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
I almost knew about Houchi.

370
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,070
She was hurt because of you.

371
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,800
Her families and lover died
because of you.

372
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,400
You hurt her so much.

373
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,310
But now you’re sitting here
and not feeling guilty.

374
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,070
♪Don’t be afraid Fate comes back♪

375
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,590
You’re right.

376
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,950
It’s my fault.

377
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,880
I don’t deserve to be the True God.

378
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,400
I wish

379
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,640
I wouldn’t go back to the God Realm.

Yes.

383
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,400

388
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,800
give back my memories.

389
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,230
All over the world,

390
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,430
I can’t think of a second person

391
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,560

393
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,880

Tianqi,

420
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,800
I really don’t understand.

421
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,110
Why did Bai Jue owe so much?

422
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,950
Everybody has his confusion.

423
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,760
Bai Jue told me

424
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,040
it was his fault about Houchi.

425
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,640
Wu Huan said

426
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
I should have submitted to fate
sixty thousand years ago.

427
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,520
What on earth happened
after I left the Nether World?

428
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,800
Where are my memories?

429
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,710
Everybody has loss of memories, too.

430
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,070
What exactly is
the Tribulation of Chaos?

431
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,430
Shanggu,

432
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,070
I didn’t experience it.

433
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,310
I’m not sure.

434
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,710
Bai Jue is so cruel to me.

435
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,590
Even now,

436
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,950
I don’t want to believe it.

437
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,590
Does he have some reason?

438
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,920
What on earth are you keeping from me?

439
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,560
When something is unfinished,

440
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,040
leave it there.

441
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,950
Tianqi,

442
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,590
I’m exhausted.

443
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,430
Let’s go back home.

444
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,160
All right.

445
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,070
Let’s go back home.

446
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,800
Qin,

447
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,160
tell me the truth.

448
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,430
Am I too cowardly

449
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,680
and self-righteous?

450
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,880
What do you think, Your Majesty?

451
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,920
Stop calling me Your Majesty.

452
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
I feel ashamed.

453
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,950
During the war in the Demon Region,

454
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,280
I was sorry for Jingjian,

455
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,640
for the late king,

456
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,470
and for the demons.

457
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,880
Qin,

458
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,430
you were right to reject me that day.

459
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
I’m not good enough for you.

460
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,070
Your Majesty, you’re young.

461
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,430
You’ve got a long way to go.

462
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,680
Take your time.

463
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,070
I’ll take my time.

464
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,160
In the God Realm

465
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,920
when I first saw you,

466
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,640
it was just like now.

467
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,310
You were wearing the uniform
of the Pilgrimage Hall.

468
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,070
You looked so proud

469
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,590
and outstanding.

470
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,560
At that time, I never expected you

471
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,000
to be the one

472
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,000
who I spent my life with.

473
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,160
In the old years,

474
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,310
thank you for choosing me.

475
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,400
It’s been sixty thousand years.

476
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,310
In all these years,

477
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,110
you lived with me.

478
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
We also have Jingyang,

479
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,590
Jingjian

480
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,190
and Jingzhao.

481
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,680
I’m satisfied.

482
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,640
Huan,

483
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,950
I should have told you.

484
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,950
I don’t love

485
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,880
the most honorable Heavenly Empress

486
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,800
after the God Realm is sealed,

487
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,230
but the old Wu Huan

488
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,280
who could be happy all day

489
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,590
because Goddess Shanggu praised her.

490
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,830
What’s the point of saying this?

491
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,680
In three days,

492
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,950
I’ll die.

493
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,560
In the God Realm

494
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,800
or in the Heavenly Palace,

495
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,640
I’ve done nothing wrong.

496
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,350
The fate is wrong.

497
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,310
And the world is wrong.

498
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,190
Huan,

499
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,920
may I hug you one more time?

500
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,160
Huan,

501
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,230
no matter you’re right or wrong,

502
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,920
you’re always my wife

503
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,070
and the mother of my children.

504
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,470
So, you already knew

505
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,080
what Wu Huan did?

506
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:33,840
Please understand it, Master.

507
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,870
For my selfish motives,

508
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,470
I...

509
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,520
Under such circumstances,

510
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
you still want
to take the blame for her?

511
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,120
Is this what Yuemi taught you?

512
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,840
Wu Huan made a huge mistake.

513
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,280
I just want to beg you

514
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,950
to keep her alive.

515
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,840
You really don’t respect me at all.

516
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,150
If I don’t keep her alive,

517
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,710
I’ll be wrong?

518
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,430
Muguang,

519
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,430
Wu Huan has been married with you
for sixty thousand years.

520
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,150
She had children for you

521
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,120
and accompanied you.

522
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,800
It’s alright when you defend her.

523
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,600
But have you thought about it?

524
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,710
In these years, she’s been honorable

525
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,710
with the supreme glory.

526
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,190
But your master Yuemi

527
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,840
has been sealed in the stone statue

528
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,910
by the Swamp

529
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,430
and has never been let out

530
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,800
or rested in peace.

531
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,670
Goddess Yuemi had
great expectations for you.

532
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,870
She made you the Star Messenger
when you first came to the God Realm.

533
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,950
So did Zhiyang.

534
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,670
Before the God Realm was closed,

535
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,120
he entrusted you with the lower realm.

536
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,470
But what did you do?

537
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,520
You really let us down.

538
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,190
In my life,

539
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,430
I’ve been too indecisive

540
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,910
and made a big mistake.

541
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,280
At last, I can do something

542
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,760
I should have done
sixty thousand years ago.

543
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,360
Let me out!

544
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,320
Where’s Muguang?

545
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,280
Let me out!

546
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,760
