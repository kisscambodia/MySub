00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 48=

3
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,600
Let me out!

4
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,560
Where’s Muguang?

5
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,520
Let me out!

6
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,010
Let me out!

7
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,400
I’ve governed the Immortal Realm
for sixty thousand years.

8
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,090
With the help of all immortals,

9
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,530
we have been in peace.

10
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,120
But I’m obsessive about fighting demons.

11
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,280
I started several wars against them

12
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,250
so that the Three Realms were in unrest.

13
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,810
I also connived the Heavenly Empress
to make big mistakes

14
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,920
which were beyond retrieval.

15
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,680
I’m too ashamed
to be the Heavenly Emperor.

16
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,170
I’d like to be a stone dragon,

17
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,370
separating immortals and demons forever

18
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,530
and always keeping the world safe.

19
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,840
The Queen of Phoenix Fengran
is fair and impartial.

20
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
She’s the best person for the throne.

21
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,680
Hope you’ll assist her wholeheartedly

22
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,970
and protect the Three Realms forever.

23
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,380
(Fuyao Hall)

24
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,080
Jingyang.

25
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,080
Jingzhao.

26
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,560
Jingyang,

27
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,010
Father and Jingjian died.

28
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,240
Only we three are alive.

29
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,800
Are you really leaving
the Heavenly Palace?

30
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
What will Mother and I do?

31
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,770
Leave the Heavenly Palace?

32
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,170
No. You can’t leave.

33
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,280
Your father is dead.

34
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,400
If you leave,

35
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,730
Fengran will take the throne.

36
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,960
I won’t let you leave.

37
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,360
Mother,

38
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,960
I made too many mistakes.

39
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,680
I’m too ashamed
to be the Heavenly Emperor.

40
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,680
I’m the Heavenly Empress.

41
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
You’re my son.

42
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,890
If you’re not qualified, who else is?

43
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,280
If I had a choice,

44
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,050
I would rather be Father’s son

45
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,930
and Jingjian’s elder brother.

46
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,930
But I don’t want to be your son.

47
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,890
Jingyang!

48
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,610
I care for the Heavenly Palace.

49
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,650
I’ve done everything,

50
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,280
simply to keep our family safe.

51
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,930
What have I done wrong?

52
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,050
To keep our family safe?

53
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,730
When will you stop deceiving yourself?

54
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,050
It’s because you made so many mistakes

55
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,930
that our family broke.

56
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,650
Everyone else can complain about me,

57
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,280
but you can’t!

58
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,490
I brought you up.

59
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,240
Mother,

60
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,800
I came to say goodbye to you.

61
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,400
Goddess Shanggu punished me
to go to the Human Realm,

62
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,800
develop it with all my power

63
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,610
and help people in distress

64
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,770
to make compensations for my sins.

65
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,360
Immortals and devils go different ways.

66
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,080
I’m afraid

67
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,050
you and I won’t meet again.

68
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,410
This is where we part ways.

69
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,410
Jingyang,

70
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,650
don’t leave.

71
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,040
Son.

72
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,330
Son!

73
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,010
Mother.

74
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:12,920
Son,

75
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,600
come back!

76
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,890
You’re satisfied now?

77
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,530
My family is ruined

78
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,890
and I can’t fight back at all.

79
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,800
You finally avenged yourself

80
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,650
for being questioned in public

81
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,560
and being fooled.

82
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,160
Master, please let go of my mother!

83
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,410
Master, please let go of my mother!

84
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,770
Muguang is dead.

85
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,800
Wu Huan, do you regret it now?

86
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,120
Without you,

87
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,800
how would he be dead?

88
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,600
If someone has to regret,

89
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,770
it should be you!

90
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,360
I indeed regret.

91
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,920
I don’t like to recall the past

92
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,120
or admit my fault.

93
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,040
But I regret taking you back
to the Pilgrimage Hall

94
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,800
sixty thousand years ago.

95
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Kill me if you want.

96
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,720
Don’t bother to nag.

97
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,010
You punish me on
the Green Dragon Platform,

98
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,770
simply because you want me
to be humiliated

99
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,850
in front of all immortals.

100
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,650
Where are they?

101
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,330
Show them how cruel you are.

102
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,770
Don’t bother.

103
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,120
I won’t let them come,
for Muguang’s sake.

104
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,770
I won’t be grateful.

105
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,850
Wu Huan, even if you die,

106
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,720
you can’t atone for your crime.

107
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,530
But Muguang is innocent.
Yuemi is innocent.

108
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,650
Jingjian is innocent.

109
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,160
I won’t put you in prison
in the Nether World

110
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,210
or totally crush your soul.

111
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,160
You had your sins,

112
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,970
because I brought you back.

113
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,480
I should put an end to it.

114
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,240
Mother. Mother!

115
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,410
Mother!

116
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,480
You have no God power now.

117
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,680
I’ve taken back your bloodline
of the Feng Clan.

118
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,160
From this day, you won’t get old or die.

119
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,770
You’re not a human, demon,

120
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,650
immortal or devil.

121
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,890
You’ll suffer all kinds of illnesses,

122
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,650
but never have a reincarnation.

123
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,450
You’ll be lonely forever.

124
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,600
Goddess Shanggu,

125
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,120
you’re loved and respected.

126
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,970
How can you be so heartless?

127
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,920
I curse you.

128
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,480
I curse you never
to get the man you love

129
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,360
so that you also live forever

130
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,650
and be lonely forever!

131
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,210
Jingjian,

132
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,850
I swear to heaven.

133
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,600
As long as I’m alive,

134
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,120
the Echo Drum won’t ring.

135
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,120
The peace between immortals
and demons is his lifelong wish.

136
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,680
Hope you’ll keep your promise.

137
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,330
Jingjian, if the crack on the drum
can’t be fixed,

138
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,770
I’ll kill myself and apologize to you.

139
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,920
I’m going back to the God Realm.

140
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,090
The Immortal Realm is in chaos.

141
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,650
I can’t be relieved

142
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,890
unless I leave it to you.

143
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,210
Master,

144
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,010
I can only fight,
but don’t know how to govern it.

145
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,160
I’m afraid I’ll let you down.

146
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,160
You’re very clear

147
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,530
about what is right or wrong.

148
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,360
When you always follow your heart,

149
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,970
you won’t make a big mistake.

150
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,770
But the responsibility is heavy.

151
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,040
I just want to stay here
and be his company.

152
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,410
Immortals and demons
have deep resentments.

153
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,290
If we want to eliminate

154
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,970
their misunderstandings and prejudices,

155
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,090
we need more than Sen Yu.

156
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,480
Like you said,

157
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,600
it’s Jingjian’s lifelong wish.

158
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,360
I promise you.

159
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,090
If immortals and demons
get back in peace again,

160
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,970
you can quit as you wish.

161
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,940
(Tomb of Immortal Jingjian)

162
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,090
You knew I would come?

163
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,010
Who else would come to me?

164
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,450
Take Shanggu back as early as possible.

165
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,330
I’ve put all spiritual power of the Dome

166
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,770
in Taicang Spear.

167
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,680
With the power of you and Shanggu,

168
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,970
you will be able to open the God Realm.

169
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,290
When Yuanqi knows,

170
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,410
he’ll lose his temper.

171
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,600
You were its master.

172
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,560
Even sixty thousand years ago.

173
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:40,920
Hongri?

174
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
After we leave,

175
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,800
you will be lonely.

176
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
Let Hongri stay with you.

177
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,040
What?

178
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,720
Nothing to say?

179
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,530
Say hello to Zhiyang when you see him.

180
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,450
When will you go?

181
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,600
Soon.

182
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Before we leave,

183
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,530
spend more time with Yuanqi.

184
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,090
In this life,

185
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,010
you should feel the sorriest for him.

186
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,450
Yuanqi is naughty.

187
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,800
In the past hundred years,

188
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,010
you had hard work taking care of him.

189
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,040
It was a nice job, in fact.

190
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,970
I quite like your son’s temper.

191
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,330
He isn’t

192
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,600
like you at all.

193
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,090
But look at you.

194
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,410
From time to time,

195
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,090
you disguised yourself as Fengran
and played with him secretly.

196
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,920
What? Isn’t it trouble?

197
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,160
If you turn up in front of him
as his father,

198
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,290
do you not know what to say

199
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,090
and fear that he can’t accept you?

200
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,240
I have a good idea

201
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,210
to help you out.

202
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,480
Go on.

203
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,720
Yuanqi loves magic weapons.

204
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,290
He always wants

205
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,920
his exclusive weapon.

206
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,240
For this,

207
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,850
he’s haunting me for nearly ten years.

208
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,160
When he wanted a weapon,

209
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,210
you could have made one for him.

210
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,450
Why didn’t you satisfy him?

211
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,920
It’s a nice job.

212
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,770
I’d like to leave it to you.

213
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,440
When Yuanqi had his first tooth,

214
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,930
walked for the first time,

215
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,410
and said the first word,

216
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,320
I witnessed them for you.

217
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,840
As for his first magic weapon,

218
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,320
it’s better that

219
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,010
you make it for him.

220
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,810
What do you think?

221
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,530
Isn’t it a good idea?

222
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,080
Yuanqi, what are you doing?

223
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,840
Fengran has become the Heavenly Queen.

224
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,720
I’m catching some fish for her.

225
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,730
Yuanqi,

226
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,570
didn’t you say

227
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,570
you wanted to marry Fengran
when you grew up?

228
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,320
Fish isn’t enough.

229
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,290
Besides,

230
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,440
it’s not the way to catch fish.

231
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,480
Let me teach you.

232
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,600
Uncle Tianqi,

233
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,080
why did you let him in?

234
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:04,930
Leave.

235
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,840
I don’t welcome you.

236
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,200
Yuanqi,

237
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,410
have you heard that

238
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,290
Wu Huan has been severely punished?

239
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,570
It got about in the Three Realms.

240
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,480
What does it concern him?

241
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,600
It’s time to tell you something.

242
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,930
What is it?

243
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,320
(Always Acquire New Knowledge)
Yuanqi, when you were born,

244
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,690
Wu Huan had become a devil

245
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,720
and was hurting people.

246
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,410
I was badly wounded

247
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:32,960
and I had no evidence.

248
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,410
I didn’t dare to take rash action.

249
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,320
Also, I feared more that

250
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,320
you and your mother

251
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,570
would be implicated.

252
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,320
After thinking carefully,

253
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,810
I didn’t recognize you.

254
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,050
But in the past hundred years,

255
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,290
I studied carefully
and cultivated myself hard.

256
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,080
At last, a couple of days ago,

257
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,600
I revealed Wu Huan’s sins.

258
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,930
Who are you fooling?

259
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,930
It’s not what my mother said.

260
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,480
What did your mother say?

261
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,320
She said

262
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,600
you didn’t deserve us.

263
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,480
Yeah.

264
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,050
I don’t deserve you.

265
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,240
Don’t try to fool me.

266
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,690
I’ve grown up.

267
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,720
I can tell right from wrong.

268
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,410
Yuanqi,

269
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,050
what your father said is true.

270
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,770
I can be his witness.

271
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
I still don’t believe him.

272
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,080
Unless...

273
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,570
Unless Fengran can be his witness, too.

274
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,720
Why do you want her?

275
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,170
Because she’s the Heavenly Queen.

276
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,930
I’m even a True God.

277
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,440
I don’t care.

278
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,930
I just trust her.

279
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,810
I even changed your nappies.

280
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,770
Why don’t you trust me?

281
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,600
Fengran often took me
to the lower realm for fun.

282
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,050
I believe whatever she says.

283
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,930
Come on.

284
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:50,570
All right.

285
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,440
Ask Fengran in a couple of days

286
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,410
whether I tell you the truth.

287
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,120
Yuanqi,

288
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,930
you can’t tell many things

289
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,200
only with your eyes.

290
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,360
I trust my eyes.

291
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,530
Yeah, no matter what reason I have,

292
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,530
I’ve been feeling guilty for you.

293
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,080
You’ve grown up.

294
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,320
I didn’t come today,

295
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,010
to ask for your pardon,

296
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,810
but to have a word with you

297
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,570
about what adults should think over.

298
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,930
Over what?

299
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,050
Death.

300
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,600
Death?

301
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,570
Have you learned

302
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,290
about death?

303
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,530
Uncle Tianqi said

304
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,840
Jingjian was gone.

305
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,840
Does that mean he’s dead?

306
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,410
When someone’s sense disappears
and his body collapses,

307
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,170
he’s gone and dead.

308
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,600
After he is dead,

309
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,050
nothing will be left.

310
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,010
Will I die, too?

311
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,410
Everybody has his fate.

312
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,080
Everybody dies.

313
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,120
But I don’t want to die.

314
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,600
I also don’t want anyone I know to die.

315
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,360
Death isn’t horrible.

316
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,320
Watching anyone you know die
isn’t horrible, either.

317
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,240
Death is destined,

318
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,480
like the blooming and fading of flowers.

319
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,050
No one can change his fate.

320
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,440
When Jingjian died,

321
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,810
Fengran was weeping all the time.

322
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,320
But as time goes by

323
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:27,840
year after year,

324
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,080
she won’t feel as hurt as before.

325
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,290
Will Jingjian feel hurt?

326
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,170
He won’t, of course.

327
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,570
Because he died for who he loved

328
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,410
and for the whole world.

329
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,200
It’s a happy thing.

330
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,960
He won’t feel hurt.

331
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,120
Hungry?

332
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,650
Let me take you somewhere.

333
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:53,810
Where?

334
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,600
The Human Realm.

335
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,540
Let’s go.

336
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,480
Sir.

337
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,200
Toys. Funny toys.

338
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,320
Small pendants.

339
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,050
Delicious sugar-coated haws.

340
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,930
Funny toys.

341
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,860
Come and have a look.

342
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,290
Here they are.

343
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,720
Gentlemen,

344
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,440
your dishes are ready. Enjoy yourselves.

345
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,120
How do you know my favorite dishes?

346
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,770
I’m your father and I know you.

347
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,010
I haven’t recognized you yet.

348
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,890
Have you read books today?

349
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,570
I read the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

350
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,810
But I remember you read it

351
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,650
a hundred years ago.

352
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,320
Fengran said

353
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,200
such an ancient book was obscure
and hard to understand.

354
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,050
I need to work hard on it.

355
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,890
Then I read it many more times.

356
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,010
Let me test you, then.

357
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,080
Come on.

358
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,120
Forget it.

359
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,240
We shouldn’t talk
when eating and sleeping.

360
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,480
Test me as you wish.

361
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,720
I can reel off that book.

362
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,320
After having the meal,

363
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,530
shall we gamble

364
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,770
and fly the kite?

365
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,930
You can gamble?

366
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,080
Sure.

367
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Your mother loves it

368
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
and I learned to play it.

369
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,570
You must be poor at it.

370
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,930
I taught you how to play.

371
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,840
Liar.

372
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,410
Fengran taught me that.

373
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,200
Compete with me.

374
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,170
What punishment?

375
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,200
Old rule. Stickers on the loser’s face.

376
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,290
How do you know the rule

377
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,810
between Fengran and me?

378
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,690
She told me.

379
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,690
I asked Fengran many times.

380
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,600
She said she didn’t teach you to gamble,

381
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,410
fly the kite,

382
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,480
or fight for you.

383
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,600
She just didn’t admit it.

384
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,320
Anyway, I’m not lying.

385
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,120
Today, you aren’t as annoying
as you were.

386
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,170
Let’s take a rest here.

387
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,050
All right.

388
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,930
I won again.

389
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,650
You’re awesome, Yuanqi.

390
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,840
I give in.

391
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,080
I won several times in a row.

392
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,480
Your face is too full for more stickers.

393
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,570
What punishment

394
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,890
do you want then?

395
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,770
You’ll do whatever I want?

396
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,170
Yes, bet is bet.

397
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,170
The other day,

398
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,720
Fengran took me off the mountain

399
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,410
and we met Xiaoba from Flower Demons.

400
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,690
He was holding a dagger.

401
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,840
A magic weapon for cultivation!

402
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,810
I want a magic weapon.

403
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,240
It should have matchless power.

404
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,480
Why did you give me a peach wood sword?

405
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,770
What is it made of?

406
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,050
It’s an ordinary peach wood sword.

407
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,080
Ordinary?

408
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,770
Then why is it so powerful?

409
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,480
It has half of my power in it.

410
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
No other weapon can be better than it.

411
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,200
Do you like it?

412
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,600
Xiaoba will envy me in return.

413
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,530
When you have a master,

414
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,930
cultivate yourself with this sword.

415
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,840
It’ll help you be a god soon.

416
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,440
Thank you, Fa...

417
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,570
One more thing.

418
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,050
Don’t hurt people without a reason.

419
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,480
I understand.

420
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,240
You put half of your power

421
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,770
in the sword.

422
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,960
If you meet a bad person

423
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,120
like Wu Huan again,

424
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,120
will you not defeat her?

425
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,360
I can handle that.

426
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,320
When I have it,

427
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,720
I can fight with you
shoulder to shoulder.

428
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,080
If you’re in trouble again,

429
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,570
come to me in Qingchi Palace.

430
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,960
Yuanqi, you know what?

431
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,770
You were born with the Power of Chaos.

432
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,120
Unless something goes wrong,

433
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,810
you’ll be the Chief God.

434
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,360
In the future,

435
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,770
you should mostly count on yourself.

436
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,890
Remember, never stop learning

437
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,840
and always be diligent.

438
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,810
Did you really not recognize me

439
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,720
because you didn’t want Mother or me

440
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,240
to be involved in trouble?

441
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:02,690
Right.

442
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,480
All right. I trust you.

443
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,480
Shouldn’t you call me

444
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,600
Father?

445
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,200
You’re a young man now.

446
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,840
You must protect your mother

447
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,720
and don’t let anyone bully her.

448
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,360
I will protect her.

449
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,480
Let me give you something.

450
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:32,770
What’s this?

451
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,570
Don’t open it

452
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,240
before I leave.

453
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,080
Where are you going again?

454
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,720
I’m going to travel around the world.

455
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,010
You’re leaving me again?

456
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,890
Uncle Tianqi will explain to you.

457
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,720
How soon will you come back?

458
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,600
Remember what I just told you.

459
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Which do you mean?

460
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,690
Your mother is still mad at me.

461
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,290
What happened today...

462
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,290
Let’s not tell her, all right?

463
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,170
I’m leaving, then.

464
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:20,810
Father.

465
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,890
When you come back,

466
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,890
bring me some magic weapons.

467
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,240
Will you?

468
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:41,720
Father,

469
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,570
why don’t you answer me?

It’s great.

478
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,080
On the tenth day of the ninth month

479
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,600
in year 60569
of the post ancient calendar,

480
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,240
the Chief God returned.

481
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,890
The Three Realms come back in peace.

482
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,010
- Welcome Chief God.
- Welcome Chief God.

483
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,080
Mother, the house is made of jade

484
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,080
and the stairs are made of glaze.

485
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,480
This place is full of treasures.

486
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,170
Let’s go to the Heaven and Earth Platform.

487
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:17,570
In the past sixty thousand years,

488
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,320
it was them

489
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:19,930
who didn’t disappear

490
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,600
or die.

491
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,410
They exhausted their god power

492
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,890
to maintain the God Realm silently.

493
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,690
They were waiting until we came back.

494
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,840
But no one told them

495
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,320
when we would come back.

496
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,290
Zhiyang,

497
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,480
we’re back.

498
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:29,440
Shanggu,

499
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,570
will you really not let Bai Jue

500
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,650
come back to the God Realm?

501
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,840
I said that

502
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,050
I wouldn’t see him ever again.

503
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,480
Why can I wish him to be back?

504
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,010
You mean you wished?

505
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,890
Yuemi’s birthday is coming.

506
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:53,960
Why are you still here?

507
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Yuemi’s birthday?

508
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,690
I’m having a dream again.

509
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,650
What are you waiting for? Come.

510
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,080
I seldom have a dream.

511
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,890
I can’t wake up so quickly.

512
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,290
Or it’ll be wasted.

513
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,160
Shanggu,

514
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,640
take good care of yourself.

515
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,240
Don’t think of me

516
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,160
or dream about me again.

517
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,850
I don’t often dream about you.

518
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,090
Just sometimes...

519
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,160

You’ll practice the Power of Chaos?

546
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,160
Precisely.

547
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,570
The Tribulation of Chaos
is aimed at Shanggu.

548
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,680
It can’t be handled
without the Power of Chaos.

549
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,160
After she left,

550
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,640
I found a clue from the Deicide Flower.

551
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,160
When I trawled through all books,

552
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,810

553
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,570
I couldn’t get the Power of Chaos

554
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,570
unless I mixed the immortal power
with the demon power.

555
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,050
But the two kinds of power
repel each other.

556
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,810
How can you mix them?

557
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,530
It’s too risky.

558
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,530
My Power of the Original Being
is the immortal power.

559
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,290
All I need to do
is to split my Original Being

560
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,960
and let the other half
cultivate the demon power.

561
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,610
Then I’ll mix them.
