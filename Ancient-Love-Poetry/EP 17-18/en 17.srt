00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:28,420
=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 17=

3
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,160
The birthday gift from Zijin Mansion
is indeed impressive!

4
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,800
This Fire Coral is even

5
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,450
more exquisite than the ones kept
in the East Sea Dragon Palace.

6
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,800
Looks like Jingyang is very
grateful to his benefactor.

7
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,960
As a former unidentified immortal
in the Lower Realm,

8
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,570
it took that guy only less than
10,000 years to become a Lord

9
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,520
in the Heavenly Palace and
an important guest at Mount Lookout.

10
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,770
But that Ziyuan is way over the line.

11
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,570
He hurt you badly back then
by a sneak attack,

12
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,200
and now he even sent
his immortal servants

13
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,360
to our Qingchi Palace at will.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,450
The Mount Lookout

15
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,170
also sent us an invitation
for the birthday banquet

16
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,880
of Lord Donghua of Daze Mansion.

17
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:39,730
Your Lordship,

18
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,360
Lord Donghua is an important
official of the Immortals.

19
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,360
Many people will go

20
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,170
to celebrate his birthday.

21
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,730
Why don’t we take this opportunity

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,170
to tell Ziyuan off?

23
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,170
We can’t.

24
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,130
With his status getting

25
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,730
higher and higher in the
Heavenly Palace these years,

26
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,770
Ziyuan is more arrogant than ever.

27
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,240
If we tell him off,

28
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,360
it’ll humiliate our Qingchi Palace.

29
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,130
But our Qingchi Palace

30
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,090
is on an equal footing with
the Heavenly Palace!

31
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,730
Even though God Gu Jun isn’t here,

32
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,640
Little Master is also a God.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,090
No matter how powerful
the Heavenly Palace is,

34
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,920
they can’t ignore what she has to say.

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,730
Chang Que.

36
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,640
Unlike Jiaye, you know everything.

37
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,000
How could you make
such a ridiculous suggestion?

38
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,090
Didn’t you see what happened just now?

39
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,960
So you lied when you said

40
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,240
her immortal power had got stronger?

41
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,320
Chang Que,

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,960
do you know

43
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
what I saw this month?

44
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,600
After that day,

45
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,520
I went to the Spiritual Spring
for 10 days in a row,

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,850
and I saw that she practiced every day
from sunset to sunrise.

47
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,410
Chang Que,

48
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,320
we’ve been with her for
tens of thousands of years,

49
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,440
but we’ve never really understood her.

50
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,490
Unbelievable! I made it!

51
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,880
I’ve practiced for so many years.

52
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,210
Why did I make it only this time?

53
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,370
Is it because

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,160
practicing by the Spiritual Spring

55
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,410
made a big difference?

56
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,210
If that’s the case,

57
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,410
does it mean

58
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,130
I can travel around with Boxuan

59
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,320
and go through tribulations with him?

60
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,520
Houchi was born
with closed spiritual veins.

61
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,440
God Gu Jun spent 40,000 years
helping her break out of the shell.

62
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,440
She was weak and sickly,

63
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
and she’s got unstable spiritual veins.

64
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,570
Even her mother dislikes her.

65
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,520
The Three Realms all know about it.

66
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,010
On account of the reputation
of our Qingchi Palace, Houchi

67
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,440
seldom left the palace
for the past 20,000 years.

68
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,880
I feel

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,600
so sorry for her.

70
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,600
Chang Que,

71
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,570
can’t you learn a few jokes

72
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,930
and make her laugh?

73
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,490
Please give me a break.

74
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,520
Since Lord Boxuan left,

75
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,370
God Gu Jun

76
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,290
has been traveling all over to find

77
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,370
herbs for Little Master.

78
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,440
Even the spiritual aura in our
Qingchi Palace is decreasing.

79
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,090
Quite a few people have left
the Immortal Cave down the mountain.

80
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,000
God Gu Jun will be back sooner or later.

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,320
When I was rejected by both
the God and Demon Realms,

82
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,160
God Gu Jun took me in.

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,000
I have to protect Houchi

84
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,400
while he’s gone.

85
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,210
Your Lordship,

86
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,970
even a small favor

87
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,690
deserves to be repaid big.

88
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,280
So, shall we go to the Daze Mansion

89
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,560
for the birthday banquet?

90
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,000
Forget it.

91
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,880
Tell them we won’t go.

92
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,320
Qingchi Palace and Heavenly Palace
have nothing to do with each other.

93
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,560
It’ll always be that way.

94
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,840
Yes.

95
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,840
Hurry!

96
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,120
Are you sure this is where Lord Ziyuan

97
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,880
dropped his Fire Coral?

98
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,770
I’m sure!

99
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,810
I’ve told you many times!

100
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,560
If we hadn’t come to the
Spiritual Spring of the Qingchi Palace,

101
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,250
we wouldn’t have made
such a big mistake!

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,690
Lower your voice!

103
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,560
The people of the Qingchi Palace
may hear us!

104
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,090
Who are you?

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,400
What are you doing here
on our back mountain?

106
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,400
Oh, a fairy maiden.

107
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,490
I’m a disciple

108
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,970
of Lord Ziyuan of the Zijin Mansion.

109
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,250
I was passing by Qilian Mountains

110
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,840
and I got thirsty,

111
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,400
so I came here to drink
some spring water.

112
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
You made it sound so reasonable.

113
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,160
There’s a barrier in our Qingchi Palace.

114
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,490
How did you get in?

115
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,690
I’ll tell Lord Fengran,
the Master of our palace.

116
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,560
What… What barrier?

117
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,280
Everybody knows

118
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,320
that the Qingchi Palace is a wasteland
in the Heavenly Realm.

119
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,400
I wouldn’t

120
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,440
come even if you

121
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,810
invited me over.

122
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,050
Do you think

123
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,770
she’s the one who took the Fire Coral?

124
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,650
Did you steal

125
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,930
Lord Ziyuan’s Fire Coral?

126
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
What Fire Coral?

127
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,050
I’m afraid I’ll hurt you

128
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,970
if you don’t tell the truth!

129
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:34,840
Boxuan...

130
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,490
Houchi,

131
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,160
are you alright?

132
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,720
I’m fine.

133
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
How dare you guys from the Zijin Mansion

134
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,840
break into our Qingchi Palace!

135
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,090
She’s that phoenix!

136
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,600
Let’s go!

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,880
- Okay!
- Wanna leave?

138
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,970
Fengran, let them go.

139
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,600
It’s better to stay away from trouble.

140
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,810
And they didn’t hurt me anyway.

141
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,810
I’m glad you are fine.

142
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,280
What should we do?

143
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,160
What should we do?

144
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,720
We offended Fengran,

145
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,970
and lost Lord Ziyuan’s Fire Coral!

146
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,840
The Qingchi Palace may be declining,

147
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,770
but it’s still God Gu Jun’s residence.

148
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,050
If Fengran looks into it,

149
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,320
we’ll both be in big trouble!

150
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,690
I told you to lower your voice!

151
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,560
Stop yelling!

152
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,810
I bet it was your loud voice

153
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,440
that caught their attention.

154
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,720
It’s not the time to scold me!

155
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
You are a quick thinker.

156
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,810
Would you think of an idea first?

157
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,840
Fengran holds a grudge
against His Grace.

158
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
The Qingchi Palace has little contact
with the Heavenly Palace.

159
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,000
And God Gu Jun is originally
from the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

160
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,930
What are you doing?

161
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,810
It hurts!

162
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,120
What are you doing?

163
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,560
Look.

164
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,090
Does it look like a wound caused
by the Demon Power?

165
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,600
It does!

166
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,840
Where did you get the spiritual water?

167
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,560
I bought it from an underground market.

168
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,370
It can forge the nature
of the wound immediately.

169
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,000
The war between the immortals
and the demons has lasted for so long.

170
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,650
Such a thing like this is always needed

171
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,690
by those coward deserters.

172
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,440
If Lord Ziyuan finds out,

173
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:00,720
you’ll…

174
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,970
I just bought it for fun.

175
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Who would’ve thought
that it’d be useful today?

176
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,250
No matter what,

177
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,490
we’ll be in trouble,

178
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,930
so we may as well just try our luck.

179
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,050
Where’s the invitation
from Lord Donghua?

180
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,090
I have it.

181
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,210
Have you changed your mind?

182
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,490
I don’t care if Ziyuan insults me.

183
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,400
But I can’t stand that his people

184
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,720
broke into our palace

185
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,840
and attempted to hurt Houchi!

186
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,340
I’ll teach him a lesson

187
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,000
at the birthday banquet!

188
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,770
But the Zijin Mansion and
the Heavenly Palace are quite close.

189
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,770
If the Heavenly Palace takes their side

190
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,050
and helps Ziyuan…

191
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,120
It doesn’t matter.

192
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,970
Chang Que,

193
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,650
prepare a gift for Lord Donghua.

194
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,770
Yes.

195
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,560
Your Lordship,

196
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,650
the Daze Mansion put God Gu Jun’s name

197
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
on the invitation.

198
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,370
If you take his place to go,

199
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,970
Ziyuan will use it against you.

200
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,600
God Gu Jun is not
the only God in our Qingchi Palace.

201
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,320
I may not be qualified to go,

202
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,160
but someone is.

203
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,840
You mean Her Grace?

204
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,200
If you are in danger,

205
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,450
inject your Immortal Power
to this bracelet,

206
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,520
and it’ll enhance your
cultivation base right away.

207
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Although it won’t last for long,

208
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,450
it’ll be enough for you
to get out of the danger in time.

209
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,840
Don’t use it too often.

210
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,400
It’ll harm your Spiritual Strength.

211
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,520
Your Grace.

212
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,960
What are you thinking of?
You look so serious.

213
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
What brings you here?

214
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,490
Donghua will hold his

215
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,160
70,000th birthday party in a few days.

216
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,160
He asked his disciple

217
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,720
to send us an invitation

218
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,250
to his birthday banquet.

219
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,130
Shall we make a trip
to the Mount Lookout?

220
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,810
The Mount Lookout?

221
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,370
I’m not going.

222
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,720
Although I haven’t been
acknowledged yet,

223
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,050
I’m still at the rank of Goddess.

224
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,080
Why would I go to
an Immortal Lord’s birthday banquet?

225
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,330
Donghua is the Lord
of the Mount Lookout.

226
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,330
His status in the Immortal Realm is
only second to the Heavenly Emperor.

227
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,840
If we don’t go,

228
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,840
people would think we are conceited.

229
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
He’s about the same age as me,

230
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,840
and quite influential.

231
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,570
How about this?

232
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,960
You can go with Chang Que.

233
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,520
I think that’ll be plenty respectful

234
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,400
if you go there in person.

235
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,130
That won’t work.

236
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,050
The invitation is for you
and God Gu Jun.

237
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,570
Chang Que and I are only Lords.

238
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,330
How can we take your places?

239
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,690
I won’t be able to go.

240
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,570
I do want to,

241
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,570
but

242
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,840
I need to practice the immortal
techniques in the ancient books

243
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,570
that Boxuan left me every day.

244
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,690
If I go on such a long trip,

245
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,810
it’ll delay my cultivation.

246
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,370
And I’ll fail when you

247
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,600
test me next time.

248
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,720
Your Spiritual Power is
already at the bottom,

249
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,960
so why care about the delay?

250
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,840
With my immortal foundation,

251
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,720
I can’t afford missing
any cultivation day.

252
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,840
And you saw

253
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,600
that I had mastered the Control Spell.

254
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,200
Do you think you did that?

255
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,520
Actually, it was me…

256
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
You what?

257
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,810
Did you help me in secret?

258
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,600
So I made the Control Spell work?

259
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,930
You know already?

260
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,450
I guess

261
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,050
you saw my cultivation

262
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,570
and you were worried that I’d lose
my confidence if I failed the test,

263
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,160
so you put on a show for me, right?

264
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,810
How did you find out that?

265
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,720
Houchi,

266
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,280
how did you grow to be this insightful?

267
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,960
I guess you cultivated your brain

268
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,330
instead of the Spiritual Power.

269
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,930
Fengran,

270
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,330
I do want to go,

271
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,600
but

272
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,720
before my father left,

273
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,810
he told me

274
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,050
that I wasn’t allowed
to leave the Qingchi Palace

275
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,400
until I mastered the Immortal Power.

276
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,570
Don’t worry.

277
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,890
Since God Gu Jun let me

278
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,720
be in charge of the Qingchi Palace,

279
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,400
I think I have the right

280
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,570
to send you to the birthday banquet.

281
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,050
Then…

282
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,690
Then what if he finds out about this?

283
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,890
I’ll take full responsibility.

284
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,400
Deal?

285
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,050

Can I go with you?

415
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,200
Your Spiritual Power is still weak.

416
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:26,200
It’s dangerous for you

417
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,130
to go with me.

418
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,840
It’s all because I was born sickly.

419
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,520
I can’t be of any help to my father,

420
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,760
and I’ve become a burden to you.

421
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,370
I left without saying goodbye

422
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,370
because I didn’t want to see you sad.

423
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,200
I will do my best

424
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,810

and learn the magic techniques.

426

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,570
the immortal techniques in the
ancient books I left you,

428
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,250
so that you can travel
around with me in the future.

429
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,330

430
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,330

431
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,280
I will be back in 10,000 years.

432
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,490
And I will find you

433
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,450
no matter where you are.

434
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,160
I’ll do my best to cultivate myself
and learn the techniques.

435
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,890
Although no one knows
where my father is,

436
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,400
he’d sometimes send
an instruction feather

437
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,640
and ask how we are doing.

438
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,280
But you…

439
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,010
You don’t even send a letter.

440
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,760
If you find out my Spiritual Power

441
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,370
hasn’t improved at all
after you are back,

442
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,400
would you laugh at me like
the others in the Three Realms do

443
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,760
that I only have an empty title

444
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,400
but no Spiritual Power at all?

445
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,090
You care about me so much.

446
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,000
You will never laugh at me.

447
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,570
Fengran decided to take a trip
to Mount Lookout.

448
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,280
And I can take this chance

449
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,120
to try to look for you there.

450
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,730
I hope you won’t encounter any danger

451
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,610
when you go through the tribulations.

452
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,850
You won’t! Definitely not!

453
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,760
You are blessed.

454
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,240
You’ll be safe.

455
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,160
You are saying that someone

456
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,120
in the Qingchi Palace
hurt you with Demon Power

457
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,640
and took away

458
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,850
the gift I prepared for Lord Donghua?

459
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,160
The Qingchi Palace has been
closed for 10,000 years.

460
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,240
Why would someone there

461
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,610
hurt you for no reason?

462
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,160
Your Lordship,

463
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,730
Wu Wang and I

464
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,400
passed by Qilian Mountains

465
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,880
and bumped into a fairy maiden
of the Qingchi Palace.

466
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,400
She knew that we are your disciples,

467
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,810
so she broke out into curses and said

468
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,160
you were evil and despicable.

469
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,640
It angered us,

470
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,760
so we argued back.

471
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,240
Then she suddenly attacked us

472
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,330
and took away the gift.

473
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,280
She… She almost killed us!

474
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,400
Is it true?

475
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,400
I dare not lie to you!

476
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,640
Look!

477
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,810
This is a wound from her attack!

478
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,970
It really is a burn wound
caused by Demon Power.

479
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,640
Since someone in the Qingchi Palace
cultivates Demon Power,

480
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,360
then I can’t blame you
for losing the gift.

481
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,050
I’ll just confiscate

482
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,400
one immortal sword from each of you.

483
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,050
- Thank you, Your Lordship!
- Thank you, Your Lordship!

484
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,640
Besides,

485
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,400
you two just stay in the mansion
and get recovered.

486
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,480
In a couple of days,

487
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,730
I’ll take you to Lord
Donghua’s birthday banquet.

488
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,330
Yes.

489
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,330
How dare you, Fengran!

490
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,120
I haven’t got even with you
for what you did back then!

491
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,360
There’s a mark of Zijin Mansion
on the Fire Coral.

492
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,160
Just wait and see!

493
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,480
I will make you pay for it!

494
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,090
Wu Xu,

495
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,160
though His Lordship didn’t
ask about the details,

496
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,520
I still feel quite uneasy about it.

497
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,000
Do you think…

498
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,880
I heard it’s been 10,000 years

499
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,050
since God Gu Jun left to find

500
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,240
herbs for her daughter.

501
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,000
I guess

502
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,330
he wouldn’t be interested in going
to Lord Donghua’s birthday banquet.

503
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,480
But there’s another God
in the Qingchi Palace.

504
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,160
If she stands up for that fairy maiden…

505
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,330
Her Spiritual Power

506
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,120
is even weaker than that
of the lowest-level Earth Deities.

507
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,400
She’s got nothing but an empty title!

508
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,000
She and Princess Jingzhao are both
the daughters of the Queen of Heaven.

509
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,120
The latter has been respected by
the Three Realms since she was born.

510
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,280
Yet I heard

511
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,640
that young Goddess was born
with blocked Spiritual Power.

512
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,730
What a poor girl!

513
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,850
Stop talking!

514
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,160
Princess Jingzhao hates it

515
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,730
when people compare her

516
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,520
with the young Goddess
of the Qingchi Palace.

517
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,810
If she finds out,

518
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,240
our entire Zijin Mansion
will be punished!

519
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,880
Qinglian,

520
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,520
I heard that His Majesty

521
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,520
invited the young Goddess
of the Qingchi Palace to come

522
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,760
to the Heavenly Palace and celebrate
the Her Highness’s birthday.

523
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,330
Really?

524
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,610
The guard of the Xuantian Hall told me.

525
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,640
It must be true.

526
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,640
People say that Princess Jingzhao

527
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,400
is the prettiest in the Three Realms.

528
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,000
I wonder how that
young Goddess looks like.

529
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,240
Which one do you think
is more beautiful?

530
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,640
It’s said that the young Goddess
is hideous

531
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,520
and super tall,

532
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,160
but she seldom gets out
of the Qingchi Palace.

533
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,570
I think it’s just a rumor.

534
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,160
Since she and Princess Jingzhao
were born to the same mother,

535
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,000
I’m sure she’s also a stunning beauty!

536
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,810
- Greetings, Your Highness!
- Greetings, Your Highness!

537
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,090
How dare you compare me

538
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,280
with that nothing girl!

539
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,970
(Jingzhao)
Flog them 100 times.

540
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,570
- Your Highness, please spare us!
- Your Highness, please spare us!

541
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,850
- Your Highness, please spare us!
- Your Highness, please spare us!

542
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,730
Whoever dares gossip again will be

543
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,160
banished from the Heavenly Palace

544
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,640
to the Lower Realm forever!

545
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,240
Yes.

546
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,400
Heavenly Father.

547
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,810
Heavenly Mother.

548
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,880
You just punished two
fairy maidens, didn’t you?

549
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,520
How did such a small matter

550
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
reach your ears, Heavenly Father?

551
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,330
As fairy maidens,

552
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,240
they gossip all the time

553
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,970
instead of minding their own business,

554
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,050
so of course I’d punish them.

555
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,810
Jingzhao.

556
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,880
Immortal Cultivation is a tough journey.

557
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,050
They just

558
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,090
gossiped a little bit.

559
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
You could’ve verbally disciplined them.

560
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,240
Why did you have to flog them?

561
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,810
Heavenly Father…

562
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,090
Enough.

563
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,000
Jingzhao,

564
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,520
just listen to your Heavenly Father.

565
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,970
Your Majesty,

566
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
you have something

567
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,640
to tell Jingzhao, don’t you?

568
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,330
In a few days,

569
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,160
it’ll be Lord Donghua’s birthday.

570
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,520
Your eldest brother is on an
inspection tour in the Lower Realm.

571
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,120
I want you and your second brother
to go to the Mount Lookout

572
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,850
on my behalf to celebrate his birthday.

573
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,240
I’m not going.

574
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,640
Why would I go to a

575
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,050
mediocre Lord’s birthday banquet?

576
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,000
Jingzhao!

577
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,520
I heard that your second brother

578
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,810
invited the North Sea Lord
to go with him.

579
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,570
If you are not going,

580
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,850
I’ll send another
immortal official to go.

581
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,000
Okay! Okay!

582
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,050
I’ll go!

583
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,730
I’ll go back and get ready now.

584
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,520
Jingzhao.

585
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,210
I’ll take my leave.

586
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,090
Jingzhao is too

587
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,930
arrogant and bossy.

588
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,610
I’m afraid she’ll get in trouble
in the future because of it.

589
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,970
Jingzhao has been pampered
since she was little,

590
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,090
so she can be a little spoiled.

591
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,880
You don’t have to be too hard on her.

592
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,730
She’s the only Golden Dragon

593
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,050
besides me in this world.

594
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,450
I hope she can be

595
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,970
more mature.

596
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,760
Otherwise, how can she lead
our dragon clan in the future?

597
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,160
Your Majesty,

598
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,090
Jingzhao is still young.

599
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,400
We’ll teach and guide her along the way.

600
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,880
Why do you keep staring at me?

601
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,120
This is the first time you’ve got out

602
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,610
of the palace for all these years.

603
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,810
How come you stay so quiet?

604
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
It’s not even like you.

605
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,280
What’s this?

606
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,930
You tricked me!

607
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,640
So you agreed to come because
you wanted to look for Boxuan.

608
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,050
That’s not true!

609
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,880
I agreed to come because I wanted to
accompany you to the Mount Lookout

610
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,240
and help you punish

611
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,160
that villain Ziyuan.

612
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,090
You are lying!

613
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,160
I begged you so hard yesterday.

614
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
You had already…

615
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,120
Houchi!

616
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,880
I’ll see you at the top
of the Mount Lookout!

617
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,810
This girl!

618
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,850
She actually brought the Spiritual Talisman
that God Gu Jun gave her!

619
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,090
Let’s see how far you can get!

620
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,810
I may as well find an Earth Deity
and ask him first.

621
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,240
Earth Deities know the
Mount Lookout very well.

622
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,760
They may have seen Boxuan before.

623
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,360
Had enough fun?

624
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,210
I just knew that you couldn’t go far.

625
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,240
Yes, enough.

626
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,210
Definitely!

627
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,880
Don’t fly around anymore.

628
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,450
Go to the bamboo cabin on
the back mountain and find Boxuan.

629
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,450
I’ll go meet you there

630
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,730
after I have dealt with Ziyuan.

631
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,850
I heard

632
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,480
that Jingjian will also
be there at the banquet.

633
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,610
Try to stay away from him.

634
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,880
Such an incompetent
won’t be a threat to me.

635
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,450
Don’t forget that I once
defeated his elder brother.

636
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:36,850
Alright.

637
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,400
Don’t worry about me.

638
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,400
Be careful.

639
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,480
Come and take a look!

640
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,400
It’s a once-in-100-year event
in the Immortal Realm.

641
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,610
Don’t miss it!

642
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,610
Miss,

643
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,210
you are too late.

644
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,050
The Pictures of Lords have been bought.

645
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,690
Would you like to check
out my other paintings?

646
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,730
Not right now.

647
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,240
Is there really such an

648
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,730
ugly person in the Immortal Realm?

649
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,240
It’s a picture of the young Goddess in
the Qingchi Palace used to avert evil.

650
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,480
Who is it?

651
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,480
Houchi, the young Goddess
in the Qingchi Palace.

652
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,880
It’s said that she’s ten meters tall

653
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,930
and as strong as a bull.

654
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,210
She may be ugly,

655
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,360
but for the immortals who
are down on their luck,

656
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,610
they often use her picture
to drive away evil from their houses.

657
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,640
It’s very popular!

658
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,850
If you want it,

659
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,520
it’ll only cost you

660
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,050
a low-class Spiritual Bead instead
of a magic treasure.

661
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,880
Who told you that the young
Goddess looks like this?

662
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,690
Her picture has always been like this

663
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,760
for over 10,000 years.

664
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,570
Miss, you look upset.

665
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,730
Have you met
the young Goddess before?

666
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:30,970
Met…

667
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,330
Think about it.

668
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,810
God Gu Jun is dashing and handsome.

669
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,330
So his daughter should be pretty, too!

670
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,240
Sure! Sure!

671
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,360
If you want a female immortal picture,

672
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,850
I have a lot of them.

673
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,570
Look.

674
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,450
This is a picture of Princess Jingzhao,
used for praying for good luck.

675
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,850
Three high-class Spiritual Beads,

676
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,000
and you can have it.

677
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,690
Praying for good luck?

678
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,610
With that ugly face?

679
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,450
Even the young Goddess
is prettier than her!

680
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,640
I don’t want it!

681
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,280
Miss,

682
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,120
I’m just running a small business.

683
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,690
I didn’t mean to offend you!

684
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,360
As an immortal, you should
focus on cultivation

685
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,280
instead of scamming people
with a bunch of garbage.

686
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,120
Your business should be banned!

687
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,760
Miss, here’s the thing.

688
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,360
The stands here are all set up

689
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,160
by the unidentified immortals
of the Lower Realm.

690
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,400
It hasn’t even been 100 years
since we became immortals,

691
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,210
so our Spiritual Power is very weak.

692
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,850
Neither can we go up
to the Mount Lookout

693
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,050
nor become Lord Donghua’s disciples.

694
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,570
We can only sell some small goods

695
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,400
in exchange for magic treasures
to assist the cultivation.

696
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,160
Please have mercy

697
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,280
and don’t ruin my business!

698
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,240
Thank you, Miss.

699
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,640
How dare him draw such
an ugly picture of me?

700
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,810
I’m ten meters tall

701
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:57,810
and as strong as a bull?

702
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,160
That’s nonsense!

703
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,330
And I’m only worth
a low-class Spiritual Bead?

704
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,640
How ignorant they are!

705
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,270
Aside from the second Prince Jingjian

706
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,520
and Princess Jingzhao,
who else will go to

707
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,730
Lord Donghua’s birthday banquet?

708
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,850
Who?

709
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,000
Just spit it out and tell us!

710
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,690
- Tell us!
- Who is it?

711
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,760
Just tell us!

712
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,660
Jingzhao will also be there?

713
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,810
- Who?
- Tell us!

714
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,570
- Who else is coming?
- Tell us!

715
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,160
Qingmu, the North Sea Lord.

716
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,640
Qingmu?

717
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,520
Really?

718
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,850
I heard that the North Sea Lord

719
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,930
has never shown up in public before.

720
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,240
But if it’s possible,

721
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,760
I’d really love to have
a competition with him,

722
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,610
and see if he’s really

723
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,000
as good as the rumor says.

724
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,520
What a big talk!

725
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,330
I…

726
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,280
The North Sea Lord Qingmu has been

727
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,360
the best ever for the recent 1,000 years
among the immortals.

728
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,610
It only took him 1,000 years before
he reached the peak of the Lords.

729
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,450
He defeated all the North Sea demons
with only one single sword strike.

730
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,280
The Heavenly Emperor
has tremendous respect for him

731
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,210
before even meeting him in person,

732
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,970
and has conferred him
the North Sea Star Lord!

733
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,930
Star Lord?!

734
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,360
After he was conferred,

735
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,450
he got many dissenters,

736
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,210
who all went to the North Sea
to challenge him.

737
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,880
And you know what happened next?

738
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,400
What happened next?

739
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,240
- What happened next?
- Tell us!

740
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,850
They were all beaten up like a dog

741
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,760
by Lord Qingmu!

742
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,450
Nonsense!

743
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,810
Even my father spent 10,000 years
cultivating in the

744
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,570
Abyssal Ridge Swamp before he
was conferred Lord.

745
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,640
It’s impossible for one to reach the
peak of Lords after only 1,000 years.

746
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,760
It’s said that the North Sea Lord

747
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,120
is very close to
Their Heavenly Highnesses.

748
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,090
He’s especially admired
by Princess Jingzhao.

749
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,520
Oh!

750
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,280
In my opinion…

751
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,930
It’s a good thing!

752
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,850
…Lord Qingmu

753
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,610
will become His Heavenly
Majesty’s son-in-law!

754
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,570
Admired by Jingzhao,

755
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,880
he’s got to be a dandy
with a hollow fame.

756
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,090
I’ve used all the flying talismans.

757
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,480
High-speed talisman…

758
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,610
Alright. Better than nothing.

759
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,730
Lord Xianshan.

760
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,210
So many immortals have

761
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,400
come to Lord Donghua’s birthday banquet.

762
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,400
It’s Master’s 70,000th birthday,

763
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,880
so we are having a big celebration.

764
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,330
Hope you’ll enjoy yourself, Lord Ziyuan.

765
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:47,360
By the way,

766
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,610
I wonder who the Qingchi Palace

767
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,880
will send here today.

768
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,760
We deliver

769
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,810
an invitation to the
Qingchi Palace every year.

770
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,000
Since God Gu Jun is traveling

771
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,120
and Lord Fengran seldom
gets out of the Palace,

772
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,090
I guess today they’ll

773
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,000
just send someone else here as usual.

774
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,850
Greetings, Your Highness.

775
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,540
(Qingmu Jingjian)

776
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,520
This…

777
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,120
This one must be the North Sea Lord.

778
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,880
Greetings, Your Highness.

779
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,000
North Sea Lord.

780
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,970
Lord Xianshan, don’t mind the formality.

781
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,050
Your Highness, North Sea Lord,
please come inside.

782
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,930
Princess Jingzhao has also just arrived.

783
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,280
She’s appreciating the flowers
right now in the back yard.

784
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,000
Where’s Lord Donghua?

785
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,610
Master is resting in the back hall.

786
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,880
I’ll go say hi to Lord Donghua.

787
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,240
Jingzhao is in the back yard.

788
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,690
You haven’t seen her for years.

789
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,690
She talks about you all the time.

790
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,690
Would you go and be her company?

791
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,280
Jingjian, a word, please.

792
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,090
Please.

793
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,000
Please.

794
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,000
You know

795
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,690
that I don’t talk to strangers.

796
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,880
But you know Jingzhao.

797
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,930
She’s not a stranger.

798
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,280
She’s a girl.

799
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,760
I don’t feel comfortable

800
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,810
when talking to a girl.

801
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,120
In the entire Three Realms,

802
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,730
you are the only one who’d

803
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,880
attach his own Spiritual Strength
to a paperman

804
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,360
so that you can talk to yourself.

805
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,520
What’s wrong with that?

806
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,930
People would think you are a weirdo.

807
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,120
I don’t care what other people think.

808
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,810
Qingmu,

809
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,090
if you always stay alone,

810
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,400
you’ll become withdrawn.

811
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,690
Take my word.

812
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:38,730
Making more friends

813
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:39,730
is good for you.

814
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,050
Having one bosom friend
is enough in life.

815
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,120
I have you already.

816
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,450
Don’t forget

817
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,360
that we played chess
for three rounds before we came.

818
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,970
I even let you retract your moves
yet you still lost the game,

819
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,850
and that’s why you finally
agreed to come with me.

820
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,400
Next time I’ll have a
sword competition with you.

821
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,610
I’m sure I won’t lose to you again.

822
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,160
Alright.

823
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,360
Stop talking.

824
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:57,850
Just go ahead.

825
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,120
Lord Qingmu.

826
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,570
Greetings, Your Highness.

827
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,090
I didn’t expect that you would come

828
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,520
to Lord Donghua’s birthday banquet.

829
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,360
I heard that the Daze Mansion had

830
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,970
the best flower view
in the Immortal Realm.

831
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,160
Since the banquet hasn’t started yet,

832
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,210
how about we take a walk in the yard?

833
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,570
There’s no flower view
in the Heavenly Palace?

834
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,480
Well…

835
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,280
The flower view in
the Heavenly Palace is good,

836
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,850
but no one really appreciates it.

837
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,360
If you don’t wanna walk,

838
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,810
we can just sit here.

839
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,090
That’ll be fine, too.

840
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,280
It’s okay.

841
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,930
Even the talisman bullied me!

842
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,610
So this is the Daze Mansion
where Lord Donghua lives.

843
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,360
It’s such a huge yard.

844
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,240
How am I supposed to get out of here?

845
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,760
I assume that these flowers

846
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:40,610
are rarely seen in your North Sea area.

847
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,330
The North Sea?

848
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
Is it that North Sea Lord Qingmu?

849
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,650
How come this girl looks so familiar?

850
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,090
Have I met her before?

851
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,330
We don’t have flowers
in the North Sea area.

852
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,090
So I’ve never seen flowers like these.

853
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,760
It’s really him!

854
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,200
Nice voice.

855
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,610
But he and Jingzhao
are becoming an item.

856
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,440
Why is he seeing another girl?

857
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,960
I’m being inconsiderate.

858
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,090
The flowers aren’t that
enjoyable after all.

859
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,000
Especially to someone like you
who travels the Three Realms often.

860
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,920
I’m sure you’ve seen
many beautiful views.

861
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,330
A common view like this
must be boring to you.

862
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,440
If it’s possible,

863
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,090
I also want to travel the Three Realms

864
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,760
and enjoy the beautiful views with you.

865
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,440
If Jingzhao finds out that
she’s being cheated on…

866
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,130
I’m used to being alone.

867
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,240
It’s not convenient to take you with me.

868
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,370
Why is this Lord Qingmu

869
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,280
being so cold to her?

870
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,330
Whatever.

871
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,280
It’s none of my business.

872
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,240
I’d better go and keep
looking for Boxuan.

873
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,680
It’ll soon be my Heavenly Mother’s
90,000th birthday.

874
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,410
She’d also love to meet you.

875
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,440
I wonder if you have time

876
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,410
to go to the Heavenly Palace
for her birthday banquet.

877
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,170
So she is Jingzhao!

878
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,410
There’ll be a lot of
guests at the banquet.

879
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,610
I’m sure I won’t be missed.

880
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,610
Moreover,

881
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,000
by that time I should be
having a closed-door training.

882
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,330
I’m afraid I won’t be able to go anyway.

883
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,240
Lord Qingmu, no need to be modest.

884
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,520
Who’s there?

885
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,300
♪Where are you♪

886
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,420
♪Your young face♪

887
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:23,850
Who are you?

888
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,610
I’m sorry.

889
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,680
I’ve got the wrong way.

890
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,520
Stop!

891
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,850
She’s just an ordinary immortal
who eavesdropped a little.

892
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,130
Don’t worry about that.

893
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,520
It’s not that simple.

894
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:35,760
Please go to the banquet first.
I’ll be there soon.

895
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,610
Qingmu!

896
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:06,680
Sorry!

897
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,810
I thought you’d be able to dodge it.

898
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,200
I didn’t know your
Spiritual Power was this weak.

899
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,890
What’s the big deal of being a Lord?

900
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,130
That doesn’t give you the right
to play tricks on others!

901
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,410
I just eavesdropped
a little out of curiosity.

902
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,850
Did you have to insult me like that?

903
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,850
I will pay

904
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,810
for your dress.

905
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,650
Do you think you can afford it?

906
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,410
Then I’ll give you this sword

907
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,240
as compensation.

908
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,090
Is that okay?

909
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,570
This stupid sword made me suffer a lot!

910
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,240
I will let you pay for it!

911
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,200
It’s fine.

912
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,680
My sword is with her.

913
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,130
I can always find her.

914
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,680
Lord Ziyuan,

915
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,480
I heard last month when Prince Jingyang

916
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,240
held the immortal Taoism debate
on Mount Kunlun,

917
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,520
you won the first place again!

918
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,200
You are indeed knowledgeable

919
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,440
and outstanding in the Three Realms!

920
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,130
I’m flattered!

921
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,650
Excuse me,

922
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,330
you need an invitation
to enter the front hall.

923
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,330
Could you please
show me your invitation?

924
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:12,960
I forgot.

925
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,920
Would this be okay?

926
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,680
You definitely deserved it!

927
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,480
It’s my fault!

928
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,130
I didn’t know you are the Lord
of the Qingchi Palace.

929
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:19,850
I’m sorry!

930
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,720
You defeated them all!

931
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,170
Let’s drop it.

932
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,760
But the Qingchi…

933
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,960
Fengran!

934
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,810
As a defeated loser,

935
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,170
don’t you feel ashamed to be here?

936
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,890
A defeated loser?

937
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,960
You hurt me badly with a sneak attack

938
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,000
when I fought with

939
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,810
Jingyang back then.

940
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,130
You…

941
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,680
And you were thick-skinned enough
to tell the entire world

942
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,050
that you defeated me!

943
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,810
How dare you!

944
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,920
Back then, you attempted to assassin

945
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,520
the first Prince for a demon!

946
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,650
If Their Majesties hadn’t

947
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,680
spared you on God Gu Jun’s account,

948
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,720
you would’ve been killed
by the thunder strike!

949
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,130
You should’ve stayed at home and
guarded the Palace for God Gu Jun.

950
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,240
What are you doing here?

951
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,050
Lord Donghua sent us

952
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,370
an invitation for his birthday banquet.

953
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,680
Since God Gu Jun is not available,

954
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,280
as the one who’s assigned
to be in charge,

955
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,850
of course, I should come on his behalf.

956
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,000
What?

957
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,920
Lord Donghua hasn’t even said anything,

958
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,370
who do you think you are

959
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,200
to speak for the Daze Mansion?

960
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,240
- Fengran…
- That’s enough.

961
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,050
Your Highness,

962
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,680
I found a few days ago

963
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,720
that one of us Immortals

964
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,090
actually colluded with the Demons!
