2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,500
You should be watching Qingchi Palace.

4
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,590
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,340
We received an invitation

6
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,590
to this birthday party.

7
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,860
My lord is away.

8
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,710
As the chief of Qingchi Palace,

9
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,260
it’s my courtesy to come with blessings.

10
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,460
What?

11
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,220
Do you, an immortal of Heaven,

12
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,710
want to take the liberty

13
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,470
of throwing me out in front of the host?

14
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,660
What’s wrong with being an immortal?

15
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,980
Let me tell you.

16
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,870
Lord Donghua is also an immortal.

17
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,740
It’s our rightful place

18
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,980
to govern Daze Mansion.

19
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,030
By despising me,

20
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,710
you’re challenging the Heaven.

21
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,950
Are you from Qingchi Palace

22
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,550
all so defiant?

23
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,710
My lord, my lady.

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,270
Please calm down.

25
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,500
Lady Fengran comes with blessings
from Qingchi Palace,

26
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,390
hence an honorable guest.

27
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,270
The presence of Heavenly royals

28
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,430
also proves your appreciation.

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,980
In Lord Donghua’s eyes,

30
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,140
your blessings are equally appreciated

31
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,340
and valued.

32
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,500
Alright.

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,430
Lord Ziyuan,

34
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,980
just a cup of wine for the new guest.

35
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,390
We have to show God Gu Jun, if not her,
the respect.

36
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,100
Your Highness,

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,460
it’s just

38
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,700
something I found

39
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,550
has been bothering me.

40
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,380
I should report it to His Majesty,

41
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,230
but since Your Highness is here,

42
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,350
I’d like to subject it to you.

43
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,460
Lord Ziyuan,

44
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,670
what’s been bothering you?

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,990
Your Highness,

46
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,670
a few days ago, I found

47
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,670
someone among us

48
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,910
colluding with demons.

49
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,630
Who is it?

50
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,820
You mean...?

51
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,910
It is Fengran.

52
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,310
Your Highness,

53
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,670
my friends,

54
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,350
she’s working with demons

55
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,020
on a conspiracy against us.

56
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,780
Guards.

57
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,270
Take Fengran down.

58
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,100
Wait.

59
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,950
Princess Jingzhao,

60
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,230
Qingchi Palace is independent
from the Three Realms,

61
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,350
including the Heaven.

62
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,670
Even the Heavenly Emperor himself

63
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,630
would have to ask before arresting me.

64
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,380
Do you want to skip the questioning?

65
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,420
It’s unreasonable and unfair.

66
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
As you all know,

67
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,270
demons and we are contradictions
of ice and fire.

68
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,500
I cannot turn a deaf ear
to your suspected

69
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,420
collusion with the demons.

70
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,940
It’s my duty to keep our world pure.

71
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,070
Well said.

72
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,460
I indeed came
from Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

73
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,220
But Qingchi Palace severed
my past with demons.

74
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,580
Do you have proofs

75
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,350
of my collusion with demons?

76
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,580
Your Highness,

77
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,940
my friends,

78
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,710
a few days ago, my disciples

79
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,430
were wounded by a demon
in Qingchi Palace

80
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,940
on an errand

81
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,430
to Qilian Mountains.

82
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,190
What’s more, the demon

83
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,710
snatched

84
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,990
a precious Fire Coral, the present

85
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,070
I prepared for Lord Donghua.

86
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,020
As you all know,

87
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,630
God Gu Jun has been traveling far away.

88
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,710
The young heiress is wet
behind the ears.

89
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,430
For the last tens of thousands of years,

90
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,820
the whole Qingchi Palace

91
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,550
follows your lead, right, Fengran?

92
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,990
Now a demon is found in Qingchi Palace.

93
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,910
You tell me.

94
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
Who is the traitor?

95
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,710
Nonsense!

96
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,190
There’s no demon in Qingchi Palace.

97
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,710
Your retort will come to no avail.

98
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,740
Wu Wang.

99
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,660
Yes!

100
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,790
This is the wound left by the demon.

101
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,580
How can you prove the scar

102
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,460
is left by a demon?

103
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,710
Even if you’re right,

104
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,990
how can you prove
its connection with us?

105
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,660
Well, how can you prove your innocence

106
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,630
against my accusation?

107
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,510
This is nothing

108
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,020
but his groundless talking.

109
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,740
Is he fanning hatred?

110
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,820
Fengran,

111
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,510
if Qingchi Palace is independent
from the Three Realms,

112
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,910
you should stay out of our fight
with demons.

113
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,460
I think my father has been merciful

114
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,350
to Qingchi Palace,

115
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,790
which makes your sabotaging collusion
with demons

116
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,990
behind God Gu Jun’s back

117
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,710
more unacceptable.

118
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,550
Merciful?

119
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,710
As existences of equal standing,

120
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,100
when do we require mercy from you?

121
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,660
Jingzhao,

122
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,070
do you plan to bully us

123
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,300
while God Gu Jun is away?

124
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,940
It’s such

125
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,150
a despicable thing to do.

126
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:32,990
This is insolent!

127
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,510
Go back home before you put on airs

128
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,660
as a princess.

129
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,740
Alright.

130
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,380
Fengran,

131
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,550
you deny it, don’t you?

132
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,150
I knew you wouldn’t admit it.

133
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,020
Never mind.

134
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,740
But let me be frank.

135
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,460
I had a tracking mark

136
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,100
on the Fire Coral.

137
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,990
As to whether it is you people

138
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,190
snatched it,

139
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,510
all we need is a test.

140
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,540
See?

141
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,300
Fengran,

142
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,260
what do you say now?

143
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,510
Well,

144
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,300
I’m also here to confront you.

145
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,230
Your disciples stole
from the Spiritual Spring.

146
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,980
The Fire Coral is the evidence.

147
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,300
It just surprises me

148
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,740
you thieves distort the truth.

149
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,950
Lord Ziyuan,

150
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
seize her.

151
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,120
Yes,

152
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,830
Your Highness.

153
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,230
Let me see

154
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,460
if the carefree North Sea Lord

155
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,140
can be wayward anymore.

156
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,510
What is she doing now?

157
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,950
Petty, he straps me to the main hall.

158
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,460
No.

159
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,670
My power is weak.

160
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,110
My presence will add
to Fengran’s trouble.

161
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,830
In case of danger,

162
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,140
fill power in this bracelet

163
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,020
and it’ll greatly ramp up your power.

164
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,700
It won’t last long,

165
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,390
but enough for you to escape.

166
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,860
(Eternal Heaven and Earth)

167
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,140
The Empress’s Phoenix Feather Fan?

168
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,260
Jingzhao,

169
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,830
you have no shame.

170
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,950
People like you

171
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,300
can’t be reasoned.

172
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,190
Years ago, for the sake of a demon,

173
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,860
you almost got my brother killed.

174
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,510
Today with the collusion,

175
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,830
you cannot be spared.

176
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,540
Lord Ziyuan,

177
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,950
seize this woman for me.

178
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,790
Yes, Your Highness.

179
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,190
Princess,

180
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,980
Fengran is the chief of Qingchi Palace.

181
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,700
Even if the collusion is real,

182
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,190
I’m afraid you can only punish her

183
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,300
after it’s reported to God Gu Jun.

184
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,460
God Gu Jun has been traveling
for tens of thousands of years.

185
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,740
It’s related to the demons,

186
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,350
and thus should fall into our hands.

187
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,860
Your Highness.

188
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,790
There is the young goddess.

189
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,700
Xianshan,

190
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,390
you can’t be

191
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,070
talking about that loser
of Qingchi Palace.

192
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,260
I heard she’s even weaker
than mortal priests.

193
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,140
Such immense power.

194
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,140
I find the power familiar.

195
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,020
How could we let a weak girl

196
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,420
make such a big decision?

197
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,980
Hold your defying words

198
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,630
against the goddess of Qingchi Palace.

199
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,980
You’ll be dead soon, so stop blabbing.

200
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,230
Fine.

201
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,420
Let me put an end to your misery.

202
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,630
Why does she become a different girl?

203
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,220
So much like the goddess in my dream.

204
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,070
- Master!
- Master!

205
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,070
Who are you?

206
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,070
How dare you break in Daze Mansion,

207
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,710
hurt an immortal from Heaven

208
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,710
and disturb the birthday party?

209
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,660
Broke in?

210
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,420
Lord Xianshan, look.

211
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,020
(Invitation)

212
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,710
Is this

213
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,470
your master’s writing?

214
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,390
I’m invited.

215
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,030
What do you mean by “broke in”?

216
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,630
Welcome, Lady Deity.

217
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,030
Jingzhao,

218
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,150
you hurt my chief.

219
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,070
But I merely punished an immortal

220
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
of yours.

221
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,190
You are Houchi?

222
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,630
That’s impossible.

223
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,950
Houchi doesn’t have so much strength.

224
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,710
Greetings, Goddess Houchi.

225
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,710
Greetings, Goddess Houchi.

226
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,710
Goddess.

227
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,470
Greetings, Goddess.

228
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,510
You said my power is too weak

229
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,590
to make a decision.

230
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,510
No, no, no.

231
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,540
No, Goddess.

232
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,630
I never said that.

233
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,900
I... I didn’t know you’d come.

234
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,220
Please, for the sake of the Heaven...

235
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,390
The Heaven?

236
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,950
You were accusing

237
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,070
my chief of colluding with demons.

238
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,630
Have you forgotten?

239
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,780
I was talking nonsense.

240
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,830
Nonsense.

241
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,470
Houchi,

242
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,390
Fengran’s collusion has been proved.

243
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,300
Even though in front of you,

244
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,660
I must bring her to trial in Heaven.

245
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,630
Really?

246
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,300
Are you two going to confess?

247
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,220
Or should I explain for you?

248
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,710
Mercy, Lady Deity.

249
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,900
Mercy.

250
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,710
I dare not lie.

251
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,710
He was wounded in Qingchi Palace.

252
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,030
Are you kidding me?

253
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,830
What are you afraid of?

254
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,070
I won’t allow her

255
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,390
to distort the truth.

256
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,340
He wasn’t wounded by a demon.

257
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,830
It’s a kind of magic potion

258
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,390
that transforms wounds.

259
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,590
Qingmu.

260
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,270
You mean...?

261
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,340
The magic potion

262
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,710
is made of scales of Illusion Fish
inhabiting at the bottom of the West Sea.

263
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,900
Apply honey from Feihong flowers on it,

264
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,950
and the wound will change back.

265
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,270
We have the honey in our mansion.

266
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,710
Lord Donghua likes it to go with
tea and desserts.

267
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,710
I’ll send someone to fetch some.

268
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,470
I deceived you.

269
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,830
Mercy.

270
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,420
You two,

271
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,830
be honest with it.

272
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,070
How were you wounded?

273
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,660
It... It was ourselves to be blamed.

274
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,590
These two sneaked into Qingchi Palace

275
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,340
to steal from Spiritual Spring
and was found.

276
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,510
Her Ladyship didn’t punish them

277
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,470
for they’re both young.

278
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,540
Well,

279
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,470
we forgave them for thievery

280
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,070
and they bit back

281
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,100
by framing collusion with demons on us.

282
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,860
Now it seems they

283
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,660
told a lie for fear of being punished

284
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,950
for losing the Fire Coral.

285
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,950
How dare you deceive me!

286
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,340
I’ll kill you.

287
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,390
Don’t be so rush with killing.

288
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,710
Give it back.

289
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,220
Goddess.

290
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,630
It’s no big deal.

291
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,590
If you like it,

292
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,390
keep it.

293
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,190
I have better ones at home.

294
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,100
I was too careless

295
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,630
and fell for their lie.

296
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,150
Please forgive me.

297
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,630
Of course, they are to be punished.

298
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,070
But you ran your mouth on us,

299
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,950
which is more intolerable.

300
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,070
This

301
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,150
is for your defiance of me.

302
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:22,780
This

303
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,780
is for the insult to Qingchi Palace.

304
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,270
And this

305
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,470
is for backstabbing Fengran years ago

306
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,270
at Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

307
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,900
Goddess.

308
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,780
Mercy.

309
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,980
Please, Goddess.

310
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,830
For the sake of Prince Jingyang,

311
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,220
please spare me.

312
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,740
Jingyang?

313
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,220
I almost forgot.

314
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,660
The Princes and Princess
are your supporters.

315
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,070
If I insist on punishing you,

316
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,630
even their father won’t say anything.

317
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,150
Houchi,

318
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,220
don’t insult my father.

319
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,220
Jingjian,

320
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,220
she hurts

321
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,780
me and Ziyuan.

322
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:21,980
Who is this?

323
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,540
Your Highness,

324
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,030
this is Goddess Houchi
of Qingchi Palace.

325
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,660
Oh, Goddess Houchi.

326
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,780
I wonder what Jingzhao and Ziyuan did

327
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,270
that incurs such punishment.

328
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,070
Jingjian.

329
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,100
Prince Jingjian, I’m impressed
by your timing.

330
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,630
While you were not here,

331
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,900
Jingzhao ordered Ziyuan to defame us.

332
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,070
Now when Goddess Houchi

333
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,470
is punishing the despicable man,

334
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,950
you decide to deliver justice.

335
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,950
I...

336
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,710
You misunderstand.

337
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,220
Your first visit coincides
with such a fuss.

338
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,710
As the host,

339
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,630
I apologize for the inconvenience.

340
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,630
Prince Jingjian,

341
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,710
given what Ziyuan did today,

342
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,630
I wonder if it’s necessary

343
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,740
to keep the eternal friendship

344
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,510
between Heaven and Qingchi Palace.

345
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,220
Jingzhao made a reckless mistake.

346
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,660
Ziyuan cannot represent the Heaven.

347
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,100
Please do not misunderstand.

348
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,150
Please ask His Majesty, Prince Jingjian,

349
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,710
what punishment he’ll inflict on Ziyuan

350
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,830
according to the law of the immortals.

351
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,740
Houchi, you...

352
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,540
Rest assured, Goddess.

353
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,660
I’ll report what happened to my father.

354
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,100
Let’s go.

355
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,270
Wait.

356
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,070
I have a matter of grave importance

357
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,070
to ask.

358
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,390
Can we talk in the back of the hall?

359
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,390
No.

360
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,270
Qingmu.

361
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,510
Hurry.

362
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,660
Let’s go to Boxuan’s bamboo hut.

363
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,860
I can’t hold it any longer.

364
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,710
What was going on?

365
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,740
My power...

366
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,220
You again?

367
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,220
Lord Qingmu,

368
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,070
you keep pestering us.

369
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,100
What is your intention?

370
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,830
Lady Fengran,

371
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,030
I mean no harm.

372
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,100
Lord Qingmu,

373
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,390
I didn’t punish you
for your impertinence.

374
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,980
Yet you follow us here.

375
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,590
Goddess Houchi,

376
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,420
I came after you to ask a question.

377
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,100
I lived in solitude in the North Sea
for thousands of years.

378
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,710
I don’t remember meeting you.

379
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,300
But why did I find you familiar

380
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,830
when I met you?

381
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:10,950
Pervert!

382
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,830
Will you stop it?

383
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,980
I just want to figure out why.

384
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,950
This is ridiculous.

385
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,830
How could I know why you had

386
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,710
that feeling for me?

387
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,980
Alright.

388
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,980
What about my sword then?

389
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,710
I smashed it into powder.

390
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,340
Wasn’t it burnt?

391
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,420
Yes, so what?

392
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,950
You may not know.

393
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,220
But that sword is a precious

394
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,540
object to me.

395
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,150
However precious it is,

396
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,710
it’s nothing but a sword.

397
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,340
I will forget

398
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,630
that you offended me.

399
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,900
Don’t push your luck.

400
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,860
Stop following us.

401
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,390
What is it that you want?

402
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,100
I just want to take my sword back.

403
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,780
I think I get your point.

404
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,030
Lord Qingmu,

405
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,100
these pearls can buy you a good sword.

406
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,830
I just want mine.

407
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,740
You’re being utterly absurd.

408
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,150
Your power...

409
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,460
Houchi, what’s wrong with you?

410
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:12,960
Fengran,

411
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,630
let’s go.

412
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,900
What was going on?

413
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,270
Nothing. I’m fine.

414
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,190
It just hit my nerve a bit.

415
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,190
I saw Ziyuan was going to harm you.

416
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,950
It was urgent.

417
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,590
So I used this bracelet.

418
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,420
But you’re even weaker
than magical beasts.

419
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,590
How did the bracelet help you push off
the Phoenix Feather Fan?

420
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,630
Besides,

421
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,540
Boxuan is just an ordinary immortal.

422
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,150
Where did he get
such a powerful halidom?

423
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,540
According to Boxuan,

424
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,950
the bracelet can greatly
ramp up my power.

425
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,860
It was the first time I used it.

426
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,710
In merely a quarter,

427
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,900
I begin to feel overwhelmed.

428
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,010
It’s true

429
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,740
that no pain, no gain.

430
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:58,860
By the way,

431
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,220
why is North Sea Lord

432
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,660
pestering you?

433
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,300
He drove a flying sword after me

434
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,220
and slashed my robe.

435
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,270
I was so angry

436
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,660
and burnt his sword to ashes.

437
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,300
Lord Ziyuan,

438
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,420
you’re an immortal from Heaven.

439
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,150
My father doesn’t even punish you.

440
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,190
Why are you still on your knees?

441
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,100
Get up.

442
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,980
Common trick.

443
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,860
Jingzhao, no!

444
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,110
The Lord of Thunder must be so bold

445
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,500
to strike Daze Mansion at this moment.

446
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,070
Those idiots.

447
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,230
It was you?

448
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,500
I cast a restriction

449
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
on Ziyuan.

450
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,070
The first to break it by force

451
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,260
will be struck by lightning.

452
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,230
You did it on purpose, didn’t you?

453
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,500
Who else in the hall except for Jingzhao

454
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,420
would be the first to try

455
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,750
to lift the restriction?

456
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,230
She attacked you behind your back.

457
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,830
How could I let her go unpunished?

458
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,590
Right now, I find

459
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,990
being a goddess is handy.

460
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,260
Well, you’re the most

461
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,870
loyal friend.

462
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,070
I gained some strength.

463
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,260
Let’s go find Boxuan.

464
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,190
Come on.

465
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,750
Jingjian.

466
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,900
Jingzhao, are...?

467
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,950
Are you alright?

468
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,750
The young heiress
does have immense power

469
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,660
to activate lightning by restriction.

470
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,110
Lord Donghua,

471
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,750
Jingzhao is young and wayward.

472
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,830
I apologize

473
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,950
for her imperti...

474
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,950
Princess Jingzhao
is just straightforward.

475
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,070
Never mind.

476
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,500
Lord Donghua,

477
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,380
my power is weak.

478
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,110
Would you please free him?

479
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,710
You can’t break it, either?

480
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,260
Sure I can break it.

481
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,470
But Goddess Houchi

482
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,190
cast a strong restriction.

483
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,830
Given my power,

484
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,710
if I break it by force,

485
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,230
I’m afraid I can only keep half

486
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,140
of Lord Ziyuan’s current power.

487
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,750
You’re one of
the most powerful immortals.

488
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,190
If you can only keep

489
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,660
half of his power,

490
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,830
no one could do better.

491
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,590
I have to bring Ziyuan to trial

492
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,190
by my father.

493
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,500
Please help us break the restriction.

494
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,350
Alright.

495
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,350
- Master!
- Master!

496
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,900
Lord Donghua,

497
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,260
with such an emergency,

498
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,660
I cannot stay.

499
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,750
I’ll take Ziyuan

500
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,500
back to Heaven now.

501
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,380
Hold on.

502
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,260
I have a question,

503
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,830
if you may give me the answer.

504
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,470
Yes, please.

505
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,990
I never met North Sea Lord before.

506
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,470
How did you get to know him?

507
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,070
Qingmu and I once subdued

508
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,590
a demonic beast in the North Sea.

509
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,710
We often compete and exchange views.

510
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,750
Gradually, we become friends.

511
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,990
Does he have any family or friends?

512
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,590
Qingmu has no parents

513
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
and lives in solitude.

514
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,070
I don’t know he has friends.

515
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:00,990
It seems

516
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
you’re particularly interested in him.

517
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,590
Not really.

518
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,660
I just think

519
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,950
he’s great as a young man

520
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,230
and want to know more.

521
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,830
You should head back to the Heaven.

522
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,990
Do visit Mount Lookout on another day.

523
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,590
We’ll have a hearty drink then.

524
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,710
Good-bye then.

525
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,750
Master.

526
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,260
What’s on your mind?

527
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,070
The young heiress of Qingchi Palace
and North Sea Lord

528
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,140
remind me of some old acquaintances.

529
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,750
Do you find the young heiress

530
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,070
resembles God Gu Jun a lot?

531
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,900
No.

532
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,470
She’s more like someone else.

533
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,990
Well, what about North Sea Lord?

534
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,900
It’s a big area back here. We still

535
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,070
couldn’t find the bamboo hut.

536
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,990
Didn’t you and Boxuan often come here?

537
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,070
Boxuan flew us here each time.

538
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,230
As for the exact location,

539
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,590
I have no idea.

540
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,710
This is too slow.

541
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,590
I’ll go up and look around.

542
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,260
Wait here for me.

543
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,750
Why is there the swish of swords?

544
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,620
This is...

545
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,260
Why is there a massive grave of swords?

546
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,140
You again?

547
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,900
I saved your life just now.

548
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,870
Shouldn’t you be grateful?

549
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,110
You want me to be grateful?

550
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,630
Alright.

551
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,950
Thank you for saving my life.

552
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:32,950
I appreciate it

553
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,990
and will repay your favor
on another day.

554
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,070
Happy?

555
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:37,990
No.

556
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,990
What do you want?

557
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,870
I had been wondering

558
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,540
why you look so familiar.

559
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,870
Now it seems

560
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,260
I found the answer.

561
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,420
Do you want to tell me

562
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,750
it’s fate?

563
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,540
Do you feel the same?

564
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,830
What you said and did

565
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,710
only convince me

566
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,110
that you’re a shameless man.

567
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,990
Except for that, I can feel nothing.

568
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,500
For so many years,

569
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,350
you’re the only one

570
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,830
who can see the grave except for me.

571
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,990
It’s the same old cliché, right?

572
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,470
The grave is huge.

573
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,710
Everyone can see it.

574
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,830
You’re hilarious.

575
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,660
I’m honest.

576
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,350
At the first time, I found this place,

577
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,500
Jingjian was right beside me.

578
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,500
But he couldn’t even hear the swish.

579
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,660
Perhaps it’s some sort of restriction

580
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,780
that only destined ones can see.

581
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,140
You said it yourself.

582
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,020
Only destined ones can see it.

583
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,470
We’re destined to be together.

584
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,990
I mean I’m destined to come here,

585
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,990
not to be together with you.

586
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,110
So quit following me.

587
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,230
I shouldn’t have driven a sword
after her.

588
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,260
My image is damaged forever.

589
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,620
I was gone for a while.

590
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,710
Where have you been?

591
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,660
Don’t bring it up.

592
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,470
Lord Qingmu is haunting like a ghost.

593
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,350
He isn’t so annoying to me.

594
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,660
Why do you dislike him so much?

595
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,190
He’s Jingzhao’s Prince Charming.

596
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,110
I don’t want anything to do with

597
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,660
anyone related to Jingzhao.

598
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,300
By the way,

599
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,110
I found the bamboo hut.

600
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,780
Let’s go.

601
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,870
Looks like it’s been deserted
for a while.

602
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,160
Come.

603
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,710
Let’s get in.

604
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,660
Maybe there are signs of someone
boarding here.

605
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,380
I didn’t know

606
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,500
there is such a hut on Mount Lookout.

607
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,950
Who is Boxuan?

608
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,900
She’s here for that man.

609
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,300
Would Boxuan have been cultivating
through his tribulation here?

610
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,260
This is the only place I know

611
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,350
where Boxuan has been
except for Qingchi Palace.

612
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,070
If he’s not here,

613
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,500
where could he be?

614
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,540
Someone was drunk here.

615
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,950
In regardless,

616
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,590
there are signs of someone living here.

617
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,470
Never saw Boxuan used this fan.

618
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:24,950
Watch out.

619
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,070
Are you alright, Houchi?

620
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:29,710
Yes, I’m fine.

621
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,870
Purple Moon Fan.

622
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,780
Do you know this fan?

623
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,830
This is Demon Lord Ziyue’s halidom.

624
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,660
Demon Lord Ziyue?

625
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,780
Who is he?

626
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,870
He’s the most mysterious demon lord
in the Three Realms.

627
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,870
And he’s as powerful as the Demon King.

628
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,750
Ziyue is a mysterious man

629
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,070
in the Demon Region.

630
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,950
He helps them with their cultivation.

631
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,830
Therefore, many respect and admire him.

632
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,260
By naming himself after the Purple Moon,

633
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,950
he must relate to it somehow.

634
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,950
That I don’t know.

635
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,190
But I heard he wears a mask
all year long.

636
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,710
No one knows how he looks.

637
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,990
He wears a mask all year long?

638
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,420
Could he be...?

639
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,380
You mean

640
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,870
the Demon Lord is Boxuan?

641
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,620
Boxuan never took off his mask
in Qingchi Palace.

642
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,140
But Boxuan practices for immortal power.

643
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,380
No.

644
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,990
It doesn’t make sense.

645
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,260
They have a lot in common.

646
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,660
Demon Lord Ziyue is a mystery.

647
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,900
So is Boxuan.

648
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,300
Fengran,

649
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,420
I don’t know

650
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,660
where else

651
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,830
we can find Boxuan

652
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,990
except here.

653
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,990
Why don’t we go visit

654
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,500
Demon Lord Ziyue?

655
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,190
After all, the fan he left here

656
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,380
points out a direction.

657
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,020
I must find Boxuan.

658
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,540
I want to know if he’s safe.

659
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,540
Alright.

660
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,470
I’ll go with you.

661
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,590
Come.

662
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,070
For his violation

663
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,230
of Heavenly laws,

664
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,110
Lord Ziyuan

665
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,110
will be banished to the mortal world

666
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,750
and never become immortal again.

667
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,900
No!

668
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,110
Your Majesty,

669
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,110
please spare me this once.

670
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,420
I’m sorry, Your Majesty.

671
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,380
For the sake of

672
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:12,990
my service

673
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,070
in the last years,

674
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,140
please forgive me.

675
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,750
You framed the leader
of Qingchi Palace up

676
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,710
and offended their goddess.

677
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,500
That almost ruins

678
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,190
our eternal friendship
with Qingchi Palace.

679
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,470
How could I keep you around?

680
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,350
Guards!

681
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,110
Take Ziyuan away!

682
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,470
Your Majesty!

683
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,500
Your Majesty!

684
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,420
Prince Jingyang!

685
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,380
Prince Jingyang, help me!

686
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,900
Your Highness, speak for me!

687
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:39,710
Prince Jingyang!

688
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,350
Father...

689
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,420
- Jingyang.
- I saved your life!

690
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,780
- Prince Jingyang!
- Step back.

691
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,540
Speak for me!

692
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,620
Your Highness!

693
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,260
His Majesty issued a Heavenly Edict.

694
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,470
He’s really flared up.

695
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,620
Ziyuan has always been unbridled.

696
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,540
Now he’s the victim
of his own evil deeds.

697
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,160
Jingyang.

698
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,070
Father,

699
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,870
I just want to ask one thing.

700
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,870
Houchi insulted us in Daze Mansion,

701
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,780
yet you punished Ziyuan.

702
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,750
Aren’t you fanning her arrogance

703
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,870
and deflating ourselves?

704
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,230
If it goes on,

705
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,620
how can we lead the Three Realms?

706
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,830
Why don’t you get it?

707
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,590
Ziyuan provoked Jingzhao’s conflict
with Houchi,

708
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,620
which nearly evolves into a conflict
with Qingchi Palace.

709
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,620
The punishment

710
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,420
is merciful.

711
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,540
But Houchi hurt Jingzhao.

712
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,140
Why didn’t you say anything about it?

713
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,870
Jingzhao hurt Fengran, didn’t she?

714
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,900
Father,

715
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
Jingyang is just upset

716
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,620
that I was hurt.

717
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,470
Jingyang,

718
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,230
it’s written in the law

719
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,470
that no gods or goddesses
should be offended.

720
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,070
We’re in the wrong.

721
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,110
So don’t make Father angry.

722
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,380
Whose side are you on?

723
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,070
Ziyuan saved my life.

724
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,070
Your judge is fair and just,

725
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,830
which will win your compliments.

726
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,420
I’m just wondering what the fighting men

727
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,780
in the Demon Region see of this?

728
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,020
The Heaven

729
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,420
won’t even protect

730
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,620
the eldest prince’s savior.

731
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,350
If such a rumor spreads out,

732
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,780
I’m afraid no one will fight for us.

733
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,300
Insolent boy!

734
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:27,950
Guards!

735
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,380
- Yes!
- Yes!

736
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,300
Make Jingyang kneel three days
outside the Heavenly Hall.

737
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,950
Let the immortals see

738
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,140
how he bends the law for selfish deeds.

739
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

740
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,590
Hold on.

741
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,830
You’re unbelievable.

742
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,830
This is not the general assembly.

743
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,590
Why cut up rough about our son?

744
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,750
Jingyang is a loyal friend and brother.

745
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,780
His friend is punished

746
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,300
and his sister hurt.

747
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,470
He couldn’t swallow the insult

748
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,500
and made a mistake.

749
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,780
When he comes around,

750
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,870
he will put

751
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,830
the general interest first.

752
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,380
Father,

753
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,020
Jingyang has been in the garrison
in Demon Region for long.

754
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,300
He might catch up with something
from soldiers.

755
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,990
Please don’t be angry with him.

756
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,950
Father,

757
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,830
don’t blame my brother.

758
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,590
He’s defending
the interest of the Heaven.

759
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,590
Do you know why you’re wrong?

760
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,710
Jingyang…

761
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,070
I’m sure he does.

762
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,500
Go back to your hall.

763
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,870
Stay in unless

764
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,470
I command otherwise.

765
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,020
Yes, Father.

766
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,020
This massive pillar
has been standing here

767
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,470
guarding the barrier dividing immortals
and demons

768
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,020
since the Human Realm came into being.

769
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,990
It can sense the power of every being

770
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,620
and rank them.

771
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,750
It seems

772
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,750
my name isn’t on it.

773
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,950
It’s not accurate.

774
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,300
Just in rumors.

775
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,260
The Demon Lord Ziyue is famous.

776
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,110
We don’t see his name on it, either,
do we?

777
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,540
(Qingmu)

778
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,020
Did you follow us?

779
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,190
I wouldn’t say that.

780
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,710
I’m just passing by.

781
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,510
Lady Fengran.

782
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,310
Houchi.

783
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,190
Are you alright?

784
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,100
Yes, I’m fine.

785
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,340
Thank you.

786
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,190
Where did you get the bracelet?

787
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,860
That’s what I have been wanting to ask.

788
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:31,820
Our bracelets

789
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,620
were made by one person.

790
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,820
Do you know an immortal named Boxuan?

791
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,550
Is he the man you’re looking for?

792
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,060
Who is he to you?

793
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,790
Do you know him?

794
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,340
No.

795
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,820
Did you lie to me again?

796
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,340
No, I didn’t.

797
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,790
Are you alright?

798
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,470
Lord Qingmu,

799
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,060
what can we do to make you
stop following us?

800
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,310
Lady Fengran,

801
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,060
what can I do to make you allow me
to go along?

802
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,100
That’s impossible,

803
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,190
unless I’m not around.

804
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:01,820
Sorry.

805
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,270
Oh no.

806
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,820
If we don’t go through together,

807
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,190
we’ll end up in different locations.

808
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,270
You’ll go

809
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,580
all extremes to reach your goal.

810
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,580
I’m not that kind of person.

811
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,510
I really want to know the man

812
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,820
who gave you the bracelet,

813
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:55,950
Boxuan.

814
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,100
For your temperament,

815
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:58,790
I don’t want you to come along.

816
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,580
The Red Blood Forest is the most
dangerous place in the Demon Region.

817
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,140
Without me,

818
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,380
how are you going
to find Demon Lord Ziyue?

819
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,820
You eavesdropped on me and Fengran?

820
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:09,990
Shameless.

821
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,550
You’re waiting for her?

822
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,620
Don’t you know

823
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,580
if you don’t go through
the barrier together,

824
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,030
you won’t land at the same spot?

825
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,580
She isn’t here yet.

826
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,950
Maybe she’s not coming.

827
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,860
You intentionally separated me
and Fengran.

828
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,820
I had no choices.

829
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,710
Young heiress,

830
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,420
don’t you feel

831
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,100
anything different when you see me?

832
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:29,990
Yes.

833
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,580
Do you find me familiar?

834
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,820
With a medicine.

835
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,340
What do you mean?

836
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,620
A clingy patch.

837
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,100
You were good-mannered

838
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,190
in front of Jingzhao.

839
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,190
Why do you keep blabbing

840
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,060
shamelessly with me?

841
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,470
I don’t speak to female immortals.

842
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,900
But I don’t know why

843
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,030
I’m so interested in you.

844
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,340
How unfortunate!

845
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,950
Whatever you say.

846
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,990
But if we find Boxuan

847
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,790
who proves that we’re not destined,

848
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,510
I will apologize to you

849
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,470
for

850
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,420
offending you.

851
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,990
We don’t need Boxuan.

852
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,270
I can prove that we’re not.

853
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,660
The road is wide.

854
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,750
You go that way.

855
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,790
And I go this way.

856
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,270
Are you convinced I’m not a good man

857
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,270
no matter what I do?

858
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,420
Alright.

859
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,380
No more concerns.

860
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,820
Abyssal Ridge Swamp?

861
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,950
I’m back home.

862
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,660
No.

863
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,710
It’s too far from the third heaven

864
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,190
where Demon Lord Ziyue lives.

865
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,580
I have to find Houchi
as soon as possible.

866
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,750
Are you looking for me?

867
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,100
If you allow me

868
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,620
to come along,

869
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,660
I’ll get you out.

870
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,060
How is that?

871
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,860
It seems your bracelet

872
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,100
can’t protect you every time.

873
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,340
Crisp skin and tender flesh,

874
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,580
which is the most tasty.

875
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:27,900
I’m sorry

876
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,060
for just now.
