00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,800
Gather your original being
and break the three realms.

4
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,600
Over these years,

5
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,000
who has been helping me

6
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,440
whenever I was in danger?

7
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,630
Bai Jue once said

8
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,520
the scariest thing
about the Devilish Energy

9
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,080
is that it will attach onto the wound

10
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,960
and gradually erode spiritual power.

11
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,550
It has to be pushed out immediately,

12
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,670
otherwise it will
endanger the foundation.

13
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,670
But,

14
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,880
in the vast Nether World,

15
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,950
I haven’t seen any of

16
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,880
the herbs he mentioned before.

17
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,920
This glossy ganoderma is quite big.

18
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,270
It looks older than
those in the God Realm.

19
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,270
I guess it might work.

20
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,230
Ancestral Sword.

21
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,110
I didn’t know you could do that.

22
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,040
You were wasted in the God Realm.

23
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,000
With you accompanying me
in the Nether World,

24
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,790
I don’t need to worry anymore.

25
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,720
This is the Devil Ganoderma
in the Nether World.

26
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,230
If you take it,

27
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,550
you might have typhoid fever,
or even fall into a coma.

28
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,600
This is all you learned from me.

29
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,110
What I taught you is totally wasted.

what they are doing right now.

Yuemi

35
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,350
must have invited a god
to tell her stories.

36
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,110
What story is she listening to today?

37
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,880
I don’t know if I heard it before.

38
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,510
Ancestral Sword.

39
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,320
It must be the orchid
you told me to pick.

40
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,760
After I took it,

41
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,270
I haven’t got better at all.

42
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,320

After you inherit Chief God’s

72
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,950
I will tell you

everything on my mind.

74
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,200
Yuemi, come out!

75
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,510
You’ve been following me
all the way here.

76
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,920
I didn’t do it on purpose.

77
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,070
I wanted to go to the Nether World
to do the same thing as you.

78
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,350
But after hearing what Zhiyang said,

79
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,640
I had to come back.

80
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,000
There is only one way back
to the God Realm.

81
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,830
You can’t say
that I followed you on purpose.

82
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,510
Back to the God Realm?

83
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,480
This is Taichu Hall!

84
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,550
What a lousy excuse!

85
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,950
All right, stop there.

86
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
I’m not feeling that bad.

87
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,830
You are lying.

88
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,760
You can’t look someone in the eye

89
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,040
when you are lying.

90
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,350
You...!

91
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,230
All right.

92
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,160
I want Shanggu to ascend
the throne as soon as possible.

93
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,790
But I really can’t bear to see her
suffer in the Nether World.

94
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,040
Yeah.

95
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,720
Of course we can’t.

96
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,320
Now she is in the Nether World.

97
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,760
If she gets hurt,

98
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,880
or if anything happens to her...

99
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,400
You...

100
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,910
She is more courageous than both of us.

101
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,350
Maybe she became matured long ago.

102
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,350
It’s just that we can’t let her go.

103
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,840
I blame myself for being incompetent.

104
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,640
Tianqi.

105
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,840
Master.

106
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,320
Master Tianqi.

107
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,710
Why are you so happy?

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,670
Master.

109
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,550
I’ve understood the fourth stage
of Six Moves of Extreme Yin.

110
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,320
That’s why you are so happy?

111
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,960
Gu Jun is already a god now.

112
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,960
Master.

113
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,590
Since I came to the God Realm,

114
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,640
I never slacked off

115
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
and I have been practicing every day.

116
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,080
Why did you take it out
on my apprentice?

117
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,760
He can’t even take one punch.

118
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,320
What a loser.

119
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,470
I’m fine.

120
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,400
Master Tianqi is enlightening me.

121
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,350
I’m glad you have some wisdom.

122
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,840
Go ahead.

123
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,350
Yes.

124
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,080
What a muddled

125
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,840
master you are!

126
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,470
No wonder he is
making progress so slowly.

127
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,760
I saw blood stasis in his vessels.

128
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,910
So I got them through for him.

129
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,590
I...

130
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,350
What?

131
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,710
Get inside and have a drink.

132
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,440
Wait for me.

133
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,460
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

134
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,880
Her Grace went to cultivate herself

135
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,910
for one thousand years.

136
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,910
Those Attendant Gods are talkative.

137
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,230
They are jealous of me

138
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,350
because they think Her Grace favors me.

139
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,710
What should I do

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,110
if they won’t listen to me?

141
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,350
I got used to being alone

142
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,590
when I was in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

143
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,710
I don’t have much experience

144
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,910
in interpersonal relationship.

145
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,670
Gu Jun! Wu Huan!

146
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,200
My spiritual power has improved again.

147
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,880
How about having a friendly competition?

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,880
You came just right.

149
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,670
Wu Huan, Muguang has many siblings
and he led troops before.

150
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,590
He must know how to handle it.

151
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,880
What’s the matter?

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,880
After Master left,

153
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Wu Huan worries

154
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,960
that those Attendant Gods
won’t listen to her.

155
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,030
Those people never liked me.

156
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,230
But because Her Grace favors me,

157
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,710
they dare not show it.

158
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,840
But right now...

159
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,350
Actually, it’s the time for you

160
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,790
to establish your prestige
while Her Grace is away.

161
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,790
Establish my prestige?

162
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,320
It’s good already not to be bullied.

163
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,710
Although you are
the Divine Beast of Her Grace,

164
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,590
when Her Grace is here,

165
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,960
you are also an Attendant God
just like them.

166
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,000
Now Her Grace left,

167
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,670
and you are the most powerful person
in the Pilgrimage Hall.

168
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,030
Pick those who are kind and obedient

169
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,280
as your people.

170
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,000
As for those who don’t listen to you,

171
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,350
don’t be afraid to punish them

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
when they make any mistake.

173
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,230
Then give them some favors.

174
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,590
It won’t take long

175
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,880
before they obey you.

176
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,000
It’s the carrot and stick approach?

177
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,910
Yes.

178
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,030
The way to lead troops is nothing
more than to put yourself in their shoes

179
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,790
and employ both kindness and severity.

180
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,470
It’s easy to talk.

181
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,910
What if those disobedient attendants

182
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,200
get more aggressive

183
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,080
and start to bully me?

184
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,000
Don’t worry about that.

185
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,000
You got me.

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,550
I’ll beat anyone who dares to bully you.

187
00:11:59,230 --> 00:11:59,960
Okay.

188
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,440
Then I’ll try it.

189
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,110
I’ll manage

190
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,590
the Pilgrimage Hall well

191
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,000
for the next one thousand years.

192
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,910
I won’t fail Her Grace’s trust.

193
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,710
You can do it.

194
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,960
By the way,

195
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,470
did you just say
that your spiritual power had improved?

196
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,230
Master Tianqi helped me with it.

197
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,470
Let’s try it?

198
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,200
Okay, you two go ahead

199
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,030
and bring out the best in each other.

200
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,640
I’ll make some tea for you.

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,710
Thank you.

202
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,550
Thank you.

203
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,790
You are ordered
to guard the Nether World.

204
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,320
But you are negligent of your duties.

205
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,520
You are committing a crime.

206
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,200
It’s you.

207
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,520
You’ve been reduced to this place.

208
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,590
Stop pulling rank on us.

209
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,470
How dare you!

210
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,710
I’m the god in charge of
the four seasons of the lower realm.

211
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,550
If you dare say that again,

212
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,030
I’ll tell on you to the God Realm.

213
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,110
Cut it out.

214
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,230
Everyone knows that you were
banished from the God Realm.

215
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,350
Anyone who is demoted
to guard the Nether World

216
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,110
won’t have a chance to go back.

217
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,080
If you have time to bicker with me,

218
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,030
you’d better find a place
and take some rest.

219
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,910
Shanggu.

220
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,350
I’ll go back fair and square

221
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,350
and make you pay for it.

Such powerful spiritual power.

256
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,070
That’s God Gu Jun.

257
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,590
He was selected by True God Shanggu

258
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,400
for cultivation in the Pilgrimage Hall.

259
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,640
He has a graceful figure indeed.

260
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,830
I wish I could also be selected
at the God-selecting Meeting

261
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,190
to cultivate myself
in the Pilgrimage Hall this time.

262
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,680
Look how lazy you are.

263
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,280
You still want to
enter the Pilgrimage Hall?

264
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,680
Maybe next life.

265
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,950
Thank you, Master.

266
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,400
Good, you’ve improved a lot.

267
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,400
Muguang has been a god for years.

268
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,470
I just promoted him to
one of the twelve apostles.

269
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,640
So he can help me share
my work in the Three Realms.

270
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,760
Be patient and cultivate yourself.

271
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,470
Don’t let your master down.

272
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,880
Yes.

273
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,040
Muguang’s willpower
is much stronger than mine.

274
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,470
Over these years,

275
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,920
whenever I asked him to
play dominoes or cards with me,

276
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,350
he always rejected me.

277
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,520
He never indulges in fun.

278
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,520
By the way,

279
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,160
why did you come here?

280
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,920
You are not here
just to coach Muguang, right?

281
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,160
The gift for your 100,000th birthday.

282
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,400
It’s a few days later.

283
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,640
I can’t wait.

284
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,710
Thanks.

285
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,920
By the way, there is some good news.

286
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,040
What is it?

287
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,710
The air of chaos in the lower realm
is increasing day by day.

288
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,350
Zhiyang and I guess

289
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,070
Shanggu is coming back soon.

290
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,520
That’s great!

291
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,920
Master.

292
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,640
I want to tell the good news to Gu Jun.

293
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,640
Just Gu Jun?

294
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,400
No Wu Huan?

295
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,830
Master,

296
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,760
I’m leaving.

297
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,400
When did it happen
between him and Wu Huan?

298
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,760
He is quite like me in this regard.

299
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,000
Nothing really started yet.

300
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,000
Come on, let me take you
to the warehouse.

301
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,160
I’m going to show Shanggu

302
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,590
all the good stuff

303
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,920
I’ve collected over these years.

304
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,470
No, wait. you have to come with me
to Taichu Hall.

305
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,880
There is one thing I need you to do.

306
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,590
Yeah.

307
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,520
Goddess.

308
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,560
The Dragon King of the East Sea

309
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,160
sent a pair of aquamarine pearls
in person yesterday.

310
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,710
He said it was a gift
for your birthday one month later.

311
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,520
Goddess, you are in charge of
the Pilgrimage Hall now

312
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
and are favored by
the True Gods Zhiyang and Tianqi.

313
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,110
Not to mention the Immortal Realm
and the Demon Realm,

314
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,560
even those from the God Realm

315
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,280
want to please you.

316
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,160
Exactly.

317
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,920
You are the head of Pilgrimage Hall now.

318
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,880
Of course your birthday banquet will be
bigger than that in the Moon House.

319
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,040
Don’t be disrespectful.

320
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,800
How can my birthday banquet

321
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,110
be compared with
Goddess Yuemi’s birthday banquet?

322
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,350
Who just broke the Chihe Jade?

323
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,400
Staying silent?

324
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,400
I’m in in charge of the Pilgrimage Hall
by Her Grace’s order.

325
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,110
Every object here
is the treasure of Her Grace.

326
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,590
You know my rules.

327
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,280
If you cover for each other
and don’t tell me who did it,

328
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,920
you will all get out of the God Realm.

329
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,640
Goddess Wu Huan, please calm your anger.

330
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,160
What’s wrong? What happened?

331
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,800
Someone broke Her Grace’s Chihe Jade.

332
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,040
I’m disciplining them.

333
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,640
It’s just a piece of jade.

334
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,590
Admonishing them is enough.

335
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,280
There is no need to be so angry.

336
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The Pilgrimage Hall is a place of honor
in the Three Realms.

337
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,880
The outsiders will laugh at us

338
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,590
if I don’t rule here strictly.

339
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,920
It’s not a big deal.

340
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,560
Just a piece of jade.

341
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,040
If Master is fond of it,

342
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,110
just tell them to be more careful later.

343
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,280
That’s Her Grace’s beloved object.

344
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,520
Of course I need to
discipline them strictly.

345
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,040
I’ll let you go this time.

346
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,160
Leave us.

347
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,400
Thank you, Goddess.

348
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,280
Wu Huan, you punish
the Attendant Gods too often

349
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,830
and it’s not good for the reputation
of the Pilgrimage Hall.

350
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,040
You got more irritable

351
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,520
after Master left.

352
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,000
Her Grace is not here.

353
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,040
I don’t know what to do.

354
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,920
I just want to

355
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,280
manage the Pilgrimage Hall well

356
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,710
and not let Her Grace down.

357
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,520
I know your intention.

358
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,110
But don’t go too hard on yourself.

359
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,310
I know.

360
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,470
Didn’t you go to inspect
the Three Realms

361
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,640
by the order of God Zhiyang?

362
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,920
How come you’re back
in less than a month?

363
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,040
There is great news in the God Realm.

364
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,710
I told him to come back earlier.

365
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,310
Right.

366
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,310
Goddess Yuemi’s
100,000th birthday banquet

367
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,920
is a few days later.

368
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,800
You should come back
to celebrate her birthday.

369
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,520
Master is coming back soon.

370
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,760
What did you say?

371
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,230
A month ago,

372
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
the mountains and seas
moved frequently in the lower realm.

373
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,950
Master Zhiyang guessed

374
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,590
that Her Grace must have
obtained the Power of Chaos

375
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,000
and she is coming back
to the God Realm soon.

376
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,640
That’s why there were
all those strange signs.

377
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,760
That’s right. I went there
to take a look with Gu Jun.

378
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,920
There was Power of Chaos flowing over
the barriers in the lower realm.

379
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,880
Masters guess

380
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,760
that True God Shanggu will be back soon.

381
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,430
Wu Huan. Wu Huan?

382
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,830
What’s wrong?

383
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,350
Her Grace is finally coming back.

384
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,800
I’m...

385
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,110
I’m so happy.

386
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,160
You’ve worked hard to manage
the Pilgrimage Hall over these years.

387
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,520
After Master comes back,

388
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,800
I’ll help you cultivate
your spiritual power.

389
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,430
Shanggu.

390
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,470
Long time no see. I really miss you.

391
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,800
No.

392
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,310
That’s too casual.

393
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,310
It’s not serious enough.

394
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,680
Rewrite it.

395
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,640
No, no.

396
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,830
This is too indifferent.

397
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,350
How can that let Shanggu know

398
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,190
how much we miss her?

399
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,640
Then write it by yourself.

400
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,400
I can’t.

401
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,830
Come on, sit down.

402
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,400
Our Goddess Yuemi

403
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,470
is the greatest literary talent
in three generations.

404
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,470
I don’t know how that silly girl

405
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
can withstand the loneliness
in the Nether World.

406
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,040
Fortunately, her days
in the Nether World

407
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,560
will be over soon.

408
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,830
After she comes back this time,

409
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,800
no matter what happens,

410
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,710
I won’t let her leave again.

411
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,920
The Origin of God-defending,
I must have you.

412
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,350
Your Grace!

413
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,350
Over the last thousand years,

414
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,190
you’ve had an arduous journey
and many injuries.

415
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,470
Aren’t you tired?

416
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,190
We can’t bear to see you suffer anymore.

417
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,760
Why don’t you go back to the God Realm

418
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,920
and let’s live in peace?

419
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,280
Go ahead!

420
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,110
Why is that?

421
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,590
Could it be that...?

422
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,470
The Origin of God-defending is the most
valuable treasure in the Three Realms.

423
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,310
Does it also choose its master?

424
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,680
What is fighting? What is killing?

425
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,400
Did the Ancestral God create
the world to destroy it?

426
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,920
What is the cause? What is the result?

427
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,920
Endless life, endless killing.

428
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,880
It will lead to no good result
to end war by war.

429
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,640
The Origin of God-defending.

430
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,520
I finally understand

431
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,190
that the Power of Chaos
can create everything

432
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,880
and can also destroy everything.

433
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,830
With my obtaining the Power of Chaos,

434
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,680
the mountains and seas can be moved

435
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,350
or calmed by a momentary thought.

436
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,310
From today on,

437
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,560
the Three Realms are under my feet

438
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,880
and all creatures are in my hands.

439
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,350
That’s what
the Power of Chaos looks like.

440
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,350
Her Grace made it.

441
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,280
Master finally finished her cultivation.

442
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,800
- Yeah!
- That’s great.

443
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,880
Did you just hear any sound?

444
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,110
A sound?

445
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,950
There hasn’t been a shadow of demon

446
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,430
over the last one thousand years.

447
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,760
What sound could there be?

448
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,110
It was not the sound of a demon.

449
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,830
It sounded like...

450
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,310
It sounded like a spirit.

451
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,070
Such pure god power of fire.

452
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,350
It can only be...

453
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,310
Master Bai Jue.

454
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,400
Guard here.

455
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,230
I’ll be right back.

456
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,430
Master Zhiyang.

457
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,710
Master!

458
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:15,710
Master Zhiyang,

459
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,640
you can’t go inside!

460
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,680
My master is bathing now.

461
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,640
Master Zhiyang! Master Zhiyang!

462
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,470
Master Zhiyang, it’s… rude…

463
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,230
You said he was bathing two hours ago.

464
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,400
I don’t believe it would take him
so long to take a bath.

465
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,280
Step aside.

466
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,110
I’m going inside.

467
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,590
What’s the matter?

468
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,160
Bai Jue, I came to tell you

469
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,520
that Shanggu has got
the Origin of God-defending.

470
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,430
I see.

471
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,000
Why is he so calm?

472
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,190
Did he know it earlier than me?

473
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,070
What? Say it.

474
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,070
Master Zhiyang,
when will Her Grace come back?

475
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,920
There are signs of Power of Chaos
in the lower realm.

476
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,640
Shanggu will return to
the God Realm tomorrow.

477
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,310
What are you smiling for?

478
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,400
Overlord, I’ve accomplished my mission.

479
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,560
You did a good job.

480
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,470
Overlord.

481
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,800
We’ve been preparing and planning
for a thousand years

482
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,680
and we sacrificed so many fellows

483
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,920
so that the Chief God could obtain
the Power of Chaos.

484
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,400
Everything will be

485
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,880
going your way, Overlord.

486
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,350
I just got the news

487
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,800
that the spirit of Goddess of Snow
entered the Nether World.

488
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,640
Do I need to do anything?

489
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,470
They all say that our Nether World
is a purgatory.

490
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,710
But those from the God Realm

491
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,640
came here one after another.

492
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,830
Interesting.

493
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,590
I heard that Xueying
is jealous of Shanggu

494
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,880
and she was expelled from
the God Realm by Bai Jue.

495
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,590
How about

496
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,310
we give her a hand?

497
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,230
It’s very injurious to extract
the spirit from the body.

498
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,800
Master actually did that for her.

499
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,590
Didn’t he know

500
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,470
it would ruin his original being
in this way?

501
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,470
Well done, little girl.

502
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,160
You obtained the Power of Chaos
only within one thousand years.

503
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,520
You just look a little beaten up.

504
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,350
Thanks to you.

505
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,070
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had
such a miserable time

506
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,350
over the past one thousand years.

507
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,950
If it weren’t for me to help you,

508
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,830
how could you have obtained
the Power of Chaos so quickly?

509
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,710
You are right.

510
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,000
I appreciate

511
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,000
your favor.

512
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,590
Well?

513
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,160
You are leaving?

514
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,280
I’ve obtained the Power of Chaos

515
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,640
and your barrier is also broken.

516
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,350
It’s time to go back to the God Realm.

517
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,190
It took you one thousand years
to obtain the Power of Chaos.

518
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,040
Even Ancestral God Qingtian
also spent that long.

519
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,040
You only used one thousand years,

520
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,110
is it because there is someone you love
in the God Realm?

521
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,710
The other three true gods

522
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,800
are like my real brothers.

523
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,760
Don’t be ridiculous.

524
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,840
I didn’t say the one you love

525
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,430
is a true god.

526
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,560
Considering you’ve had
such a miserable life,

527
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,390
being trapped here for years,

528
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,800
I’ll let that go.

529
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,120
I’m leaving.

530
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:30,910
Girl.

531
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,840
Take care.

532
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,150
Don’t worry.

533
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,840
As long as you are obedient,

534
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,470
the gods won’t give you a hard time.

535
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,840
I’m leaving.

536
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,840
Those gods have always been so stupid.

537
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,670
They only keep on guard against me.

538
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,630
They never know

539
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,320
their biggest enemy in the Three Realms

540
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,520
is called destiny.

541
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,840
Moyu.

542
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,600
Yes, Overlord.

543
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,000
I’ve learned everything

544
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,470
about the God Realm through Shanggu

545
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,630
over the past one thousand year.

546
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,800
Take my spiritual power

547
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,710
and break the Qiong Qi barrier

548
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,470
at the Red Blood Forest
in the Demon Realm.

549
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,840
Remember.

550
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,870
I’ve cast a spell on Goddess of Snow.

551
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,430
She can be really useful for you

552
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,280
to finish your task in the God Realm.

553
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,390
Yes!

554
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,950
The God Realm has been
peaceful for too long.

555
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,470
It’s time to have some fun.

556
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,670
Shanggu.

557
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,600
It’s been a thousand years.
I’ve been missing you.

558
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,150
It’s not good.

559
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,470
It sounds too formal.

560
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,710
Shanggu.

561
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,760
Ice Cube?

562
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,430
I’ve been waiting for this moment
for a thousand years.

563
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,120
I can’t let you meet Shanggu first.

564
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,870
How is your spiritual power so weak?

565
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,430
It’s not your concern.

566
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,800
It’s a sign that your spirit
left your body before.

567
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,040
Have you been...?

568
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,560
It’s common to have the spirit
damaged during cultivation.

569
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,840
There is no need to make a big deal.

570
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,190
Don’t you think
I will tell it to Shanggu.

571
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,470
I won’t let you

572
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,870
gain Shanggu’s sympathy.

573
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,910
Goddess of Snow, why are you here?

574
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,320
The beast Qiong Qi
broke out from the barrier.

575
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,150
Let me in.

576
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,280
I have to see Master Zhiyang.

577
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,080
Thank you, Goddess Xueying.

578
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,630
Hold the barrier!

579
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
We’ve been waiting for long.

580
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,670
Why isn’t Shanggu back yet?

581
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
Masters.

582
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,040
Master Shanggu left the Nether World

583
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,630
an hour ago.

584
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,560
Gods.

585
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,190
I don’t know why Qiong Qi
came to attack us.

586
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,430
Isn’t Qiong Qi’s clan

587
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,360
imprisoned in the Wasteland
of the Demon Realm?

588
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,430
It won’t be that easy!

589
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,190
Qiong Qi is fierce and terrifying!

590
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,800
These people are no match for them!

591
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,870
We must guard the gate

592
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,800
and wait for the True Gods to come!

593
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,390
Qiong Qi can’t see with its eyes.

594
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,470
There must be someone who led them here.

595
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,120
If we kill their leader,

596
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,760
they will fall to pieces!
