2
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,980
Why don’t you feed me?

4
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,940
Don’t go too far.

5
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,730
How much could
a Nine-Clawed Lotus hurt you?

6
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,800
Didn’t you use to kick
the Nine-headed Snake

7
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,050
and punch the Roc Bird?

8
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,690
Can you be so weak?

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,960
When was I that valorous?

10
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,960
You’re too old to remember it correctly.

11
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,440
Shanggu,

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,830
just feed me one.

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Why allowed you to stand here?

14
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,910
I didn’t invite you.

15
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,000
Are you here for me?

16
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,760
The Nine-Clawed Lotus that hurt Tianqi
was from Changyuan Hall’s east pond.

17
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,320
It has nothing to do with Gu Jun.

18
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,200
It was my oversight.

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,510
I’m here to make an apology to you.

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,430
Is this your attitude to apologize?

21
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,900
I’m the one who was hurt!

22
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,560
You decide if you accept the apology.

23
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,630
Tianqi,

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,790
please be the bigger person

25
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,630
and let go of
the Nine-Clawed Lotus thing.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,200
Don’t bring it up again.

27
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,480
Come on.

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,960
Forget it.

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,510
It’s not a big deal.

30
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,510
I don’t care much.

31
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,870
Anyway,

32
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,760
I’ve got something more important to do.

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,760
Within one month,

34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,590
I’ll train Shanggu’s disciple,
Gu Jun, with her.

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,480
If you do,

36
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,790
Gu Jun will lose.

37
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,040
Why do you think he’ll lose?

38
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,510
Shanggu,

39
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,350
let’s make a good showing.

40
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,430
In a month, let’s make Ice Cube...

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,280
The Dark Abyss.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,590
I’d like to lend you the Dark Abyss

43
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,350
to help Gu Jun become a God.

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,920
I don’t believe you.

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,230
You’re never so kind.

46
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:12,990
This is the pellet

47
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,430
I made for Gu Jun
to unblock his cold veins.

48
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,680
When did you make it?

49
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,120
How did you know
he was born with cold veins?

50
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,510
You expect him to lose, don’t you?

51
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,920
Shanggu learns cultivation from me.

52
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,350
Gu Jun’s problem

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,920
is also my problem.

54
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:32,870
Shanggu,

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
have some dignity.

56
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,680
Just pellets.

57
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,400
I’ll make some for you.

58
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,070
Who dares to take any pellets
with alcohol?

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,120
I swear I won’t drink any
within one month.

60
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,350
Who believes that?

61
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,350
You!

62
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,070
Come on, Shanggu.

63
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,960
True God Bai Jue, I’d like to thank you
on behalf of Gu Jun.

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,870
You’re welcome.

65
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,960
Shanggu,

66
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,200
I’ve got some other things.

67
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,070
Elixirs, magic weapons,
armors and good wine.

68
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,480
I’ve got everything.

69
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,680
Don’t bother.

70
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,480
You don’t like Gu Jun, do you?

71
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,400
Why do you suddenly show some mercy?

72
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,350
Trying to take him away?

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,920
Come to the Pilgrimage Hall
at 11 tonight.

74
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,510
I’ll give you the key to the Dark Abyss.

75
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,040
Shanggu,

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,790
you promised me last night.

77
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,400
Don’t break your promise.

78
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,120
What are you doing?

79
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,440
Are you done?

80
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,470
Tianqi,

81
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,400
the Dark Abyss

82
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,160
is indeed the best place for Gu Jun.

83
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,120
All right.

84
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,190
Don’t bother to explain.

85
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,600
I don’t want to listen.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,910
See you

87
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,680
at 11 tonight.

88
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,350
Wait.

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,840
When we proposed the fight,

90
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,840
we only said if Gu Jun lost,

91
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,310
I would go
to the Nether World immediately.

92
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,160
But we didn’t say

93
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,560
what if he won.

94
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,280
That’s right.

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,960
We’re all here.

96
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,470
Let’s discuss about it.

97
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,960
Looks like

98
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,350
I’m asking for a snub again.

99
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,560
Shanggu.

100
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,680
Shanggu!

101
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,030
Bai Jue,

102
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,680
you cultivated yourself alone
in the past tens of thousands of years.

103
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,030
Zhiyang and I brought Shanggu up.

104
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,790
So, you don’t decide

105
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,070
if she goes to the Nether World or not!

106
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,070
Zhiyang,

107
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,230
don’t you think so?

108
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,560
Where’s he?

109
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,790
Master,

110
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,510
something urgent happened
in the lower realm.

111
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,440
True God Zhiyang has gone to handle it.

112
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,280
What a silly old thing!

113
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,510
Are you all right?

114
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,310
I’m fine.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,310
You really do well in swordsmanship.

116
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,630
Her Grace is right about you.

117
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,310
What’s the good of that?

118
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,400
I’m born with cold veins

119
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,440
and chaotic spiritual power.

120
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
The cultivation

121
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,750
is over a thousand times harder for me.

122
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,880
Don’t lose heart.

123
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,070
Now that you’re in the Pilgrimage Hall

124
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,840
and Her Grace thinks highly of you,

125
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,560
she’ll figure out a way

126
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,160
to help you complete
your cultivation soon.

127
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,310
If you’re in need,

128
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,720
ask me to practice swordsmanship
with you at any time.

129
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,720
Thank you, Wu Huan.

130
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,230
When I was in the Phoenix Clan,

131
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,280
I was nothing

132
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,720
but a humble colorful Phoenix.

133
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,310
Thanks to the help of Her Grace,

134
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,720
I’ve come this far.

135
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,000
I believe

136
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,440
you’ll distinguish yourself one day.

137
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,310
I don’t care about that.

138
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,310
Master doesn’t despise my humble origin

139
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,560
and she’s nice to me.

140
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,680
I want nothing,

141
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,960
but to win honor for her.

142
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,280
Why were you practicing

143
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,840
even before I come?

144
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,230
Greetings, Wu Huan.

145
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,600
Go on with it.

146
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,600
I’ll leave you alone.

147
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,910
Wu Huan,

148
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,030
please wait.

149
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,630
I see you work hard

150
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,000
to take care of the Pilgrimage Hall.

151
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,120
This is the hot spring mud

152
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,600
we have on Mount Tianci.

153
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,000
Turn it into water

154
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,160
and apply it on your skin.

155
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,280
It’ll keep your skin moist.

156
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,750
Here’s some and please have a try.

157
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,560
Thank you, Muguang.

158
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,910
But you don’t need

159
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,910
to bother for me.

160
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,430
Thank goodness.

161
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,040
You finally smiled.

162
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,720
If you hadn’t stopped me,

163
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,480
I would have fallen out with Ice Cube.

164
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,870
It’s not a festival.

165
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,920
Why did you set fireworks?

166
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,110
As long as you can smile,

167
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,510
I’m willing to set fireworks

168
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,110
for you every day.

169
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,310
Keep such romantic words

170
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,920
for other goddesses.

171
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,670
Shanggu,

172
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,550
do you really not understand
or are you playing fool?

173
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
It’s been so many years.

174
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
Can’t you see

175
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,280
how I feel for you?

176
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,480
Shanggu,

177
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,920
I like you.

178
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,600
I adore you

179
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,960
and all can be my witnesses

180
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,240
that I’m not lying.

181
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,360
Shanggu,

182
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,630
don’t you have any...?

183
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,190
Tianqi,

184
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,160
I always treat you as my elder brother.

185
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
I never have any feeling...

186
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,920
♪Large memories are for you♪

187
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,670
The wind is blowing hard.

188
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,550
I didn’t hear what you said at all.

189
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,630

250
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,360
I have had the cold veins
for over a dozen years.

251
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,430
I’m used to it.

252
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,310
Don’t feel anxious.

253
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,630
Now that Bai Jue offered
to lend us the Dark Abyss,

254
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,990
he won’t break his promise.

255
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,430
He’ll certainly complete his promise.

256
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,280

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,960

258
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:19,840

263
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,550
I made it into a sachet.

Compared to the Dark Abyss,

267
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,280
it has little effect.

268
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,870
But better little than none.

But look at you. You’re drunk.

281
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,160
Ridiculous.

282
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,840
I’m so depressed

283
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,070

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,670

291
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,600

You’re just jealous.

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,280

294
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,960

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,600
You look tough,

297
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,260
but you’re timid inside.

298
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,110
You’re even worse than me.

299
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,800
At least, I dare to confess my love

300
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,430
and I live a freer life than you.

301
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,360
Shanggu is destined to be the Chief God.

302
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,310
She’ll take over
the instruction feather of Chief God.

303
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,990
To her,

304
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,870
love is simply a drop in the bucket

305
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,190
and it doesn’t matter.

306
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,750
Are you persuading me or yourself?

307
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,040
As long as she cultivates herself

308
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,070
and lives a good life,

309
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,600
that’s enough for me.

310
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,800
That’s enough for you.

311
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,280
But is that enough for her?

312
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,190
Bai Jue,

313
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,070
I think you’re poor and selfish.

314
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,870
But you don’t deserve any sympathy.

315
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,720
For you,

316
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,750

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,760
Gu Jun finally unblocked his cold veins
and became a God.

378
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
If he wins the competition,

379
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,790
I won’t need to go to the Nether World.

380
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,550
That’s great.

381
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,670
There’s finally good news.

382
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,430
In case,

383
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,310
I’ve taught him some advanced skills.

384
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,880
He said he was confident to win.

385
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,430
In this way,

386
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,120
I can always stay with you.

387
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,070
You mean with Bai Jue, right?

388
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,310
I don’t want to benefit from him.

389
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,030
What?

390
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,150
You said there was finally good news.

391
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,640
Did you have all bad news today?

392
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,150
Not only today,

393
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,670
for days.

394
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,430
Every day, immortals die
without a reason.

395
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,070
Even heavenly generals have suffered.

396
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,670
Even I might suffer soon.

397
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,760
Devils did that?

398
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,670
Go and ask Zhiyang.

399
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,790
But now I finally understand that

400
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,150
Bai Jue insists on letting you
experience in the Nether World

401
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,150
so that you can acquire
the Power of Chaos

402
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,070
for a right reason.

403
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,840
For several spiritual veins,

404
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
how many years

405
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,480
have you fought

406
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,720
and how many members of yours have died?

407
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,640
Your Grace.

408
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,720
Why can’t you stop?

409
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,150
Why is Zhiyang so angry?

410
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,240
He’s upset about the dispute
between seven islands.

411
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,270
You’d better not get in, Your Grace.

412
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,880
I understand.

413
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,430
To block the cracking barrier,

414
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,550
you have few spiritual veins left.

415
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,430
You both are at the end of your ropes.

416
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,270
If the problem isn’t solved...

417
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,070
Why are there few spiritual veins?

418
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,840
Everyone in the Three Realms
is expecting

419
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,070
Your Grace

420
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,910
to take over the instruction feather
of Chief God soon,

421
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,070
because the Power of Chaos
in the lower realm collapses.

422
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,960
The distribution of spiritual power
has already been out of balance.

423
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,860
(Trivial Stories
Love Story of Nine-headed Snakes)

424
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,120
Gu Jun, congratulations.

425
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,520
You’ve made great progress.

426
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,120
Without Master’s help

427
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,120
in the Dark Abyss,

428
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,070
I wouldn’t have become a God.

429
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,310
Wu Huan,

430
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,030
thank you for the sachet, too.

431
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,640
The sachet has little effect.

432
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,910
Never mind.

433
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,310
By the way,

434
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,790
tomorrow you’ll have a competition

435
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,790
with Goddess Xueying.

436
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,030
Don’t waste the efforts

437
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,430
Her Grace made on you.

438
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,360
Don’t worry.

439
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,270
I won’t disappoint you and Master.

440
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,360
You’re used to using spells.

441
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,070
But I got my skills

442
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,550
by fighting in the swamps.

443
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,120
You cheated.

444
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,310
You just became a God.

445
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,240
How could you have such strong power?

446
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,390
Goddess of Snow,

447
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,910
just say it if you can’t accept losing.

448
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,640
You used spells

449
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,430
when fighting my master.

450
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,150
But I used none of them today.

451
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,670
I didn’t cheat at all.

452
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,070
I won the competition.

453
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,550
Master Bai Jue,
please take back the order

454
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,390
sending my master to the Nether World.

455
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,760
I know what to do.

456
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,720
Shanggu,

457
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,910
you must also practice hard
when you stay in the God Realm.

458
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,760
Goddess of Snow,

459
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,910
now that you lost,

460
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,760
shouldn’t you keep your promise?

461
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,360
Forget it.

462
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,120
I’ll make the decision

463
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,640
and spare you.

464
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,270
Thank you, Your Grace.

465
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,360
Wait!

466
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,960
Your Grace,

467
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,190
there was a fire in Taichu Hall

468
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,600
and the Nine-Clawed Lotus
wounded Master Tianqi.

469
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,270
I’ve figured it out

470
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,550
and I want to tell on someone.

471
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,030
Hongri,

472
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,520
it wasn’t a fight of some immortals?

473
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,390
Zhong Li, Xia Hui,

474
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,190
come out and confess!

475
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,790
Master, please understand.

476
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,670
It’s her. Goddess Xueying hinted us

477
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
to steal the Nine-Clawed Lotus

478
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,600
from the east pond of Changyuan Hall
and frame Gu Jun up.

479
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,960
Goddess of Snow disobeyed the rules.

480
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,880
True Gods,
please punish her accordingly.

481
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,190
Master, I’m sorry.

482
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,790
I shouldn’t have disrespected Her Grace.

483
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,840
Master, I know I’m wrong!

484
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,880
Stop calling me Master.

485
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,520
For the sake that you made contributions

486
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,270
when fighting devils,

487
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,910
you’re expelled out of the God Realm

488
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,600
and shall guard the barrier
of the Nether World.

489
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,840
Zhong Li and Xia Hui are expelled, too.

490
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,720
They mustn’t come back again.

491
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,720
Leave!

492
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,030
Get up!

493
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,960
There’s already much fun to see today.

494
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,520
I don’t mean to add more.

495
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,720
In fact, no matter Gu Jun won or lost,

496
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,190
I had decided to go to the Nether World.

497
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,960
I’m not coming back

498
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,600
until I complete my power.

499
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,120
Shanggu,

500
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,910
don’t!

501
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,150
Ten thousand years ago,

502
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,120
I was born on Heaven and Earth Platform

503
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,760
in the name of the Chief God.

504
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,000
I feel quite guilty.

505
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,670
When Xuanyi was the Chief God,

506
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,120
he could at least defend the God Realm.

507
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,600
But I

508
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,000
don’t have much power

509
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,840
or make any contribution
to the Three Realms.

510
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,190
It may also be the reason

511
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,030
why Goddess of Snow doesn’t respect me.

512
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,120
Even if you leave
the Three Realms to me,

513
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,790
you’ll be worried, right?

514
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,360
So,

515
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,310
I’ve decided to cultivate myself
in the Nether World alone.

516
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,240
After I complete the Power of Chaos,

517
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,190
I’ll defend the Three Realms.

518
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,150
I may not grow up

519
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,150
unless I leave you.

520
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,030
The world is big.

521
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,910
Time for me to go out for a look.

522
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,790
A thousand years isn’t long.

523
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,070
Wait for me.

524
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,120
Who are you?

525
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,070
How dare you break in the Devil Realm?

526
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,240
Are you not wanting a long life

527
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,120
and seeking for your doom?

528
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,520
Want to kill me?

529
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,390
Let’s see if you can.

530
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,760
She’s heading for Overlord...

531
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,480
Let her go.

532
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,660
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

533
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,960
Shanggu.

534
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,720
Shanggu,

535
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,600
I’ve found some good story books
in the lower realm

536
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,670
and let’s enjoy them.

537
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,000
Shanggu.

538
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,070
What a poor memory I have!

539
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,670
She’s gone to the Nether World.

540
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,240
What are you doing?

541
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
You freaked me out!

542
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,000
Well, let me tell the truth.

543
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,070
Shanggu is going to stay in
the Nether World for a thousand years.

544
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,960
Without such treasures,

545
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,270
I’m afraid she’ll feel bored.

546
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,480
So, I came secretly

547
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,550
to bring her some toys and books.

548
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,880
I nearly forgot this.

549
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,360
You!

550
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,840
You’re the obstacle
on her way to success.

551
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,000
Bai Jue is trying hard to instruct her,

552
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,150
but you always make trouble.

553
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,760
You’re complaining about me?

554
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,520
What’s this?

555
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,030
I just miss her.

556
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,880
Ice Cube let Shanggu

557
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,120
cultivate herself alone.

558
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,390
Will she suffer there?

559
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,600
She will, of course.

560
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,080
But Bai Jue didn’t think about

561
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,480
who brought Shanggu up.

562
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,720
You brought her up.

563
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,560
She won’t easily suffer.

564
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,110
You’re right.

565
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,280
When Shanggu is away,

566
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,320
I feel a void in my heart.

567
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,870
She’s there for cultivation,

568
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,720
but I still want to see her.

569
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,280
Don’t you have any business to do?

570
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,560
No.

571
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,830
You do?

572
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,000
Go.

573
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,960
Let me show you

574
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,390
what business I have.

575
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,480
Where are we going?

576
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,190
Why did you take me here?

577
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,150
That’s Altair.

578
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
And that’s Vega.

579
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,240
I know.

580
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,800
The Ancestral God punished them

581
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,110
so that they couldn’t
get back together for years.

582
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,720
That’s cruel.

583
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,870
How about

584
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,390
making them get back together

585
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,800
after Shanggu becomes the Chief God?

586
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,240
They meet once a year,

587
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,910
but they have quite a lot of babies.

588
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,480
Altair is taking care of them.

589
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
All Vega does is to enjoy her life,

590
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,480
instead of suffering
from raising babies.

591
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,350
She’s quite happy.

592
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,590
She isn’t as miserable as others think.

593
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,040
Is... Is that all right?

594
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,910
Why isn’t it?

595
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,870
As long as they decide

596
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,110
who works and who takes care of babies,

597
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,480
it’s family stuff.

598
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,520
Others shouldn’t interfere.

599
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,480
You know what?

600
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,430
You have a point.

601
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,190
But, sometimes when I see them
miss each other too much,

602
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,280
I let them meet secretly

603
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,960
when others are not noticing.

604
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,720
I appreciate it when you break rules

605
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,830
and behave willingly.

606
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,320
Would you like a chess game?

607
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,520
Where are the chess pieces?

608
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,670
You always look rude.

609
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,520
I didn’t expect you
to enjoy the chess game?

610
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,280
Will you play or not?

611
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,110
I will.

612
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,960
There you are, Your Grace.

613
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,000
What?

614
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,000
Aren’t you afraid of death?

615
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,190
I checked ancient books before I came.

616
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,520
Bai Jue wanted me to cultivate myself
in the Nether World

617
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,000
because the Deicide Flowers
release the spirit of Chaos

618
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,280
when they’re in bloom.

619
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,480
Only the Chief God can absorb it

620
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,320
and it will help me
complete the Power of Chaos.

621
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,670
The blooming will be a thousand years.

622
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,720
So will the cultivation.

623
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,190
Precisely.

624
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,670
But Bai Jue neglected another treasure.

625
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,190
The Origin of God-defending
at the border of the Nether World.

626
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,350
Looks like you did some work.

627
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,430
I come here to cultivate my power.

628
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,800
Before I make it,

629
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I’m not leaving.

630
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,800
I come to see you,

631
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,960
because I want you to set up a barrier

632
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,110
at the border of the Nether World

633
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,800
that even Gods can’t break.

634
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,870
You’re afraid they may regret

635
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,430
and drag you back to the God Realm?

636
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,520
I’m afraid I can’t hold it,

637
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,870
and then I’ll count on others

638
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,760
or miss the comfort in the God Realm.

639
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,110
Your Grace,

640
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,670
you’re still so straightforward.

641
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,320
I can help you,

642
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,630
but on two conditions.

643
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,520
What conditions?

644
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,760
Devils like us are always bloodthirsty.

645
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,040
Many devils guard
at the border of the Nether World.

646
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,040
Even Bai Jue can’t take much advantage.

647
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,350
So, leave your life to destiny.

648
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,910
I won’t show mercy on you.

649
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,190
It’s not that easy to kill me, either.

650
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,430
What’s the second condition?

651
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:05,320
I’ve been too lonely in this place.

652
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,870
I need you to come often

653
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,320
and chat with me.

654
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,520
Look how I’m chained.

655
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,150
Are you afraid I’ll kill you?

656
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,280
If I die,

657
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,870
I can’t chat with you.

658
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,430
You’re such a lovely goddess.

659
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,560
I don’t really want to kill you.

660
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,560
Once my barrier is set up,

661
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,590
you cannot get out of the Nether World

662
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,630
unless you become the Chief God.

663
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,190
Have you thought it over?

664
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,800
It’s my first time

665
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,910
to think something over so carefully.

666
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,760
- Greetings, Master Tianqi.
- Greetings, Master Tianqi.

667
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,110
Master Tianqi,

668
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,560
Her Grace ordered that

669
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,960
no one shall get into the Nether World.

670
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,630
Get out of my way.

671
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,480
I’ll stay with Shanggu.

672
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,430
Now you know how dangerous
the Nether World is?

673
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,240
All we should do

674
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,630
is respect her decision.

675
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,150
I’m not like you

676
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,190
who likes to reason things out.

677
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,830
I can’t let her take the risk alone!

678
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,910
Zhiyang, be quick.

679
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,320
Break the barrier with me

680
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,320
and get Shanggu back!

681
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,000
What are you waiting for? Do it!

682
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,320
This month, 38 immortals died.

683
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,630
When Shanggu offered
to go to the Nether World,

684
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,390
I was thinking

685
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,320
if we spoilt her too much

686
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,560
and held up her growth.

687
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,960
In fact,

688
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,590
she’s stronger than we imagined.

689
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,720
If we take her out of the Nether World,

690
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,720
won’t we hold her back?

691
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,670
You’d better pray for her safety.

692
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,830
Master,

693
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,670
the leaving of your spirit

694
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,000
consumes great power

695
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,190
and even hurts your lifespan!

696
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,830
Are you sure you’ll do this?

697
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,870
As long as she’s safe,

698
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,630
let alone ten thousand years’ lifespan,

699
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,190
even if it’s
a hundred thousand years’ lifespan,

700
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,590
I won’t mind.

701
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,240
Rest assured, Master.

702
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,760
I won’t leave this place

703
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,040
and I’ll protect your body.

704
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,870
You must be very careful.

705
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,150
If the devils

706
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,520
or Xuanyi finds your spirit,

707
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,190
your body will be ruined, too.

708
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
I know.
