2
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,060
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,590
We are going to get your thing back,

4
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,550
not to fight.

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,720
Don’t act rashly.

6
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,590
I wouldn’t have saved him
if I’d known I was being used.

7
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,360
It makes me mad when I
think about his poker face.

8
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,830
All right. You just did a great job.

9
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,830
The Gods are looking at you
differently now.

10
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,270
If you go to pick on him now,

11
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,120
who knows what kind of rumors

12
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,360
will come out.

13
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,630
It’s not me who did a good job.

14
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,720
It’s Bai Jue.

15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,190
What they want to say
has nothing to do with me.

16
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,480
But you can’t beat him
even you go there.

17
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,080
If he throws you out of
his hall like he did last time,

18
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,310
it will be much more embarrassing.

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,550
Do you really not care?

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,510
Then there is nothing I can do.

21
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,590
What’s your idea?

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,510
All right. I’ll get it for you.

23
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,310
Stay right here and wait for me.

24
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,360
Master has ordered me

25
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,800
that if Her Grace
comes here to ask for it,

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,670
I should give it to her immediately.

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,880
Goddess Yuemi, take it.

28
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,190
When did Shanggu’s power
become so strong?

29
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,190
Her Grace practiced really hard

30
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,360
and she passed the thunder trial.

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,900
Her spiritual power is quite strong now.

32
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,340
It won’t take her long to obtain
the Power of Chaos and be a real Chief God.

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,270
We taught her for more than
ten thousand years

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,110
and she made no progress at all.

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,800
Looks like Bai Jue is quite capable.

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
My master never complained,

37
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,910
but he has been lonely
for ten thousand years.

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,270
Finally he has Her Grace
to stay with him now.

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,630
And he is teaching her attentively.

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,080
But

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,470
Her Grace is not around these days

42
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,960
and there is no smile
on his face anymore.

43
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,980
There is so much dust on my swing.

44
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,380
That Ice Cube.

45
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,880
I’ll break with him

46
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,270
after I get my original being.

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,960
He is meditating now.

48
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,520
I can’t be luckier.

49
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,320
I read from books

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
that when the True God is meditating,
his soul is wandering in the universe.

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,720
He won’t wake up for a while.

52
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,830
Let me take the chance

53
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,520
and get back my original being

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,600
before he knows it.

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,240
Then I don’t need to
waste my time with Ice Cube.

56
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,750
What should I do now?

57
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,190
I don’t even have enough power
to take out my original being.

58
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,830
Could it be...

59
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,630
There is no one here anyway.

60
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,360
No one would know it.

61
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,920
What are you doing?

62
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,720
Aren’t you meditating?

63
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,480
I’m taking a nap.

64
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,350
By rights,

65
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,350
you should have given
my original being back to me

66
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,640
when you got back to the God Realm.

67
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,880
But you didn’t and you made me

68
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,390
come here to ask for it.

69
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,920
Are you trying to embarrass me?

70
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,000
That’s not what I want.

71
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,350
We are finished now.

72
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,270
Shanggu?

73
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,200
Shang...

74
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,550
What are you doing?

75
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,320
It’s really hot today.

76
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,670
Aren’t you afraid to have heat rash

77
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,480
as someone who lost her
spiritual power?

78
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,830
Get up. Come on.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,320
Look what this is.

80
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
I’m sure you will be
alive and kicking after you see it.

81
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,390
I asked it from Hongri.

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,510
Yuemi.

83
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,440
Don’t come here to see me anymore.

84
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,720
I’m too embarrassed to leave
the Pilgrimage Hall.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,830
Goodbye.

86
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,230
I have something to ask you.

87
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,720
Master, go ahead, please.

88
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,670
I have an old friend who is an immortal.

89
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,790
He is in trouble now.

90
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
And it’s because of a girl...

91
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Master, I’ve been
by your side for so long.

92
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
What kind of immortal friend

93
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,440
can you have with your temper?

94
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,640
Right. Right.

95
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,320
Your old friend is in trouble
because of a girl.

96
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,200
Master, please continue.

97
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,390
My old friend did something.

98
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,110
But he did it to
fulfill his responsibilities

99
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,760
and to save the world.

100
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,640
But somehow that girl was implicated

101
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,040
and she thought she was used by him.

102
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,720
She got mad at him and blamed him.

103
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,440
What do you think my friend should do?

104
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,390
What’s the relationship

105
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,110
between your friend and that girl?

106
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,950
He is her teacher.

107
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,230
Her teacher...

108
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,830
Did he tell her the truth

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,600
and finish the task with her

110
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,640
when he learned

111
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,880
that she misunderstood him?

112
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,950
No.

113
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,480
But my friend

114
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,070
didn’t tell her for her safety.

115
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,440
I see.

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,070
He is her teacher.

117
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,230
It’s not like he is a general
and she is a soldier

118
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,920
or he is a god and she is an immortal.

119
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,480
You mean I only care about

120
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,040
the result and the cause

121
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,830
when I act and order

122
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,720
and I’m too heartless?

123
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,920
Exactly.

124
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,200
But we were confronted with an enemy.

125
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,200
What if we lose the fight
because I care about her feelings?

126
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,510
Master, you are too serious about it.

127
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,040
For every girl in the world,

128
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,670
all she wants is to be cared
and trusted.

129
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,000
If your friend

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,600
deceived that girl,

131
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,230
then that’s his fault.

132
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,720
Is it really his fault?

133
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,440
What should he do then?

134
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,480
Apologize.

135
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,790
I’ll tell my old friend now.

136
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,070
See?

137
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,880
Look how fast I am.

138
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,110
You both should learn from me.

139
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,670
Your Grace, you’re awesome.

140
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,880
Shanggu.

141
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,760
What are you doing here?
I haven’t forgiven you yet.

142
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,670
You are a Chief God. Excessive attention
to plaything saps the will.

143
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,910
You’d better mind your own business.

144
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,350
I guess

145
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,080
I’m the only Chief God

146
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,080
who was totally being used

147
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,590
and didn’t know it at all.

148
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,910
I explained it to you on that day.

149
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,230
From now on, even it’s not about Xuanyi,

150
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,000
I’ll still be attentive to you.

151
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,790
Just let it go.

152
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,110
You want me to let it go that easily?

153
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,710
For someone who can’t
tell right from wrong like me,

154
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,350
I don’t deserve your teaching.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
Ancestral Sword! See him out!

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,440
See him out...

157
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,230
See...

158
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,230
All right, since the True God won’t go,

159
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,280
I’ll go then.

160
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,440
Shanggu. Shanggu.

161
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,710
Sit down. Drink with me.

162
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,150
Has your friend from the Immortal Realm
solved his problem?

163
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,200
You are talking about
yourself and Her Grace, right?

164
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,590
Is Her Grace

165
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,320
still angry about what happened
in the Nether World that day?

166
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,960
Do you still want to teach her?

167
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,550
I’ve promised Zhiyang to teach her.

168
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,350
There is no reason to give up halfway.

169
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,840
You are totally right.

170
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,670
Her Grace is impulsive.

171
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,080
In the face of the virtuous cause,

172
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,710
you should be more tolerant.

173
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,670
Master, I have a good idea.

174
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,960
Master.

175
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,150
Where is the person?

176
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,960
We need a fourth in our game.
Didn’t I ask you to invite someone here?

177
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,590
I’ve invited all the Gods here.

178
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,230
They were either cultivating themselves

179
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,910
or appreciating flowers
and tasting wine.

180
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,110
Why do they

181
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,230
not want to play dominoes with me?

182
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,550
Your stakes are too high.

183
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,030
No one wants to come.

184
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,790
Never mind. Leave us.

185
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,400
Yes.

186
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,670
It’s boring for us three
to play dominoes.

187
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,790
How about I ask Bai Jue to come?

188
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,520
Don’t. Don’t,

189
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,550
Bai Jue is pretty lofty.

190
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,840
He can’t stand to see
such vulgar things like dice.

191
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,710
Yeah.

192
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,230
Tianqi, did you just know Bai Jue?

193
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,840
Your suggestion is too unreasonable.

194
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,840
What do you know?

195
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,230
It must feel really good to win

196
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,790
some Sacred Beads from that Ice Cube.

197
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,960
We just need one more person.

198
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,670
Ancestral Sword, come on.

199
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,320
He just looked at you

200
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,670
and you don’t dare to move, do you?

201
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,440
I’ll melt you down one day, you wuss.

202
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,200
Come here.

203
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,030
The divine weapon is
connected with its owner.

204
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,840
Your personality

205
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,080
will determine its personality.

206
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,710
I’m saying...

207
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,080
Use the spell

208
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,840
when you meet Her Grace.

209
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,150
Just read it.

210
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,670
I promise she will be happy to hear it

211
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,350
and she will forgive you.

212
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,230
You are considerate and thoughtful,

213
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,550
gentle and generous,

214
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,640
beautiful and brilliant,

215
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,440
tender and attentive.

216
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,110
You’re the best in the Three Realms.

217
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,520
Did Bai Jue get his tongue hurt
in the Nether World?

218
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,640
His tongue?

219
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,550
I think his brain got hurt.

220
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,150
I feel the same.

221
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,000
I’ll leave then.

222
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,320
You haven’t finished your compliments.

223
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,710
Ice Cube, stop there!

224
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,320
Shanggu!

225
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,150
Shanggu!

226
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,910
Look at her.

227
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,200
She just wouldn’t allow us
to mention Bai Jue.

228
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,670
He only said a few words

229
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,640
and she just ran after him.

230
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,710
These two people

231
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,710
are really perfect for each other.

232
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,150
Perfect?

233
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,470
Perfect?

234
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
Bai Jue’s stubborn and grumpy.

235
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,320
I’m way better than him.

236
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,000
No way.

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,960
They are moving too fast.

238
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,670
I have to do something about it,

239
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,960
or she will slip through my fingers.

240
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,150
What a fool.

241
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,590
Can’t you look back?

242
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,670
There is also someone waiting for you.

243
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,350
I must ask for a good marriage today.

244
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,110
Puhua.

245
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,640
I finally find you.

246
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,000
Master Tianqi.

247
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
What brings you here?

248
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,960
Let me ask you.

249
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,790
Did you match Shanggu with someone else?

250
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,080
(Puhua)
You must be joking.

251
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,080
How dare I?

252
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,110
It’s not the right time
for Her Grace to get married.

253
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,520
It won’t work even I do.

254
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,400
What’s more,

255
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,280
the red lines she

256
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,000
messed up last time

257
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,790
haven’t been sorted out yet.

258
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,150
How dare I provoke her again?

259
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
That sounds reasonable.

260
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,440
Puhua.

261
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,670
I know

262
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,440
you are in charge of marriage
in the world.

263
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,590
It must be tiring for you.

264
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,710
Not at all.

265
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,550
I’m only in charge of the marriage
of the lower realm.

266
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,030
It’s not tiring at all.

267
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,910
Look.

268
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,590
The Gods in the God Realm

269
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
are really old-fashioned.

270
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,350
They cultivate and practice
all the time.

271
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,080
But they don’t know
the harmony between yin and yang,

272
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,280
falling in love and getting married
are the laws of nature.

273
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,760
Master Tianqi,
you are insightful indeed.

274
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,000
I can set people up.

275
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,520
But I can only do it

276
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,670
in the lower realm.

277
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,150
My skills are useless in the God Realm.

278
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,320
How come?

279
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,030
I think those Gods in the God Realm
are quite boring.

280
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,640
I’m thinking about
holding a Dating Event.

281
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,400
Dating Event?

282
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,470
I don’t know if you are
willing to help me.

283
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,550
Of course. Of course.

284
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,030
It’s just there is something tricky.

285
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,880
I need you...

286
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,670
I got it. I got it.

287
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
Which goddess
are you interested in again?

288
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,200
What do you mean again?

289
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,200
Among all the goddesses,

290
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Shanggu is the only one I fall for.

291
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,400
The little Chief God?

292
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,470
Hongri!

293
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,910
Hongri!

294
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Bring some tea for me.

295
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,840
That’s how you entertain guests
in Changyuan Hall?

296
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,000
No one will be so rude

297
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,910
in Master Tianqi’s Taichu Hall.

298
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,820
I’m only rude to you.

299
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,910
Little Kylin. you were defeated by me
ten thousand years ago.

300
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,230
You still remember it?

301
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,000
Old Dragon, if it wasn’t for you
to make me drink wines for three days,

302
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,880
how would I lose to you?

303
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,110
Just leave after you pass the message.

304
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,080
All right. I don’t bother to
bicker with you today.

305
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,760
I’m here by the order of my master

306
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,110
to send an invitation to your master.

307
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
It’s the beginning of spring
three days later.

308
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,910
My master will hold a Dating Event
for the Little Chief God

309
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,550
in Master Yuemi’s Taoyuan Forest.

310
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,080
All the Gods will be invited
at that time.

311
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,080
Of course.

312
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,760
Your master doesn’t like banquet anyway.

313
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,470
It doesn’t matter if he comes or not.

314
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,080
What does the Dating Event

315
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,400
have anything to do with the Her Grace?

316
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,670
Of course it has.

317
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,910
Can’t you see

318
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,000
that my master and Her Grace

319
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,150
have fallen for each other?

320
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,440
They are perfect for each other.

321
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

322
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,280
Her Grace belongs to my master!

323
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,910
Your master?

324
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,280
Don’t be kidding.

325
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,320
Someone like Bai Jue

326
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,960
can even freeze magma into ice.

327
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,880
How would Her Grace like him?

328
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,760
I think he is destined
to be alone forever.

329
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,640
You...!

330
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,280
Zihan.

331
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,350
We haven’t met for more than
ten thousand years.

332
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,300
You are becoming more disciplined.

333
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,710
I was talking nonsense.

334
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,150
Don’t take it seriously.

335
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,350
My master doesn’t mean anything else.

336
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,520
Because Her Grace

337
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,110
is still recovering from the fight

338
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,910
in the Nether World.

339
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,200
The banquet can be a good chance

340
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,150
for her to relax and have some fun.

341
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,910
She hasn’t fully recovered?

342
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,470
Master, you don’t know it?

343
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,110
Yes.

344
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,680
I guess she only

345
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,110
told my master about it.

346
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,920
I got the invitation. You can leave now.

347
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,920
Your jokes are so funny.

348
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,230
Where did you hear them?

349
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,430
As long as you are happy,

350
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,280
I can keep telling you jokes
for three days and nights.

351
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,190
I just want you to be happy every day

352
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,590
and get better soon.

353
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,400
You are right.

354
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,310
As Gods,

355
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,640
the most important thing is to be happy.

356
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,110
Are you happy?

357
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,520
Of course.

358
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,040
Then, do you like me?

359
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,470
Of course I like you.

360
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,040
You’ve been the best to me
since I was young.

361
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,800
You are my favorite god.

362
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,400
Puhua will hold

363
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,560
a Dating Event in Taoyuan Forest
a few days later.

364
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,830
Have you heard about that?

365
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,310
This old man really has a lot of time.

366
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,560
It’s not enough for him
to set people up,

367
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,160
now he wants to set Gods up.

368
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,470
I heard that many Goddesses
and Gods will be there.

369
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,950
Do you wanna come?

370
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,110
It’s such a big event.
Of course I will come.

371
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,070
All right, today’s story is over.

372
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,190
I’ll be back to my Taichu Hall.

373
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,070
See you in Taoyuan Forest
a few days later.

374
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,920
I won’t see you out.

375
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,040
Bye.

376
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,710
Where are we going?

377
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,880
It looks great over there.

378
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,950
Let’s go over the bridge
and take a look.

379
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,640
Okay.

380
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,400
This scenery is so beautiful.

381
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
That’s true.

382
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,640
There are so many gods here today.

383
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,160
Isn’t this the God of Disaster?

384
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,470
Master said

385
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,350
that those who attend this banquet

386
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,000
must have a good appearance.

387
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,640
But I think my master will get mad

388
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,350
when he sees your looks.

389
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,400
It’s good to have tea with you...

390
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,880
What a bad day

391
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,640
to meet someone so unsightly.

392
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,680
Goddess of Day, who are you insulting?

393
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,470
The one who answers to me.

394
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,880
I don’t understand.

395
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,350
How could anyone in the God Realm

396
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,680
fall for a crazy woman like you?

397
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
I don’t have time to bicker with you.

398
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,310
Let’s see

399
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,160
which of us will find a partner first.

400
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,950
Fine.

401
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,400
I haven’t had such a good time
for so long.

402
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,950
Puhua.

403
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,590
Yeah.

404
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,310
Do you still remember

405
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,350
what I told you?

406
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,590
Of course I remember.

407
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,880
And also, get the music,

408
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,470
petals and rainbows ready for Shanggu.

409
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,230
Okay.

410
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,640
It would be best
if there are one thousand swans

411
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,400
flying over my head,

412
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,880
which will show

413
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,880
who is the focus of the event.

414
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,640
Swans are good.

416
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,830
But, Master,

417
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,040
where can I find

418
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,310
a thousand swans for you
in such a short time?

419
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,560
No swans?

420
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,880
Then hawk can also work.

421
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,640
Hawk?

422
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,070
Only hawk spreading its wings

423
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,560
can show my dignified bearing.

424
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

425
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,520
The Gods are almost there.

426
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,400
Master Puhua.

427
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,070
They are waiting for your magic charm.

428
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,590
Right, I’ll go right away.

429
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,230
Look how busy you make him.

430
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,280
Do you want to win Shanggu’s heart

431
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,470
just like this?

432
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,640
Save it.

433
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,520
Well?

434
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,160
Am I not handsome?

435
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,760
You are handsome enough
to ward off evil spirits.

436
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,950
You don’t know how to appreciate it.

437
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,880
You want to hear compliments?

438
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,310
Fine.

439
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,160
Master Tianqi is impressive in bearing.

440
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,070
I’m sure you will
win the heart of Shanggu.

441
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
There you go.

442
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,230
Bai Jue never attended any banquet.

443
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,830
Why did he come here?

444
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,190
It’s Master Bai Jue.

445
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:06,470
Master.

446
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,880
It’s really him.

447
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,230
He is so beautiful.

448
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,280
Master.

449
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,160
Why did you come to the Dating Event?

450
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,160
Is it because you fall for some goddess?

451
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,160
The beautiful scenery on a spring day.

452
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,800
I just practiced a piece.

453
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,280
May I have the honor to play it for you?

454
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,710
Tianqi.

455
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,800
Don’t bother.

456
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,560
Master, these are newly picked figs.

457
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,640
Do you want to try them?

458
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,160
What’s the situation over there?

459
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,800
Are those Goddesses losing their minds?

460
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,470
Master Bai Jue! Master!

461
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,680
Who knows what happened

462
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,760
to that Ice Cube.

463
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,880
You once sent a Goddess to his hall

464
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,950
and he rejected her.

465
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,830
Now he is here
flirting with those Goddesses.

466
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,280
That’s strange.

467
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,520
Shanggu, what do you
think of my look today?

468
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,280
Are you trying to ward off evil spirits?

469
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,800
What did I tell you?

470
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,000
Shanggu.

471
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,350
Let’s find a quiet place

472
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,760
to enjoy the scenery. Let’s go.

473
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,760
I can see Master again.

474
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,350
You finally showed up.

475
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,310
Why do you care?

476
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,800
I’ve been looking for you.

477
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,710
I think you were
having a good time over there.

478
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,160
I was having a miserable time.

479
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,070
What a joke.

480
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,230
I ran out of the Pilgrimage Hall
to chase you that day.

481
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,710
But you didn’t even look back.

482
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,640
I heard that the injuries you got
in the Nether World haven’t healed yet.

483
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,310
This medicine can heal wounds

484
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,520
and increase your spiritual power.

485
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,800
Take it.

486
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,880
It’s a minor injury. I’m fine now.

487
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,830
By the way,

488
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,710
I was rude that day.

489
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,110
Bear with me.

490
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,400
Hold on.

491
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,830
What?

492
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,110
You blamed me for
making you look bad in public.

493
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,350
Shanggu.

494
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,830
I’m here today to apologize to you.

495
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,520
How could it be the omnipotent

496
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,640
Master Bai Jue’s fault?

497
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,400
About what happened in the Nether World,

498
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,950
I neglected your feelings

499
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,950
and didn’t think
from where you were standing.

500
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,560
It was my fault.

501
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,830
But like I said,

502
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,520
even it’s not about Xuanyi,

503
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,400
I will still treat you attentively.

504
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,830
I really mean it.

505
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,280
Please be generous

506
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,880
and forgive me.

507
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,160
Well...

508
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,830
Ice Cube.

509
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,880
There are a lot of Gods here.

510
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,920
How can a teacher
apologize to his student?

511
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,110
Get up.

512
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,430
There are countless ways in the world.

513
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,520
We shall never stop learning.

514
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,680
Well, tomorrow...

515
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,350
Tomorrow, Yuemi asked me
to play dominoes with here.

516
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,350
Shanggu.

517
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,040
It suddenly occurred to me
that I have something to do tomorrow.

518
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,070
- Let’s cancel it.
- Yuemi, you...!

519
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,830
Since Her Grace and Master
are reconciled now,

520
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,190
let’s have a drink together

521
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,590
and put all these behind us.

522
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,880
Xueying, what are you doing?

523
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,710
Master Tianqi.

524
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,710
I didn’t mean to spill it on Her Grace.

525
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,230
Her Grace’s dress

526
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,560
really matches with

527
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
Master Bai Jue’s dress.

528
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,470
Yeah.

529
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,430
Thank you for helping me out.

530
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,400
What a beautiful dress.

531
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,760
I think Your Grace
won’t be mad at me now.

532
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,680
Tomorrow, wait for me in Changyuan Hall.

533
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,640
Okay.

534
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,830
Shanggu, how boring it is
to cultivate and practice.

535
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,310
If you get bored of playing dominoes,

536
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,350
I will take you down there to have fun.

537
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,800
There are countless ways in the world.
We shall never stop learning.

538
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,280
What did Ice Cube do to you

539
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,920
to make you so diligent now?

540
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,040
Well?

541
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,640
Are you unhappy that I’m getting better?

542
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,470
Puhua!

543
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,920
Puhua!

544
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,190
I’ve been looking for you for a while.

545
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,710
Why are you hiding here to drink?

546
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,190
Goddess Yuemi.

547
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,310
Are you also here to ask for
the Rope of Love?

548
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,710
They want your Rope of Love.

549
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,000
But I don’t want it.

550
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,950
Goddess Yuemi.

551
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,800
Are you also

552
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
falling for someone?

553
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,040
I think I must be drunk.

554
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,470
Yeah. How is it possible?

555
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,400
I don’t think there is
anyone in the God Realm

556
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,470
who can handle you.

557
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,040
What’s wrong with me?

558
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,680
I’m beautiful

559
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,590
and competent.

560
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,760
Am I not good?

561
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,350
You are good.

562
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,640
You are great.

563
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,680
Goddess, you are

564
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,110
far from gentle and elegant.

565
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,590
But you are bossy and good at fight.

566
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,640
I dare you to say that again!

567
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,310
I just helped you out.

568
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,950
I was wrong. I was wrong.

569
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,680
Goddess Yuemi, let me go.

570
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,590
If I faint,

571
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,310
I can’t give you my treasure...

572
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,560
Goddess Yuemi.

573
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,000
This is my heirloom.

574
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,070
It works every time.

575
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,190
What if it doesn’t work?

576
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,560
I promise you with my life.

577
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,640
Just consider it as a favor

578
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,040
if you get what you want this time.

579
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,000
Don’t make troubles

580
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,710
in my Temple of Love down there anymore.

581
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,190
Take it.

582
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,000
Interesting.

583
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,680
Interesting.

584
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,640
Master.

585
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,640
Where’s Yuemi?

586
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,760
Let’s go to pray
and draw divination sticks.

587
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,640
Okay.

588
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,950
You know Yuemi’s temperament.

589
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,710
I guess
she is hearing gossips somewhere.

590
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,160
Let’s forget about her.

591
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,070
Shanggu, actually, I have something...

592
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,430
Congratulations, Your Grace!

593
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,920
To me?

594
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,230
You just had your God vessels opened

595
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,880
and you sealed the Overlord Xuanyi.

596
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,830
Congratulations.

597
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,160
This is not a celebration party.
What’s the congratulation about?

598
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,880
I’ve always respected and admired you.

599
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,800
You do have an extraordinary bearing
as expected.

600
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,350
It’s a blessing for the Three Realms

601
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,880
to have such a Chief God.

602
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,920
What an ass-kisser.

603
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,880
You’re an ass-kisser.

604
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,070
It’s Bai Jue who directed well.

605
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,040
I just followed the plan.

606
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,710
I didn’t do much.

607
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,110
You are too humble.

608
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,590
Too humble.

609
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,950
It’s widespread in the God Realm

610
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,950
that Bai Jue assisted you

611
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,310
to break into the Nether World.

612
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,800
Bai Jue assisted me?

613
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,230
Who told you that?

614
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,590
Of course it’s Bai Jue who told us that.

615
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,190
You think I don’t know

616
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,280
it’s you two who spoke ill of Shanggu

617
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,920
behind her back?

618
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,110
Well,

619
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,830
are you afraid now?

620
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,160
It’s too late to fawn on her

621
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,400
in the Dating Event now.

622
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,040
I was being mouthy.

623
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,680
Those were just jokes.

624
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,710
Master, Your Grace, please forgive me.

625
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,350
I was blind as a bat.

626
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,950
I thought you are naughty.
But I didn’t know you are so brave.

627
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,160
Remember.

628
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,470
Don’t gossip about Shanggu anymore.

629
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

630
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,760
Tianqi, I want to go back
to the Pilgrimage Hall.

631
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,760
Don’t you love banquets the most?

632
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,160
Why are you going back so early?

633
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,190
I have to go to Changyuan Hall
to practice tomorrow morning.

634
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,950
Bye.

635
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,070
Shanggu, I haven’t...

636
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,280
Great, Shanggu.

637
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,070
You created a chance for me.

638
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,950
I will take this chance.

639
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,350
Who dared to attack me?

640
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,950
Little Night.

641
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,950
Why didn’t I notice

642
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,640
that your eyes are so beautiful?

643
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,190
Little Day.

644
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,470
You are the most beautiful

645
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,880
goddess I’ve ever met.

646
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,430
Let’s be together forever.

647
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,350
Who threw the Rope of Love on them?

648
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,560
Why didn’t you throw it earlier?

649
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,310
Yuemi?

650
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,800
Master.

651
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,310
Thirty thousand years ago,

652
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,430
we met in the Plum Garden.

653
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,760
You said...

654
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,310
Who is here?

655
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,950
I’m Xueying in charge of
the four seasons in the Heavenly Realm.

656
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,640
I intruded into the garden

657
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,680
because of the breathtaking scent
of the plum blossom.

658
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,470
Please forgive me

659
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,710
if I disturbed you.

660
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,920
The plum blossoms
are waiting for the snow.

661
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,470
It’s a good name.

662
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The plum blossoms
are waiting for the snow.

663
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,040
That sentence you said

664
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,280
made me wait for three thousand years.

665
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,230
It’s not what I said that made you

666
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,760
wait for three thousand years,

667
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,400
but your own obsession.

668
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,590
I know you are aloof.

669
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,920
I dare not ask for too much.

670
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,590
I just want to stay by your side

671
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,590
and take care of your life.

672
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,160
It’s enough for me to see you often.

673
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,680
You know it’s not gonna happen.
Why do you have to ask me that?

674
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,590
Please go back, Goddess of Snow.

675
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,590
I won’t go back.

676
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,230
If you learn

677
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,280
what love means,
you will know it’s a lifetime.

678
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,430
God lives too long.

679
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,350
I don’t want to spend the rest of
my life in misery and pain.

680
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,310
Even you won’t let me stay by your side,

681
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,190
I still want to tell you my feelings.

682
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,310
Goddess of Snow.

683
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,040
I know

684
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,230
you spilled the wine on purpose.

685
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,590
Needless to explain.

686
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,230
Since Shanggu doesn’t care about it,

687
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,590
I won’t punish you.

688
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,040
I know you still have pity for me.

689
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,190
Master!

690
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,760
Not good.

691
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,040
God of Day and God of Night
went down there together.

692
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,590
Let’s talk about this later.

693
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,190
The two of them are in charge of
day and night respectively.

694
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,310
They can’t go down there together.

695
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,400
I held the Dating Event

696
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,520
when Zhiyang is not around.

697
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,280
If he finds it out,

698
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,350
he will skin me alive.

699
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,110
Let’s go.

700
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,830
Let’s go down now and take them back.

701
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,110
Be careful.

702
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,040
Bai Jue, didn’t you go back?

703
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,350
I’ll take you out of here.

704
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,950
Master Tianqi!

705
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,590
I did you a great favor this time!

706
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,160
Why is there a secret room?

707
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,830
It’s just a spell.

708
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,880
Looks like Puhua did it.

709
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,880
The spell was made
based on Taoyuan Forest.

710
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,280
If I break it, I’m afraid
Taoyuan Forest will be also destroyed.

711
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,310
Don’t.

712
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,760
Yuemi really cherishes her forest.

713
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,760
If it’s destroyed,

714
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,800
she will blame me
for thousands of years.

715
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,400
Never mind. We will be trapped
for a while at most.

716
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,920
If the prankster finds
that we are trapped here,

717
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,950
he will let us out.

718
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,560
Are you meditating now?

719
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,590
There is nothing to do anyway.

720
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,070
But I don’t know how to do it.
What should I do?

721
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,280
You can take a nap.

722
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,800
I will die of boredom

723
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,830
if we are trapped here for hours.

724
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,110
Talk with me.

725
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,310
I don’t like small talk.

726
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,590
If you dare tease me again,

727
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,760
I don’t mind making you angry
one more time.

728
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Then try it.

729
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,660
♪Until I met you♪

730
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,700
♪I tried everything♪

731
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,500
♪Wait for the dawn of the next life♪

732
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,400
I didn’t do it on purpose.

733
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,560
You did.

734
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,000
I didn’t.

735
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,070
I can be easily provoked
and you know it.

736
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,660
♪Listen to it♪

737
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,060
♪We can feel each other♪

738
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,590
Why did you undo it so soon?

739
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,640
What did you say?

740
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,700
♪With a few words♪

741
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,160
I mean, after I practice
for a few more days,

742
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,590
I can break your spell

743
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,880
by myself.

744
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,920
Let me ask you.

745
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,400
Why did you let me take the credit

746
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,470
for sealing Xuanyi?

747
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,590
You are smart. Take a guess.

748
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
I won’t.

749
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,680
Childish.

750
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,230
You won’t meditate anymore?

751
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,880
Someone is too noisy.

752
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,280
It’s amazing.

753
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,040
They are so sweet.

754
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,760
It’s much more fun
than the plays in the lower realm.

755
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,670
Bai Jue, come to watch this.

756
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,710
I don’t like these stuff.

757
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,710
Don’t act coldly. Come on.

758
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,600
The so-called falling in love

759
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,950
should be like this.

760
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,910
Why is your face so red?

761
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,430
It’s hot here.

762
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,670
Are you kidding?

763
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,230
You are God of Fire.
Is heat a problem to you?

764
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,560
Let me see.

765
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,840
Where is it?

766
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,470
Even you don’t like it,
I still want to watch it.

767
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,670
Sit down and recite the formula
with me to clear your mind.

768
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,000
Right here, right now?

769
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,840
Recite the mind-clearing formula?

770
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,710
A pure heart is like water.
The pure water is like your heart.

771
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,150
There is no breeze and no waves.

772
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,910
Sit in the bamboo forest alone
and play the zither.

773
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,670
Fall in silence and meditation.

774
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,150
You want me to meditate now?

775
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,190
Fine. Well done.

776
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,230
Since there is nothing to do,

777
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,710
then let me appreciate his beauty.

778
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,950
From now on,

779
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,710
you are not allowed to be mean to me

780
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,870
and pick on me.

781
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,230
Don’t hide everything from me.

782
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,630
Got it?

783
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,670
I’d better

784
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,470
recite the mind-clearing formula.

785
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,430
The exquisite heart with seven orifices.

786
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,390
Flower and moon change with the heart.

787
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,520
The spring breeze is blowing.
Cultivating myself...

788
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,670
Cultivating...

789
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,630
It doesn’t sound like
the mind-clearing formula.

790
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,080
Is this the natal chart?

791
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,870
This place

792
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,630
should be under Puhua’s place.

793
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,870
He is in charge of
the marriage of all gods,

794
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,910
which means he can see
everyone’s natal chart.

795
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,630
And I got it out

796
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,320
by accident.

797
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,280
This is Yuemi’s natal chart.

798
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,190
The God of Flower’s natal chart.

799
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,670
Zhiyang’s...

800
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:20,950
Doesn’t it mean

801
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,470
I can see everyone’s natal chart?

802
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,870
I didn’t mean to

803
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,150
see your natal chart.

804
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,870
It’s a windfall indeed.

805
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,120
There is no reason to not see it.

806
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,390
This fierce beast harms the God Realm.

807
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,320
Bai Jue, kill it.

808
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,910
Ancestral God, I...

809
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,320
I’m afraid.

810
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,870
Turn your fear into strength.

811
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,670
If it doesn’t die, you will die.

812
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,710
Master Bai Jue wiped out

813
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,910
the nine tribes of the demons.

814
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,430
But that was really a fierce fight.

815
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,430
I guess the True God Bai Jue

816
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,630
also got his spiritual power impaired.

817
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,910
Master Bai Jue is powerful indeed.

818
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,870
He is the greatest fighter
in the God Realm.

819
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,040
Losing a little spiritual power

820
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,280
won’t cause him any harm.

821
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,360
You are right.

822
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,280
He is aloof

823
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,150
and condescending.

824
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,560
No wonder he has no friends.

825
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,950
The natal chart contains the past,

826
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,950
the present and the future of all gods.

827
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,120
Even the Ancestral God will have
a backlash for seeing it.

828
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,390
You only have little power.
How dare you see it?

829
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,470
I’m just curious

830
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,840
what you were like before I was born.

831
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,390
Are you angry?

832
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,360
Of course I am angry.

833
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,840
If you dare to act rashly again,

834
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,560
I will punish you.

835
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,080
I don’t know it’s that dangerous
to watch the natal chart.

836
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,390
I won’t do it again.

837
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,670
I just saw...

838
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,150
The Ancestral God

839
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,280
was really harsh on you
when you were a kid.

840
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,390
I’m used to it.

841
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,150
I used to be a loner.

842
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,470
And I will still be one in the future.

843
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,430
What are you doing?

844
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,870
Don’t push me away.

845
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,230
I have injuries.

846
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,560
Bai Jue.

847
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,430
Not everyone is indifferent

848
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,120
and timid in the world.
