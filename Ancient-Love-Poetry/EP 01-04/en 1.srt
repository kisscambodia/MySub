00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:28,460
=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
=Episode 1=

3
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,590
When the world appeared,

4
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,030
Ancestral God created the God Realm,
the Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm.

5
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,670
He passed on the cultivation
of spiritual power

6
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,350
before he broke the space and left.

7
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,560
The God Realm is supreme

8
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,910
where Four True Gods command
all the other Gods.

9
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,420
(Temple of Love)

10
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,800
Look.

11
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:18,840
Yuemi,

12
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,070
Qionghua Banquet is held every year.

13
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,150
What’s the fun of that?

14
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,560
But look at the Temple of Love.

15
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,950
Puhua holds the Dating Event
every thousand years.

16
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,760
Everyone in the Three Realms

17
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,590
wants to find their love in this event.

18
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,870
It’s the funniest place.

19
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,360
Here.

20
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,150
What for?

21
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:39,840
Look at them.

22
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,870
How bustling!

23
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,590
I’m looking forward to it.

24
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,030
I don’t need to cover my face.

25
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,920
(Shanggu)
I come to the lower realm

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,070
to enjoy the beautiful scenery.

27
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,400
Who just begged me

28
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,920
(Yuemi)
to cover her for coming here

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,950
and promised she would be obedient?

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,720
Soon you forgot it?

31
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,400
All right. I’ll cover my face, then.

32
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,640
Your portrait has been hung

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,790
in the middle of the Supreme God Temple.

34
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,510
If someone recognizes you

35
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,480
and tells on you to Zhiyang,

36
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,200
we’ll be in trouble.

37
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,720
Yuemi, don’t worry.

38
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,310
If there’s trouble, I’ll take the blame.

39
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,670
Look at Puhua.

40
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,870
He only drinks in the God Realm.

41
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,480
He’s holding up so many immortals.

42
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,030
Now the world is in peace.

43
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,510
Instead of cultivating themselves,

44
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,840
those in the lower realm

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
simply want love.

46
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,070
How boring and superficial!

47
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,560
Come on, Goddess of Moon & Stars.

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,070
You feel bored?

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,590
Let’s go somewhere else.

50
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
- Go.
- Don’t.

51
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,790
We’ve come already. Don’t leave.

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,360
Are you keeping something from me?

53
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,430
Don’t be absurd.

54
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,310
I was wondering on my way here

55
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,360
why you wanted to come
to the Temple of Love.

56
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,430
Turns out you have love for someone.

57
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,640
Give it back to me.

58
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,480
Tell me. Who’s he?

59
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,640
I won’t tell you.

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,790
If you like someone,

61
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,230
go ask Puhua.

62
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,200
If you’re too shy to go,

63
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,030
I can ask him for you.

64
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,360
You don’t understand.

65
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,230
Life is too long.

66
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,120
I also want someone
to divert me from boredom.

67
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,590
But over the past ten thousand years,

68
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,150
not even a single immortal
has chased me.

69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,430
In story books,

70
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,480
love lasts ten thousand years.

71
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,030
But to us,

72
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,950
it’s merely a passing moment.

73
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,310
I don’t think it’s a big deal.

74
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,000
When you fall in love,

75
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,630
you won’t sound you don’t care.

76
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,230
Fall in love?

77
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,160
I’ve learnt a new spell.

78
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,120
I’d like to help them.

79
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,120
I picked her first.

80
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,840
You!

81
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,040
What?

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,510
Let go of me!

83
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,560
Rogue!

84
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,320
Why did you touch me?

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,840
How impolite!

86
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,320
What?

87
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,790
Puhua taught me the spell personally.

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,470
Why did I use it so poorly?

89
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,880
You have little spiritual power.

90
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,950
You certainly used it poorly.

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,070
Let go of me!

92
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,160
What are you doing?

93
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,790
What do you want?

94
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,600
Do something!

95
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,630
Zhiyang will know!

96
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,600
Girl. Girl. Girl.

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,000
Girl, you look so beautiful.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,950
How do I look?

99
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,790
Wait for me.

100
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,350
Girl.

101
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,560
Girl, here I am.

102
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,070
Shanggu.

103
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,280
Girl? Girl?

104
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,440
Where’s she?

105
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,120
Where’s she gone?

106
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,750
Girl.

107
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,840
When the primordial world
came into being,

108
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,470
When the primordial world
came into being,

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,630
Ancestral God created the God Realm,

110
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,750
Ancestral God created the God Realm,

111
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,000
and generated spirits
with the Power of Chaos.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,790
and generated spirits
with the Power of Chaos.

113
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,720
Spirits fell in the lower realm,

114
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,600
Spirits fell in the lower realm,

115
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
the Heavenly Realm emerged
after a hundred thousand years.

116
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,510
the Heavenly Realm emerged
after a hundred thousand years.

117
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,440
- Master.
- Master.

118
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,000
(Bai Jue)

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,670
What did I say

120
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,950
in the first class?

121
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,630
Be sincere in study and don’t be late.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,400
Gods and immortals can do as they like.

123
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,950
But they can’t break rules.

124
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,320
Master, we didn’t mean to be late.

125
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,280
Today, a girl jostled

126
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,440
in the Milky Way.

127
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,470
Instead of reflecting on yourselves,
you blamed others.

128
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,560
How can you be immortals?

129
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,560
You were held up,

130
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,910
but I taught you Riding with Sword

131
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,560
three months ago.

132
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,470
Why didn’t you use it?

133
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,910
Sorry, but I’m a little rusty.

134
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,040
Then why didn’t you practice it?

135
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,630
Follow up.

136
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,320
Are you scared?

137
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,720
Yes.

138
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,910
Practice more

139
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,400
and you’ll no longer be scared.

140
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,440
Yes.

141
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,750
Go reflect on yourselves.

142
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,280
Now that you’ve come,

143
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,880
why bother to hide?

144
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,320
I had thought

145
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,910
teaching little immortals
could make you gentler.

146
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,670
(Tianqi)
But you still have the same temper.

147
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,750
Be quick.

148
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,840
What can an uncommunicative man

149
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
teach you?

150
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,880
When cultivating to be a God,

151
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,840
you should enjoy yourselves

152
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,510
like I do.

153
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,120
Today,

154
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,320
I’d like to show you.

155
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,790
Watch carefully!

156
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,040
What are you laughing at?

157
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,480
I’m simply thirsty.

158
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,430
Bai Jue,

159
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,630
fight me after I drink enough wine.

160
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,920
Master Tianqi, we fight with hands,

161
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,070
but only boast with the mouth.

162
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,950
Yeah!

163
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,870
Yeah.

164
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,680
Fire Beast, you’re quite talkative.

165
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,040
I’m not the Fire Beast! I’m Kylin!

166
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,310
Come on. Heat the wine for me.

167
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,750
Master, look.

168
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,400
Master Tianqi...

169
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,720
Class is over.

170
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,510
Hongri, take them back for some rest.

171
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,840
Yes.

172
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,840
Ice Cube.

173
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,680
It’s the fur of the Nine-tailed Fox.

174
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,310
It was a kind of fierce beast

175
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,950
when Ancestral God created
the Heavenly Realm. You hunted it?

176
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,950
I just did some exercise
in my spare time.

177
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,720
Why did you only
prepare gifts for Zhiyang?

178
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,680
Help yourself to the wine.

179
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,990
I knew it.

180
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,800
You must be missing us
over the past ten thousand years.

181
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,870
If you come to see how I’m doing,

182
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,800
you can leave.

183
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,550
I can’t.

184
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,110
I come to bring you back.

185
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,110
I’ve sent you
countless instruction feathers

186
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,550
over the past years,

187
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,190
but you gave me the cold shoulder.

188
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,240
It’s Shanggu’s ten thousandth birthday
next month.

189
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,750
Since she was born
on the Heaven & Earth Platform,

190
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,070
you have never seen her.

191
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,950
In this world,
only we four are True Gods

192
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,630
who were born by the world itself.

193
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,480
It’s time for you to come back.

194
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,680
She’s still young,
considering her life span.

195
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,160
We’ll meet sooner or later.

196
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,750
No rush.

197
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,070
It’s not up to you.

198
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,980
(Bai Jue, you have to come back
for Shanggu’s birthday, Zhiyang.)

199
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,550
This is the order from Zhiyang.

200
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,630
He summoned you

201
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,630
to the ten thousandth birthday
of Chief God of Chaos.

202
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Anyway,

203
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,870
she’s the future Chief God of Chaos.

204
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,070
If you don’t go,
those old Gods will think

205
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,720
you disrespect her.

206
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,240
Besides, Shanggu is...

207
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,990
I’m not finished yet.

208
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,840
Listen.

209
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,510
If you dare to help her
hoodwink me again,

210
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,280
leave the God Realm
and start over your cultivation!

211
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,550
Yes, Master.

212
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,280
Looks like Zhiyang is really angry.

213
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,630
Do you remember you were punished

214
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,750
with three thunder strikes
for making wrong comments on reports.

215
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,750
I never forget!
I laid in bed for a month.

216
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,240
As far as I see,

217
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,310
you’ll lie in bed
for two months this time.

218
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:14,990
Don’t be scared.

219
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,870
You’ve got a good idea?

220
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,430
I don’t.

221
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,480
But I can go to the lower realm

222
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
and get you some story books

223
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,190
to divert you from boredom
when you lie in bed for recovery.

224
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,630
Don’t be sarcastic.

225
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,400
You think I’m really afraid of Zhiyang?

226
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,800
Punishment isn’t a problem,
but I’ll feel disgraced.

227
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,680
Now that you went
to the Temple of Love with me,

228
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,040
I’ll remain faithful.

229
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,950
I’ll take the thunder strikes for you.

230
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,430
No.

231
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,040
I answer for my own fault.

232
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,190
Shall I go out and hide for a moment?

233
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,070
After Zhiyang calms down,

234
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,160
the punishment
will be cut half, at least.

235
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,510
My girl,

236
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,950
everyone in the God Realm
is looking for you.

237
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,070
Where do you think you can hide?

238
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,510
There’s an empty hall over there.

239
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,310
Changyuan Hall?

240
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,400
That’s where Bai Jue lives.

241
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,110
He’s not a man to mess with.
You can’t go.

242
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,950
Don’t be scared!
He’s been in the lower realm

243
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,840
for ten thousand years
and he won’t be back soon.

244
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,630
It’s an empty hall, anyway.

245
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,600
Ancestral God, bless us.
Don’t let Bai Jue come back.

246
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,360
Zhiyang!

247
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,720
Have you found Shanggu?

248
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,990
Bai Jue?

249
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,510
(Zhiyang)
Hope you’re all well.

250
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,600
Don’t get yourself embarrassed.

251
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,840
He’s greatly improved his cultivation

252
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,040
and fought me when he first saw me.

253
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,280
He’s still so competitive.

254
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,680
It’s the birthday gift
for the Chief God of Chaos.

255
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,310
Let me have a look.

256
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,720
A birthday peach?

257
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,190
You grew the peach tree?

258
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,800
There’re peach trees on Mount Lookout.

259
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,800
You simply picked one?

260
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,920
What’s the difference?

261
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,160
I have something else to do
in the Heavenly Realm. See you.

262
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,920
Bai Jue.

263
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,950
I know you don’t like to socialize.

264
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,190
I didn’t simply

265
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,070
summon you

266
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,680
for Shanggu’s birthday.

267
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,950
Not for her birthday?

268
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,240
Then why did you get him back?

269
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,720
Shanggu was born

270
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,550
with blocked God vessels
and little spiritual power.

271
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,040
She can’t cultivate
the unique Power of Chaos.

272
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,950
I want you to stay in the God Realm

273
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,600
and teach her personally.

274
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,950
Why...? Why do you want that?

275
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,480
Bai Jue is so stubborn.

276
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,630
How can Shanggu bear with that?

277
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,550
Besides,

278
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,310
I watched Shanggu grow up.

279
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,800
I should teach her!

280
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,430
Tianqi is naughty,

281
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,040
but he’s good enough
to teach a ten-thousand-year-old girl.

282
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,720
Bai Jue made sense.

283
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,990
Bai Jue,

284
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,750
if Shanggu learns from Tianqi
to be so arrogant,

285
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
the God Realm will be in danger
even before the invasion of Demons.

286
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,680
Danger? Why would that happen?

287
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,800
Can I break the God Realm?

288
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,720
Shut up!

289
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:22,480
Bai Jue,

290
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,990
among us three,

291
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,400
only you can make her vessels
no longer blocked.

292
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,870
Not interested.

293
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,800
I’m interested.

294
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,870
Shut up!

295
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,750
Bai Jue.

296
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,600
All right.

297
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,920
There’s something
you’ll know sooner or later.

298
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,920
Come with me.

299
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,750
Since when did the barrier
of the Nether World split?

300
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,160
Since last month,

301
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,920
the Power of Chaos has begun to vanish.

302
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,430
Do you know?

303
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,600
The barrier of the Nether World contains
the Power of Chaos of the Ancestral God.

304
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,360
When the Power of Chaos began to vanish,

305
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,110
the barrier will be totally split
sooner or later.

306
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,600
Once the Nether World is open,

307
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,800
there’ll be a great disturbance.

308
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,510
Maybe it’s the destiny

309
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,040
that Shanggu didn't have unblocked God vessels.

310
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,110
Even if you don’t want
to bother about Demons,

311
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,870
don’t you remember
the Tribulation of Chaos?

312
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,840
It’s coming in a thousand years.

313
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,190
Only the Chief God of Chaos
can fight it.

314
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,800
But we don’t even know

315
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,400
what the Tribulation of Chaos is.

316
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,550
How can a young girl like her fight it?

317
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,870
That’s why I want you to teach her.

318
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,600
It’s about the peace of the God Realm.

319
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,430
For the sake
of Ancestral God’s last wish.

320
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,800
If the Tribulation of Chaos comes,

321
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,070
I’ll fight with my life
to defend the God Realm.

322
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,190
The disaster is coming to the God Realm.

323
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,990
It reminds me of the old years!

324
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,400
Tianqi,

325
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,070
do you remember the first time

326
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,550
the Ancestral God took us
to the battlefield?

327
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,720
It’s still vivid in my mind.
Bai Jue even...

328
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,600
Zhiyang,

329
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,280
we’re no longer young.

330
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,440
Don’t bring it up again.

331
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,870
If immortals of the low class know it,

332
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,470
he’ll be laughed at in the Three Realms.

333
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,960
How humiliated he’ll be!

334
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,160
You swore you wouldn’t bring it up.

335
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,280
Sorry, sorry.

336
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,110
It’s my fault.

337
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,870
We didn’t mean that. Never mind.

338
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,320
What’s Shanggu like?

339
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:28,590
Shanggu?

340
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,630
She’s submissive and hardworking.

341
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,320
She’s also smart

342
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,830
and never makes trouble.

343
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,200
If she didn't have unblocked God vessels,

344
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,110
she would have taken control
of the instruction feather of Chief God.

345
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:41,920
Seriously?

346
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,870
Yes.

347
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,710
I’m used to quietness
in the past ten thousand years.

348
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,320
All right.

349
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,630
I promise to keep your hall
from being disturbed,

350
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,920
especially by Goddesses.

351
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
I can’t help her much.

352
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,080
It mostly depends on her.

353
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,590
It’s a deal, then.

354
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,680
You mustn’t regret!

355
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,680
Why didn’t you tell him

356
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,630
Shanggu’s real temper?

357
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,920
What were you laughing at?

358
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,750
You kept making trouble!

359
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,590
It’s you who spoilt Shanggu!

360
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,710
I laughed?

361
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,920
Shanggu,

362
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,800
you always make trouble
though you mean good.

363
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
When you tried to help Zhiyang,

364
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,280
you made wrong comments on the reports.

365
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,350
When you wanted to be a matchmaker
for immortals,

366
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,680
you made trouble again.

367
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,400
Is there something wrong with your mind?

368
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,350
Isn’t that the Goddess of Snow?

369
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,160
Why is she coming to Changyuan Hall?

370
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,920
Try hard to be in full bloom.

371
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,920
(Xueying)
When Master Bai Jue comes back,

372
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,990
he’ll be happy to see you in full bloom.

373
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,590
It’s been ten thousand years
since Bai Jue left,

374
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,560
but the Goddess of Snow
is still waiting.

375
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,160
What a touching affection!

376
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,230
Who’s there?

377
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,920
Master Bai Jue?

378
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,440
Greetings, Master.

379
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,470
He’s Bai Jue?

380
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,920
It’s been ten thousand years,
and you still look the same.

381
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,470
Why are you here?

382
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,590
Master, I know you like Blue Flowers.

383
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,990
When you were away,

384
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,350
I was taking care of them here,

385
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,400
so that you can see the same scene

386
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,920
when you come back.

387
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,400
Master.

388
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,200
I said that

389
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,350
without permission,

390
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,400
no one is allowed in my hall.

391
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,990
You broke my rule deliberately.

392
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,710
Go take three thunder strikes.

393
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,560
How merciless he is!

394
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,560
Does it hurt?

395
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,230
No.

396
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,560
Looks like I need
to grow the tree taller

397
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,960
in case someone peeps again.

398
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,830
I peeped you?

399
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,200
I don’t want to know who you are.
Please leave.

400
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,230
And you.

401
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,630
Wait.

402
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,230
The Goddess of Snow made great efforts
to grow the flowers,

403
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,680
and you just fired them?

404
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,400
How impersonal you are!

405
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,230
I’m a God. Why must I be personal?

406
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,920
You!

407
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,110
This is my hall.

408
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,920
I can fire anything as I wish.

409
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,990
What does it concern you?

410
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,830
I, Shanggu, concern about everything
in the God Realm.

411
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,350
Shanggu?

412
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,560
Greetings, Your Grace.

413
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,080
Don’t worry, Goddess of Snow.

414
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,710
I’ll bring you justice.

415
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,160
Tomorrow morning, I’ll degrade him
to the lower realm.

416
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,320
You think you can?

417
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,710
Yes!

418
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,080
Let go of me! What are you doing?

419
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,440
Let go of me!

420
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,800
Rogue!

421
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,830
Why are you so rude?

422
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,630
What’s going on?

423
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,710
Shouldn’t you be degraded?

424
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,800
I was trying to bring love
to the Heavenly Realm.

425
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,160
I just didn’t expect some accidents.

426
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,350
You abused your spiritual power
and disturbed the Heavenly Realm.

427
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,320
You’re not only weak,

428
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,080
but also irresponsible.

429
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,800
Do you think you’re better?

430
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,560
You have a good appearance,

431
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,400
but you’re indeed merciless.

432
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,440
What bad luck
does the Goddess of Snow have

433
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,590
to like you?

434
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,590
You knew yourself well enough

435
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,560
so that you didn’t come back.

436
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,320
Even when a God like you breathes

437
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,630
in front of me,

438
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,630
I’m afraid you’ll stain the air.

439
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:57,920
What are you doing?

440
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,440
I’m the future Chief God of Chaos.

441
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,960
Tianqi brought you up, didn’t he?

442
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,200
Yes, so what?

443
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,350
You’ve only learned bad habits.

444
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,160
Put me down!

445
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,040
What are you doing?

446
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,470
Put me down!

447
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,230
Today,

448
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,560
you were absent from Qionghua Banquet
and disturbed the Temple of Love.

449
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,350
You should be punished
with ten thunder strikes.

450
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,630
How dare you! Put me down!

451
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,590
Zhiyang deceived me to be your teacher.

452
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,160
He even told me
you were submissive and hardworking.

453
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,710
I hope

454
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,230
you won’t let him down.

455
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,110
Go tell Zhiyang

456
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,710
I punished you for him.
And he’s welcome.

457
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,160
Bai Jue, wait and see!

458
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,830
I’ll let you know
who reigns the God Realm!

459
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,080
I don’t know

460
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,350
why those Goddesses like Bai Jue.

461
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,830
For his long face?

462
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,230
For his reprimand?

463
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,470
Or for his frequent punishment?

464
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,800
The Goddess of Snow is so beautiful,

465
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,990
but he turns her down.

466
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,680
In story books,

467
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,470
love once begun, will never end.

468
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,590
If I fall in love with such a bad man,

469
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,400
I’ll be screwed.

470
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Yeah. Bai Jue is so cold.

471
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,400
He can’t be as popular

472
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,200
as Tianqi.

473
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,830
Let alone Tianqi...

474
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,470
Think about Zhiyang.
The Ancestral God is our father.

475
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,440
And we were all bred
between the heaven and earth.

476
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,320
I’m the only loser.

477
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,230
They’re all powerful.

478
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,080
Is the Ancestral God not my real father?

479
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,830
My poor girl,

480
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,080
you have poor power, but a noble status.

481
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,510
You’re underestimated.

482
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,870
Yuemi, you’re the best to me.

483
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,280
You never want me to suffer, right?

484
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,750
Are you done?

485
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,560
Get to the point.

486
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,990
How do you want me to help again?

487
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,110
Help me to pull down Changyuan Hall.

488
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,400
- I’ve got something else to do.
- Yuemi!

489
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,040
Dear girl,

490
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,870
he’s Bai Jue,

491
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,750
the most powerful True God.

492
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,440
I can’t fight him,
even if I had tenfold power.

493
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,080
You can’t see me
be annoyed to death, can you?

494
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,630
Shall we ask Zhiyang

495
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,960
for some advice?

496
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,320
What happened?

497
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,320
I was reviewing the reports.

498
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,080
Why did you get me here
from Chaos Hall?

499
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,710
Look at her.

500
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,560
She was annoyed for the whole night

501
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,470
and had nothing to eat.

502
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,870
She even threatened to kill herself.

503
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,590
Who did that?

504
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,680
Who else could it be?

505
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,590
The God you got back.

506
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,870
Dear girl,

507
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,230
why are you eating nothing?

508
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,590
Yuemi, go get her

509
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,960
the Sweet Juice.

510
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,440
All right.

511
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,590
Don’t bother. I won’t eat anything.

512
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,320
I’m fine.

513
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,110
I’m alright. Alright.

514
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,230
Who bullied you?

515
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,830
Tell me and I’ll defend you.

516
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,560
Bai Jue, or who else?

517
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,710
He did something wrong first.

518
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,080
I reprimanded him a little.

519
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,160
Guess what?

520
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,080
In the face of Xueying,

521
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,230
he kicked me out of Changyuan Hall.

522
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,230
Expel him
from the God Realm immediately.

523
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,200
If he isn’t expelled,

524
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,080
I’ll starve myself to death.

525
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,590
Bai Jue?

526
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,230
You don’t want to?

527
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,920
I don’t mean that.

528
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,320
But it’s kind of a tough job.

529
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,400
Tough?

530
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,920
What makes it tough?

531
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,350
Everyone in the God Realm obeys you!

532
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,200
Are you partial to him, instead of me?

533
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:19,750
My little girl,

534
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,870
I’m certainly partial to you, right?

535
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,080
Shanggu, I don’t mean not to help you.

536
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,110
But Bai Jue is also the True God.

537
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,510
He’s as noble as me in the God Realm.

538
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,960
I can’t win if he fights me.

539
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,590
Unless the God Realm collapses,

540
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,750
I can’t expel him.

541
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,590
Don’t you...?

542
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,230
Don’t you have another option?

543
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,160
There is.

544
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,470
What is it?

545
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,040
Shanggu, you can improve yourself,

546
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,680
master the Power of Chaos,

547
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,280
take control of the instruction feather
of Chief God

548
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,590
and be the Chief God of Chaos.

549
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,040
When you’re the Chief God of Chaos,

550
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,710
you can not only expel him,

551
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,440
but also make him do whatever you want.

552
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Good idea.

553
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,350
Zhiyang, it’s a good idea.

554
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,800
But...

555
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,710
I can’t do it in a short time, can I?

556
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,560
It’s not hard.

557
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,960
Learn all his skills.

558
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,320
After you succeed,

559
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,440
let’s fight him together

560
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,280
and expel him immediately.

561
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,590
Yeah.

562
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,080
When you come back
after completing your study,

563
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,960
no one dares to bully you again.

564
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,400
How could I learn from him?

565
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,470
Who am I? The Chief God of Chaos.

566
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,870
If I call him Master,

567
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,200
how disgraced I’ll be!

568
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,200
Shanggu!

569
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,350
Forget it.

570
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Bai Jue was really out of line.

571
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,800
I’ll go to Changyuan Hall with you
and fight him.

572
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,440
If we fail,

573
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,110
I’ll run away with you.

574
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,510
Even if we have to
be unidentified immortals,

575
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,590
I will not let you suffer

576
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,320
in Changyuan Hall.

577
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,750
Be unidentified immortals?

578
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,630
How can you be unidentified immortals?

579
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,400
Considering Shanggu’s temper,

580
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,560
if she becomes an unidentified immortal,

581
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,440
she’ll be bullied, won’t she?

582
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,750
Hurry. Get packed for her

583
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
and send her to Puhua Cave

584
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,440
to be a matchmaker.

585
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,320
After you go to the lower realm,

586
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,630
it won’t be long

587
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,590
before you become
a respectable immortal.

588
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,710
I...

589
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,400
But...

590
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,110
But what?

591
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,280
You’re totally incompatible
with Bai Jue.

592
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,230
I won’t let you suffer.

593
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,320
I...

594
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,590
I what?

595
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,350
To live a comfortable life,

596
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,320
work for Puhua
and be an Immortal of Love.

597
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,200
I...

598
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,870
Yuemi, this is my home.

599
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,870
I’m not going anywhere.

600
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,750
It’s a deal, then.

601
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,920
I won’t let you meet Bai Jue again.

602
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,470
I won’t let you suffer at all.

603
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,320
Yuemi, get packed for her

604
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,710
and send her to Puhua Cave.

605
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,830
Wait, wait. I’ll go.

606
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,320
Go what?

607
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,160
I’ll go to Changyuan Hall
for cultivation.

608
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,280
In such a long life,

609
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,230
I believe I’ll learn all his skills

610
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,280
and expel him from the God Realm.

611
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,830
All right. Put on your shoes.

612
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,230
My girl, just sit down.

613
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,400
Be careful not to catch a cold.

614
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:16,540
(Changyuan Hall)

615
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,510
Look how naughty you are.

616
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,630
You come to see your teacher.

617
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,160
It’s my first day for classes,

618
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,160
I must be respected.

619
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,320
Last time, he kicked me out.

620
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,350
This time,

621
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,080
he must invite me in respectfully.

622
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,710
Greetings, Master Bai Jue.

623
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,510
Why are you bowing? Raise your heads.

624
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,040
Why are you bowing? Raise your heads.

625
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,630
Stop. Are you coming to be a disciple

626
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
or to screw the place?

627
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,560
Go. Be quick.

628
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,110
I’m here to learn skills from you,
Master Bai Jue.

629
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,400
Please kindly teach me.

630
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,320
Zhiyang told me that

631
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,400
you promised to teach me.

632
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,440
You’re the True God.

633
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,160
You won’t break your promise, will you?

634
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,510
I can teach you,

635
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,990
but you must promise three things.

636
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,320
Specifically?

637
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,800
I’ll even accept thirty things.

638
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,680
Take off your cloak.

639
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,080
Yuemi, did you hear that?

640
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,960
He asked me to take off my cloak.
How impolite!

641
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,990
Dear, bear with it.

642
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,870
In my place,

643
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,560
there’s no Chief God or Her Grace.

644
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,510
Take off your cloak of the Chief God

645
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,280
and wear plain dresses.
Until you leave my place,

646
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,320
you’re still an Attendant God

647
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,870
in Changyuan Hall.

648
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,320
Are you alright with it?

649
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,470
Bai Jue,

650
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,960
- Shanggu is...
- All right.

651
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,320
I will take it off.

652
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,510
I haven’t had the Power of Chaos yet

653
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,990
and I’m not the real Chief God.

654
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,200
Now that I’ve never enjoyed the status,

655
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
what’s the problem with taking it off?

656
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,870
What are you doing?

657
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,960
When you cultivate yourself here,
you mustn’t be distracted.

658
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,710
Destroy them and never touch them again.

659
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,990
Can you do that?

660
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,680
I’ve been carrying them
since I was little.

661
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,870
I can stop carrying them.
Why must them be destroyed?

662
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,800
When you want something,
you abandon something else.

663
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,280
If you can’t abandon
such prosaic things,

664
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,920
how can you be the Chief God?

665
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,710
Why don’t you be a joke?

666
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,470
If you don’t want to do that, leave.

667
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,280
I never teach anyone unwitting.

668
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,590
I’ll destroy them. I will.

669
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,510
Now that you can abandon them,

670
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,110
come on in.

671
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
You can really abandon them?

672
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,990
Bai Jue is right.

673
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,960
I must abandon something
for something else.

674
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,350
When I learn all skills from him,

675
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,440
I’ll first pull down his hall

676
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,470
to avenge all my treasure.

677
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,920
There’s the third thing to do.

678
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,470
How arrogant you are!

679
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,960
I guess you’ll no longer enjoy yourself.

680
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,680
Are you sincere to learn from me?

681
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,510
Yes. I’m completely sincere.

682
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,830
I’m not!

683
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Who wants to always see your cold face?

684
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,440
Don’t put on an act.

685
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,400
When I become the Chief God,

686
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,830
I’ll torture you as I wish.

687
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,440
My salute to you, Master.

688
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,710
Comfortable, isn’t it?

689
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,470
A noble girl like me
respects you so much.

690
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,830
Even your Changyuan Hall is honored.

691
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,630
Honored?

692
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,350
You used Mind Reading on me?
How shameless!

693
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,750
You say you respect me,
but curse me in your heart.

694
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,110
Does it make you not shameless?

695
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,040
When I curse you a little,

696
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,200
does it really hurt you?

697
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,200
It’ll be your real power

698
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,400
if you can do what you want to do.

699
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,830
I’m waiting until you become
the Chief God

700
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,630
and torture me as you wish.

701
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,440
You sealed my spiritual power?

702
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,800
That’s the third thing.

703
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,920
Forget about your tiny power.

704
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,470
Now that you’ll learn from me,

705
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,080
you must obey my rules.

706
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Come at seven tomorrow morning
and don’t be late.

707
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,920
What do you mean?

708
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,750
Master said that when you’re staying
in Changyuan Hall,

709
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,990
you’ll serve as the Attendant God
of the lowest level.

710
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,280
Every day, you can learn from me

711
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,750
the basic attending skills.

712
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,110
You’re simply his Spirit Beast.
Why do you think you can command me?

713
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,630
Master said that

714
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,870
you weren’t the Chief God in this place.

715
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,470
I take care of Changyuan Hall.

716
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,350
I’ll certainly teach you first

717
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,510
and you shall learn from me.

718
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,990
You’re obviously embarrassing me.

719
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,710
Where’s Bai Jue? I want to see him.

720
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,040
Master also said that

721
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,960
if you’re satisfied with anything,

722
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,440
you can leave

723
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,160
and you shall never come back

724
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,110
for cultivation.

725
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,750
I love sweeping.

726
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,400
I don’t like to get close to anyone.

727
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,110
Tianqi, behave yourself.

728
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,070
How did you do that?

729
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,440
What?

730
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,870
She’s sweeping the floor for you?

731
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,790
Work carefully!

732
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,870
Submissive

733
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,830
and hardworking.

734
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,720
Smart and never makes trouble?

735
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,400
Blame the one who said it.

736
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,920
Zhiyang said it.

737
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,830
If she weren’t important for our future,

738
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,350
do you think she could be admitted
to my place

739
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,000
considering her temper?

740
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,240
Bai Jue, Shanggu isn’t that bad.

741
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,960
You simply met her a couple of times.

742
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,630
After you get familiar with her,

743
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,160
you’ll know she’s innocent and lovely.

744
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,520
Innocent and lovely?

745
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,400
Yeah.

746
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Will that enhance her spiritual power?

747
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,240
Or will it make her bear responsibility?

748
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,760
You!

749
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,590
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

750
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,310
Come on. Have some water.

751
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,030
I didn’t mean that.

752
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,760
I really didn’t mean that.

753
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,270
Bai Jue,

754
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,550
you’re embarrassing me.

755
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,830
After I complete my study,

756
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,590
I’ll expel you from the God Realm!

757
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,200
This is the only existing copy
that Master most appreciates.

758
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,830
How can you...?

759
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,550
What do we do?

760
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,000
It’s from Yuemi. Enjoy it.

761
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,270
What an ugly handwriting!

762
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,790
Come on. Read it and I’ll carve.

763
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:19,870
Get up.

764
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,110
What? I learned writing from Zhiyang.

765
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,070
You don’t want it?

766
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,790
Are you trying to be indolent

767
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,790
so that I have to do all the work
in the yard?

768
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,550
I’m not!

769
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,270
Then get up and read.

770
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,680
It’s too good for your master.

771
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,680
Look and learn.

772
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,720
Master.

773
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,550
Come with me, Shanggu.

774
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,590
How much do you know
about the Three Realms?

775
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
It’s an easy question.

776
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,590
I don’t like cultivation,

777
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,550
but I like plays and story books.

778
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,270
As for the Three Realms...

779
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,960
Seventy thousand years ago,

780
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,270
the Ancestral God divided the world
into three parts.

781
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,630
In the Nether World
of the Extreme North,

782
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,240
God of Devil and Devils are imprisoned.

783
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,720
Where the Nether World is contiguous
to Immortals and Demons

784
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,550
has been sealed
with the Barrier of Chaos

785
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,350
and totally isolated.

786
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,070
Immortals live in the southwest.

787
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,400
There are many blessed caves

788
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,070
where many immortals and immortal clans
have come into being.

789
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,070
Demons live in the southeast.

790
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,960
They’re mostly spiritual beings
who live in groups.

791
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,000
It’s been days since you came.

792
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,030
If you pass the exam today,

793
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,350
I’ll formally teach you spells
and universe rules.

794
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,960
Are you serious?

795
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,720
This is the Red Blood Forest
where Tiger Demons live.

796
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,270
There’s thin spiritual power here
and it’s hard for cultivation.

797
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,720
Tiger Demons suffer from that.

798
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,790
If you manage to make them smile,

799
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,000
you’ll pass the exam.

800
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,830
Isn’t that too hard?

801
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,200
Most Tiger Demons are serious men.

802
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,520
I’m not an acrobat.

803
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,550
Even if I’m a God,

804
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,480
I can’t manipulate others’ emotions.

805
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,590
As the Chief God,

806
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,110
you must keep everyone happy and safe.

807
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,590
If you can’t even do this,

808
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,270
how will you take on
heavy responsibilities?

809
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,960
You’re my teacher.

810
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,440
You should have taught me
how to solve problems.

811
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,030
But you set a difficult problem
to humiliate me.

812
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,550
If you think I can’t make it,

813
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,630
you can resign to Zhiyang.

814
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,110
Why do you pretend you’re teaching me?

815
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,550
I don’t mean to set a difficult problem.

816
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,960
I simply overestimated you.

817
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:27,870
Forget it.

818
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,030
I’ll give you an easier exam.

819
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,200
Go get something
from the Red Blood Forest.

820
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,790
Wait.

821
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,400
Such an easy job to placate Tiger Demons

822
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,480
will not frustrate me.

823
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,070
In case of difficulty,
you shouldn’t easily give up.

824
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,960
Save your breath. Just wait and see.

825
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
Shanggu, what happened?

826
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,310
Tell me.

827
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,200
Did Bai Jue embarrass you again?

828
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,790
He’s always hard to get close to.

829
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,070
All these years, no one gets to him,

830
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,350
except Hongri.

831
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,240
When you learn from him,

832
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,630
you will suffer.

833
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,000
Don’t take it seriously.

834
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,000
Tomorrow is your birthday.

835
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,400
You like the buzz.

836
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
Shall I hold a big party for you?

837
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,110
If you feel bored

838
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,310
and don’t want to take classes,

839
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,920
today is the spring day of Demons,

840
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,310
where demon flowers bloom,

841
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,000
let me take you for a walk there.

842
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,000
Demons?

843
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,960
Yeah, you’re a Demon God.

844
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,310
I should have asked you.

845
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,520
Tianqi,

846
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,680
do you know how to make a demon happy?

847
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,870
Make a demon happy?

848
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,000
We demons are straightforward and loyal.

849
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,030
Give him the sincerest care.

850
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,030
The sincerest care?

851
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,550
For example,

852
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,310
hug him.

853
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,000
The sincerest care?

854
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,000
Your Grace.

855
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,030
Greetings, Your Grace.

856
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,310
Don’t bother. You may rise.

857
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,030
Your Grace, tomorrow is your birthday.

858
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,200
We know you don’t like cultivation.

859
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,030
So, we prepared you some novelties.

860
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,520
We wonder if you’ll like them.

861
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,030
I will.

862
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,160
What you offer me every time

863
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,720
always makes me happy.

864
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,720
Have a look, Your Grace.

865
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,920
It took us a long time to prepare them.

866
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,520
A long time?

867
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,830
You’re so serious

868
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,790
for my ten thousandth birthday?

869
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,070
Is it because

870
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,070
you’ve earned too much offering?

871
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,920
Don’t tease us, Your Grace.

872
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,830
We’re not God of Love or Wealth.

873
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:48,960
We won’t have too much offering.

874
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,680
Your birthday is a great event
in the God Realm.

875
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,440
We should be serious.

876
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,350
Yes, yes.

877
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,200
I’ll accept them, then.

878
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,870
But gifts blind eyes.

879
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,830
What do you want from me? Tell me.

880
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:00,630
We...

881
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,000
If you want nothing, I’ll go.

882
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,070
Your Grace,

883
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,440
I do want to ask you for a favor.

884
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,480
Go ahead.

885
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,520
We quite admire Master Bai Jue.

886
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,030
Unfortunately, no stranger is allowed
to enter Changyuan hall.

887
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,240
Now, you’re cultivating yourself there.

888
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,110
Your Grace,

889
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,310
for the sake of our admiration
for Master Bai Jue,

890
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,310
- please help us...
- Be a matchmaker for you?

891
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,240
I never expected to do what Puhua does

892
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,110
when I’m in Changyuan Hall.

893
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,310
How unexpected!

894
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,070
Tell me.

895
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,870
What makes you like that cold God?

896
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,270
What makes you?

897
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,000
