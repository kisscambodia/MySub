00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,160
I never expected to do what Puhua does

4
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,950
when I’m in Changyuan Hall.

5
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,230
How unexpected!

6
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,870
Tell me.

7
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,760
What makes you like that cold God?

8
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,270
What makes you?

9
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,040
I don’t understand.

10
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:58,760
Never mind.

11
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,230
For the sake of your gifts,

12
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,760
I have a reason to help you.

13
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,080
Thank you, Your Grace.

14
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,390
Enjoy the tea, please, Master.

15
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,190
Hongri, get out of the way!

16
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,270
I won’t.

17
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,190
Then don’t blame us for being rude!

18
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,880
Master, I used three barriers.

19
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,800
I really don’t know how they got in.

20
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,470
Where’s Shanggu? She isn’t back yet?

21
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,360
Since you asked Her Grace

22
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,880
to solve the problem of Tiger Demons,

23
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,800
Her Grace came back a few times,

24
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,240
but didn’t stay for long.

25
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,440
Maybe she’s trying to solve the problem.

26
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,440
Go get packed and we’ll go
to the lower realm tomorrow.

27
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,910
What about Her Grace’s birthday?
You won’t go to the party?

28
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,600
I don’t like the buzz.

29
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,240
But you should at least
go and greet her.

30
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,800
This morning,

31
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,470
I prepared the washing water for Master.

32
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,360
He looked at me a few times.

33
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,720
What makes you so proud?

34
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,520
I saw his handwriting.

35
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,720
Did you see it?

36
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,080
When he was doing the calligraphy,

37
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,440
he looked so handsome and attractive.

38
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,600
That’s nothing.

39
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,550
The Goddess of Snow even danced for him.

40
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,550
She did?

41
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,390
I heard the music
Master played last night.

42
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,830
They made a perfect couple.

43
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,630
Her Grace helped us

44
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,110
to get close to Master.

45
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,320
Her birthday party is about to begin.

46
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,670
Let’s get in for celebration.

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,790
Yeah.

48
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,670
I’ve got a better gift for her.

49
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,350
Maybe,

50
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,350
it’ll be us

51
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,200
who can approach Master tomorrow.

52
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,110
Your Grace, happy birthday.

53
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,040
Bai Jue.

54
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Greetings, Master Bai Jue.

55
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,670
I’ll ask Zhiyang
to issue an instruction feather.

56
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,160
From this day on,

57
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,510
you mustn’t enter Changyuan Hall.

58
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,390
You’re the Chief God of Chaos,

59
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,000
but you sold me out

60
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,230
for such vulgar things.

61
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,670
What a joke!

62
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,350
And you.

63
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,440
Leave with your vulgar gifts.

64
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,270
- Yes.
- Yes.

65
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,040
Those are gifts for me.
Why can you decide?

66
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,480
Right.

67
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,110
I can’t be a teacher

68
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,320
for a vulgarian like you.

69
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,880
After I leave,

70
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,320
go explain to Zhiyang yourself.

71
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,510
Never see you again.

72
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,390
Behave yourself, Your Grace.

73
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,720
This time,

74
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,720
you really disappointed Master.

75
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,920
Forget it.

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,000
We’re used to Master’s coldness
over the years.

77
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,510
He’s been so cold
in the past ten thousand years.

78
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,920
Her Grace was scolded most.

79
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,640
Why do you feel so sad?

80
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,550
Master... Master...

81
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,270
He banned me
from entering his hall again.

82
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,000
Look at your tears. What happened?

83
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,790
For your information, Master,

84
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,000
at Her Grace’s birthday party,

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,640
Master Bai Jue flew into a rage

86
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,640
and banned us
from entering his hall again.

87
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,480
Well,

88
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,000
he never has compassion for girls.

89
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,350
You know what?

90
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,830
Don’t take it seriously.

91
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,230
But he’s serious this time.

92
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,670
Even Her Grace was scolded.

93
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,270
What? Even Shanggu was scolded?

94
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,920
Why can you still read?

95
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,270
Tell me. What did you do to Shanggu?

96
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,350
Why can’t I feel

97
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,550
her power?

98
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,160
When she was admitted to Changyuan Hall,

99
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,790
I sealed her power.

100
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,550
You!

101
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,440
Do you know she’s missing?

102
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,920
Don’t be anxious.

103
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,880
It’s going to rain soon.

104
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,510
Considering she can’t bear
with any hardship,

105
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,000
she’ll go back after she’s wet in rain.

106
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,070
Bai Jue, what exactly did she do?

107
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
What makes you hate her so much?

108
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,640
What did she do?
She’s covetous for treasure.

109
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,640
Shortly after she did cultivation
in my hall,

110
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,110
she accepted lavish gifts

111
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,390
and took Goddesses into my hall.

112
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,670
How ridiculous!

113
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,350
Lavish gifts?

114
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,720
Bai Jue, you get her wrong.

115
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,070
She didn’t do that

116
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,640
to get lavish gifts,

117
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,880
but to solve your problem for her.

118
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,320
There he is.

119
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,440
It’s Master Bai Jue.

120
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,920
It’s really him.

121
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,480
Yeah.

122
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,640
300 miles to the west
of the Demon Region.

123
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,320
Mount Jingyou. Near Qianshui River.

124
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,920
I found it!

125
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,640
Tianqi is right.

126
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,920
Demons are straightforward.

127
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,720
Only the sincerest happiness

128
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,790
will make them happy.

129
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,230
You mean I get her wrong?

130
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,640
I’m warning you.

131
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,160
You must get her back

132
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,670
and apologize to her honestly.

133
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,880
It was her ten thousandth birthday!

134
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
Who could bear with such humiliation?

135
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,880
How shall I apologize?

136
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,760
I ate the birthday peach you gave her.

137
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,110
Sweet, isn’t it?

138
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,200
It’s as hard and puckery as you!

139
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,670
Did you lose your taste sense?

140
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,110
Anyway, I thought about it for you.

141
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,470
You like stone carving, don’t you?

142
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,670
Carve a stone bracelet for her.

143
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,080
Girls like jewels.

144
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,960
Don’t pretend you didn’t hear me.

145
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,080
Remember what I’m telling you.

146
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,910
You must get Shanggu back.

147
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,710
Otherwise, I’ll...

148
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,960
I...

149
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,350
Master Tianqi.

150
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,550
Don’t call me.

151
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,320
Come over.

152
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,840
Master Tianqi!

153
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,440
Otherwise, I’ll take him to Taichu Hall

154
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
and heat the wine for me every day!

155
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,440
Master Tianqi, you...

156
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,080
What?

157
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,110
Master, we should go find Her Grace.

158
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,910
If it rains heavily,

159
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,470
and she has no power available,

160
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,150
she...

161
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,820
(Changyuan Hall)

162
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,200
Why are you not taking shelter
inside the hall?

163
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,910
Having pity or reflecting on yourself?

164
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,960
You said never see me again, didn’t you?

165
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,200
Why are you coming to me again?

166
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,280
Give my power back to me.

167
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,150
A True God

168
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,790
lives as long as the world

169
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,840
and lasts as long as the universe.

170
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,320
But with sealed power,

171
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,710
he’s merely common.

172
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,470
Put it on. Don’t catch a cold.

173
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,940
Is this an apology?

174
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,200
Will you forgive me?

175
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,350
Forgive you for the robe only? Never!

176
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,840
The Red Blood Forest is on the border
between Gods and Devils.

177
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,150
The battle seventy thousand years ago

178
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,790
led to rare spiritual power in it.

179
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,710
What you did

180
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,000
can only make them happy for a while,

181
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
but not forever.

182
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,030
I asked Tianqi.

183
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,670
Even he can’t solve the problem.

184
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,520
Why you want me to do it,

185
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,710
you’re embarrassing me.

186
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,280
Tianqi can’t solve the problem.

187
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,710
Nor can Zhiyang or me.

188
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,960
But you can.

189
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,910
Me?

190
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,200
No one can keep
the God Realm in peace, but you.

191
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,880
No one can make Tiger Demons
happy and safe, but you.

192
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,150
It’s the first exam for you.

193
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,320
It’s also your lifelong mission
as the Chief God of the Three Realms.

194
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,590
I thought you looked down on me.

195
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,440
Zhiyang doesn’t even let me
touch the reports.

196
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,760
My birthday party

197
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,590
is always of high classification.

198
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,000
Gods who come to it

199
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,470
can’t even get in without treasure.

200
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,230
You’re Master Bai Jue,

201
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,350
but what a cheap gift you’re giving me!

202
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,280
Is it enough, then?

203
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,200
I never expect him

204
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,080
to make me happy.

205
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,640
What a rare chance!
I must give vent on my anger.

206
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,110
I’m the Chief God.

207
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,280
No matter how weak I am,

208
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,060
others only dare to gossip behind me.

209
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,400
But what have you done?

210
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,150
You humiliated me in public
over and over again.

211
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
What do you want me to do?

212
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,150
I’m not a mean girl.

213
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,880
Well, seal your own power

214
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,910
for half an hour.

215
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,230
All right.

216
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,400
We’re even, then.

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,350
Seal your own power

218
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,280
for half an hour.

219
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,710
All right.

220
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,760
How come?

221
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,320
You sealed your power.

222
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,790
Are we even?

223
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:52,880
You must have cheated.

224
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,760
Without power, you’re common.

225
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,960
I don’t believe this.

226
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,400
Now you do?

227
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,880
The life is long and the world is big.

228
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,520
Once you become the Chief God of Chaos,

229
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,840
you may know new rules and definitions

230
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,840
for everything in the Three Realms.

231
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,000
It’s getting late.

232
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,350
Your Grace, go to sleep early.

233
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,110
Wait.

234
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,200
How did you do that?

235
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,440
If you want to learn it,

236
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,440
come at seven tomorrow morning
and don’t be late.

237
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,520
The chaos appears in the world

238
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,550
and enriches the air.

239
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,400
The world makes up for it in return.

240
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,840
Then the Power of Chaos never stops.

241
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,840
Tun means abundance.

242
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,280
Abundance is where everything starts.

243
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,670
(Endure the Hardship)
Everything is confused at first.

244
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,710
Meng means ignorance.

245
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,520
Ignorance must be cleared out.

246
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,640
So, Xu is right after that.

247
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,110
Bai Jue does have a way to instruct her.

248
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,640
Xu means diet.

249
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,320
There’s a dispute about diet.

250
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,350
It was eight thousand years ago

251
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,590
when Shanggu read a book last time.

252
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,840
Well done.

253
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,550
You know how to control her.

254
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,760
Shanggu is often criticized
for her weak power.

255
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,590
Considering her competitive temper,

256
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,550
it’s the best way to prod her.

257
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,590
Shortly after you’re back,

258
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,030
you know such gossips?

259
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,760
When I want to know something,
I’ll get to know it in a day.

260
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,840
Shanggu hasn’t made any progress.

261
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,340
It’s all because of him, he...

262
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,030
Shanggu said that

263
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,760
you didn’t even allow her
to review the reports?

264
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,440
Because she always made trouble.

265
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,350
When I was travelling
in the lower realm,

266
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,350
I heard of many interesting things.

267
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,910
For example?

268
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,030
The Cold Swamp is in the hinterland
of Snake Demons,

269
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,400
but many Crocodile Demons
stay there, too.

270
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,280
Its ownership was in dispute.

271
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,150
A True God

272
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,110
made a wrong comment on the report

273
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,590
and earmarked Crocodile Demons
into the region of Snake Demons.

274
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,910
So far, they have fought
for a thousand years.

275
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,080
Who was it

276
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,000
that made such a trouble?

277
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,790
I did.

278
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,350
You know that.

279
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,440
At that time,

280
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,000
I just took over the affairs
on behalf of Ancestral God

281
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,150
and I wasn’t experienced.

282
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,280
It could be understandable
when I made a mistake.

283
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,440
Yeah, Zhiyang.

284
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,230
When you first took power,
you made trouble, too.

285
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,080
Why are you overcautious

286
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,520
when it comes to Shanggu?

287
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,110
Tianqi, try the tea.

288
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,840
Isn’t there a burning smell?

289
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,080
Ice Cube,
where did you get such good tea?

290
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,550
I got it from Flaming Woods.

291
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,080
What’s the story about that?

292
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,900
When Zhiyang went to the lower realm
for some business,

293
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,020
a female immortal in Flaming Woods

294
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,380
kidnapped him and forcibly married him.

295
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,200
What?

296
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,230
A serious True God in the God Realm

297
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,640
was forcibly married in the lower realm?

298
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,470
What are you laughing at?

299
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,440
More than that.

300
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,150
I’ve heard some of your love affairs

301
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,080
in Yoyo Valley, the Indifference Cliff
and the Loss Sea.

302
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,350
Come on, Zhiyang!

303
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,110
I’m known as the most flippant

304
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,000
and the most dissolute in the God Realm.

305
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,080
But I think

306
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,710
everyone is deceived

307
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,520
by your serious acting.

308
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,030
What do you know?

309
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,550
Those were accidents.
Don’t bring them up again.

310
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,640
They were old stories.

311
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,840
Ice Cube, have I offended you?

312
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,840
You haven’t.

313
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,030
But you told me something.

314
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,150
Submissive, hardworking

315
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,520
and never makes trouble.

316
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,760
Why must I learn

317
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,150
such childish books?

318
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,440
Bai Jue, come over!

319
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,790
I told you. You can offend anyone,

320
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,910
but the vengeful cold man.

321
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,790
Yeah.

322
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,640
Look. The barrier has another crack.

323
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,950
Why is it coming to the God Realm?

324
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,800
I’d like to meet the Chief God of Chaos

325
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,680
by the Nether World at March

326
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,310
for peace negotiations between us,

327
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,950
from Xuanyi.

328
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,430
Are you kidding me?

329
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,560
Xuanyi asked to see me?

330
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,070
What do you mean?

331
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,830
He’s Overlord Xuanyi
who kills people in cold blood.

332
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,590
Are you really letting me go?

333
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,160
Devils are imprisoned in the Nether World
for seventy thousand years.

334
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,310
But in recent months,
the barrier keeps splitting.

335
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,400
Many devils flooded and made trouble

336
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,830
in the regions of Immortals and Demons.

337
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,110
Zhiyang, now that the barrier
of the Nether World will collapse,

338
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,430
and devils will come to us,

339
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,190
why don’t we accept his invitation

340
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,070
and go there to check?

341
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,020
Are you listening to me? I mean...

342
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,820
But Xuanyi is scheming.

343
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,400
I’m afraid he’s up to something else.

344
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,760
Precisely.

345
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,680
He’s been hiding in the Nether World
for seventy years ago.

346
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,950
He must be up to something evil.

347
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,520
Now, he asked to see Shanggu.

348
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,470
There must be a trap.

349
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,230
Yes. There must be!

350
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,190
Yeah, Zhiyang, how about not...?

351
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,560
Xuanyi used to be
the Leader of True Gods.

352
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,640
If he hadn’t fallen as a devil,

353
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,160
he would have been
the Chief God of Chaos.

354
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,590
Now, Ancestral God fell.

355
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,880
There’s no Chief God in the God Realm.

356
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,470
If Devils start a war again,

357
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
people will die and suffer.

358
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,230
If Shanggu can go have a negotiation,

359
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,110
she might get us away from the disaster.

360
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,640
You’re right.

361
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,880
We can’t let the disaster happen again

362
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,800
which happened seventy thousand years ago.

363
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,160
Come on.

364
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
I don’t want a war, either.

365
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,000
But look at me.

366
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,070
If I go, I’ll die.

367
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,880
Won’t I?

368
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,310
Won’t I?

369
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,470
Bai Jue, I’ll leave it to you.

370
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,880
You must teach Shanggu enough skills

371
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,640
within three months.

372
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,920
Then we’ll go
to the Nether World together.

373
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,920
Come on. I’m the Chief God, right?

374
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,640
Don’t you listen to my opinion?

375
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,000
What Chief God?

376
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,040
I can’t even make my own decision.

377
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,350
Even before I become the real Chief God,

378
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,640
I’m dying already.

379
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,230
He’s Overlord Xuanyi.

380
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,040
He nearly defeated the Ancestral God.

381
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,430
If I go, I’ll die,

382
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,280
won’t I?

383
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What are you going to do, then?

384
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,470
Run away. Or will I wait to die?

385
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,950
Did you just say

386
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,040
you would run away?

387
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,280
No. I won’t ever run away.

388
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,230
God of Kunlun just had a son.

389
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,950
I’ll go congratulate him.

390
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,520
What about the Nether World?

391
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,280
I can’t be in two places at once.

392
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,590
I won’t go with you. Sorry for that.

393
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,680
Seriously?

394
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,470
Sure.

395
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,760
Good. I don’t need to bother, then.

396
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,040
What do you mean?

397
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,400
Nothing.

398
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,520
By the way, find a good weapon
as soon as you can.

399
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,350
In case you meet some devils,

400
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,160
it may help you survive.

401
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
There’s no devil on Mount Kunlun.

402
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,350
Xuanyi wants you.

403
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,040
Wherever you go,

404
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,160
Devils will be after you.

405
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,110
It’s easy to find you
within three months.

406
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,590
Are you still leaving?

407
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,760
Tomorrow.

408
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,070
Tomorrow I’ll go to your hall
and learn skills carefully.

409
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,710
You don’t need to wait till tomorrow.

410
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,040
Tell me.

411
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,950
Did you just let him take Shanggu away?

412
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,950
Considering her temper,

413
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,430
how can she bear
with Bai Jue’s instruction?

414
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,800
If you can, go instruct her.

415
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,400
I!

416
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,000
We tried for ten thousand years,

417
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,190
but she made no progress at all.

418
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,400
She’ll face Xuanyi and Devils this time.

419
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,950
In a thousand years, she’ll face
the Tribulation of Chaos.

420
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,920
We can protect her for years,

421
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,280
but not forever.

422
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,040
She’s the future Chief God.

423
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,110
She’ll grow up sooner or later.

424
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,470
This is Mount Lookout

425
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,190
where I cultivated myself
in the lower realm.

426
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,880
Stay here for the cultivation.

427
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,310
I was doing good in Changyuan Hall.

428
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,640
Why must I stay here?

429
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,160
Devils are cunning. Xuanyi is the worst.

430
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,310
Considering your weak power,

431
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,070
how can you go to the Nether World

432
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,400
without hard cultivation?

433
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,350
This is a quiet place
and no one will disturb you.

434
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,590
Go back to the God Realm
in three months.

435
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,590
There’re strict etiquettes
in the God Realm.

436
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,190
I learn cultivation from you,

437
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,950
but I didn’t formally acknowledge you.

438
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,640
So, you can’t make any decision for me.

439
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,920
Master is simply a title. I don’t care.

440
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,430
I decide

441
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,830
when I go back to the God Realm

442
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
and when I go to the Nether World.

443
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,590
If you find my plan improper,

444
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,920
do as you wish.

445
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,880
Why is there a barrier?

446
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,540
Mount Lookout is the common border
of Immortal, Demon and Devil Realms.

447
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,460
Without my barrier,

448
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,020
how could this place be in peace?

449
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,060
I don’t want to stay here
for even a minute.

450
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,620
Let me go back to Changyuan Hall now.

451
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,980
You didn’t formally acknowledge me.

452
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,180
You can go wherever you want.

453
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,680
Why do you bother to ask me?

454
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,160
Bai Jue.

455
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,880
I have no compassion for girls.

456
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,400
As you wish, Your Grace.

457
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,880
Forget it.

458
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,880
I must be humble when I need his help.

459
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,470
After I learn some of his skills,

460
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,950
I’ll try to get out of here.

461
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,560
I’m born to be generous.

462
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,160
I won’t argue with you.

463
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,310
I hear that stars over Mount Lookout
are the most beautiful.

464
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,000
I’ll stay as you wish.

465
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,880
For only three months, anyway.

466
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,070
Bai Jue? Leave!

467
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,160
So quickly? I was freaked out.

468
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,640
I was nearly eaten.

469
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,880
In case of danger,
you only know to depend on stronger men

470
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,070
or shrink back.

471
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,350
Your nerve

472
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,160
is really shocking me.

473
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,560
I didn’t mean failing to fight them.

474
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
I simply didn’t realize
what was going on.

475
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,760
Let alone you have weak power,

476
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,590
what did you do
in the past ten thousand years?

477
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,760
You can’t even use any basic move.

478
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,230
They’re devils of low grade.

479
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,070
Stop giving me a lesson.

480
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,640
You said there was a barrier,
wasn’t there?

481
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,920
Then how did the devils break in?

482
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,830
How can I train you

483
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,590
without letting you fight
with real devils?

484
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,920
If I have a good weapon,

485
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,760
I can also kill devils like you do.

486
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:46,710
You can?

487
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,190
You! I...

488
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,230
I can’t hold it.

489
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,560
You want a weapon, don’t you?

490
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,470
You!

491
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,800
Are you giving me a weapon?

492
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,040
You’re trying to crush me.

493
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,680
I simply want to let you know

494
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
devils are not immortals

495
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,160
who always flatter you.

496
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,760
Tianqi and Zhiyang

497
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,000
can’t protect you forever, either.

498
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,190
One day, you’ll have real fights

499
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,000
with devils.

500
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,680
If you still don’t
cultivate yourself carefully,

501
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,590
your purest spiritual power

502
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,880
which you can’t use

503
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,590
will make you enjoy your status,

504
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,430
but also get you dead.

505
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,160
You’re powerful. You’re always right.

506
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,880
All right?

507
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,800
Do you know why you can’t
get through your God vessels?

508
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,880
You think I don’t want that?

509
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,830
I want to be stronger, too.

510
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,350
But...

511
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,680
But Tianqi spoils you

512
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,760
or Zhiyang is too busy to teach you?

513
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,680
You!

514
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,950
At seven tomorrow morning,
I’ll help you unblock your God vessels.

515
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,400
That’s great.

516
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,520
When I have unblocked God vessels,
I’ll make you feel sorry.

517
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,880
Your Grace, the day breaks. Get up!

518
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,710
Your Grace, the day breaks. Get up!

519
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
What’s the time now?

520
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,880
Even the cock hasn’t crowed yet.

521
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,040
I’m not getting up.

522
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,000
Ice Cube!

523
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,710
He tricked me again!

524
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,160
There are three levels
for the spiritual power.

525
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,310
The first level is the Power of Chaos

526
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,560
that the Ancestral God used
to create the world.

527
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,520
The second level is the Power of Rules
that True Gods have,

528
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,430
including God power, immortal power
and demon powder.

529
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,000
The third level is the power
of the lower realm.

530
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,520
Devils are coming?

531
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,950
I practiced till midnight last night.

532
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,470
I only slept for four hours

533
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,830
before you got me up for cultivation.

534
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,230
However strong I am,

535
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,400
I can’t hold that.

536
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,350
Sleepy?

537
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,590
Let me help you wake up.

538
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,760
Wait.

539
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,520
I’m quite awake. Let’s continue.

540
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,160
There’re three levels
of the spiritual power.

541
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,070
Wait. Three levels
of the spiritual power...

542
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,640
But why didn’t you mention
the devil power?

543
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,040
Because the devil power

544
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,950
isn’t naturally generated by the world.

545
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,680
Xuanyi had the Power of Chaos,

546
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,520
just like you.

547
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,950
He was the successor
of the Chief God of Chaos.

548
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,310
Now that there wasn’t devil power,

549
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,110
how did Xuanyi turn into Overlord

550
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,070
and how did devils come into being?

551
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,000
Seventy thousand years ago,

552
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,590
Xuanyi was dissatisfied with the way
the Ancestral God ruled the world.

553
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,920
Before he inherited
the instruction feather of Chief God,

554
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,230
he had fought for the throne.

555
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,950
But when he was nearly defeated,

556
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,400
he suddenly went against
the heavenly rule

557
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,280
and forcibly absorbed evil spirit
from dead immortals.

558
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,400
Puffs of evil spirit mixed

559
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,590
with the Power of Chaos in his body,

560
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,880
ending up as the devil power
that could engulf everything.

561
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Evil men in the lower realm

562
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,680
cultivated in the same way,

563
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,470
and became his subordinates.

564
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,880
Then, Devils came into being.

565
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,880
So, that’s how Devils appeared.

566
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,350
After defeating Xuanyi,

567
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,160
the Ancestral God broke the space
and vanished.

568
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,160
His last breath bred you,

569
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,470
who’s the new leader of Four True Gods.

570
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,430
With the Power of Chaos,

571
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,280
you should always warn yourself

572
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,400
not to do what Xuanyi did.

573
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,560
When you inherit
the instruction feather of Chief God,

574
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,560
you’ll bear the responsibility

575
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,590
to defend the world
and open the Human Realm.

576
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,520
I know.

577
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,110
I’m born with the responsibility

578
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,310
to defend the Heavenly Realm,
God Realm and the upcoming Human Realm.

579
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,880
I know that.

580
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,800
With great power
comes great responsibility.

581
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,350
I have very little power.

582
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
I think it’s better that

583
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,110
you, Zhiyang and Tianqi
defend the world.

584
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,590
So, you want to learn.

585
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,040
I don’t mean not to learn it.

586
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,400
I told you, didn’t I?

587
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
I have blocked God vessels.

588
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,920
I’ll hit your God vessels with force.

589
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,470
It depends on you
if they can be unblocked.

590
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,560
What will you do?

591
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,280
Relax.

592
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,470
Are you trying to hit me again
with an excuse?

593
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,280
Feeling anything?

594
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,560
No.

595
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,160
No?

596
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,160
Be quick. Take back your power.

597
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,920
I don’t know how.

598
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
I feel so bad. Too much power.

599
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,190
If it continues, you’ll go insane.

600
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,830
Do something.

601
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,680
I’m still young,
and I don’t want to die.

602
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,710
Close your eyes.
I’ll help you dredge your power.

603
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,760

don’t think you can buy me over
with your handsome appearance.

629
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,520
I have unblocked God vessels now,

630
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,470
and I’ll leave here
after I learn some skills.

631
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,470
Your Grace,

632
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Master asked me

633
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,880
to teach you today.

634
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,470
Where’s Bai Jue?

635
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,040
Master...

636
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,560
He’s sick.

637
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,560
Sick?

638
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,640
Is it serious? Let me check on him.

639
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,760
No, no. He just has a cold.

640
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,190
And he coughs.

641
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,710
He doesn’t want you
to risk any contagion.

642
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,950
According to Tianqi,

643
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,710
when I have unblocked God vessels,

644
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,590
if I practice hard day and night,

645
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,190
I’ll greatly improve my power

646
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,400
and get twofold results
with half the effort.

647
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,470
But come on.

648
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,110
Why is he sick now?

649
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,800
I would think he pretended to be sick.

650
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,110
Your Grace,
let’s go for the cultivation.

651
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,800
You don’t want Master to worry about you

652
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,640
even when he’s sick, do you?

653
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,070
Right.

654
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,830
Your Grace, you can’t get in!

655
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,400
Your Grace.

656
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,470
Your Grace, Master is really sick.

657
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,520
Your Grace.

658
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,950
The day is breaking. Get up!

659
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,310
You’re my teacher!

660
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,760
I’m doing

661
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,800
what you did to me.

662
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,190
Why do you feel so weak?

663
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,920
You’re really sick?

664
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,590
Are you done?

665
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,950
I’m sorry, I...

666
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,680
I...

667
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:06,760
I thought...

668
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,710
You thought everybody liked
to get up late like you did.

669
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,160
I’m sorry.

670
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,070
Get out.

671
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,870
You wronged Master!

672
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,800
Your Grace,

673
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,190
you were born by the residual breath
of the Ancestral God

674
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,760
with blocked God vessels.

675
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,520
If it were easy to unblock,

676
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,950
why didn’t Master Tianqi or Zhiyang

677
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,000
help you do that?

678
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,600
If Master Bai Jue
weren’t powerful enough,

679
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,520
it would be you who’s lying in bed now.

680
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,520
Look at me.

681
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,870
I didn’t sleep last night.

682
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,150
But I feel so energetic

683
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,040
as if there were continuous
spiritual power

684
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,870
coming out of my body.

685
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,870
Enjoy the cultivation yourself.

686
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,040
I’m too humble to teach you
and I’m leaving.

687
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,870
Where are you leaving?

688
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,280
Master lost so much power.

689
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,800
He needs some medicinal tea.

690
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,870
I’ll go with you.

691
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,630
Can you be so kind?

692
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,280
I just don’t want to owe him.

693
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,230
What does he like?

694
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:13,760
Why do you ask?

695
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,390
Just asking.

696
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,950
It’s the medicinal tea I just made.

697
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,040
Would you like some?

698
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,390
I know you’re angry with me.

699
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,600
If you’re so angry,

700
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,840
punish me as you want.

701
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,470
Punish you for such a small thing?

702
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,040
I’m not that bored.

703
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,870
Thank you for unblocking my God vessels.

704
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,600
We even...

705
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,320
I mean

706
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,470
I didn’t know what happened.

707
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,470
I couldn’t stop that day.

708
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,230
I didn’t mean to absorb your power

709
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,360
and even flirt with you.

710
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,430
I don’t care.

711
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,760
What?

712
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,040
Nothing.

713
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
You’re so nice to me.

714
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,120
But I was rude to you.

715
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,630
I feel sorry.

716
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,800
Didn’t you say
you would make me feel sorry?

717
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,360
Why would you feel sorry?

718
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,910
I was just joking.

719
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,360
You still remember?

720
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,520
I have a perfect memory.

721
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,040
I...

722
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,190
I never owe anyone.

723
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,630
How do you want me to repay you?

724
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,430
When you cultivate yourself hard

725
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,950
and manage to fight
against the Devil God,

726
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,040
I’ll be relieved.

727
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,520
I swear I’ll impress you.

728
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,520
Go. I’ll teach you swordsmanship.

729
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,910
Swordsmanship?

730
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,320
It’s so great
to have unblocked God vessels.

731
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,230
I can even learn swordsmanship.

732
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,040
You and Yuemi
have known each other for long.

733
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,280
She’s among the best in swordsmanship.

734
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
How much of Six Moves of Extreme Yin
have you learnt?

735
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,120
Six Moves what?

736
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,670
How about Star Swordsmanship
or Cloud Swordsmanship?

737
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,080
Never heard of any.

738
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,600
You’ve stayed with Yuemi
for ten thousand years.

739
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,870
What did she teach you?

740
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,040
To drink, play dice, play cards,

741
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,910
watch plays and read story books.

742
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,080
I’ll teach you.

743
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,630
Got it?

744
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,150
Yes.

745
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,080

I didn’t see it clearly.

751
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,390
Could you show me again?

752
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,630

Yes.

769
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,320
It’s not hard to play swordsmanship.

770
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,390
Master, you’re in good mood today.

771
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,390
Nice tea.

772
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,000
Her Grace picked it

773
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,080
behind the mountain yesterday.

774
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,870
No wonder you look so happy.

775
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,000
The water is good.

776
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
Her Grace also collected it

777
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,520
from the pistils of flowers

778
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,280
early this morning.

779
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
It must be sweet.

780
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,040
What’s your point?

781
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,910
I want to say that

782
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,120
you and Her Grace

783
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,670
often argue.

784
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,760
But you also care about each other.

785
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,040
As far as I see,

786
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,870
you haven’t had the formal ceremony
to be her teacher,

787
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,430
but you care about each other
more than others.

788
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,190
Are you getting yourself
to heat the wine?
