=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,060
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,980
Master, you’re in good mood today.

4
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,080
Nice tea.

5
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,630
Her Grace picked it

6
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,680
behind the mountain yesterday.

7
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,680
No wonder you look so happy.

8
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,680
The water is good.

9
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,950
Her Grace also collected it

10
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,270
from the pistils of flowers

11
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,870
early this morning.

12
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,510
It must be sweet.

13
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,800
What’s your point?

14
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,870
I want to say that

15
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,800
you and Her Grace

16
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,400
often argue.

17
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,510
But you also care about each other.

18
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,870
As far as I see,

19
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,760
you haven’t had the formal ceremony
to be her teacher,

20
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,190
but you care about each other
more than others.

21
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,950
Are you getting yourself
to heat the wine?

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,630
Watch this, Ice Cube!

23
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,630
You can’t even dodge that.

24
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,720
Looks like my spiritual power
has increased a lot.

25
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,030
Not to mention one Xuanyi,

26
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,720
even there is a group of Xuanyi,
I won’t be afraid at all.

27
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,240
Don’t get carried away.

28
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,110
What do you want to do?

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
I’m happy that you made it.

30
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,550
Stop there.

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,110
You’ve played such a trick many times.

32
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,240
I know what you mean.

33
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,390
What do I mean?

34
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,000
With that stance and look,

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,000
I’m sure you want to take me
to the Nether World to train me.

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,800
When I get beaten nearly to death,

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,910
you will jump out

38
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,910
and preach at me,

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,750
telling me not to be carried away.

40
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,670
You are pretty smart.

41
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,800
Thank you for your compliment.
I appreciate it.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,160
Are you scared now?

43
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,390
You can’t provoke me
into doing anything now.

44
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,270
I haven’t practiced enough yet.
Next time.

45
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,670
Stay here. I’m going to the God Realm.

46
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,670
Yes.

47
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,030
Bai Jue, why are you back alone?

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,160
Where is Shanggu?

49
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,910
Bai Jue, Shanggu is naughty in nature.

50
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,390
You mustn’t hit her

51
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,800
if she makes any trouble.

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,390
I need four things.

53
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,520
Phoenix Feather, Black Tortoise Shell,

54
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,470
Dragon Horn and Xuanjin Iron.

55
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,800
You want to make a weapon?

56
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,720
Any of our weapons

57
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,110
can be invincible in the world.

58
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,470
And you want to use four items one time.

59
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,110
Are you going to poke a hole in the sky?

60
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,670
Not for me. It’s for Shanggu.

61
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,550
I’m relieved to know

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,830
that you are so attentive to Shanggu.

63
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,910
Relieved?

64
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,030
Shanggu’s vessels haven’t been opened.

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,520
Even the weapon is made,

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
she still can’t use it.

67
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,390
I have got through her vessels.

68
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,390
You have?

69
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,000
How did you do that?

70
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,670
Your Grace, you have
practiced for four hours.

71
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,480
Take a rest.

72
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,350
I can’t.

73
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,600
I finally find the feeling today.

74
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,000
I must practice more moves.

75
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,070
You wouldn’t get up at all
a few days ago.

76
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,390
How did you get the hang of it
so quickly?

77
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,160
Cut it out.

78
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,480
That’s nonsense!

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,070
Don’t you know how powerful
Shanggu’s chaotic state is?

80
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,510
You two acted so rashly.

81
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,440
You might become dust
if anything goes wrong.

82
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,270
Why didn’t you ask us to protect you?

83
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,070
Yeah.

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
No offence, Shanggu.

85
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,320
Anyway, I have got through her vessels.

86
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,670
You wanted me to teach her,

87
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,390
and I have my own way to do it.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,600
You...

89
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,830
Never mind.

90
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,670
Xuanyi is what matters now.

91
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,670
It’s good that you are strict with her.

92
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,600
Xuanjin Iron is in the North Sea
of the Heavenly Realm.

93
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,950
You just opened up her vessels.

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,640
I guess your power also got diminished.

95
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,880
I’ll get it for you later.

96
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,040
It’s okay. Just a piece of iron.

97
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,230
I will get it myself.

98
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,230
Ice Cube.

99
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,640
Why do you care about Shanggu

100
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,390
so much all of a sudden?

101
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,440
Listen, you can’t fall in love with her.

102
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,920
You can’t be more boring.

103
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,230
Bai Jue.

104
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,160
Shanggu only had
the power of an immortal.

105
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
Now her God vessels are open.

106
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
I think she will have
her first divine trial soon.

107
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,880
You must stay cautious
when you are with her.

108
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,230
Don’t let your guard down.

109
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,200
Don’t let your guard down!

110
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,510
The demonic miasma?

111
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,390
Your Grace, there is no
barrier here.

112
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,200
Let’s go back to the bamboo house.

113
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,200
Your Grace, what are you doing?

114
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,390
I’ll see what those demons got.

115
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,320
I’ll be right back.

116
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,510
No! Come back!

117
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,600
It’s dangerous! Your Grace!

118
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,000
Come back! Your Grace!

119
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,480
There is no need to be scared.

120
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,160
My God vessels are open now.

121
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,160
A few demons won’t be a problem to me.

122
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,200
That’s it? You are too weak.

123
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,670
No.

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,920
If I lose here,

125
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,480
Bai Jue will mock me.

126
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,510
Just a bunch of demons.

127
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,760
Let me show you what I got.

128
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,830
Master.

129
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,350
Where is Shanggu?

130
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,160
Master, you are finally back.

131
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,880
Her Grace went to fight with
demons on her own.

132
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,320
That’s quite a big fight
with the demons.

133
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,350
No.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,230
This is her divine trial.

135
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,230
My goodness.

136
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,480
This thunder trial

137
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,510
is much more scary
than the normal thunder.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,880
Why does the thunder trial

139
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,070
happen so suddenly?

140
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,920
She just had her vessels open

141
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,830
and the trial clouds are so violent.

142
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,950
If she inherits
the instruction feather one day,

143
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,590
I’m afraid the world will be
turned upside down.

144
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,910
How lucky I am.

145
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,030
Even the thunder can’t hit me.

146
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,110
What are you so fierce about?

147
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,670
I dare you to hit me again.

148
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,000
Her foundation is not solid.

149
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,910
If she gets hit by the thunder,

150
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,670
her root might get hurt.

151
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,790
Bai Jue.

152
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,320
What is it?

153
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,000
I’ve almost mastered these moves.

154
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,150
When will you take me
to the Nether World for training?

155
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,880
I’m quite surprised by

156
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,670
your excessive confidence.

157
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,200
What do you mean?

158
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,790
You should know

159
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,030
you might die at the hands of the demons

160
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,030
if anything goes wrong.

161
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,640
What a coincidence.

162
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,790
It went pretty well today.

163
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,350
I not only defeated the demons,

164
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,280
but also survived the divine trial.

165
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,670
You used to be angry at me

166
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,910
because I was afraid of demons and lazy.

167
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,440
Now I am diligent.

168
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,030
I volunteered to challenge the demons.

169
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,910
But you got angry again.

170
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,790
Don’t you think you are
too difficult to get along with?

171
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,470
For me?

172
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,880
You can give it back to me
if you don’t want it.

173
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,440
Why would I not want it?

174
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,670
You gave me a carrot
and then used a stick.

175
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,440
Is it because you think
you reprimanded me

176
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,670
too harshly and you feel
guilty about it?

177
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,280
I just can’t bear to see
someone is too weak

178
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,670
to protect herself.

179
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,000
You became nice to me so suddenly.

180
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,670
Is it because you fall for me?

181
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,550
My taste is not that bad.

182
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,550
All across the Three Realms,

183
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,670
you are not the only one
who falls for me.

184
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,400
There are countless men out there

185
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,440
who are more handsome
and gentler than you.

186
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,550
They are way better than you.

187
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,000
Can’t you even take some bad reviews?

188
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Cut it out.

189
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,520
I have read some plays.

190
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,910
Do you think
I will fall into your trick?

191
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,030
Bai Jue?

192
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,200
Bai Jue, what’s wrong with you?

193
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,910
Hongri!

194
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,000
Hongri!

195
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,670
Your master fainted because of me!

196
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,440
Hongri!

197
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,500
(Xuanyi)

198
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,670
He helped her pass the trial
and make the sword.

199
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,960
That little Chief God
is really special to Bai Jue.

200
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,440
Interesting.

201
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,790
Overlord.

202
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,350
How is it going?

203
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,280
You were right about it.

204
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,790
The Chief God at the Pilgrimage Hall

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,400
has had her vessels open.

206
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,110
(Moyu)
The demons I sent are no match for her.

207
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,910
Bai Jue does have something special.

208
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,840
Zhiyang failed to enlighten her even he
taught her for ten thousand years.

209
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,840
But Bai Jue got through her
God vessels within a few days.

210
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,910
I’d like to meet our little Chief God.

211
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,110
Send people to keep an eye on
Mount Lookout.

212
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,150
Report to me if you get any news.

213
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes.

214
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,670
As a True God,

215
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,440
how did he just faint like that?

216
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,790
What happened just now?

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,350
Just now... nothing happened.

218
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,670
He gave me a sword and then...

219
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,350
What sword?

220
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,060
Master actually made a sword for you.

221
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,540
I’ve been serving him for
tens of thousands of years.

222
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,940
I’ve never seen him
treat anyone so well.

223
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,440
Is it that hard

224
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,670
to make a sword?

225
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,790
Your Grace, your source of power
is different from Master’s.

226
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,710
Considering his status now,
making a weapon for you

227
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,320
would impair his spirit
and shorten his lifespan.

228
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,550
Shorten his lifespan?

229
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,320
How would that happen?

230
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,150
He is a True God. He lives as long as
the heaven and the earth.

231
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Do you really think
the thunder can’t strike you

232
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,440
because you are
the successor of the Chief God?

233
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
My master took

234
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,280
those forty-nine thunders for you,

235
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,910
which impaired his spiritual power.

236
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,080
How lucky I am.

237
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,520
Even the thunder can’t strike me.

238
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,550
He even made a weapon for you.

239
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,030
No wonder he lost half of his life.

240
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,590
I usually see him acting arbitrarily.

241
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,280
I didn’t know he did so much for me.

242
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,960
Master’s spiritual power got impaired.

243
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,280
I need to go back to the God Realm

244
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,640
and ask Master Zhiyang for help.

245
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,590
Your Grace, take care of Master for me.

246
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,520
Bai Jue is injured now.

247
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,350
The barrier will be undercut

248
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,880
and the demons in Mount Lookout
will surely notice it.

249
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,670
Go to re-set the barrier

250
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,590
and don’t let the demons in.

251
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But Master...

252
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,880
I owe this to him.

253
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,840
It’s my turn to pay him back.

254
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,640
Well done. Bai Jue.

255
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,550
How can you be so scheming?

256
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,400
You got hurt

257
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,470
so badly for me.

258
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,640
How am I going to

259
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,710
tease you and contradict you again?

260
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,670
Never mind.

261
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,960
I should have

262
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,670
taken these thunders.

263
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,640
I’ll give the power back to you.

264
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,190
I don’t even know
how to transfer my spiritual power.

265
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,230
I’m so useless.

266
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Bai Jue taught me before.

267
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,520
The spiritual power resides in
my original being.

268
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,000
Right.

269
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,920
My original being.

Overlord.

284
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,590
The barrier of Mount Lookout

285
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
has been showing signs of instability

286
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,680
since last night.

287
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,040
The barrier is collapsing.

288
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,190
Looks like Bai Jue’s original being

289
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,430
suffered great damage.

290
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,430
Let’s take this chance

291
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,350
to meet them.

292
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,310
His temperature finally goes up.

293
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,000
He should be getting better now.

294
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,230
Don’t get me wrong.

295
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,280
I’m here to see
if you are getting better.

296
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,110
I’m about seventy percent recovered.

297
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,310
Who saved me?

298
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,310
Not me.

299
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,400
Tianqi or Zhiyang?

300
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,560
Tianqi...

301
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,000
He...

302
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,830
Why do you look so pale?

303
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,400
I...

304
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,070
I was worried about

305
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,470
your condition and I barely slept.

306
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
But I will make it up

307
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,280
after I get some sleep later.

308
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,710
Hongri told me

309
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,000
that you made a sword
and took the thunders for me.

310
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,710
It’s no big deal.

311
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,710
It’s no big deal for you,

312
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,590
but it’s a big deal for me.

313
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,680
I’ve decided.

314
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,160
Rites and law are strict
in the God Realm.

315
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,350
I haven’t performed the ritual to
formally acknowledge you as my teacher.

316
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,560
I, the Chief God, Shanggu

317
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,310
came to learn from
the True God, Bai Jue.

318
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,950
I will never disobey your order
from now on.

319
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,920
Even if you are arbitrary and assertive,

320
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,310
I won’t be mad at you anymore.

321
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,230
There are countless ways in the world.
We shall never stop learning.

322
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,230
Are you willing to proceed with me?

323
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,470
Since you brought it up,

324
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,160
I’ll take you as my apprentice.

325
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,920
You and I will proceed together
from now on.

326
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,160
Why are you so enlightened today?

327
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,350
I’m not enlightened.

328
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,280
I just feel upset at the thought of

329
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,310
the war between gods and demons.

330
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,590
Those Goddesses,

331
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
you, Zhiyang and Tianqi
will get hurt because of it.

332
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,920
Don’t worry.

333
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,110
I will cultivate myself

334
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,230
with great concentration.

335
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,040
I’m glad that you can think in this way.

336
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,280
But I have one more thing to ask you.

337
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,280
Go ahead.

338
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,350
When did I act arbitrarily?

339
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,710
You must be kidding.

340
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,880
I don’t like jokes.

341
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,280
Master, you are awake.

342
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,040
What’s wrong?

343
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
The barrier between Mount Lookout
and the Nether World is collapsing.

344
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,430
I’m worried that the demons
will come to invade again.

345
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,000
Those demons won’t spare a moment.

346
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,310
I’m going to change my clothes.

347
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Wait for me outside.

348
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,430
Okay.

349
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,280
You haven’t fully recovered yet.

350
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,190
It’s okay.

351
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,830
Bai Jue, help!

352
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,310
I like to see the way you protect me.

353
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,860
The Nether World

354
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,820
is quite different from
what I thought before.

355
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,040
The Ancestral God created the world
without partiality.

356
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,640
The Nether World was also
one of the blessed places.

357
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,470
But in order to imprison the demons,

358
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,190
the Gods sealed this place.

359
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,000
What kind of flower is that?
It’s pretty.

360
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,190
That’s Deicide Flower.

361
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,520
It’s highly toxic.

362
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,110
Long time no see, Bai Jue.

363
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,230
Shanggu, he is Overlord Xuanyi.

364
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,400
You mustn’t make eye contact with him.

365
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,190
This smart and cute girl

366
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,280
must be the little Chief God.

367
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,350
Sorry that I offended you
at the barrier.

368
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,920
I just want to invite you

369
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,000
here for a drink.

370
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,070
Xuanyi, she can’t drink much

371
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,800
and she knows nothing about wine.
Don’t waste it.

372
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,400
What if I insist?

373
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,070
What are you nervous about?

374
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,230
I just want to have
a good chat with her.

375
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,920
Shanggu!

376
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,520
Where’s Bai Jue?

377
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,040
What did you do to him?

378
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,830
Don’t worry. He is fine.

379
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,400
Only when he is not around

380
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,520
can we have a good talk.

381
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,640
Well, little Chief God.

382
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,520
Are you satisfied with my arrangement?

383
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,900
He is Overlord Xuanyi.

384
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,820
You mustn’t make eye contact with him.

385
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,020
Satisfied. I’m very satisfied.

386
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,100
Your arrangement is
novel and interesting.

387
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,260
Zhiyang doesn’t allow me

388
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,620
to play at all in the God Realm.

389
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,950
That old-fashioned man

390
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,640
hasn’t changed for
seventy thousand years.

391
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,280
If you like,

392
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,110
you can stay here for a few more days.

393
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,110
I know how boring the God Realm is

394
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,350
better than you do.

395
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,230
You are right.

396
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,070
They are all old-fashioned
in the God Realm.

397
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,110
With such a temper,

398
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,590
I guess you were brought up by Yuemi.

399
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,880
You know Yuemi?

400
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,070
She used to steal wine in my hall
when she was a kid.

401
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,190
The time has passed
and things are different now.

402
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,400
The clan of demons has been
imprisoned here for years.

403
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,880
If you are willing to guide
the clan of demons to a good direction,

404
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,430
I think the Gods will let you come back.

405
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,190
What a good way to look at it.

406
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,070
But I almost wiped out
the God Realm back then,

407
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,310
how would they be willing to
welcome me back?

408
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,310
I just saw the way
Bai Jue looked at you.

409
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,760
You two look really good together.

410
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,160
You must be joking.

411
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,760
Well...

412
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,230
I have nothing to do with that Ice Cube.

413
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,470
If Bai Jue hears that,

414
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,160
I’m afraid he will be upset.

415
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,830
Why would he feel upset?

416
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,310
I’ve known Bai Jue
for tens of thousands of years.

417
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,920
We’ve been close once
and we have also fought many times.

418
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,880
But this is the first time
he gets so close to a girl.

419
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,760
You think we are close?

420
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,880
He always bosses me around

421
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,000
or takes a carrot-and-stick
approach to me.

422
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,070
There is something you don’t know.

423
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,400
Bai Jue hates females the most.

424
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,560
He won’t even let a female mosquito
come near to him.

425
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,800
I once thought

426
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,110
that he has no emotions

427
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,110
and he can’t fall in love with anyone.

428
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,070
But the way he cared about you just now

429
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,590
has dispelled my doubts.

430
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,040
Don’t be ridiculous.

431
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,760
Shanggu.

432
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,190
Bai Jue.

433
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,830
Are you all right?

434
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,430
I’m fine.

435
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,680
Did Xuanyi do anything to you?

436
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,160
He seems to have changed himself.

437
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,760
Yuemi once stole wine in his hall.

438
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,470
If he didn’t defect from the God Realm,

439
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,160
I think I would also grow up
in his hall.

440
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,110
Why don’t we have a peace talk?

441
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,190
Let’s stop fighting.

442
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,470
Our little Chief God.

443
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,280
You are a compassionate person indeed.

444
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,920
If you dare to touch her again,

445
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,400
I will burn your Nether World to ashes!

446
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,420
You weren’t this angry when I killed

447
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,830
your heavenly soldiers back then.

448
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,000
Where is that cold-blooded and merciless

449
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,760
God of War, Bai Jue?

450
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,680
Have you become gentle
because you don’t fight a lot recently

451
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,350
and you start to
care about your love life?

452
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,520
Shanggu, to a man like Bai Jue,

453
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,950
you have to use some special tricks

454
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,830
to make him reveal his true feelings.

455
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,950
Shanggu.

456
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,830
I think we are connected in some way.

457
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,800
Why don’t you stay here?

458
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,560
There are no rules in the Nether World.

459
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,830
You can do whatever you want.

460
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,040
You turned into Bai Jue

461
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,070
and it makes me feel sick.

462
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,230
Let’s go.

463
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,950
The injuries you got at Mount Lookout
haven’t healed yet.

464
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,520
Do you really think you can
take her away easily?

465
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,470
Xuanyi blocked here. What should we do?

466
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,020
I wanted to take you here for training.

467
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,740
But I have no spiritual power left now.

468
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,420
I’ll try to break the barrier

469
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,180
and you leave as fast as you can.

470
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,780
You haven’t recovered your power.

471
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,020
I can’t leave you here alone.

472
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,380
We must leave together.

473
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,300
No, I will worry about you
if you stay here.

474
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
Xuanyi wants to kill me.

475
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,660
I can’t let you take the risk alone.

476
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,430
You got the nerve to stay here
knowing you will die.

477
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,280
I really admire

478
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,800
your brute courage.

479
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,590
Xuanyi, just come at me.

480
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,470
I’m the Chief Good.

481
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,680
Will do, then.

482
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,190
Go to find Zhiyang!

483
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,470
Xuanyi, the Ancestral God kept you alive

484
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,590
and gave the Nether World
to the clan of demons

485
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,640
because we hope you can
repent your mistakes.

486
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,680
Why do you have to repeat your mistakes?

487
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,430
When I was the Chief God
seventy thousand years ago,

488
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,620
you were nothing but

489
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,340
a sidekick following me around.

490
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,660
When do I need to explain to you

491
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,340
what I’m going to do?

492
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,830
Then have a try.

493
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,470
Seventy thousand years later,
you still can’t win me.

494
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,070
How arrogant.

495
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,590
Today is the day of your destruction!

496
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,800
You came just right.
Hurry and save Bai Jue!

497
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,520
What are you panic about?

498
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,110
That Ice Cube is hard to kill,
He will be fine.

499
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,040
Hold on.

500
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,680
You are not surprised at all.

501
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,800
Do you...

502
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,190
already know it?

503
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,190
Shanggu.

504
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,950
It’s not what you think.

505
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,350
This is all Bai Jue’s idea.

506
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,470
It has nothing to do with me.

507
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,040
Think about how good I am to you.

508
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,760
How would I lie to you, right?

509
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,880
It’s Zhiyang. He made me do it.

510
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,830
Shanggu.

511
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,040
Bai Jue.

512
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,880
I think you are getting naiver

513
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,160
over these years!

514
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,280
It’s just a barrier. Even it’s broken,

515
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,590
I can still kill you.

516
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,430
How dare you set me up!

517
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,910
What’s going on here?

518
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,670
What did you do?

519
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,520
When you rose in revolt back then,

520
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,320
the Ancestral God worried
that such a day would happen.

521
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,230
He cast a spell in the Nether World.

522
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,670
If you don’t rebel,

523
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,230
the Nether world will be the last chance

524
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,150
for you and the clan of demons.

525
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,320
But if you refuse to give up
your sinister plan,

526
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,840
you will be trapped on the

527
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,390
God-holding Platform
for the rest of your life.

528
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,710
You may never leave here again.

529
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,910
Qingtian, you can only trap me here!

530
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,000
But you can never kill me!

531
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,230
I’ll bring the demons

532
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,040
back to the world one day!

533
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,150
What’s wrong?

534
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,760
You imprisoned Overlord Xuanyi
on the God-holding Platform.

535
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,560
You did a good thing
for the people and the Three Realms.

536
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,390
I shouldn’t blame you.

537
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,080
But now I’m very angry.

538
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,870
Tell me.

539
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
You took the thunders for me

540
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,470
and got hurt on Mount Lookout.

541
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,040
Among all the things you did,

542
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,080
which of them were planned ahead?

543
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,190
Half and half.

544
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,390
You are frank.

545
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,280
After I was brought to the Nether World,

546
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,280
everything was in your schedule.

547
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,360
Xuanyi thought you were badly hurt

548
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,390
and let his guard down.

549
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,080
You took the chance
and gave him a fatal blow.

550
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,670
You planned them all.

551
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,430
But you could have told me in advance.

552
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,710
I can prepare myself at least.

553
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,040
It didn’t turn out bad, did it?

554
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,430
I thought you got through my vessels,

555
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,120
made a sword for me,

556
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,520
and took the thunders for me
because you cared about me.

557
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,280
I thought you really wanted to
help me advance.

558
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,560
I was worried about your injuries.

559
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,320
Now it turns out

560
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,470
what you did for me

561
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,000
is all part of your plan.

562
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,760
And I’m just one of your pawns.

563
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,600
You have advanced now.

564
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,630
You have improved a lot than before.

565
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,390
Is the process really that important?

566
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,360
Do you even know what I’m angry about?

567
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
If the gods and demons have a war,

568
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,710
everyone in the God Realm
will be a pawn.

569
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,000
No one can be spared.

570
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,150
I understand all the things you said.

571
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,950
But you could have told me in advance.

572
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,560
I would do my best

573
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,600
to help you defeat Xuanyi.

574
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,320
Why would you hide it from me?

575
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,000
Xuanyi can pry into people’s minds.

576
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,600
I have no better choice.

577
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,150
We won anyway.
Don’t bother yourself with it.

578
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,430
Old man, have you prepared
the wine for celebration?

579
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,630
Shanggu did a great job
in her first battle.

580
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,870
We must celebrate it.

581
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,520
I don’t need you to tell me that.
The wine is ready.

582
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,910
I told you

583
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,520
not to hide it from Shanggu

584
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,430
and you wouldn’t listen to me.

585
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,320
Come on, let’s go back to the God Realm.

586
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,600
Let’s talk...

587
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,230
Go away!

588
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,150
Do you always think
you are the rational one?

589
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,950
I even performed the ritual to
acknowledge you as my teacher

590
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,190
and said things like
we will proceed together.

591
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,040
Those who are amiable
can’t command an army.

592
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,320
If you need me to do anything

593
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,560
when you rule the Three Realms,

594
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,280
I will shrink from no sacrifice.

595
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,190
I don’t want to hear
your lecture anymore.

596
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,870
Girl! Girl!

597
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,800
Overlord, they fell for our trick.

598
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,320
Qingtian guarded me as I expected.

599
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
Finally they showed their last card.

600
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,630
Overlord, Shanggu’s performance

601
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,230
fully meets your expectations.

602
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,630
She is kind and willing to
risk her life to save others.

603
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,120
She is the best candidate

604
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,080
to become the Chief God
and solve the disasters in the future.

605
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,320
Unfortunately,

606
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,040
she is not strong enough.

607
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,390
I wonder if she can inherit
the instruction feather

608
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,040
of Chief God within a thousand years.

609
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,120
Don’t worry.

610
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,470
Now I’m trapped in
the God-holding platform

611
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,950
and Bai Jue will let his guard down.

612
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,520
In order to make Shanggu master
the Power of Chaos as soon as possible,

613
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:16,430
they will come to me soon.

614
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,950
The Deicide Flower

615
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,560
is about to blossom.

616
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,280
How long has it been
since the fight in the Nether World?

617
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,080
It’s been seven days.

618
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,520
Master.

619
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,230
Her Grace hasn’t come
to practice these days.

620
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,800
Why would Shanggu use her Power of Chaos

621
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,560
to save me on Mount Lookout that day?

622
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,520
I’ve told you many times.

623
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,600
Then tell me one more time.

624
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,040
When you fainted that day,

625
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,710
I told her

626
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,150
what you did for her.

627
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,630
You don’t know how worried she was.

628
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,390
I wanted to go back to
the God Realm and asked for help.

629
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,280
But she worried that demons
would come to hurt you.

630
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,150
So she saved you with her power.

631
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,600
Why didn’t you tell me that day?

632
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,150
You and Her Grace

633
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,470
went to the Nether World
as soon as you woke up.

634
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:33,430
I didn’t have a chance
to tell you even I wanted to.

635
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,600
It was not easy for her.

636
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,910
It took her so long to
have the spiritual power.

637
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,080
Yeah, and she gave it all
to you at once.

638
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,600
If I knew it would happen,

639
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,710
I wouldn’t let her
go to the Nether World.

640
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,910
Master, it’s no use to tell me that.

641
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,390
The poor little Chief God’s
original being

642
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,390
is still in your body.

643
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,840
There are prohibitions

644
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,800
and barriers everywhere
in the God Realm.

645
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,040
Without the spiritual power,

646
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,430
how should she go on with her life?

647
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,630
Even she wants to take a walk
at the lower realm, I’m afraid...

648
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,760
If you keep talking,

649
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,470
I’ll send you to serve
in the Pilgrimage hall.

650
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,390
We are going to ask for something,

651
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,230
not to fight.

652
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,430
Don’t act rashly.

653
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,430
I wouldn’t have saved him
if I’d known I was being used.

654
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,280
It makes me mad when I
think about his poker face.
