00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:28,460
=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,910
The spiritual power is low here.

4
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,550
The seal should have been damaged,

5
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,510
but the God-holding Lock
hasn’t weakened by any bit.

6
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,800
It’s the air of chaos.

7
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,590
Could it be the Deicide Flower?

8
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,040
When Deicide Flower blooms,

9
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,120
it releases the air of chaos,

10
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,440
which can only be absorbed by
the Chief Gods of the Three Realms.

11
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,270
It is most conductive to practice
the mightiest the Power of Chaos.

12
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,110
Bai Jue,

13
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,720
the little Chief Goddess
that you care so much about

14
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,440
can learn it from you.

15
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,720
Why don’t you hand her to me?

16
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,440
Within a thousand years,

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,270
I’ll train her into
a Chief Goddess of Chaos.

18
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,750
The old man Qingtian set me up

19
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,750
so I’m tied here
on the God-Holding Platform,

20
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,830
how do I harm her, right?

21
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,880
Why should you be worried?

22
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,550
My proposal

23
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
benefits you

24
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,670
or me

25
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,750
or the Three Realms.

26
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,750
Maybe only by becoming
the Chief Goddess of Chaos

27
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,830
can you change the predestination.

28
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,260
(Ning, a girl born by a snake, lying on
a bed anxiously was seen by her family)

29
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,460
(Even though you’re a demon snake)

30
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,630
Even though you’re the Chief Goddess,

31
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,360
my heart doesn’t change.

32
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,390
I, Bai Jue, won’t fail you.

33
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,030
The story is good.

34
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,320
It’s about the knowledge of
the nine-headed serpent.

35
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,350
I’ll excerpt some.

36
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,390
I’ve heard that

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,880
Master Bai Jue was going to

38
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,160
wine and dine you alone, Your Grace.

39
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,480
Is the red rope already working?

40
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,110
Your Grace, let’s go
make some preparations.

41
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,390
Of what?

42
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,880
Having a bath
and getting some new clothes.

43
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,670
Since Bai Jue sincerely invited me,

44
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,720
I can’t rudely reject him, right?

45
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,640
But you and I must

46
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,950
put the practice in highest priority.

47
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,760
We can’t be distracted by fun.

48
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,900
(Wish we’re together forever)

49
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,920
If someday, Master Bai Jue

50
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,110
tells you how he feels about you,

51
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,070
you should handle it properly

52
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,000
as a dignified Chief Goddess.

53
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,760
How dare you.

54
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,950
You’ve only served me for days,

55
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,270
and you’re already mocking me.

56
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,160
Sorry.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,760
Your Grace,

58
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,480
my master has something important
to speak to you.

59
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,880
Please come to Changyuan Hall.

60
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Go back and tell your master that

61
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,070
I’ll be right there.

62
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,070
Yes.

63
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,720
It’s just an average dinner,

64
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,510
you didn’t have to dress so grandly.

65
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,720
When Hongri went to me,

66
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,070
Wu Huan and I were selecting
a robe for the Day of the Chosen.

67
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,070
I didn’t want you to wait too long,

68
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,600
so I just came with the robe on.

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,830
Please, these are all your favorites.

70
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,000
You eat a lot normally.

71
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,920
What? You don’t have an appetite today?

72
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,640
Idiot, no appetite?

73
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,670
I’m just trying to be elegant.

74
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,480
Try this sour bamboo. It’s appetizing.

75
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,790
See?

76
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,110
The bracelet is so shiny
after I polished it.

77
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,600
I take so good care of the gift
that you gave me.

78
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,550
The wonton is still warm.

79
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,200
It tastes the best right now.

80
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,000
My lip makeup.

81
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,390
You don’t like it?

82
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,070
How is it?

83
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,440
Slow down. Don’t choke on it.

84
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,440
Shanggu,

85
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,070
I have something to tell you.

86
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,880
This is it! This is it!

87
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,230
Ice Cube is pouring me some wine.

88
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,160
Is he...

89
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,150
Going to tell me how he feels about me?

90
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,790
I’ve got a good plan

91
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,080
which may help you get the
instruction feather of Chief God sooner.

92
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,440
Great!

93
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,000
There are too many magics
for us to learn.

94
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,710
Let’s go together.

95
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,880
I’m afraid you’ll have to go
on your own.

96
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,080
I’m going alone?

97
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,910
Where?

98
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,470
Fighting is the quickest way to
improve your God power.

99
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,400
I’ll have to

100
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,000
head to the Nether World on your own.

101
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,320
The Nether World?

102
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,840
For how long?

103
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,520
A thousand years.

104
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,910
A thousand years...

105
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,470
Shanggu,

106
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,640
you’ve been practicing hard ever since
your God veins got unblocked.

107
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,960
It’s just time is pressed.
I don’t have other choices.

108
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,640
It’s not that I don’t want
to go with you.

109
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,350
You practice the Power of Chaos,

110
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,200
Neither me nor Tianqi nor Zhiyang

111
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,200
can help you.

112
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,790
You’re on your own.

113
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,110
I’ve started to recite
the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

114
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,400
I’ll study hard.

115
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,440
Don’t scare me with the Nether World.

116
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,030
The decision has been made.
No more discussion.

117
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,910
I don’t understand.

118
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,670
Why do you kick me away
all of a sudden?

119
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,640
Did I do anything wrong?

120
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,350
The Nether World is dangerous.

121
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,790
There will be no one there
protecting or spoiling you,

122
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
or making plans for you.

123
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,670
So you must be good.

124
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,230
Think twice before you act. Got it?

125
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,550
I won’t go!

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,080
Unless you go with me.

127
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,540

You may take it if necessary.

130
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,760

I know that I’m willful,

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,350
that I’m lazy and that I don’t practice

135
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,440
or read enough.

136
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,840
But I’m trying to change myself.

137
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,910
I’ll strive to meet your expectations.

138
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,400
Just don’t send me to
the Nether World. Please.

139
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,110
As a True Goddess, you are to
lead the Three Realms.

140
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,670
We don’t get to choose our fate.

141
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,670
In the Heavenly Realm, we call
it the last meal before execution.

142
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,760
Fine.

143
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,340
I’ll go.

He’s a heartless man all along.

150
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,000
It’s your own fault
that you were too optimistic.

151
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,400
You looked for trouble yourself.

152
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,520
What did Bai Jue do again?

153
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,320
He said

154
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,640
I’ll be sent to the Nether World.

155
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,000
On my own.

156
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,400
A thousand years.

157
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,880
He’s lost his mind.

158
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,230
The Nether World is full of Devils.

159
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,200
I can’t believe he has
the heart to do so.

160
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,790
No. I must reason with him.

161
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,790
Tell me,

162
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,230
is he not going to be satisfied with me

163
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,440
before I become a Chief Goddess?

164
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,400
Silly girl.

165
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,470
I really don’t want you
to experience all these.

166
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,470
I don’t want to go.
I don’t want to go to the Nether World.

167
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,080
What am I supposed to do

168
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,280
to make him revoke the decision.

169
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,280
No matter what happens,

170
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,110
I’ll be on your side.

171
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,000
If you don’t want to go,
let’s figure something out.

172
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
It’s no big deal.

173
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,470
We’ll fight him if we have to.

174
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,030
Tomorrow is the Day of the Chosen.

175
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,200
Please rest early, master.

176
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,400
Go to the lower realm tomorrow.

177
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,230
Give Wuxi some spiritual power

178
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,080
to facilitate his
transformation into human.

179
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,640
What?

180
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,110
It’s nothing.

181
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,880
At the thought of Wuxi and Feng Yan,

182
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,640
my heart softens.

183
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,840
Your heart softens?

184
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,550
They have parted with
each other for a thousand years.

185
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,110
It’s too much pain.

186
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,840
Muguang.

187
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,760
Thanks.

188
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,840
You’re welcome.

189
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,440
We promised that we’d look after
each other in the God Realm.

190
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,200
The Day of the Chosen

191
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,030
is the day the disciples are chosen
in the God Realm.

192
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,520
These four immortals
are the best in recent years.

193
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,760
Please make your choice prudently

194
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,760
to reinforce the foundation
of the God Realm.

195
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Yes, Your Grace.

196
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,550
Arise.

197
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,910
You’re the best candidates.

198
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,440
You’ve passed the Chosen Test
and are ranked.

199
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,640
Tell us where you are from.

200
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,280
I’m Zhong Li from Mount Kunlun.

201
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,880
I’m Xia Hui from Daohe Clan of Shanzhou.

202
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,280
(Muguang)
I’m Muguang from the Golden Dragon Clan on Mount Tianci.

203
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,710
He’s from the Golden Dragon Clan.

204
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,150
Muguang has strong spiritual power
and is very gifted.

205
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,470
He ranked No. 1 in the test.

206
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,670
And he practices the soothing
techniques of the Golden Dragon Clan.

207
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,960
I think

208
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,790
Muguang is the most ideal
assistant of Shanggu.

209
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,440
I’m Gu Jun

210
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,790
from the Sea Dragon Clan
of Yuanling Swamp.

211
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,060
Sea Dragon? Sea Dragon?

212
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,260
Why is the savage land sending
anyone up here?

213
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,060
(Gu Jun)

214
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,670
The Day of the Chosen is solemn.

215
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,640
If the lower realm
doesn’t have four candidates,

216
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,910
just let us know.

217
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,880
Why is an inferior demon sent here?

218
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,200
Goddess of Snow,

219
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,880
are you belittling the Demons?

220
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,880
Sorry.

221
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,590
I heard that

222
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,080
other than the four True Gods,

223
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,350
other gods do their jobs

224
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,760
equally.

225
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,550
If I was lowly,

226
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,590
then what would you be, Goddess?

227
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,000
If the God Realm hierarchizes

228
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,790
the lower realm based on regions,

229
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,230
then maybe the God Realm

230
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,400
is too snobbish for you.

231
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,640
Insolent!

232
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,340
How dare you!

233
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,350
Kid, you’ve got an attitude.

234
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,840
Step forward.

235
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,400
Let me have a look at you.

236
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
You do like him.

237
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,070
No wonder

238
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,950
your temper is like that person.

239
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,310
Zhiyang,

240
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,830
I like the kid’s attitude.

241
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,590
You choose from the rest.

242
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,560
He

243
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,520
will be the disciple
of the Pilgrimage Hall.

244
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,590
Whatever you say.

245
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Hail, ma’am.

246
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,230
No.

247
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,110
Master Bai Jue, you can’t interfere with
the decision of the Pilgrimage Hall.

248
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,640
Lady Shanggu makes the choice.

249
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,160
Is Master Bai Jue choosing a disciple

250
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,400
or the Pilgrimage Hall?

251
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,350
The lower realm complains that

252
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,070
because Wu Huan is at your side,

253
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,830
so you got a good deal.

254
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,830
I’m afraid Gu Jun is admitted because

255
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,190
of his appearance, right?

256
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,230
How can she say this?

257
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,190
Right.

258
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,680
What did you say?

259
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,950
How can you say this?

260
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,110
You can insult me,

261
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,430
but not my master.

262
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,560
What are you going to do with me,

263
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,350
lowly demon?

264
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,040
He’s weak now but he will grow.

265
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,430
The life of God is long.

266
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,950
No one predicts the future.

267
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,520
Goddess of Snow, I book a duel with you

268
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,000
as the master of Gu Jun.

269
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,470
A month later, you two duel.

270
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,400
I promise that

271
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,520
if Gu Jun fails,

272
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,190
I’ll head to the Nether World
right away.

273
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,430
Before I master the Power of Chaos

274
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,280
and take over the
instruction feather of Chief God,

275
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,590
I won’t come back to the God Realm.

276
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,680
If you lose,

277
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,800
are you willing to

278
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,430
detach yourself from the God Realm?

279
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,310
Deal.

280
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,350
Lift your hands.

281
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,590
Thank you, master.

282
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,680
I won’t fail you.

283
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,280
I can’t believe

284
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,070
I was so lucky on the Day of the Chosen

285
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,190
to have you.

286
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,070
Don’t worry.
Although I’m not a True God,

287
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,830
I still have the good stuff for you.

288
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,590
I’ll train you into

289
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,430
a God as quickly as I can.

290
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,830
I, Muguang of the Golden Dragon
on Mount Tianci,

291
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,710
kneel before my master,
the Goddess of Moon & Stars.

292
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,760
I respect my master like parents.

293
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,800
I won’t fail you. I’ll practice hard.

294
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,920
Arise. Don’t be so formal with me.

295
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,430
You’re gifted.

296
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,830
But you’re rigid. Just like Zhiyang.

297
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,590
Please don’t make fun of me.

298
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,230
But...

299
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,040
I haven’t given you the

300
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,310
disciple’s entrance letter.

301
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,760
I’ll go home

302
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,800
and get it for you.

303
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,350
That’s unnecessary.

304
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,310
I know that Golden Dragon Clan

305
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,520
is courteous and cultured.

306
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,470
Ever since Moon House was built,

307
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,950
it only has a board but no couplet.

308
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,520
Can I task you to write the couplet?

309
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,950
Sure.

310
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,040
I have the confidence to
complete the task.

311
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,520
But remember,

312
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,350
don’t make it highbrow. Make it grand.

313
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,760
Come to see me in the Taoyuan Forest
once you’re done.

314
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,800
Yes.

315
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,940
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

316
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,000
Sir Gu Jun, this is the Pilgrimage Hall.

317
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,590
Your Grace is inside the room.

318
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,590
Please wait here.

319
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,830
Thank you.

320
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,110
Hail, master.

321
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,430
Look at you, all tensed up.

322
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,070
Just like when I just came to
the Pilgrimage Hall.

323
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,710
Get up. No strangers here.

324
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,430
I’m here to see my master

325
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,590
and officially bow to her.

326
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,950
Please let her know.

327
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,950
Her Grace is reading in there.
She is not to be disturbed.

328
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,520
She ordered me to tell you something.

329
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,040
Please tell.

330
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,470
The competition is upon you.
You must practice hard.

331
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,830
The formality isn’t essential.

332
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,710
Formality isn’t needed here
in the Pilgrimage Hall.

333
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,830
Don’t worry, Your Grace is kind.

334
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,830
And she is nice to others.

335
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,950
Just do what she tells you to do.

336
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,310
Yes, I will.

337
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,950
All right, straighten your spine.

338
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,430
From now on,

339
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,680
the Pilgrimage Hall is your home.

340
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,520
You’re from Yuanling Swamp.

341
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,350
Where did you practice before?

342
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,830
Sea Dragon Pool of Yuanling Swamp.

343
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,590
Sea Dragon Pool?

344
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,310
What a coincidence!

345
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,800
I, too, practiced in Sea Dragon Pool
for a hundred years before.

346
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,230
Did you.

347
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,470
I always think

348
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,430
Sea Dragon Pool is a desolated place

349
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,680
and the spiritual power is thin
in Yuanling Swamp.

350
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,590
Why did you practice there, my lady?

351
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,110
The earth deity of Sea Dragon Pool
is generous

352
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,230
and loves to teach knowledge.

353
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,190
I was fortunate to study a lot from him.

354
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,830
I passed the Chosen Test

355
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,350
because the earth deity enlightened me.

356
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,110
How is he doing?

357
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,070
He still drinks three jugs
of booze every day.

358
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,800
That’s what he likes.

359
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:06,350
When did you practice in Yuanling Swamp?

360
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,830
Three thousand years ago.

361
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,350
I was there, too.

362
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,680
Were you?

363
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,110
Why didn’t I see you?

364
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,040
I was a lower demon back then.

365
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,350
I always practiced in self-seclusion.

366
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,880
That’s why you didn’t see me, my lady.

367
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,710
It makes sense.

368
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,310
It’s only been three thousand years

369
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,560
and you’ve improved so much.

370
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,950
I’m not gifted.

371
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,470
But I was more diligent than others.

372
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,880
Her Grace chose you for a reason.

373
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,470
You’re different from the rest.

374
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,920
Please don’t make fun of me.

375
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,830
Please don’t call me “my lady” anymore.

376
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,430
Call me Wu Huan.

377
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,710
I didn’t know

378
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,110
we practiced at the same spot.

379
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,190
I didn’t know

380
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,160
as the divine beast of the
Chief Goddess of the Three Realms,

381
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,190
you’d practice in rigor and cold.

382
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,640
I thought

383
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,920
only a lesser demon like me

384
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,230
would go to Yuanling Swamp.

385
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,230
You’re right.

386
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,000
I was one of the lesser
ones of Parasol Forest.

387
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,110
The Five-colored Phoenix.

388
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,680
No.

389
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,160
I didn’t mean you were lesser.

390
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,430
For real.

391
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,520
Birth means nothing.

392
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,190
As long as we don’t
look down on ourselves,

393
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,230
no one else can.

394
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,880
Don’t waste time here. Go to practice.

395
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,880
I’m off, then.

396
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,820
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

397
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,640
Gu Jun.

398
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,110
If you need anything,

399
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,830
just come to me.

400
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,190
Thank you, Lady Wu Huan.

401
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
He has the backbone.

402
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,000
He’s more pleasant than

403
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,350
those patronizing high disciples.

404
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,540
(Taichu Hall)

405
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,000
God Zihan. Master Zhiyang has assigned

406
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,310
Muguang to learn from Goddess Yuemi.

407
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,920
The two of us are gonna learn
from Master Tianqi.

408
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,950
Is that possible for you

409
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,520
to take us to meet our master?

410
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,190
Stop.

411
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,560
Master Tianqi has said,

412
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,710
all people in his hall look pretty.

413
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,880
You guys are too ugly to join us.

414
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,680
He didn’t want you.

415
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,560
Well, then,
you gotta find us another shelter

416
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,920
in this God’s world, right?

417
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,180
Yeah.

418
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,300
(Accommodate Yourself)

419
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,040
Fine.

420
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,560
Here you go with
two 10000-year-old snow lotus seeds.

421
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,710
Take those back.
They’ll nourish your skin.

422
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,230
Probably in the next Day of the Chosen,

423
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,560
you’ll get favored by Master Tianqi.

424
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,400
God Zi…

425
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,000
He’s nothing but a beast.

426
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,710
How dare he crack the whip at me!

427
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,400
So embarrassing.

428
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,470
Now I’m a little envious of Muguang.

429
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,160
Since Goddess Yuemi took him in,

430
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,000
she has treated him so well

431
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,350
and nurtured him
as one of the 12 Star Messengers.

432
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,800
That’s for sure.
You and I are no match for Muguang.

433
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,470
But that Gu Jun of low origin

434
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
should take away our halo.

435
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,190
I swear I will find a chance

436
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,230
to teach this demon beast a good lesson.

437
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Let’s go.

438
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,760
- Goddess Xueying.
- Goddess Xueying.

439
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,310
Relax. I didn’t hear anything.

440
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,430
It’s just that

441
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,190
the Nine-Clawed Lotus of the East Pond
of Changyuan Hall are blooming.

442
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,920
I heard it’s intensely poisonous,
which shouldn’t be underestimated.

443
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,710
Many fairy fishes
in the pond have been poisoned.

444
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,950
You gotta find a way
to solve the problem.

445
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,190
Yes.

446
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,500
(Ning, a girl born by a snake, lying on
a bed anxiously was seen by her family)

447
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,680
Your Grace.

448
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
It’s been a few days
for you haven’t visited Changyuan Hall.

449
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,070
Hongri has come
for several times to check.

450
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,470
What did he say?

451
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,680
Both Hongri and I worry about your bet.

452
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,430
Xueying is a Goddess.

453
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,830
It’s truly hard for Gu Jun
to win over her.

454
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,640
Gu Jun could break into the Chosen Test

455
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,190
all the way from Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

456
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,830
It means that he

457
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,680
has the perseverance
to grasp the nettle.

458
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,230
Over time,

459
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,520
I’ll get better as well.

460
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,190
When the time comes, our hall

461
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,800
will definitely become the top one hall
in the God Realm.

462
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,230
Your Grace. Work hard.

463
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,190
I’ll make sure Pilgrimage Hall
is always ready

464
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,230
and won’t distract you and Gu Jun.

465
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,340
Gu Jun. You owe us a favor.

466
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,190
Thanks to the fairy water,

467
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,430
or you’d have to burn yourself!

468
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,760
Demon beast is a demon beast.

469
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,070
You really think
you can acquire God Power?

470
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,590
If I were you, I’d go home

471
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,830
before losing face
of the Chief God in a month.

472
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,430
Bullshit.

473
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,430
What the hell is this?

474
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,070
It’s on my handsome face.

475
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,520
Go.

476
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,190
- Master.
- Go.

477
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,430
What happened to you, Master?

478
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,280
You…

479
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,230
Your Grace. Your Grace.

480
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,160
Bad news! The Taichu Hall is flooded!

481
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,520
Zihan detained Gu Jun

482
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,560
and claimed that he has intended
to assassinate Master Tianqi.

483
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,380
(Taichu Hall)

484
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,680
Your Grace.

485
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,280
How did you hurt so badly?

486
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,400
Slow down. Slow down.

487
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,350
Shanggu.

488
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,520
I was too careless

489
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,520
to be hurt by some immortals.

490
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,920
I’m afraid I won’t live long.

491
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,070
It’s just a Nine-Clawed Lotus.

492
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,920
You are a true god.

493
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,280
How could this happen?

494
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,800
You have no idea.

495
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,400
A few days ago, I was practicing.

496
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,310
Suddenly,
I was like possessed by the devil.

497
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,590
My heart got hurt severely.

498
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,190
And the Nine Claw Lotus
attacked my heart as well

499
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,950
and caused an old injury recrudescence.

500
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,880
I’m afraid that this time,

501
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,040
I can’t hold out for too long.

502
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,160
Seriously?

503
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,350
Shanggu.

504
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,470
I hope in my last moments,

505
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,040
you’ll be by my side.

506
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,230
Don’t worry.

507
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,310
You definitely will make it through.

508
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,310
Why?

509
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,640
Because coincidentally, I just learned

510
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,070
a set of pointing techniques
in the lower realm.

511
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,710
It won’t work.

512
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,560
A drowning man will catch at a straw.

513
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,280
See?

514
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,710
I was right.

515
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,350
You definitely will make it through.

516
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,040
Since when did you find out?

517
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,000
When I walked in the door.

518
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,560
Am I that bad at acting?

519
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,880
Just a little worse than me.

520
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,310
I remember when I was young,

521
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,710
I was injured by Taotie.

522
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,920
You took me to the lower realm
to seek medical treatment.

523
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,310
The treatment takes more
than a hundred years.

524
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,310
Actually, I’ve realized
I was totally fine.

525
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,950
You were using me as a cover

526
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,350
so as to facilitate your own travels
down the lower realm.

527
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,800
Holy crap.

528
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,230
At that time, you were naughty
and mischievous,

529
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,190
just like a boy.

530
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,760
Zhiyang got frustrated about you.

531
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,280
I’m the only one willing
to clean up your mess.

532
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,280
I learned nothing

533
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,800
but cleverness in trivial matters

534
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,950
from you.

535
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,310
It was Yuemi who taught you that.

536
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,800
You’ve got the wrong person.
It’s definitely not me.

537
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,070
Although

538
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,680
Devil God is now being suppressed
by the God binding Lock,

539
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,680
in the Nether World,

540
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,590
there’re still many free Devils
out there.

541
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,880
This is a dangerous trip.

542
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,110
I really don’t want you to go.

543
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,800
I know.

544
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,830
Your willfulness and stubbornness

545
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,070
are all pretend.

546
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,070
You’re the most self-driven person
I’ve ever met.

547
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,950
You grew up amidst criticism, Shanggu.

548
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,000
As for the nonsense they talked,

549
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,590
when you hear it,

550
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,040
you’d only fight it back

551
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,310
with pranks.

552
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,640
Only when you return to the hall
will you secretly wipe your tears.

553
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,110
The position
of Chief God seems to be glorious,

554
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,950
but in fact it’s too hard to take.

555
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,470
That day in the hall,

556
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,000
I could tell that

557
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,800
Zhiyang and Bai Jue
must have discussed it.

558
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,470
Neither of them stopped you to go
to the Nether World.

559
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,470
But don’t worry. As long as I’m here,

560
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,760
no one can force you to do
what you don’t want to do.

561
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,000
Isn’t it just a trip?

562
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,950
It only takes a thousand years.

563
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,040
It will pass in a blink of an eye.

564
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,830
A piece of cake.

565
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,110
Your acting skills aren’t any better
than mine.

566
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,190
As long as I can inherit
the instruction feather of Chief God,

567
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,160
I am willing to suffer as much as I can.

568
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,110
Our naughty little Goddess Shanggu

569
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,640
has finally grown up.

570
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,000
It’s heartbreaking to see you
to think like an adult.

571
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,310
Sorry. Sorry.

572
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,350
Who are you?

573
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,830
I’m Muguang. I’m so sorry, Goddess.

574
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,800
It’s you.

575
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,950
I’m not Goddess.

576
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,190
Just an Attendant God of Her Grace.

577
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,350
You don’t have to bow for me, Muguang.

578
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,800
You’re Wu Huan,
the Divine Beast of Shanggu?

579
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,710
I was too reckless just now.

580
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,520
Sorry about that.

581
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,800
I will pay for your dress
next time we meet.

582
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,710
Don’t worry. It was just an accident.

583
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,350
Oops. I’ve smudged your masterpiece.

584
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,800
It’s okay.

585
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,430
The light and shadow comes and goes.

586
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,800
There is no limit to the boundaries.

587
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,640
I’ll always be there with no regrets.

588
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,830
That’s fabulous!

589
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,230
Affectionate

590
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,400
and Magnificent.

591
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,760
Here you go.

592
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,630
Goddess Yuemi asked me to write

593
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,670
a few couplets for the Moon House.

594
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,950
I wrote many of them
with which I wasn’t so satisfied.

595
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,150
I was contented
until I came to these two.

596
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,120
So, I wanted to show them to my master
as soon as possible.

597
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
That’s why I knocked into you.

598
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
I’m really sorry for that.

599
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,190
It’s okay.

600
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,950
You’ve already apologized.

601
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,320
No need to say it again.

602
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,520
I’m still in a hurry to get back
and wait for news from Gu Jun.

603
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,840
Let’s talk later.

604
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,950
Gu Jun?

605
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,320
What happened to him?

606
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,800
He got into trouble in Taichu Hall.

607
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,950
I don’t know if he’ll be alright.

608
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,000
Her Grace is there.

609
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,000
He’s gonna be okay.

610
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,230
What if he doesn’t have the protection
of the Goddess?

611
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,360
You were born with a golden key.

612
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,120
I guess you don’t know

613
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,630
how difficult the path upward is
for us lower people.

614
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,190
Gu Jun treads on eggs.

615
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,430
I guess you won’t understand.

616
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,120
I don’t quite understand.

617
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,710
We just don’t want to be looked down
upon by others.

618
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,230
How come you two

619
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,670
are even uglier than before?

620
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,040
It was Gu Jun who beat us up.
Please trust me, Master.

621
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,120
Don’t call me Master.

622
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,870
Taichu Hall doesn’t accept apprentices
who lost in fights.

623
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,150
Fighting isn’t a big deal.

624
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,870
It’s a big deal
if it hurts Master Tianqi,

625
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,120
especially for his precious face.

626
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,800
A leaf from a 2000-year-old tree

627
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,800
accidentally fallen on his face

628
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,840
has been banished to the lower realm
to clean the pond.

629
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,470
Tell me.

630
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,950
Who put out the Nine-Clawed Lotus?

631
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,670
- It was him.
- It was him.

632
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,800
What the hell is that Nine-Clawed Lotus?

633
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,950
I’ve never heard of it.

634
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,800
Gu Jun. Although you’re the apprentice
from my hall,

635
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,670
I won’t show any favor toward you.

636
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,190
Tell us the truth.

637
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,040
Did you put the Nine-Clawed Lotus there?

638
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,120
No.

639
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,520
Okay, I believe you.

640
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,560
Your Grace.

641
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,040
The Nine Claw Lotus is originally
from the Demons.

642
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,950
Both of us are Immortals.

643
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,120
It’s impossible for us to have it.

644
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,670
Nevertheless,

645
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,080
in the God Realm, it also exists…

646
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,520
Right in the East Pond
of Changyuan Hall.

647
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,150
If it wasn’t brought by Gu Jun
from the lower realm,

648
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,040
could it be brought by Bai…?

649
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,670
Never mind.
I don’t care to look into this matter.

650
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,150
You two.

651
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,080
Go take three lightning strikes each.

652
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

653
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,630
As for you…

654
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,190
None of my business.

655
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,670
I’ll leave you to Shanggu.

656
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,320
Go. Go.

657
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,390
I don’t wanna see your face.

658
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,430
Why don’t you bow down and thank Master?

659
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,560
Thanks. Master.

660
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,520
I’ve just checked
Gu Jun’s cultivation level.

661
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,870
He was born with cold veins
and his spiritual power is disordered.

662
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,670
I’m afraid he can only compete

663
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,320
with Xueying after he’s promoted to God.

664
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,040
Otherwise, he’ll definitely lose.

665
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,670
I came to check on you.

666
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,190
I heard that you got into trouble.

667
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,000
Zhong Li and Xia Hui

668
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,910
tried to set me up,

669
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,390
and they got hurt instead.

670
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,150
I’m glad you’re okay.

671
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,950
Her Grace took you as her apprentice.

672
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,470
There must be plenty of people
who are jealous.

673
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,470
In the future,
you should be more careful.

674
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,560
I know.

675
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,190
But I worry that I can’t make a progress
in such a short time,

676
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,870
and lose the match with Xueying,

677
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,080
giving shame to my master.

678
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,360
From now on, I’ll practice with you.

679
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,670
With an opponent,

680
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,190
you’ll get to know where to improve.

681
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,670
Thanks, brother.

682
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,870
What are you holding?

683
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,600
This is a couplet I wrote for my master.

684
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,470
By the way,

685
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,360
do you usually practice your sword

686
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,320
in the Pilgrimage Hall?

687
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,320
Not really.

688
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,630
Sometimes, I’ll practice as I walk
when I got fascinated.

689
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,670
Come on. Let’s go practicing.

690
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,190
Go.

691
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,560
Is Wu Huan always
in the Pilgrimage Hall?

692
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,190
Yes.

693
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,430
How is she?

694
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,000
She’s nice.

695
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,190
One, two, three, four...

696
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,950
…Five, six, seven, eight.

697
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,870
Oh no. What Zihan said is true.

698
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,000
One is missing.

699
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,000
In that case,

700
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,630
the Nine-Clawed Lotus appeared
in the Taichu Hall

701
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,120
was taken from the East Pond.

702
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,910
Since the Goddess of Snow came here,

703
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,360
the East Pond has been taken care
of by her.

704
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,390
Shall we bring her here and ask?

705
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,190
Master. Where’re you going?

706
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,190
To the Pilgrimage Hall.

707
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,520
I’m gonna tell Shanggu the truth

708
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,840
and prove Gu Jun’s innocence.

709
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,800
Master is really getting more and more
concerned about her Grace.

710
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,630
If she really goes to the Nether World,

711
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,870
will he regret it?

712
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,040
How come Shanggu isn’t back yet?

713
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,320
Doesn’t she want to discuss
how to help Gu Jun advance to God?

714
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,670
It’s been a whole night.

715
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,470
What was she doing at Tianqi’s place?

716
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,670
Stop watching. Mind your business.

717
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,600
Goddess Yuemi. Please enjoy the tea.

718
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,910
I heard

719
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,670
there is a dark place in the God Realm

720
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,950
that is most suitable for Gu Jun
to be promoted to the upper gods.

721
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,520
That is the treasure of the Ice Cube,

722
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,670
which he never lend out.

723
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,950
But Gu Jun’s business
is Her Grace’s business.

724
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,190
Master Bai wouldn’t be so cold, right?

725
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,600
He couldn’t wait

726
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,600
to see Gu Jun fail.

727
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
In this case, Shanggu

728
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,630
can go to the Nether World
without any excuse.

729
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,420
(The Pilgrimage Hall)

730
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,670
Such a small matter,

731
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,840
how come True God Bai Jue was alerted?

732
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,430
Master Bai Jue.

733
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,840
Where’s Shanggu?

734
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,360
She’s where she likes to be.
It’s none of your business.

735
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,000
Master Bai Jue.

736
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,320
Her Grace went to the Chaos Hall.

737
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,870
Where’re you going?

738
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,870
The Nine-Clawed Lotus was taken out
of Changyuan Hall.

739
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,430
I gotta go apologize to Tianqi.

740
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,800
Apologize?

741
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,190
You are more like going to fight.

742
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,800
Shanggu.

743
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Look, I’m in so much pain that

744
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,000
I can’t even hold my chopsticks.

745
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,520
Why don’t you feed me?

746
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,950
Enough.

747
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,040
How much pain
can a Nine-Clawed Lotus cause?

748
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,390
Back in the day, wasn’t you
who stepped on a Nine-headed snake

749
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,470
and took down a roc bird
with your fists?

750
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,280
How come you’re this weak now?

751
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,280
When have I ever been so brave?

752
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,470
You’re getting old
and your brain isn’t working well.

753
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,710
Just feed me one. Shanggu.

754
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,800
Who allowed you to stand here?

755
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,840
I didn’t invite you.

756
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,430
