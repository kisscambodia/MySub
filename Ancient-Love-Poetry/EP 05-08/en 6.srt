=Episode 6=

3
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,280
Up and forward.

4
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,400
Try to integrate your body and mind.

5
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,720
Stop.

6
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,470
Your grace, you are a beginner.
Don’t rush it.

7
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,790
Use the strength of your legs.

8
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,720
Don’t focus too much on your posture.

9
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,440
It’s mainly about your mind.

10
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,110
Okay.

11
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,830
Keep still.

12
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,300
She is much slenderer than before.

13
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,590
Master, Her Grace has
a voracious appetite recently.

14
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,300
Her waist got much thicker.

15
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,940
How did you tell she is slenderer?

16
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,830
Master, we should head for
the training ground now.

17
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,070
I ate too much

18
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,860
and I want to stay here
for a while to digest.

19
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,300
But you said the True God
should abstain from food

20
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,480
and you only had some soup.

21
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,990
Master, wait for me.

22
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,240
(Endure the Hardship)

23
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,780
Bai Jue?

24
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,800
Bai Jue?

25
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,270
I notice that you like plain colors.

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,580
So I put on a plain dress today.

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,350
But you are not here.

28
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,270
Your Grace.

29
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,660
Why is it you again?

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,360
Don’t you know

31
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,140
other Goddesses are not allowed to
enter Changyuan Hall?

32
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,380
Bai Jue did that to you.

33
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,270
Why do you come here again?

34
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,470
Everyone in the God Realm

35
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,300
knows that Master Bai Jue
treats you differently.

36
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,830
You must be very proud.

37
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,470
Bai Jue and I

38
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,190
are True Gods coming from
the same origin.

39
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,380
It’s natural that he treats me kindly.

40
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,910
You can only fool yourself
with these words.

41
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,740
If you weren’t the Chief God,

42
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,220
if it weren’t for the True God Zhiyang

43
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,070
to select Bai Jue as your mentor,

44
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,380
how would Master Bai Jue
look at you differently

45
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,500
with your temperament and conduct?

46
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,660
Your only advantage

47
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,500
is your identity

48
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,940
as the Chief God.

49
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,630
You broke my kite.

50
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,110
You didn’t apologize but humiliated me.

51
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,660
You got so angry

52
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,380
just because of a kite.

53
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,910
Is it because I’m right about it?

54
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,580
You were born as the God of Chaos.

55
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,380
But you are ignorant and incompetent.
You have little spiritual power.

56
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,830
Do you think you are qualified
to be the Chief God of the Three Realms

57
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,500
and enter Changyuan Hall

58
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,660
as his disciple?

59
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,500
How dare you.

60
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
I’m not qualified.

61
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,350
Then are you qualified?

62
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,580
Of course I am.

63
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,110
You only have a higher status than me.

64
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,660
What else are you better than me?

65
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,830
Fine, since you are so confident,

66
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,830
let’s have a competition
fair and square.

67
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,710
If you win,

68
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,380
I will forgive you for
offending your superior.

69
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,270
If you lose...

70
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,180
If I lose,

71
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,750
I’m willing to take punishment.

72
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,150
Good.

73
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,710
Greetings to Your Grace.

74
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,380
Your Grace, you are distinguished.

75
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,310
I dare not hurt you.

76
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,750
Let’s use the lotus leaf
as the criteria.

77
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,110
Whoever falls first loses.

78
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,380
Okay.

79
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,220
Your Grace.

80
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,430
You are too pretentious, aren’t you?

81
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,870
It’s enough to deal with you.

82
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,710
When did Her Grace become so powerful?

83
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,940
Yeah.

84
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,270
They seem to be evenly matched.

85
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,430
Yeah.

86
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,900
Your Grace, you’ve lost.

87
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,270
You played dirty.

88
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,460
But you lost.

89
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,150
As a Chief God,
can’t you afford to lose?

90
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,750
Ancestral Sword!

91
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,270
You promised you won’t

92
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,030
use the Ancestral Sword
before we fought.

93
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,870
But the Ancestral Sword
can smash the sky and the earth.

94
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,380
If you use the Ancestral Sword
to fight with me,

95
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
- then…
- Don’t worry.

96
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,590
I will beat you fair and square.

97
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,430
I won’t use a divine weapon
to fight with you.

98
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,550
Now you lost and you vented
your anger on me.

99
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,780
Don’t go too far.

100
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,030
Her Grace is still young and impulsive.

101
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,660
They didn’t say they can’t use
spells before they fight.

102
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,900
Greetings to Master Bai Jue.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,990
Greetings to Master Bai Jue.

104
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,440
Please don’t blame me.

105
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,900
I just want to see

106
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,660
where I’m not as good as Her Grace.

107
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,380
I didn’t expect to win her by luck

108
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,710
and make Her Grace so unhappy.

109
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,590
You won her by luck?
You must be kidding.

110
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,500
If it wasn’t for you to play tricks,

111
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Shanggu would beat you
with no more than ten moves.

112
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,430
You are not as skillful as her,

113
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,430
not as diligent as her,

114
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,830
and not as upright as her.

115
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,030
Do you hear that?

116
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,560
Fortunately, there is someone sensible.

117
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,900
If you plead guilty now,

118
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,430
maybe I will...

119
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,060
Shut up.

120
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,550
The competition ends here.

121
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,590
You should all leave.

122
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,270
Yes.

123
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,220
We are leaving then.

124
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,180
You don’t practice your skills

125
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,300
but horse around in Taoyuan Forest.

126
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,180
She easily set you up

127
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,180
with a spell.

128
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,110
What are you proud of?

129
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,420
Bai Jue.

130
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,230
Don’t show your joy and anger.

131
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,350
Don’t speak your likes and dislikes.

132
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,790
This is what you should
practice the most.

133
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,140
Goddess of Snow only said a few words
to other Gods

134
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,510
and she provoked you into
drawing your sword to fight with her.

135
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,390
How can the Gods of the Three Realms
trust you in the future?

136
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,070
How can the world trust you?

137
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,950
Xueying broke our kite.

138
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,230
It’s just a kite.

139
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,630
We can make a new one if it’s broken.

140
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,460
As the Chief God, you are responsible
for the peace of the God Realm.

141
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,830
You acted rashly today.
What about in the future?

142
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,910
That kite is a little object for you.

143
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,020
But it’s not for me.

144
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,380
Shanggu.

145
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,110
Master!

146
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,580
Master, please stay.

147
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,060
Please don’t be angry with me.

148
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,460
What happened today is my fault.

149
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,580
I’m willing to do everything

150
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,580
to calm your anger.

151
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,350
You should go to apologize to Shanggu

152
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,140
instead of making a show in front of me

153
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,060
if you really learn from your mistakes.

154
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,870
But Her Grace hasn’t calmed down yet.

155
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,620
She won’t forgive me easily.

156
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,580
You are right.

157
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,060
Then I will take a-thousand-year
spiritual power from you

158
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,190
as your punishment.

159
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,020
What?

160
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,520
You don’t want it?

161
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,060
You didn’t mean what you said?

162
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,230
I dare not.

163
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,190
But I’m in charge of the four seasons.

164
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,460
If my spiritual power is damaged,

165
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,700
I’m afraid it will implicate others.

166
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,670
What’s more, I’ve also made
some contributions

167
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,350
in the fight between Gods and Devils.

168
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,310
If you punish me that hard,
I’m afraid others will criticize you.

169
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,310
You have thought a lot.

170
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,350
But you still should be punished.

171
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,750
You are not competent enough.

172
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,700
Instead of practicing harder,

173
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,380
you played dirty tricks.

174
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,110
I remember I said

175
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,380
no Goddess is allowed to
enter the Changyuan Hall.

176
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,790
And it includes you.

177
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,020
Your Grace.

178
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,750
This is the gift from
the Goddess of Snow as an apology.

179
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,910
Just a-thousand-year spiritual power.

180
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,430
It’s far from my power of chaos.

181
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,750
I don’t want it.

182
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,750
You are laughing at me.

183
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,670
You don’t think I can
cultivate my power of chaos,

184
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,230
do you?

185
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,500
I won’t go to Changyuan Hall tomorrow.

186
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,350
My kite is broken.

187
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,550
He didn’t comfort me at all.

188
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,910
It was just a little competition.
And he made a big deal out of it.

189
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,620
He even said the Three Realms
will be subverted.

190
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,790
I think his brain is subverted.

191
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,620
I’m so pissed off.

192
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,190
I lost my temper with Bai Jue.

193
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,910
He must be angry with me now.

194
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,910
I’m not perfect

195
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,140
in his eyes anymore.

196
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,790
But he can’t blame me, right?

197
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,190
He was rude to me first.

198
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,460
So I’m still perfect

199
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,350
in his eyes.

200
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,060
It’s so hard to win someone’s heart.

201
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,380
Yuemi is right.

202
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,060
I can’t get my hope too up, right?

203
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,230
What should I do?

204
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,060
Master, the divine bead has been
sent to Her Grace.

205
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,190
As you ordered,

206
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,550
I said it was from the Goddess of Snow.

207
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,550
I didn’t say anything about you.

208
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,670
Put it away. I won’t need it anymore.

209
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,500
Master, are you not
going to see Her Grace?

210
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,670
No.

211
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,140
Go to tell her

212
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,990
we will learn the ways of
being an emperor tomorrow.

213
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,260
Yes.

214
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,580
Master, I still want to say

215
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,990
that since she came back
from Mount Lookout,

216
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,820
she has been practicing really hard.

217
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,230
She is still young,
and there will be ample time.

218
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,240
(Endure the Hardship)

219
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,750
Are you blaming me
for being too harsh on her?

220
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,460
I dare not.

221
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,620
She doesn’t have much time left.

222
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,940
If I slack off and go easy on her,

223
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,550
that will harm her.

224
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,790
Go ahead.

225
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,880
Yes.

226
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,310
Ice Cube.

227
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,500
Shanggu hasn’t come to your hall
to practice for some time, right?

228
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,190
I heard that Hongri has invited her

229
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,580
several times but she didn’t come once.

230
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,110
Well, I knew you can’t teach her.

231
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,140
Why are you mentioning this?

232
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,870
It requires a tranquil mind to appreciate
the good tea. Don’t ruin the mood.

233
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,620
Zhiyang, I just learned a new move!

234
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,550
I promise you never...

235
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,020
Shanggu.

236
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,550
You came just right.

237
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,550
Come on. Come on.

238
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,230
I heard about what happened
in Taoyuan Forest on that day.

239
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,140
Didn’t Bai Jue take your side?

240
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,460
Why did you get angry with him?

241
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,700
Have a seat. Come on.

242
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,620
The three of us

243
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,350
have a close relationship.

244
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,750
He has taken a-thousand-year
spiritual power from Goddess of Snow

245
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,990
as her punishment.

246
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,990
Really?

247
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,550
Talkative.

248
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,110
Yes.

249
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,800
Never mind.

250
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
No matter what tricks Xueying used,

251
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,720
I still lost, right?

252
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,670
Shanggu, you are not angry anymore?

253
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,940
As the saying goes,
the Gods have a glib tongue.

254
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,870
Don’t easily...

255
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,910
Shanggu.

256
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,060
I just got something to tell you.

257
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,260
I’m discussing with Bai Jue and Tianqi

258
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,940
about choosing a beast
at Parasol Forest for you.

259
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,670
When will we go?

260
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,500
We should leave soon.

261
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,110
Shanggu.

262
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,310
How about I go with you?

263
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,990
The Parasol Forest is a good place.

264
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,500
We can travel all the way there

265
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,310
and have fun together.

266
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,670
You are not going with me?

267
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,580
I have something to do.

268
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,620
If you are busy,

269
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,140
we can leave a few days later.

270
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,870
I’ll wait for you.

271
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,260
Why must it be him?

272
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,190
Because he is my righteous master.

273
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,260
Bai Jue!

274
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,060
Do you want to ask me

275
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,430
why I won’t go to
the Feng Clan with you?

276
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,500
I thought about it.

277
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,940
You were right about

278
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,430
my fight with Xueying.

279
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,140
I was too careless.

280
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,910
And I should accept my defeat.

281
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,430
I will find a way to win her.

282
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,820
I don’t care about it anymore.

283
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,460
Then why don’t you go to
the Feng Clan with me?

284
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,460
Shanggu, I can’t solve
everything for you.

285
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,750
It’s about the affairs
of the Feng Clan this time.

286
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,820
And it’s a great chance for you

287
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,020
to tame your beast
and for your self-development.

288
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,260
But I’ve been learning from you.

289
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,910
It’s a big deal to choose my beast.

290
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,670
How can you not come with me?

291
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,750
Master, Your Grace.

292
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,940
Elder Feng Yun presents himself.

293
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,190
Greetings to Your Grace.

294
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,620
Greetings to Master Bai Jue.

295
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,940
Sir, why are you here so suddenly?

296
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,670
Didn’t you receive
my instruction feather?

297
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,870
I came to see you

298
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,310
just because I received
your instruction feather.

299
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,550
What does that mean?

300
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,310
The Feng Clan committed a grave sin.
I’m here to ask for your forgiveness.

301
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,990
What happened?

302
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,350
Before the Ancestral God
broke into the void,

303
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,620
he has selected our queen
as Her Grace’s beast.

304
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,310
Over these years,

305
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,380
Queen Feng Yan has been
cultivating herself

306
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,110
to take on this important task.

307
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,380
Three days ago,

308
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,460
Her Majesty finally reached
the realm of Nirvana.

309
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,020
And your instruction feather
also arrived.

310
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,790
But as she was going to be reborn

311
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,990
in the Parasol Forest,

312
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,260
someone stole her spirit.

313
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,140
Feng Yan’s spirit was stolen?

314
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,310
The Queen of Phoenix will have
Nirvana three times in her life.

315
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,820
After her emotions
and desires are eradicated,

316
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,910
she will become the strongest beast.

317
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,260
The outsiders don’t know these things.

318
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,980
The members of the Feng Clan
are all skilled in martial arts

319
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,790
and you have always been
the head of all clans.

320
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,190
Who is so bold as to break into
the Parasol Forest and steal her spirit?

321
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,310
It’s Wuxi.

322
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,710
He is the ancestor of parasol.

323
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,260
He has guarded the Feng Clan
for tens of thousands of years

324
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,620
and he has been loyal to the Feng Clan.

325
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,500
If he is loyal,

326
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,670
why would he steal Feng Yan’s spirit

327
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,950
during her Nirvana?

328
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,620
There is something you don’t know.

329
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,590
In the end, it’s all about love.

330
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,590
It’s a fatal attraction between them.

331
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,100
The Queen of the Feng Clan

332
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,140
will have Nirvana three times
in her lifetime.

333
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,100
To be born, to become a god and to die.

334
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,020
After Nirvana,

335
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,340
the body, character and memory

336
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,710
will be gone along with the Nirvana.

337
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,310
But the Queen of Phoenix’s

338
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,860
cultivation will not disappear.

339
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,020
Therefore, the Queen of Phoenix
will become stronger

340
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,740
after each death.

341
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,070
I see.

342
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,380
Does it mean that the Queen of Phoenix

343
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,220
has always been the same person?

344
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,260
Yes, and no.

345
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,590
Except for the cultivation,

346
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,310
there is no similarity between
the previous queen and the queen now.

347
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,430
The current Queen of Phoenix and Wuxi

348
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,830
grew up together

349
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,710
and they have fallen for
each other since childhood.

350
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,620
I know they are in love.

351
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,950
But the Ancestral God

352
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,980
has made an order

353
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,500
to select Her Grace’s divine beast
from the Feng Clan.

354
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,260
Queen of Phoenix is the strongest
in the Feng Clan.

355
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,310
Therefore, only she

356
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,340
can be the beast
of the Little Chief God.

357
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,020
But after

358
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,310
Her Majesty fought with the devils,

359
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,340
her spiritual power
was greatly impaired.

360
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,980
Now she only has the power
of an immortal.

361
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,100
Therefore, Her Majesty

362
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,340
decided to have her second Nirvana.

363
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,500
But who knows

364
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,950
Wuxi would actually do that

365
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,790
to stop her Nirvana.

366
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,190
If Feng Yan has her second Nirvana,

367
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,740
there is no difference
from being killed.

368
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,910
Right, Ice Cube?

369
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,830
Everything in the Three Realms
has its own way of living.

370
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,670
There is no right or wrong.

371
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,790
Since Feng Yan has made her decision,

372
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,710
I guess she has made her choice
to give up something.

373
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,500
But Wuxi stepped in

374
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,830
and stopped the Queen of Phoenix
from Nirvana.

375
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,340
He should be killed
according to the law.

376
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,740
Bai Jue.

377
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,470
Rules are rules.

378
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,310
Wuxi goes against the density.

379
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,340
If we disregard Ancestral God’s
order just for him,

380
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,910
then what do we need the rules for?

381
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,260
Sir, please rest assured.

382
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,590
This matter is of great importance.

383
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,100
I will find the spirit back in person.

384
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,830
Didn’t you just ask me to
go through it alone?

385
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,950
Why are you taking it on again?

386
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,260
Wuxi should still be
in the land of the immortals.

387
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,020
But he hid his smell
and it’s hard to find him.

388
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,430
I have an idea.

389
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,200
(Southsea Town)

390
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,070
How is my look?

391
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,070
Give me the Immortal-seeking Bell.

392
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,830
Why?

393
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,190
I asked Yuemi for this treasure.

394
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,830
It can detect the smell of the gods.

395
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,830
Even you have the Immortal-seeking Bell,

396
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,790
do you know what Wuxi
and Feng Yan look like?

397
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
I’ve thought about it.

398
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,430
Before we left, I asked Elder Feng Yun

399
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,340
for their portraits.

400
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,910
You’ve made some progress.

401
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,950
It smells so good.

402
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,600
Yeah?

403
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,910
- Yeah, try it later.
- I’m hungry.

404
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,830
Let’s eat something first
before we leave.

405
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,830
A True God doesn’t need to eat.

406
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,500
But I can’t.

407
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,980
I’m still growing.

408
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,880
Maybe I can still grow taller.

409
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,960
You are what you eat.

410
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,440
Wonton is exactly what I need.

411
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,480
Do you forget our task
just because you are hungry?

412
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,160
I mean

413
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,240
I’ll come back to eat it

414
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,040
after we finish our task.

415
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,880
There you go.

416
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,400
They are here somewhere.

417
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,560
Let’s go.

418
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,590
Your Majesty, please forgive me
for my disrespect.

419
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
I’ve been with you for years
and I’m deeply in love with you.

420
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,260
It’s killing me to think about

421
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,590
you will forget everything about us

422
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,550
after your Nirvana.

423
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
I had to take your spirit away

424
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,340
when you were about to be reborn.

425
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:07,910
I...

426
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,430
Wuxi.

427
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,340
I’ve told you clearly

428
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,070
before my Nirvana.

429
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,670
I owe you too much in this life.

430
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,190
I don’t deserve
to be with you next life.

431
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,790
Why did you make such a big mistake?

432
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,430
No.

433
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,830
It’s not you, but the Little Chief God
who owes me a lot!

434
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,590
If it wasn’t for her to choose a beast,

435
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,830
you and I wouldn’t have to separate
after your Nirvana.

436
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,500
But the Wuxi who is in love with me

437
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,340
wouldn’t do that.

438
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,980
How can you put the Feng Clan in danger

439
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,470
just to save me?

440
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,980
Our love hasn’t come
to an end this life.

441
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,310
I don’t want a next life.

442
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,430
I regret it.

443
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,190
What?

444
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,910
You regret that I took you out
without permission

445
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,670
or regret being with me?

446
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,430
I regret having Nirvana.

447
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,740
When you stole my spirit
out of the Feng Clan,

448
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,950
I saw your tears.

449
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,470
I thought I could let go of this life.

450
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,740
But I still can’t stand leaving you.

451
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,740
I’ve decided.

452
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,830
Whether we will roam all over the world

453
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,710
or be hunted forever,

454
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,470
I want to be with you.

455
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,550
I won’t fail you.

456
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,310
I will do everything for you
with no regrets.

457
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,590
Now I’ve taken you out of the Feng Clan.

458
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,380
The Gods and the Feng Clan
must be looking for us.

459
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,910
There are many people here.

460
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,430
We can only stay here for a while.

461
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,470
It’s not a long-term solution.

462
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,830
You can put my spirit

463
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,550
in a phoenix flower.

464
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,790
Then

465
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,430
I will be a flower fair.

466
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,710
I think I can hide my identity
in this way.

467
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,740
But I don’t want you
to live that kind of life.

468
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,500
Wait for me here.

469
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,340
I’ll go to find a paradise for us.

470
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,740
And then

471
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,140
we will be a pair of free cranes.

472
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,070
No one will find us.

473
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,020
The Immortal-seeking Bell?

474
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,980
What?

475
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,950
Elder Feng Yun

476
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,340
must have told on us to the God Realm.

477
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,910
They used the Immortal-seeking Bell

478
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,670
to find us through our smell.

479
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,070
I don’t want to leave you.

480
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,950
Don’t worry.

481
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,070
They must think I have your spirit.

482
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,710
I’ll create a diversion.

483
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,620
Wuxi, don’t go.

484
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,140
I’m afraid you will be in danger.

485
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,430
This parasol leaf
has the same root as me.

486
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,070
Your spiritual power is weak right now.

487
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,740
Don’t fight with anyone yet.

488
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,470
You must hide yourself well.

489
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,340
After this is over,

490
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,470
this leaf will lead you to me.

491
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,470
Wait for me here.

492
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,020
I can’t believe Wuxi is still

493
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,740
drinking and having fun here.

494
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,590
But it’s quite fun
with all these immortals.

495
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,380
I’ll bring Yuemi here next time.

496
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,980
Are you here to play or to find them?

497
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,620
I told you I have my own way.

498
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,740
I’m experienced in arresting people
and not being arrested.

499
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,430
I was caught by Zhiyang many times

500
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,380
when I secretly left the God Realm
to have fun.

501
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,070
You can’t rush it.

502
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,190
What’s in the suet? It smells great.

503
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,190
Master.

504
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,550
This is not suet.

505
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,980
This is the famous peach blossom wine
in our Dongfeng Restaurant.

506
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,740
The wine is mellow, and it tastes sweet.

507
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,860
It’s smooth and the aftertaste lingers.

508
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,340
Is there such a good thing
in the Immortal Realm?

509
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,670
Are you sure you are not bragging?

510
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,670
You will know if I’m bragging

511
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,310
after you taste it by yourself.

512
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,590
Try it.

513
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:04,980
Wuxi?

514
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:06,950
Wait for me here.

515
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,140
Wuxi knows I have Bai Jue to protect me.

516
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,260
But he still attacked me.

517
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,910
He was creating a diversion.

518
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,620
Maybe Feng Yan’s spirit

519
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,710
is still in the restaurant.

520
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,670
Who is that?

521
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,670
My fair lady, I pass by here

522
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,790
and get lost by accident.

523
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,790
Can you tell me the right direction?

524
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,670
I’m also here for the first time.

525
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,100
You should ask the waiter here.

526
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,910
You are beautiful and kind.

527
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,620
I’ve been finding my way for some time
and I’m really thirsty now.

528
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,380
Can you let me take a rest inside?

529
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,670
I have something important to do.

530
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,260
I can’t let you in.

531
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,860
Maybe it’s because you have
such an outstanding look,

532
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,380
I feel connected to you.

533
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,950
I can’t help but want to
say a few more words.

534
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,500
Are you a flower fairy?

535
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,760
Yes.

536
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,070
You must be careful
if you are going to travel far.

537
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,740
The suburbs are not
very peaceful recently.

538
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
How?

539
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,430
There is a flower-picking beast

540
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,860
wandering around
the outskirts of Southsea Town.

541
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,950
His target is exactly
beautiful girls like you.

542
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,140
Really?

543
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,070
You are a flower fairy.

544
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,550
How can you not know that?

545
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,070
I... I heard about it.

546
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,500
Not only this,

547
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,500
I also know a top-secret event
in the Feng Clan.

548
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,910
I love traveling since I was born

549
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,830
and I’m really into gossip.

550
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,430
From the Chief God choosing a beast

551
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,740
to an old turtle marrying a concubine,

552
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,310
there is nothing I don’t know

553
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,830
in the Three Realms.

554
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,140
Forget it, it’s about
the face of the Chief God.

555
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,190
We are little immortals.

556
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,500
Let’s not worry about that.

557
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,670
Since you are going to travel far,

558
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,470
I’ll leave you to it.

559
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,860
Maybe we will meet again.

560
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,550
Hold on!

561
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,950
You just said

562
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,470
Master Bai Jue is secretly investigating
the stolen spirit

563
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,790
of the Queen of Phoenix
in Southsea City?

564
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,140
Has he found out anything?

565
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,550
You are just a flower fairy.

566
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,340
Why do you care so much

567
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,380
about the Feng Clan?

568
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,380
I’m just curious like you.

569
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,620
You don’t have
the Queen of Phoenix’s spirit.

570
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,670
Well.

571
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,790
You really want to go against the Gods?

572
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,470
If it weren’t for these True Gods
to push me so hard,

573
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,500
would I need to do that?

574
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,830
That’s ridiculous.

575
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,020
The immortals and demons know
that the spirit of

576
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,670
the Queen of Phoenix was stolen
and they are coveting it.

577
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,100
The leaders of all clans
want to absorb it

578
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,340
to enhance their spiritual power.

579
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,590
I’m afraid there will be
trouble in Southsea Town.

580
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,950
Handle it with Shanggu
as fast as you can

581
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,860
and hurry back to the God Realm.

582
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,500
The Gods are basically certain

583
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,790
that Wuxi put the spirit
of the Phoenix Queen

584
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,470
in a flower.

585
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,020
It’s a secret. How did the Gods know it?

586
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,100
The fish is on the hook.

587
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,470
Why isn’t Ice Cube coming back?

588
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,140
This peach blossom wine is delicious

589
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,830
but also very intoxicating.

590
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,140
I drank a little too much.

591
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,470
I mean, the spirit of the Phoenix Queen
still belongs to a god.

592
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,980
How can a flower hold it?

593
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,910
After she resides in a flower,

594
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,670
she can’t even protect herself
with her little spiritual power.

595
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,620
I think a lot of people
will come to fight for it.

596
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,710
The Little Chief God thought
it was Wuxi’s own idea.

597
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,710
She didn’t expect that the Phoenix Queen
also wants to leave with him.

598
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,550
How should the two of them end this?

599
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,980
If the Chief God knows

600
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,550
she would put Wuxi
and Feng Yan through this

601
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,500
because of choosing her beast
in the Feng Clan,

602
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,190
she wouldn’t go to the Feng Clan at all.

603
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,140
Now it turns out to be so serious.

604
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,310
Why did Feng Yan

605
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,020
choose such a way

606
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,100
and get some many people implicated?

607
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,260
You have to eradicate your emotions
and give up your memories to be reborn.

608
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,220
Let me ask you.

609
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,140
Without emotions and memories,

610
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,020
will Feng Yan still be herself?

611
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,100
The Phoenix Queen was born

612
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,500
to take on the mission of the Feng Clan.

613
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,550
So she has to be reborn
and part with the love of her life

614
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,220
just because she is the Phoenix Queen?

615
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,590
Don’t you feel sad for her?

616
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,310
She is the prestigious Phoenix Queen,

617
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,220
but she can’t even love and hate
as she wants

618
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,020
like those girls who are dating
in the Immortal Realm.

619
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,860
But there are a lot of
poor people in the world.

620
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,380
No one can disobey the will
of the Ancestral God.

621
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,380
I don’t know
if the superior Chief God knows

622
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,020
that there are many competent people
in the Feng Clan born from

623
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,020
humble backgrounds who can
also take on the mission to be a beast.

624
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,620
Feng Yan has neither the ability
to assist the Chief God

625
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,430
nor the aspiration to help
the Three Realms.

626
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,670
She just wants to be an ordinary woman

627
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,100
and grow old with her lover.

628
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,100
Do you have any other questions?

629
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,470
Chief God, Shanggu.

630
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,020
If...

631
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,980
There is no “if”.

632
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,670
You will understand

633
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,620
what it feels like
to be troubled by love

634
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,830
when you fall for someone one day.

635
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,910
I’m sober now.

636
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,710
Please lead the way.

637
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,830
Never mind.

638
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,260
I wasn’t going to
separate you two anyway.

639
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,380
And now you are firm.

640
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,310
What do you mean?

641
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,100
Just go before I change my mind.

642
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,380
Your Grace.

643
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,790
Hurry.

644
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,550
You won’t be able to leave

645
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,310
if Master Bai Jue comes back.

646
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,310
Thank you for letting us be together.

647
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,070
Wuxi.

648
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,590
Feng Yan.

649
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,980
Why did it take you so long?

650
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,140
I was really worried.

651
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,260
Were you in trouble?

652
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,070
Good.

653
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,340
I was going to look for you
in the restaurant.

654
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,620
But I worried other people
would notice me

655
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,620
and find you out.

656
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,140
The Little Chief God recognized me.

657
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,190
Don’t worry.

658
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,910
She is a reasonable and kind person.

659
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,740
It was her who let me go.

660
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,100
Wuxi, we shouldn’t have blamed her.

661
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,950
This is all because of Shanggu.

662
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,550
You can forgive her, but I can’t.

663
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,540
Ridiculous.

664
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,380
My head hurts a lot.

665
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,620
You still use that tone with me.

666
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,860
When can you stop

667
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,950
being so voracious?

668
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,060
Ice Cube, I feel dizzy.

669
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,990
I mean, can’t you be

670
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,860
a little gentler to me?

671
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,470
Don’t be mad at me all the time, okay?

672
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,470
I really envy Wuxi
and Feng Yan’s relationship.

673
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,750
They are so brave for their love.

674
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:23,990
They even defied the divine order

675
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,540
and risked their lives for their love.

676
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,910
Wuxi made a big mistake

677
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,750
because of his selfish love.

678
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,620
He is not brave for love.

679
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,340
Stop saying drunken gibberish.

680
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,470
I’m not drunk.

681
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,820
Do I look drunk to you?

682
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,620
I’m not drunk.

683
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,190
Are you listening to me?

684
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,230
I am envious of Wuxi and Feng Yan.

685
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,030
I don’t want to catch them back.

686
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,060
Who were you drinking with?

687
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,030
Feng Yan. Who else could it be?

688
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,540
Where are you going?

689
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:56,910
Zhiyang sent us a message

690
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,820
that the Three Realms know

691
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,190
the loss of the Phoenix Queen’s spirit.

692
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,030
As the Chief God, you didn’t catch her
and you got yourself drunk.

693
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,990
So what?

694
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,670
Why are you lecturing me again?

695
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,140
Bai Jue, if I am

696
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,620
troubled by love

697
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,510
and break the divine rules one day,

698
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,030
will you also punish me
according to the law?

699
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,620
The divine rules do not
only exist in dogma.

700
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:25,380

and such a beautiful scenery♪

729
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,280
♪May you♪

730
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,990
Why?

731
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,820
You are a woman and I am a man.

732
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,580
You can’t touch the places
covered by clothes.

733
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,060
But there are no clothes on your face.

734
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,190
It’s even more tiring than
fighting with fierce beasts.

735
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,340
Take a good rest here.

736
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,750
Wuxi and Feng Yan are in danger now.

737
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,300
I’ll be right back.

738
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,750
I’ve set a barrier. No one can come in.

739
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,620
The owner of the hut
is a Crane Immortal

740
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,510
who ascended to the God Realm
some time ago.

741
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,300
I guess the Crane Immortal
won’t come back again.

742
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,140
It’s really like a paradise.

743
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,990
Let’s live here for now.

744
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,670
We can make a plan

745
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,990
after everything is over, okay?

746
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,860
It’s really shabby here.

747
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,230
I didn’t think it through.

748
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:08,910
Yan.

749
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:10,990
Sorry that you have to live here.

750
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,620
I’m not even afraid of death.

751
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,100
This is no big deal to me.

752
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,950
Wuxi.

753
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,470
We committed a grave sin.

754
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,510
There is no turning back.

755
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,620
From now on, it’s hard
not to hide all the time.

756
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,620
But my spiritual power is weak now.

757
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,990
I’m afraid I will be a burden to you.

758
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,540
Yan.

759
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,750
You know I’m bad at words

760
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,470
and I can’t do the sweet talk.

761
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,030
But I swear to heaven

762
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,060
that I will make you happy

763
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,030
even at the cost of my life.

764
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,780
Will you...

765
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,580
Will you marry me?

766
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,270
Since we are getting married,
we should clean up this place.

767
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,710
Why are you still standing there?

768
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,030
Come here and clean it up.

769
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,380
Okay. Okay.

770
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,910
I will do all the housework.

771
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,670
No!

772
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,380
Someone broke the barrier.

773
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,820
Is that Master Bai Jue?

774
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,430
Let’s go.

775
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,750
Wuxi, get out of here
if you don’t want to die.

776
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,710
What we want is
the spirit of the Queen Phoenix.

777
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:12,950
I won’t allow that!

778
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,750
How did I fall asleep?

779
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:35,990
I kissed him?

780
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:38,990
No way.

781
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,620
It’s definitely impossible.
