2
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,270
How come I fell asleep?

4
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,510
Did I kiss him?

5
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,630
Impossible.

6
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,160
No way.

7
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,120
Where’s Bai Jue?

8
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,120
It’s still warm.

9
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,510
He looks like an aloof guy.

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,190
But he’s actually very nice.

11
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,030
Wuxi.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,600
Wuxi.

13
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,470
Bai Jue.

14
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,720
This is a dispute between
our lower realm.

15
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,390
You should uphold justice.

16
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,390
How can you help the Feng Clan?

17
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,750
Talking about justice,

18
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,390
you can just challenge Feng Yan

19
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,600
since her spirit is off her body.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
How dare you mention justice
in front of me?

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,750
Southsea is where the Immortals inhabit.

22
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,000
You Snake Demons

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,720
gave birth to plenty of Gods.

24
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,720
Who’d expect you to be so despicable?

25
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,580
If you try to break in here
and cause chaos in the lower realm.

26
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,880
I don’t mind spending some time

27
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,160
destroying every one of you.

28
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,670
Let’s go.

29
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,470
Well? You still want to fight?

30
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,240
I’ve made my promise.

31
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,520
I have to protect Feng Yan
even if I die.

32
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,320
Wuxi.

33
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,720
You’re helpless.

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,880
Wuxi.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,720
Why are you here?

36
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,600
I’m the one who let Feng Yan go.

37
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,600
I’m the one to blame.

38
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,360
Free both of them.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
You are a Chief God.

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,030
You’d only drag the Three Realms down
if you get emotional.

41
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,260
Do you know how dangerous
it might be for them now?

42
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,180
You are not helping them.

43
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,100
You are doing the opposite.

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,190
I wonder if there’s another way?

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,030
Maybe you can punish Wuxi

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,080
without damaging his life.

47
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,080
Indecision invariably leads to trouble.

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,520
Feng Yan. You are the leader
of the clan.

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,800
I will take your spirit back to home.

50
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,800
As for you.

51
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,470
Such being the case, do you
regret it or not?

52
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,160
Stealing Feng Yan’s spirit

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,000
is the most incorrect thing
I’ve ever done.

54
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,550
But I’ve never regretted it.

55
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,800
If I didn’t do it,

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
I would never know how much love

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,720
Yan has for me this life.

58
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,360
If someday,

59
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,630
Your Grace and Bai Jue

60
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,360
are put in the same situation.

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,110
I believe

62
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,360
you’d make the same decision.

63
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,830
If you continue to speak recklessly,
I will sentence you to death right now.

64
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,480
Bai Jue. Wuxi has made
such a huge mistake.

65
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,000
He ought to die.

66
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,920
But his inspiration was to save me.

67
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,640
It was me who disobeyed
Ancestral God’s will.

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,950
I refused to be a Divine Beast.

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,440
It was me who tricked Wuxi
into stealing the spirit

70
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,920
which caused today’s result.

71
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,480
It was all my fault.
I’m the one to blame.

72
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,480
Yan.

73
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,760
I’d pledge loyalty to Your Grace
after my reborn

74
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,000
to make up for my fault.

75
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,670
Please spare Wuxi’s life.

76
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,640
Since Feng Yan has taken
full responsibility,

77
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,670
this can be another pair of shoes.

78
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,760
It’s known to the God Realm

79
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,270
that Bai Jue strictly adheres
to the rules.

80
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,000
He’d make the fairest sentence for sure.

81
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,640
Never mind.

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,160
If you can be loyal to Shanggu
after reborn.

83
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,830
I’ll spare your life this time.

84
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,160
Yan.

85
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,600
If I have another chance,

86
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
I hope that I’m not the Queen
of Phoenix.

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,950
Yan.

88
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,920
But to only be your Feng Yan.

89
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,440
Yan.

90
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,510
Yan.

91
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,350
Yan. Yan.

92
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,200
Yan.

93
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,550
Yan. No.

94
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,440
Yan. Yan.

95
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,920
No!

96
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,350
Yan.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,640
Yan.

98
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,830
Shanggu.

99
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,980
Don’t kill him.

100
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,440
Don’t talk.

101
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,040
I’m taking you to the Feng Clan now.

102
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,110
I heard that Bai Jue took
back Her Grace.

103
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,160
She’s badly damaged.

104
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,510
Now she’s in the guest room.

105
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,550
Well, should we go inside
and take care of her?

106
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,790
It was Wuxi who hurt her.

107
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,880
Now the whole Feng Clan
is deterred by the danger.

108
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,790
The Master may blame us

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,040
if we make any mistakes.

110
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,200
You’re right. Let’s just
mind our own business.

111
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,880
We don’t want to put ourselves forward
during this time.

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,510
Miss, I’d like to ask

113
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,950
(Wu Huan)
if Her Grace needs someone now.

114
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,200
Wu Huan.

115
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,950
You should be cleaning
the spiritual herbs now.

116
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,950
What are you doing here?

117
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,070
Even if Her Grace needs
someone to take care of her.

118
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,390
It wouldn’t be you.

119
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,110
I’m just worrying about Her Grace.

120
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,320
At a time of this, everyone worries
for themselves.

121
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,550
Why do you pretend to be nice?

122
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,040
I know right?

123
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,720
She’s only a fifth-grade color phoenix,

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,350
trying to approach Her Grace.

125
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,830
Why don’t you look at yourself
in the mirror

126
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,390
before you ask for anything?

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,200
Let’s go.

128
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,790
Sir.

129
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,440
What’s so mysterious
with Wuxi’s God power?

130
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,600
How come

131
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
I can’t heal her wounds?

132
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,350
Wuxi used to be
an ancestral sycamore tree.

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,670
His tens of thousands of years
of spiritual essence

134
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,830
all infused to the last strike.

135
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,070
The sword is hidden
with the power of fire.

136
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,720
Your original nature is fire.

137
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,950
Of course you can’t heal Her Grace.

138
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,270
I’ll ask Tianqi...

139
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,510
No.

140
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,670
The power of fire can only
be healed by the Queen of Phoenix.

141
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,280
If Her Grace gets reborn,
she then can deal with it.

142
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,710
But what

143
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,000
should I do now?

144
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,150
I can’t let things happen
to Shanggu.

145
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,030
Don’t worry, Master.

146
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,320
There may be a way to save her.

147
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,710
What’s that?

148
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,280
I know there’s a treasure
in the God Realm

149
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,400
called Water Bead.

150
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,910
It’s the remains of the ancestors
which heals every wound.

151
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,910
I guess

152
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,150
it can clear the fire
in Her Grace’s body.

153
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,000
I know where the bead is.
Let me get it now.

154
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,790
Ice Cube.

155
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,150
It hurts.

156
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,550
It hurts so badly.

157
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,760
Wu Huan.

158
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,030
You’ve got to change your own fate.

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,670
Who are you?

160
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,230
I’m Wu Huan.

161
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,320
The Feng Clan is aware of its own crime.

162
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,000
I volunteer to take care of Her Grace.

163
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,590
Ridiculous. Look at this place.

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,520
Who are you to be here?

165
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,840
Master.

166
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,710
Her Grace is suffering from the fire,
it must be unbearable.

167
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,640
Apply the water in the Icy Pool
behind the Parasol Forest on body.

168
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,230
It can ease Her Grace’s pain.

169
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,350
Then, take good care of her.

170
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,400
Yes, Master.

171
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,470
I’ll definitely take good care
of Her Grace.

172
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,470
Alright.

173
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,880
Since Master has recognized you.

174
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,470
Take care of her with full heart.

175
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,880
Yes.

176
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,760
I need to borrow your treasure.
I’ll reward you some other day.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,350
It’s my pleasure

178
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,000
to help you.

179
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,760
However, the Water Bead

180
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,320
is given by Master Zhiyang

181
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,400
after the battle between Gods
and Demons.

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,230
It’s especially precious to me.

183
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,520
I’d like to know the reason
why you need it.

184
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,400
To save people.

185
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,960
Is it for

186
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,520
Her Grace?

187
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,000
She’s hurt by the parasol fire.

188
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,710
Master and I

189
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,640
have never talked in these many years.

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,590
Who’d know you’d ask for a favor

191
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,230
for Her Grace?

192
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,590
I’m curious.

193
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,350
Are you commanding me

194
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,840
as a True God

195
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,710
to give the Water Bead?

196
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,710
Or asking me as an old-time friend

197
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,440
for a favor?

198
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,880
What do you mean?

199
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,760
What do you want me to do
to give out the bead?

200
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,640
I don’t ask for anything.

201
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,080
My only wish is

202
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,000
to be your apprentice

203
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,000
and stay by your side.

204
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,910
Master. You’re back.

205
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,520
My power isn’t strong enough now.

206
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,550
Her Grace’s situation is getting worse.

207
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,910
Have you brought back the Water Bead?

208
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,440
Yes.

209
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,000
Alright. Please cure Her Grace now.

210
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,320
Wu Huan. Let’s go out.

211
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,470
What I want

212
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,670
is your safety.

213
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,230
Ice Cube...

214
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,640
Your Grace.

215
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,590
You’re finally awake.

216
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,200
Who are you?

217
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,710
My name is Wu Huan, I belong
to the Feng Clan.

218
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,320
This is the Parasol Forest.

219
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,520
You were hurt by Wuxi yesterday.

220
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,280
The True God took you back here.

221
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,230
What happened to Wuxi?

222
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,030
The Master sentenced him.

223
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,880
What?

224
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,840
Your Grace.

225
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,280
I only got some skin trauma.

226
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,030
But Wuxi is Feng Yan’s only care.

227
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,880
Why did he have to be killed?

228
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,470
Where’s he now?

229
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,840
I’m not sure.

230
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,520
Your Grace.

231
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,670
You just got better.
Please don’t get angry.

232
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,470
If I know this would happen,

233
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,440
I wouldn’t come to the Feng Clan
to select the beasts.

234
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,840
I teared a couple apart.

235
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,470
I even made Wuxi lost his life.

236
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,080
Your Grace.

237
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,670
Selecting Divine Beasts concerns
both the Gods and the Feng Clan.

238
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,840
It’s a rule made by the Ancestral God.

239
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,440
Please don’t blame yourself too much.

240
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,710
The Ancestral God’s will

241
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,840
is to select Divine Beasts
from the Feng Clan.

242
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,150
But it didn’t have to be Feng Yan.

243
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,520
Bai Jue.

244
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,520
Do you still feel uncomfortable?

245
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,320
We promised Feng Yan
to keep Wuxi alive.

246
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,670
Now you’ve killed him.

247
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,110
How should we tell Feng Yan?

248
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,550
You can go first.

249
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,230
Yes.

250
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,910
Still mad?

251
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,910
Yes.

252
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,590
Like I’ve said,

253
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,200
I’d only destroy his cultivation.
I stuck to my words.

254
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,400
I knew you wouldn’t do it.

255
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,840
You’re still recovering. Don’t move.

256
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,910
The only thing for you to do

257
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,030
is to make the choice
of the Divine Beast

258
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,440
to settle everything down.

259
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,960
The girl taking care of me, Wu Huan.

260
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,400
She looks like a low-rank phoenix
of the Feng Clan.

261
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,470
I heard the honor of Feng Clan

262
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,030
is usually decided by their ranks.

263
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,520
I think many low-rank phoenixes

264
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
may admire Feng Yan who was born

265
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,200
in an honorable family that is
be qualified to be the Divine Beast.

266
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
I think Wu Huan does, too.

267
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,910
So, you’d like to choose her
as the Divine Beast?

268
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,230
Yes. If I do,

269
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,320
I mean to let them know

270
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,790
that I treat people

271
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,000
in the Three Realms equally.

272
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,150
I’ll never indulge them with the idea

273
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,640
that family background
decides everything.

274
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,520
By the way,

275
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,910
if I foster

276
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,590
a low-rank phoenix like Wu Huan.

277
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,230
Would the elders of the Feng Clan
be against it?

278
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,710
Some people will.

279
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,830
So, you should come up
with a perfect plan.

280
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,400
To convince the Feng Clan

281
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,920
for their loyalty and help.

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,710
This is...

283
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,920
The left is the real one
and the right is fake.

284
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,430
It’s your call to make the decision.

285
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,880
Ice Cube. You’ve already prepared it.

286
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,590
I didn’t expect it.

287
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,070
You are the best ever.

288
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,520
I’m so impressed.

289
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,310
I don’t like you getting
this close to me.

290
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,230
Well... How about when we hugged?

291
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,110
It was much closer.

292
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,220
♪Time disturb my feelings♪

293
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,220
♪Like you do♪

294
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,220
♪Hold tightly with your warm hand♪

295
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,180
♪Look up at the meteor
across the darkness♪

296
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,700
♪Your tall figure♪

297
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,740
♪Is even clear in the haze♪

298
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,220
♪I save some time♪

299
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,220
♪To exchange it for you♪

300
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,590
What’s wrong?

301
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,430
What’s the matter?

302
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,430
What a bad luck.

303
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,760
I had a dream last night

304
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,350
that the cabbage I grow for a long time

305
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
got picked by a pig!

306
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,040
There’s no pig in the God Realm.

307
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,560
Even if there is, it’d be
a spiritual pig.

308
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,190
Of course it’s a spiritual pig.

309
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,160
Ice Cube.

310
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,190
Be careful.

311
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,110
Don’t drink too much.

312
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,680
You are right.

313
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,040
I found that

314
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,040
ever since Bai Jue and Shanggu
came back from the Nether World,

315
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,280
the atmosphere between them is weird.

316
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,760
So, I’m a bit worried.

317
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,190
What are you worrying about?

318
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,190
I worry that I may lose Shanggu.

319
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,760
She’s not yours anyway.

320
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,590
What do you mean?

321
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,070
Before Bai Jue came,

322
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,430
Shanggu followed me everywhere
all the time.

323
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,760
But now.

324
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,110
All she talks about is Bai Jue.

325
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,190
What’s so good about him?

326
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,590
If I know this.

327
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,070
I’d definitely not

328
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,800
allow Bai Jue to be her master.

329
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,110
Shanggu can make her own choices.

330
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,070
What is she to you?

331
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,760
A kept wife?

332
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,430
Such a healthy relationship

333
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,070
becomes so weird in your words.

334
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,280
I’m free to say anything I like.

335
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,680
If you don’t want to hear it.

336
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
Just go somewhere else.

337
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,400
What’s wrong with you?

338
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,920
The liquor is poisoned, too.

339
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,310
I advise you not to drink it.

340
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,590
What’s wrong with you?

341
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,190
I’ll leave you here to be mad.

342
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,680
I’m going to the lower realm

343
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,520
and replace that Ice Cube.

344
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,430
I can’t let them stay together.

345
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,000
It’s an important matter for them
to chase Feng Yan’s spirit.

346
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,880
Don’t cause troubles for them.

347
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
The Feng Clan needs help.

348
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,800
As the True God, it’s my
responsibility as well.

349
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,110
Tianqi.

350
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,110
If Shanggu doesn’t want
to be with Bai Jue,

351
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,400
she’d walk away without your help.

352
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,190
Besides, it’s their own business.

353
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,070
Why do you want to meddle?

354
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,640
Well... Then don’t you meddle

355
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,110
with my business with Shanggu.

356
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,920
I...

357
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
Just go if you want.
Don’t come back if you do.

358
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,400
Both good and evil.

359
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,400
It perfectly suits my appreciation
of beauty.

360
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,430
Elder Feng Yun.

361
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,110
Your Grace.

362
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,560
I’m giving back Feng Yan’s spirit.

363
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,880
Please keep it well.

364
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,680
Wait until the Queen of Phoenix
come back after a thousand years.

365
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,800
Yes. As Master commands.

366
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,070
I believe you all know

367
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
my trip to the Feng Clan

368
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,190
is to select a Divine Beast for me.

369
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
There’s still some time before

370
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,190
the reborn of the Queen of Phoenix.

371
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,040
I’d like to choose one

372
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,680
from the low-rank Phoenixes.

373
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,110
Your Grace.

374
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,590
How can a low-rank phoenix deserve
to be near around you?

375
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,000
If you agree,

376
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,430
I will let go

377
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,680
of the fact that you lost the spirit.

378
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,400
Wu Huan.

379
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,920
Come here.

380
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,310
For the next a thousand years,
would you like to be my Divine Beast

381
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,590
and come back to the God Realm with me?

382
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,520
Your Grace.

383
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,590
Do you mean it?

384
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,310
I don’t think it’s appropriate
to joke in this occasion.

385
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,160
I...

386
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,160
I’d like to do it.

387
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,430
I hope that

388
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,920
from now on,

389
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
phoenix of the Feng Clan

390
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,280
can all be appreciated
and put in important positions

391
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,000
as long as they are morally qualified
and work hard.

392
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,640
Your Grace is merciful.

393
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,310
I wish after a thousand years,

394
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,400
no one would find out the spirit
is actually fake.

395
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,800
As for the queen’s true spirit,

396
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,680
put it on the flower.

397
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,680
Wuxi’s body will be transformed
into a sycamore tree.

398
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,560
If give it some time,

399
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,640
there’s still a chance for them to meet.

400
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,430
Great divine water.

401
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,590
I got it. You want to buy me
some wonton.

402
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,680
Take a look.

403
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,080
We’ve traveled for a long time.

404
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,430
- Great divine water.
- I am a bit hungry.

405
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,590
Take a look.

406
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,190
The sweet-smelling divine water.

407
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,430
Sir. Two wonton, please.

408
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,590
Okay.

409
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,520
Wu Huan, don’t you want some?

410
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,950
I’m not hungry.

411
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,000
Besides, wonton to me

412
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,520
is just ordinary food.

413
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,640
I’ll wait at table for you two.

414
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,830
Here’s your wonton.

415
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,920
The God Realm is full of elegant taste.

416
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,350
A simple bowl of food
is called wonton.

417
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,190
I think the best place

418
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,310
for the wonton to go would
be my stomach.

419
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,760
Yum.

420
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,950
Delicious.

421
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,280
No wonder it has an interesting name.

422
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,070
I caught you.

423
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,280
You ate the God of Chaos.

424
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,590
According to the rules in God Realm,

425
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,040
how should I dispose you?

426
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,350
Boring.

427
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,160
Is this the Divine Beast you chose?

428
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,880
Her story went all over the God Realm.

429
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,560
It’s more ridiculous than a drama.

430
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,950
Wu Huan. You are my Divine Beast now.

431
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,880
Since you’re in The Pilgrimage Hall,

432
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,350
you’ve become one of us.

433
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,760
No matter how you used to be bullied
in the Feng Clan.

434
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,470
From now on,

435
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,040
you can straighten up

436
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,160
and focus on cultivating now.

437
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,400
Yes, Your Grace.

438
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,070
In the God Realm,

439
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,000
many look down me as a Chief God.

440
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,400
Many look down on you

441
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,590
as a low-rank phoenix, too.

442
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,680
Let’s train harder

443
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,830
and impress those who are blind.

444
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,000
Isn’t it cool?

445
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,520
Yes, Your Grace.

446
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,830
You two can get along.

447
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,470
Maybe you can really
do something one day.

448
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,160
You’ve neglected training.

449
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,710
You only care about gossip.

450
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,160
Your Immortal-seeking Bell
isn’t working anymore.

451
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,070
I just check it. It’s fine.

452
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,310
Your Grace. Your Grace.

453
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,310
Your Grace.

454
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,350
Xueying broke into the Changyuan Hall.

455
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,160
I couldn’t stop her.

456
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,430
Isn’t she afraid
of Bai Jue’s punishment?

457
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,950
I came to tell you another news.

458
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,680
Bai Jue took Xueying as his apprentice,

459
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,160
it’s all over the God’s Realm now.

460
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,070
That’s impossible.

461
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,950
It’s true.

462
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,310
Xueying said

463
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,430
Bai Jue personally took her.

464
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,900
(Endure the Hardship)

465
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,520
After all these years,

466
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,400
I can finally walk into
the Changyuan Hall justifiably.

467
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,040
I can stay with Master all the time now.

468
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,560
I have to seize this chance.

469
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,950
I still remember

470
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,680
our first met
in the Plum Blossom Garden.

471
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,350
You once said to me,

472
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,040
the plum blossoming on the branch
to wait for me.

473
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,000
Until now,

474
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,710
I’ve not forgotten.

475
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,830
Your Grace.

476
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,560
Master has said

477
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,430
that you’re forbidden
to enter Changyuan Hall.

478
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,230
Hongri. Send her out.

479
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,040
Your Grace doesn’t know yet.

480
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,350
Bai Jue Master has taken me
as his apprentice.

481
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,470
From now on, I’ll be living
in the Changyuan Hall

482
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,920
and cultivate with you.

483
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Living in the Changyuan Hall?

484
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,430
Who said it?

485
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,470
Master’s instruction feather is here.

486
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,560
I doubt if Your Grace don’t
recognize it.

487
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,070
I don’t believe it.

488
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,430
Unless he tells me himself.

489
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,920
Who are you to judge
Master’s apprentices?

490
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,280
Your Grace don’t do any work

491
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,880
but meddling with other’s business
in Changyuan Hall.

492
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,430
You put the cart before the horse.

493
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,590
I’ve heard it before

494
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,230
that Your Grace don’t like cultivating.

495
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,190
It’s a waste of your position
as the Chief God.

496
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,760
Well.

497
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,950
Just travel around
and enjoy the beautiful scenery.

498
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,470
Why would you stay here and suffer?

499
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,310
After all.

500
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,640
Not everyone can be
a disciple of Master Bai Jue.

501
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,920
It’s better for someone who is
not worthy of their position

502
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,800
to leave before it is too late.

503
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,560
Don’t ruin the reputation of the master
and make a fool of yourself.

504
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,160
Then become the mockery
of the Gold Realm.

505
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,950
Xueying, you made me do it.

506
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,000
Ancestral Sword.

507
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,160
Will you go by yourself today,

508
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,680
or I’ll use the Ancestral Sword?

509
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,920
I didn’t expect Your Grace would
have such profound God power

510
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,560
when getting angry.

511
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,400
Your Grace seems to have indeed

512
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,160
fulfilled the tease before

513
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,400
to tear down the Changyuan Hall
after having learned something.

514
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,310
Master.

515
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,310
Bai Jue, explain to me clearly.

516
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,470
Shanggu.

517
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,400
From now on, you and Xueying
will practice together.

518
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,040
There are so many people in God Realm.

519
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,710
Why did you take her as your disciple?

520
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,640
Water Bead.

521
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,350
Master. Xueying was just a little angry

522
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,590
and offended Her Grace.

523
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,950
Goddess of Snow, if you
can use another trick,

524
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,190
maybe Master can think highly of you.

525
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,160
What happened today won’t be repeated.

526
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,160
If anyone dares to stir up trouble
in the future.

527
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,760
I will not spare him.

528
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,820
(Endure the Hardship)

529
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,950
I won’t believe that

530
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,680
if I’m with Master every day.

531
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,310
I can’t be better than you
who are stupid.

532
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,760
Your Grace.

533
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,920
Your Grace.

534
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,230
Your Grace. It’s Day of the Chosen
in a few days.

535
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,070
Master Zhiyang has specially
sent a feast robe.

536
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,590
Throw it all out.

537
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,280
Throw all these white clothes out!

538
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,160
Your Grace. Didn’t I choose well?

539
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,000
It’s not your fault.

540
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I get angry

541
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,880
when I see the white clothes.

542
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,070
Master only took a disciple, not a wife.

543
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,880
Why are you so angry?

544
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,560
He knew that I hate Xueying

545
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,430
but took her as a disciple.

546
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,160
It is because of the Water Bead.

547
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,350
I should pay back what I owe.

548
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,160
Master must have treated you
as his own family.

549
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,040
Who wants to be

550
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,470
a sibling kind of relative with him?

551
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,590
She likes to learn skills
from Master, right?

552
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,560
Then I’ll satisfy her.

553
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,310
Yesterday, Her Grace left in anger.

554
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,680
I guess she won’t come today.

555
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,000
Your Grace.

556
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,800
You are so beautiful today!

557
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,800
Of course.

558
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,920
I am beautiful every day.

559
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,680
Don’t be late tomorrow.

560
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,710
Plus,

561
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,680
it’s cold in spring.

562
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,280
Wear more clothes next time.

563
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,830
Don’t just talk about me.

564
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,400
Do you see what your disciple
is wearing?

565
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,710
It’s not summer yet, is it?

566
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,310
Goddess of Snow, you put on
too little clothes.

567
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,040
I can’t tolerate the heat.
Your Grace are joking.

568
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,350
I have thought about it.

569
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,920
Goddess of Snow didn’t hesitate
to use Water Bead

570
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,470
to become a disciple of Bai Jue.

571
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,950
I think you must be dedicated
to learning

572
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,800
and hungry for practice, right?

573
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,940
All these ancient books were sent
to me by Zhiyang.

574
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,100
Today.

575
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,780
I’ll give you all of them

576
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,300
to pay back what I owe you.

577
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,000
Thank you for your generosity.
Your Grace.

578
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,880
Reading requires meditation.

579
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,710
You also know the nature of me.

580
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,470
If you stay in the Changyuan Hall.

581
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,110
I’m sure I’m going to bother you.

582
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,280
I suggest that you should
take these books back.

583
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,000
Close the door and learn.

584
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,590
Tell me when you finish.

585
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,710
I have everything that you need.

586
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,590
Don’t be so polite.

587
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,800
But I’ve read all these books.

588
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,400
Is that so?

589
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,430
Your Grace don’t believe me.

590
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,350
Well, to you.

591
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,560
It’s difficult for you to finish
reading them all.

592
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Don’t underestimate me.

593
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,760
I have read all these books.

594
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,350
Since you have read it all.

595
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,230
I won’t lend them to you.

596
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,520
Wait.

597
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,820
(The Classic of Mountains and Rivers)

598
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,040
The Classic of Mountains and Rivers.
The classic of the God Realm.

599
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,160
Although it has access
to the world’s mountains and rivers.

600
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,280
It’s difficult to understand.

601
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,680
This book looks brand new.

602
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,110
Did Your Grace really read it?

603
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,680
Of course.

604
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,160
Just The Classic
of Mountains and Rivers.

605
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,760
When do we start the class?

606
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,400
(Endure the Hardship)

607
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,590
Since you two have both studied
The Classic of Mountains and Rivers.

608
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,190
Then I will give you a test.

609
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,430
Xueying.

610
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,560
Yes.

611
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,040
It is said in the book that there is
a thing born on the Western Sea.

612
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
The area is filled with spices and gold.

613
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,880
Its shape is like leek,
and its flower is cyan.

614
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,590
What’s its name?

615
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,560
This is a kind of grass called Zhu Yu.

616
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,430
What is its use?

617
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,000
You won’t go hungry if you eat it.

618
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,350
The head of the Northern Mountain
is called the Mount Shanhu.

619
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,680
Another 250 miles north.

620
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,230
A Mountain called Qiuru.

621
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,160
It is full of jade, no grass and trees.

622
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,400
Good.

623
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,400
Shanggu.

624
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,710
Just ask.

625
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,640
I know this book backwards
and forwards.

626
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,800
I understand all of them.

627
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,190
The head of the Northern Mountain
is called the Mount Shanhu.

628
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,000
And 300 miles north, called...

629
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,190
What’s next?

630
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,080
Luckily I was prepared.

631
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,870
And 300 miles north, called...

632
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,840
The Classic of Mountains and Rivers...

633
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,000
Go, go, go!

634
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,760
Here it is. Here it is.

635
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,230
Can’t you answer it?

636
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,470
(The Classic of Mountains and Rivers)

637
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,190
Your Grace.

638
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,320
Mount Dai with jade on it
and a lot of green jade under it.

639
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:41,000
Mount Dai with jade on it
and a lot of green jade under it.

640
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,000
Goddess, my answer is not right?

641
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,080
Absolutely right.

642
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,950
Hongri. Go get two cups of hot tea

643
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,080
Okay, I’ll go get it for Your Grace.

644
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,560
A beast born in the West Sea.

645
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,230
It looks like Yu with white ears.

646
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,760
And it can crawl on all fours
and walk like a man, what is its name?

647
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,280
And it can Crawl on all fours
and walk like a man, called...

648
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,760
W... Where is it?

649
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,320
I can’t find it!

650
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,000
Your Grace.

651
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,360
This is the content of the first
volume of the book.

652
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,080
You just said that you
can recite it backwards.

653
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,670
Now you don’t know it.

654
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,280
Well.

655
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,430
- Can you answer?
- The first volume...

656
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,870
Shanggu.

657
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,870
It’s called Xingxing. If you eat it
and you will walk fast.

658
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,950
It’s called Xingxing. If you eat it
and you will walk fast.

659
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,230
Your Grace is really knowledgeable!

660
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,630
Even these earrings are extraordinary.

661
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,430
Lying and deception

662
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,120
are worse than uneducated.

663
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,150
Okay, I know.

664
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,040
The Classic of Mountains and Rivers
is difficult to read.

665
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,870
If you want to memorize it,
you need to work hard.

666
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,520
Shanggu,

667
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,150
I will test you again in a few days.

668
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,150
Understood.

669
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,800
The next question I would like to ask

670
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,600
is the matter involving
the management of the Three Realms.

671
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,360
You should study it well as a Chief God.

672
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,040
The issues involving
the management of the Three Realms.

673
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,470
There is nothing more superficial
than the customs and traditions,

674
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,430
astronomy and geography

675
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,040
So that you can adapt
to the local conditions.

676
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,560
And deal with all the problems.

677
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,670
My next topic is

678
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,840
The Tiger Demons live all year
round in the Red Blood Forest.

679
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,040
This area is barren.

680
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,470
In what ways do they practice?

681
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,560
The Tiger Demons are savage,
cruel and murderous by nature

682
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,630
They must have obtained the spiritual power
by eating their own kind

683
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,710
to improve themselves.

684
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,120
I didn’t realize that Goddess of Snow
is just an armchair strategist.

685
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Sitting and talking.

686
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,870
The Tiger Demons are an
extremely united group.

687
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,840
All of them got the spiritual
power from God of Demons.

688
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,760
Then mastered the basic power
to practice.

689
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,230
They rely on generations
of inheritance and accumulation

690
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,630
to have strong spiritual power.

691
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,430
Red blood Forest is hot in all seasons.

692
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,390
I have never been there
to perform a spell.

693
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,190
So I don’t know the cause and effect.

694
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,950
Please punish me, Master.

695
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,520
Punishment is not necessary.

696
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,040
But there is no end of learning.

697
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,710
Don’t be someone who is

698
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,320
strong in appearance
but weak in reality.

699
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,840
Yes, I will remember the teachings
of Master.

700
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,430
Your Grace.

701
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,760
Look at me.

702
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,230
I forgot about Goddess of Snow.

703
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,800
But you are made of ice.

704
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,150
I don’t think it’s necessary to have
hot tea to drive away the cold.

705
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,950
Shanggu.

706
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,520
You are the Chief God.

707
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,470
You are closely related to
the Three Realms and you just recovered.

708
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,280
Take more care of yourself
in the future.

709
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,950
Okay.

710
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,430
Really?

711
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,360
When did Ice Cube become so warm?

712
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,630
You didn’t make it up, did you?

713
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,670
Look at my charm.

714
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
Look at you.

715
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,910
Do you have confidence

716
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,840
to attract Bai Jue?

717
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,120
Pretty close.

718
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,390
It’s like 80%.

719
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,230
80%?

720
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,120
Not that confident.

721
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,470
I think you are really into this.

722
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,870
Completely fallen into this.

723
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,800
This is not useful for me.

724
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,870
Here you are.

725
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,230
Thank you.

726
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,390
Ice Cube was on my side.

727
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,390
Maybe he also likes me, right?

728
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,230
But why doesn’t he tell me?

729
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,580
(Bai Jue)

730
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,040
I see.

731
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,560
Ice Cube. Don’t be afraid

732
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,600
I’ll help you out of your misery.

733
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,860
(Xueying)

734
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,840
Xueying.

735
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,360
I’ll see how you can pursue
Bai Jue in the future.

736
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,150
Ancestral God, bless me
to be successful.

737
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:10,870
Otherwise.

738
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,670
My years of being single would be
in vain.

739
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,840
Created by nature,

740
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,120
You called me here in a hurry.
What happened?

741
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,000
When I begged you to come here,

742
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,230
I was worried that

743
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,280
Shanggu won’t take over
the position of the Chief God.

744
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,120
The speed of the collapse of the Power
of Chaos in the lower Realm

745
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,670
is faster than we can imagine.

746
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,000
The power of chaos collapses everywhere.

747
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,910
Then barriers everywhere

748
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,040
and seals must have been damaged.

749
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,150
You should send someone

750
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,320
to repair the barrier
as soon as possible.

751
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,120
Of course I know this.

752
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,190
But tomorrow is the Day of the Chosen.

753
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,870
The Immortals in the lower Realm
who just cultivated to the top

754
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,600
will enter the God Realm for practice.

755
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:12,800
I am determined to

756
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,840
select an outstanding disciple
for Shanggu

757
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,760
to help her practice.

758
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,320
I called you to ask you.

759
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,760
How many more days does
Shanggu need to become Chief God?

760
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,710
She learns fast, but it’s
still a short time.

761
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,120
I’m afraid it will take
ten thousand years longer.

762
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,230
Ten Thousand Years?

763
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,360
No.

764
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,150
The later she becomes Chief God,

765
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,710
more dangerous the lower Realm will be.

766
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,520
Master Bai Jue.

767
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,630
You guys guard here every day.

768
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,000
Is there anything strange?

769
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,280
I did not find any strange.

770
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,710
I would like to ask Master to explain.

771
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,280
Never mind.

772
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,520
Guard this place, I will personally
go in to have a look.

773
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:55,760
Yes.

774
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,600
The spiritual power is thin here,
so the seal should be damaged.

775
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,430
But the God-holding lock
is not weakened in any way.

776
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,710
It’s chaos.

777
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,630
