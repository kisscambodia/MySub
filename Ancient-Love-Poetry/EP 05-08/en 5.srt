=Episode 5=

3
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,040
I just saw...

4
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,440
The Ancestral God

5
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,440
was really harsh on you
when you were a kid.

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,630
I’m used to it.

7
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,310
I used to be a loner.

8
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,630
And I will still be one in the future.

9
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,550
What are you doing?

10
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,440
Don’t push me away. I have injuries.

11
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,830
Bai Jue.

12
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,550
Not everyone is indifferent

13
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,360
and timid in the world.

14
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,360
The relationship between people

15
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,950
should be kind and warm.

16
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,390
From now on,

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,630
I will always be with you.

18
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,080
I’ll accompany you to cultivate,
study and drink.

19
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,110
When the weather is clear,

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,670
we can go out to fly a kite.

21
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,110
From now on,

22
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I won’t leave you alone anymore.

When Zhiyang comes back tomorrow,

38
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,960
I’m afraid I will be sent to the lower realm
for tens of thousands of years

39
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,670
and can’t come back.

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,160
What’s the big deal?

41
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,240
I’ll take the wine to see you.

42
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,440
You know nothing!

43
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,550
Am I afraid of living without drinking?

44
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,240
I’m afraid
I won’t be able to see Shanggu!

45
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,550
Then I won’t pay a visit to you,

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,270
so that you don’t even have a drink.

47
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,880
Yuemi, I didn’t mean that.

48
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,600
Of course you are very important to me.

49
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,830
But think about it.

50
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,360
I had an illustrious life,

51
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,270
waiting for ten thousand years.

52
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,160
Now I am about to be together
with Shanggu.

53
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,110
Why it could be messed up by these two?

54
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,550
What do you say?

55
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,440
Sorry.

56
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,600
This is my own trouble.

57
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,670
I will take all the blame tomorrow.

58
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,520
Is that true?

59
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,270
I’m serious.

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,800
Good friend!

61
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,830
Then you stay here.

62
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,190
I’m going to see Shanggu.

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,110
Little Day, I miss you!

64
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,550
Where are you?

65
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,270
- Little Night!
- Little Day!

66
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,350
- Little Night!
- Little Day!

67
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,670
Little Night!

68
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,920
Little Day!

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,320
Little Night!

70
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
Little Day!

71
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,230
Little Day!

72
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,350
- Little Day!
- Little Night!

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,200
- Puhua’s Rope of Love…
- Little Day!

74
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,600
- When did it work?
- I miss you!

75
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,000
- Even the True God can’t stand it.
- Little Night!

76
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Yuemi, hold on!

77
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,230
I cannot make it!

78
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,980
- Little Night!
- Little Day!

79
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,760
Why are they so strong?

80
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,110
Little Night!

81
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,350
Come here!

82
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,110
Our God Realm finally has a happy event!

83
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,110
What?

84
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,230
Master Bai Jue, why is that you?

85
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,510
Why are you here?

86
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,760
I didn’t know that

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,230
God Puhua has such a wonderful place.

88
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,760
Master, forgive me.

89
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,390
Yesterday, the sun and the moon
went dark together.

90
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,110
I was too far away

91
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,350
to see it clearly.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,480
So it was you
who entered the secret room yesterday?

93
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,720
How’s the lady who followed you in?

94
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,550
Is this place laid for Tianqi?

95
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
This joy room…

96
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,720
Yes.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,390
It’s Master Tianqi who asked me
to help arrange it.

98
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,790
But he didn’t come yesterday,
and you came in.

99
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,440
I really don’t know why this happened.

100
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,720
Why did he arrange this?

101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,720
Well… This is for

102
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,390
his date with Shanggu.

103
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,760
Shanggu and he

104
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,320
had a deep friendship since little.

105
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,350
Now Shanggu has grown up.

106
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,350
Master Tianqi

107
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,790
will ponder their date every day

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,880
to marry Shanggu home.

109
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,350
He even let me

110
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,350
play matchmaker.

111
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,920
Did you?

112
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,760
Yes, but it didn’t work.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,040
How can I be a matchmaker

114
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,160
for gods in God Realm?

115
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,640
I just couldn’t let them be together.

116
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,110
That’s weird.

117
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,640
Did the turmoil yesterday…

118
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,480
Did I even get Shanggu wrong?

119
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,880
You even mistook me and Tianqi

120
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,350
who have so many differences.

121
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Not to mention Shanggu.

122
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,160
Yes, yes. It’s all my fault!

123
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,200
You’re not qualified to be a matchmaker
for True Gods.

124
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,760
Don’t mind our business in the future.

125
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,320
As the Chief God, Shanggu

126
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,720
bears the responsibility
of heaven and earth.

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,040
How can her love be arranged casually?

128
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,230
Tianqi went a little too much.

129
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,070
You’re right, True God Bai Jue.

130
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,640
This time I was indeed inconsiderate.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,230
I promise that from now on,

132
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,110
I will never arrange any date
for Shanggu.

133
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,920
I’ll let her be single
for 100,000 years!

134
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,790
Master Bai Jue, yesterday…

135
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,510
Oh! Nothing happened yesterday!

136
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,830
I am really old!

137
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,070
I’m really confused.

138
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,760
After the banquet was over yesterday,

139
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:03,950
I...

140
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,950
I went back to the cave to rest early.

141
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,440
Right?

142
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:10,950
Just leave.

143
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,350
Yes, yes. I’m leaving.

144
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,950
I’m leaving.

145
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,000
Weren’t I dreaming just now, right?

146
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,510
You were not!

147
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,720
True God Bai Jue really holds a lady!

148
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,270
Oh my goodness!

149
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,920
This…

150
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,230
Who is that lady?

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,640
I do not know.

152
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,880
Ancestral God bless us.

153
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,160
Our God Realm is going to gossip!

154
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,830
God of Day and God of Night,

155
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,110
after you two fell in love,

156
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,040
regardless of the rules,
you privately went to the lower realm.

157
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,200
You turned the day and night upside down,
causing a catastrophe.

158
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,320
Do you admit your guilt?

159
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,070
Master, it is all my fault.

160
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,110
Yesterday, I forcibly led the God of Day
to the lower realm.

161
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,350
That’s why we made a big mistake.

162
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,510
Master, no matter
how harsh the punishment is,

163
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,070
I’ll assume to myself all the blame.

164
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,550
Please don’t blame the God of Day.

165
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,670
True God Zhiyang,

166
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,200
I forcibly let the God of Night
go to the lower realm with me.

167
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,830
It’s my fault
and it has nothing to do with him!

168
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,920
Please don’t blame the God of Night.

169
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,550
No, it’s me who couldn’t help
and made a big mistake!

170
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,440
It has nothing to do
with the God of Day.

171
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,480
The God of Night…

172
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,600
God of Day and God of Night,

173
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,030
Puhua has cut off the Rope of Love
for you.

174
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,760
Is the affection between you true?

175
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,960
It begins with a misunderstanding,

176
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,400
stuck in acquaintance,

177
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,960
and becomes loyal to love.

178
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,960
Me, too.

179
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,470
Enough.

180
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,670
Even if you two
have such a reasonable excuse,

181
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,150
you were indeed wrong.

182
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,710
You must be punished severely.

183
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,000
Master, what’s wrong to like someone?

184
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,710
Which rule stipulates

185
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,280
the two of them can’t be together?

186
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,880
Nonsense!

187
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,550
You are also a senior in the God Realm.

188
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,440
Day and night are not allowed
to be at the same time.

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,790
It is the law of nature!

190
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,280
It’s known to all three-year-old kids!

191
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
It doesn’t need to be written
in the rules!

192
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,470
It’s not their fault anyway.

193
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,550
Yesterday I accidentally threw

194
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,470
Puhua’s Rope of Love on them.

195
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,440
That’s why they went to the lower realm
regardless of their responsibilities.

196
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,590
I am also responsible.

197
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,910
I shouldn’t have set a Dating Event.

198
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:27,960
Puhua.

199
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,640
You were doing right.

200
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,230
You were just following Tianqi’s orders.

201
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,110
It’s you, Yuemi.

202
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,840
I won’t blame you for messing around
in normal times.

203
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,760
Can’t you tell the importance
of this matter?

204
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,030
Yuemi.

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,640
You always blame yourself
for everything.

206
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,320
That’s a bad habit.

207
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,910
When can you change it?

208
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,080
Tianqi.

209
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,110
I am a real man.

210
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,790
One should answer for what he does.

211
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,150
I just drank some wine and

212
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,520
threw a Rope of Love on them.

213
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,960
Just do what’s necessary.

214
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,840
Master Tianqi.

215
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,150
You are the True God.
Why do you want to protect Goddess Yuemi?

216
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,470
And this rope is obviously her…

217
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,280
What hers?

218
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,640
I prepared it for me and Shanggu.

219
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,640
What’s the big deal?

220
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,760
You talk nonsense!

221
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,350
What are you doing?

222
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,110
You can hold the Dating Event
without telling me.

223
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,000
But you even talk nonsense now!

224
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,200
The Rope of Love belongs to you, right?

225
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,760
Alright.

226
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,150
You caused the chaos.

227
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,520
Go lock yourself in the Bright Hall!

228
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,840
You can come out again

229
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,840
only when you recognize your fault.

230
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,640
Why? It’s just a bloody rope!

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,640
You are alone for hundreds
of thousands of years.

232
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,030
But you can’t stop others
from finding their happiness!

233
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,640
Shut up!

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,520
Come, pull him down for me!

235
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,760
Master Zhiyang!

236
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:37,840
No need!

237
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,200
I can walk myself!

238
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,710
Was I in the secret room
of Taoyuan Forest?

239
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,150
How did I come back?

240
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,400
Master Bai Jue held you back.

241
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,030
Was I sleeping beautifully?

242
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,470
Was I

243
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,470
snoring or drooling?

244
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,940
A little.

245
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,440
Did anyone see it?

246
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,400
Everyone saw you.

247
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,200
Oh my! It’s horrible! It’s a big mess!

248
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,840
All Goddesses

249
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,960
will definitely hit me
once they see me in the future.

250
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,640
Some might kill me!

251
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,760
Then do I have to pick a time
when nobody else is there

252
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,520
to go to Changyuan Hall
to practice in the future?

253
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,710
Why are you laughing?

254
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,640
Don’t I look good as other Goddess?

255
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,640
Your Grace is the most beautiful.

256
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,590
Go.

257
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,150
Yes.

258
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,640
What should I wear on tomorrow’s class?

259
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,840
My red dress…

260
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,880
Or the green one?

261
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,470
Who was he holding?

262
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,640
Which lady was it?

263
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,710
Come, come, buy away!

264
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,760
Let’s guess

265
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,710
who actually touched the heart

266
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,320
of our Master Bai Jue.

267
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,200
Come, come, come!

268
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,880
Bet all.

269
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,080
How dare you make fun of Master!

270
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,400
Greetings, Master Bai Jue.

271
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,960
What should we do with them?

272
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,590
What’s the situation?

273
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,960
Which type do they think I like?

274
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,470
(Lovely)

275
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,670
They bet on the lovely type most.

276
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,000
Why?

277
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,470
Maybe

278
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,670
yin and yang meridians link each other
in you.

279
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,150
It turns out that I am so indifferent
in your hearts.

280
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,550
Hongri said something wrong.

281
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,320
It’s okay. I’m too serious.

282
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,150
This dress…

283
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
It’s her.

284
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,590
Master Bai Jue actually cares about her.

285
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,550
(Temple of Love)

286
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,000
What a day!

287
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,960
I really want to die.

288
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,200
How dare me mind the Gods’ business!

289
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,670
I won’t do that again.

290
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,030
Or…

291
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,910
I’d better close this Temple of Love.

292
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,520
Yes, retreat for two hundred years.

293
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
To cool off.

294
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,710
Puhua.

295
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,470
Greetings, Your Grace.

296
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,150
Please get up.

297
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,150
You are in charge of marriage
of the Three Realms.

298
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,960
You should know the best
about love, right?

299
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,080
Since you said so,

300
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,910
do you want to know what love is?

301
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,080
Yeah, what is love?

302
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,960
The storybooks always say that true love
is the promise of life and death.

303
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,880
Then tell me.
If we don’t risk life and death,

304
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,150
isn’t our love true?

305
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,590
Your Grace, you may have worshipped
the wrong temple.

306
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,790
You don’t even know that.

307
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,790
No wonder there are so many foolish
men and women in the lower realm.

308
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,320
No. Well. This…

309
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,640
This word of love is very difficult
to understand.

310
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,760
You don’t know and I don’t know either.

311
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,710
Those who are trapped in love
don’t even know.

312
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,550
So there will be a saying goes like

313
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,230
we don’t know where love starts,
but it goes deeper and deeper.

314
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,400
How can I tell?

315
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,150
Your Grace.

316
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you want to tell

317
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,840
who you like in your heart?

318
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,400
Yes.

319
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,960
Your Grace, if you ask like that,

320
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,760
I’m afraid that you’re already touched
and trapped by love.

321
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,670
Stop talking nonsense!

322
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,520
I’m just curious.

323
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,760
Your Grace, if you really want to know

324
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,150
who is the one you like,

325
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,030
you can feel it with your heart.

326
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,520
Feel what?

327
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,030
What you think, what you miss,
and what you expect

328
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,320
is the person you really like.

329
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,280
You are considerate and thoughtful,
gentle and generous,

330
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
beautiful and brilliant,
tender and attentive.

331
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,230
You’re the best in the Three Realms.

332
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,350
Your Grace, let me give you a few words.

333
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,590
Love is just like this jug of wine.

334
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,470
The first sip is refreshing.

335
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,280
But if it tastes rich,

336
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,520
it will be entangled
with evil intentions.

337
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,710
Your Grace, you must be careful.

338
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,910
Entanglement?

339
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,440
Does this guy attract a lot of beauties?

340
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,200
I’m not as good as others?

341
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,470
The stars are so bright tonight.

342
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,110
It’s not worse than those
at the Mount Lookout.

343
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,280
How did you come?

344
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,320
I’m afraid you are alone in the temple.

345
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,760
I specially come to visit.

346
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,400
I’ll chat with you.

347
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,000
Did you drink wine?

348
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,470
Today I am in a good mood.

349
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,790
I had a few drinks.

350
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,520
Sit down and I’ll sober you up.

so that you have a poker face,

or because

363
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,710
you don’t know what expression to show

364
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,350
so that you have no expression at all.

Do you remember that

366
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,710
you asked me

00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,830
You finally want to speak the truth.

370
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,680
Where there is inferiority,

371
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,280
there is conceit.

372
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,430
Your God vessels are smooth now
and you are so powerful.

373
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,560
Those tricks pretending to be
weak and stubborn before.

374
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,640
Don’t play them again in the future.

375
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,310
I feel tired for you.

376
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,280
Still want to talk?

377
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,040
I don’t want to talk anymore.
You’re so good at talking.

378
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,560
Do you want to learn some new moves?

379
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,000
In addition to practice,

380
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,560
can’t we do something else?

381
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,800
What do you mean?

382
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,950
For example…

383
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,560
Stars?

384
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,310
Watch the stars.

385
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,560
The stars in Mount Lookout
are the most beautiful.

386
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,280
But you never bring me to watch them.

387
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,070
If you want to see the stars,
go by yourself.

388
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,470
Why do you want me to bring you there?

389
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,880
You have to take me there!

390
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,920
I know a place

391
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,560
better than Mount Lookout.

392
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,230
This is the Heaven & Earth Platform

393
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,230
where the Ancestral God
released the warning.

394
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,920
It is said that

395
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,070
between heaven and earth,

396
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,070
a calamity will come
every 180,000 years.

397
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,520
Only the Chief God of Chaos
can resist it with God power

398
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,000
to eliminate the catastrophe

399
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,680
and save the common people,
bringing the peace.

400
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,160
Seventy thousand years ago,

401
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,070
the Ancestral God wanted
to pass the throne to Xuanyi.

402
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,520
But Xuanyi lost his mind
and became a demon.

403
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,160
That led to a catastrophe
of heaven and earth.

404
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,310
I know all this.

405
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,560
The Ancestral God passed with the void,

406
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,230
leaving behind a breath of chaos

407
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,230
on this platform.

408
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,070
I was born here
after thousands of years.

409
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,800
I was born to inherit the will
of my Ancestral God.

410
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,760
I’m destined to bring peace
to the world.

411
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,640
So, Shanggu.

412
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,070
You’ll take charge of the world.

413
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,430
Behind the greater power than others,

414
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
you have
the most important responsibility.

415
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,000
I will practice hard.

416
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,640
I will work harder than you think

417
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,000
and take charge of the instruction feather
of Chief God as soon as possible

418
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,800
to become the Chief God of Chaos.

419
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,710
Where’s your compliment?

420
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,070
Don’t keep your poker face.

421
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,190
Once your face is cold,

422
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,430
I feel uncomfortable looking at it.

423
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,560
When I feel uncomfortable,
I won’t practice well.

424
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,280
If I don’t practice well,

425
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,800
I can’t serve as the Chief God of Chaos.

426
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,000
Who can I blame?

427
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,190

Were you having a nightmare?

452
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,380
Or are you suddenly in a bad mood?

453
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:47,980
It’s okay.

454
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,060
Something happened
in the Nether World again?

455
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,740
No.

456
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,070
Are there any warnings
related to Shanggu released

457
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,160
from the Heaven & Earth Platform
these days?

458
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,350
No.

459
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,400
Since Shanggu was born,

460
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,040
the Ancestral God has failed to warn
for many years.

461
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,000
Shanggu is burdened.

462
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,000
It’s about the power of chaos
and all common people in the lower realm.

463
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,430
There must be no mistakes.

464
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,560
Issue an imperial order tomorrow.

465
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,160
Within 100 meters
of Heaven & Earth Platform,

466
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,880
no God is allowed to take a step close.

467
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,880
Why so strict?

468
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,590
If the Ancestral God
has released some warnings,

469
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,560
all Gods must get informed
at the first time.

470
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,710
Heaven & Earth Platform
is the cornerstone of the God Realm.

471
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,280
Although Xuanyi has been sealed now,

472
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,590
we cannot let our guard down.

473
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,400
In order to prevent the Devils
from coming back,

474
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,760
I will personally guard
the Heaven & Earth Platform in the future.

475
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,000
Alright then. Tianqi has become
more and more absurd recently.

476
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,710
Since you have returned,

477
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,880
before Shanggu takes over
the instruction feather of Chief God,

478
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,040
you can take main control
of some affairs of God Realm,

479
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,160
lest the kind of chaos
God of Day and God of Night

480
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,000
caused destroying the rules

481
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,950
happen again.

482
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,760
I was just asked to come back
to teach Shanggu.

483
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,950
Well.

484
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,950
I have to take main control
of some affairs of God Realm.

485
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,350
Rest assured.

486
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,040
Wait till this is done.

487
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,430
I will send you back to Mount Lookout

488
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,160
and you can enjoy the leisure alone, OK?

489
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,000
Don’t have to.

490
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,470
I accept your arrangement.

491
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,680
True God Bai Jue has a hard mouth
and a soft heart.

492
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,680
You are the most righteous.

493
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,920
Why you look like this?

494
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,560
Isn’t it just a few thunders?

495
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,310
Thunder Punishment from the True God.

496
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,310
Even me

497
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,350
can’t stand it.

498
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,920
How can Zhiyang

499
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,160
treat you this way!

500
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,470
It’s me who made the God of Day
and God of Night fall in love

501
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,590
and broke the rules.

502
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,280
I should be punished.

503
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,520
No, I’m going to find him!

504
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,470
I’m thirsty.

505
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,350
Why don’t you even have water?

506
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,040
I don’t want to drink the water here.

507
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,400
Then wait for me to get you
some spring water.

508
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,160
Fetching spring water
is too troublesome.

509
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,470
You go to Taichu Hall

510
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,760
and bring me a few jars of fine wine.

511
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,760
You are a prisoner of Bright Hall.

512
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,230
According to the rule,
you should not drink alcohol.

513
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,710
Yuemi, I’m really thirsty.

514
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,800
You help me.

515
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,110
OK.

516
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,640
I’ll take some for you now.

517
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,470
It’s okay to break the rules for you.

518
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,950
No matter how many of them.

519
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,680
The more, the better.

520
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,920
OK.

521
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,680
Yuemi, I remember that

522
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,950
I have a few jars of fine wine
of thousands of years.

523
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,950
Go ask Zihan. He knows where they are.

524
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,070
And the batch of tribute from Donghai.

525
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,160
Please also fetch them for me.

526
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,160
Hurry up and go back soon.
I’m waiting for you!

527
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,710
Why are you not weak now?

528
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,280
You just want to drink alcohol!

529
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,310
You…

530
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,040
What happened?

531
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,590
Don’t you want to know

532
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,950
why I throw that Rope of Love away?

533
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:09,920
Yes.

534
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,830
You asked the Rope of Love for whom?

535
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,190
Do you really fancy someone?

536
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,230
I shouldn’t have asked you that.

537
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,000
Do you really have a crush on a God?

538
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,760
OK.

539
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,920
When I leave the Bright Hall,

540
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,280
I’ll help you check it myself.

541
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,280
I tell you.

542
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,400
In our Gods’ eyes
and your Goddesses’ eyes,

543
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,400
people are different.

544
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
You are not uncomfortable?

545
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,920
This is a good thing.
Why am I uncomfortable?

546
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,800
I’m not asking it for myself.

547
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,560
I’m…

548
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,000
Don’t you like Shanggu?

549
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,470
I asked it for you.

550
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,000
Yuemi!

551
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,520
Since you are affectionate
and I am righteous,

552
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,560
from today on,

553
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,710
we become brothers, OK?

554
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,310
From then on,
I will be your big brother.

555
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,470
Or you want to be the big brother?

556
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,760
Is it inappropriate?

557
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,920
Who wants to be your brother?

558
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,590
You haven’t fetched the wine for me yet.

559
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,110
I asked you to give me a suggestion.

560
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,680
Why do you look more worried than me?

561
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,160
Are you feel bored again

562
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,950
practicing with Bai Jue?

563
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,190
Do you want to go to the lower realm
to make trouble again?

564
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:46,920
No.

565
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,680
Say it. What’s the matter?

566
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,800
I fancy someone.

567
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,310
Fancy?

568
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,760
You fancy a lot of people.

569
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,950
Zhiyang, Tianqi and me.

570
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,830
You fancy us all.

571
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,950
It’s not that kind of fancy.

572
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,520
It’s the kind
that I don’t know what to do

573
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,640
to make him happy.

574
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,920
Anything else?

575
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,710
Do you have any other feelings?

576
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,190
Just his eyes.

577
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,110
His eyes are as bright as

578
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,920
the twinkling stars.

579
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,160
It seems you are really falling in love!

580
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,280
No, my heart is trembling.

581
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,830
But what is good about falling in love
with someone?

582
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,470
Take this dim sum as an example.

583
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,560
When you first started eating it,

584
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,760
it’s as sweet as honey.

585
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,280
But slowly,

586
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
you will think
it is sourer than hawthorn.

587
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,640
If this dim sum likes
to be eaten by you, it’s fine.

588
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,000
But if it doesn’t like
to be eaten by you,

589
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,040
it’s as bitter as medicine.

590
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,310
What’s the sour and bitter?

591
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,950
What are you talking about?

592
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
If you don’t like this dim sum,
just don’t eat it.

593
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,070
So,

594
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,830
who do you like?

595
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,520
You do not know him.

596
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,040
Not from our God Realm?

597
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,680
No.

598
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,040
Then just go and confess to him.

599
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,400
With your status and beauty,

600
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,400
which God in our God Realm
wants to refuse you?

601
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,760
Let me tell you.
It’s no good to be impatient.

602
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,070
There are too many Goddesses
who rashly confessed love to him.

603
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,000
They all failed one after another.

604
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,710
If you really want to know

605
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,800
if he likes you, I have a way.

606
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,520
What way?

607
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,160
You go kiss him.

608
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,190
Just see how Bai Jue reacts.

609
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,760
Of course.

610
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,680
It’s not the kind of kissing
to redeem your power.

611
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,680
It’s the kind

612
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,760
between men and women.

613
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,760
Forget it.

614
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,640
If I kiss him,

615
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,310
he must have twitched my muscles,

616
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,920
peeled me off

617
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,310
and sent me to purgatory.

618
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,060
You are a coward.

619
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,820
I’m not.

620
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,230
I’m following my heart.

621
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,470
No way.

622
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
I didn’t seem to tell you
that it was Bai Jue, right?

623
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,830
How can you guess it right away?

624
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,520
You only listen to him
in the entire God Realm.

625
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,520
If it’s not him, is it Tianqi?

626
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
I’m not stupid.
I guessed it a long time ago.

627
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,230
Look at you now.

628
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,430
Humble, shy and nervous.

629
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,760
It’s not like
the free and easy you before.

630
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,680
Is it so obvious?

631
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,800
If you really want to please Bai Jue,

632
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,710
don’t lower your posture deliberately.

633
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,040
Don’t cater to him cautiously.

634
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,470
Facts proved that

635
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,800
Bai Jue doesn’t like it at all.

636
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:29,160
Look at Xueying. She waits for him
for tens of thousands of years.

637
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,280
You can learn a lesson
drawn from her mistakes.

638
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
What should I do?

639
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,710
In the storybooks

640
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,190
if a woman wants to pursue a man,

641
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,070
you can’t be straight.
You should attract his attention.

642
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,190
Attract his attention?

643
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,400
How can I attract his attention?

644
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,680
Don’t ask me that.

645
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,040
If I knew,

646
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,950
then neither do I…

647
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,280
Look at you!

648
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,880
Do you also have someone you like?

649
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,350
You know me.

650
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,000
I think this kind of love affair

651
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,000
is very superficial.

652
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,880
Really?

653
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,680
You read storybooks
more often than I do.

654
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,350
Do you still want me to give you
any suggestion?

655
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,830
Yes, I do!

656
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,760
But,

657
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,110
you have to guarantee

658
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,950
that only you and I know this thing.

659
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,830
Otherwise, your little things…

660
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,470
I promise you!

661
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,430
I won’t say it.

662
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,590
Attract?

663
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,680
You can try to do what he likes.

664
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,920
The thing is that Bai Jue

665
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,520
has no entertainment and hobbies.

666
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,310
What can I do to attract his attention?

667
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
I remind you one thing anyway.

668
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,400
He is a heartless man.

669
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,560
He even burned the flowers
that Xueying planted.

670
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,000
Anyway, don’t count on him too much.

671
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,160
I’ve got an idea!

672
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,430
Your Grace.

673
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,920
What are you doing with so many gadgets?

674
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,230
I want to make your Master happy.

675
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,800
He always frowns at normal times.

676
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,710
Your Grace, you have a good heart.

677
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,520
I’m afraid that Master Bai Jue
won’t appreciate it.

678
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,190
Won’t he?

679
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,230
Master.

680
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,920
You came quite early today.

681
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:18,880
What is this?

682
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,190
The spare time is very boring.

683
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,470
I’ll use these gadgets
to relieve the boredom.

684
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,680
It’s a kite.

685
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,470
Does it look good?

686
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,560
Haven’t you flown it before?

687
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,160
No.

688
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,800
Oh my god. Hongri!

689
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,190
Your Master has never flown a kite!

690
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,640
Is it weird?

691
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,280
Kite, rattle-drum and lantern.

692
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,280
Everyone played them
when we were children.

693
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,640
Yes, there were balls and shuttlecock!

694
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
Exactly!

695
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,470
I was not so bored when I was a kid.

696
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,520
I know.

697
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,520
You had been with Taicang Spear
every day when you were a child,

698
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,430
fighting in the South and the North.

699
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,430
If you did want to play,
you didn’t have enough time.

700
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,280
I don’t like these things.

701
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,520
Try it. I’m good at flying kites!

702
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,350
Your Grace, Master won’t appreciate it.

703
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,350
Okay, I will accompany you.

704
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,230
Are you good at flying kites?

705
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,670
There is a lot of knowledge in it.

706
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,470
The kite must fly in the wind

707
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,950
in order to fly high and far.

708
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,190
Come, let me help you.

709
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,670
It’s flying! It’s flying!

710
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,000
It’s flying!

711
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,230
How high is it!

712
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,600
Look!

713
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,710
Phoenix is flying.
It has a great meaning.

714
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,150
Shanggu, if you can choose,

715
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,320
you are willing to be an ordinary God

716
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,040
or a Chief God who shoulders
the lives of the Three Realms?

717
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,320
Why did you ask it suddenly?

718
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,320
You want to test me again?

719
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,190
No.

720
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,190
I just want to hear your sincere answer.

721
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,670
I was born as the Chief God of Chaos.

722
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,390
These lives of the Three Realms

723
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,630
are my responsibilities
for being born into this world.

724
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,950
In that case,

725
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,080
no matter how many responsibilities
I have on my shoulders,

726
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,150
I’m willing to take them.

727
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,520
OK. I will do my best to

728
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,280
help you take over the God Realm
as soon as possible.

729
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,150
Someday,

730
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,910
the place you shine

731
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,360
is the name of Shanggu,
the Chief God of Chaos.

732
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,670
Master, what happened to you?

733
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,430
Did you hurt your waist?

734
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,390
Don’t talk nonsense!
My waist is very good!

735
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,600
The floor in this Bright Hall
is just too hard.

736
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,630
I slept with a sore back.

737
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,430
Oh, yes.

738
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,000
These few days when I was locked up,

739
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,670
what did Zhiyang do to comfort me?

740
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,080
He sent some good wine.

741
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,800
They are all wine of thousands of years.
You’ll definitely appetite them.

742
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,800
Not bad.

743
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,000
By the way, Master.

744
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,600
During your lockdown,

745
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,080
I took time to visit the Demons.

746
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,390
Sen Jian is indeed a creative talent.

747
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,520
I have sent that little tiger demon

748
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,950
to the third heaven to practice.

749
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,190
The Tigers are all brave.

750
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,560
With time, he can be of great use.

751
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,040
You’ve done a good job. Great!

752
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,280
It’s Master who respects him with mercy

753
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
and finds a good general for the Demons.

754
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,630
If talking about respecting talents,

755
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,040
you are the greatest Divine Beast
I have picked.

756
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,560
In the war between Pure Dragons
back then,

757
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,950
if it weren’t for Master’s protection,
a little kid like me…

758
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,670
Stop, stop.

759
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,150
If you have the time to repay me,

760
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,320
come in and drink with me.

761
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,120
Go, go, go.

762
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,910
Master, I’m a light drinker.

763
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,600
I’m afraid I’ll make you disappointed.

764
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,040
I won’t.

765
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,520
Is there any news
of Ice Cube these days?

766
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,470
Rumors of the God Realm said that
after the Dating Event,

767
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,430
Master Bai Jue came out holding a lady.

768
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,910
They all said that
there was something wrong.

769
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,360
A lady?

770
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,000
Who is the lady?

771
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,800
There were many witnesses.

772
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,710
So there were many rumors.

773
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,000
Some people said
it’s the Goddess of Snow.

774
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,870
Some said it’s the Goddess of Rain.

775
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,080
And some said
it’s the Goddess of Flower.

776
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
The rumors were of everything.

777
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,870
Some people even said it’s Her Grace.

778
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,630
What? Shanggu?

779
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,040
All the ladies
who were alone at the time

780
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,320
had become suspects.

781
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,670
Just for this,

782
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,230
there was a gambling game
at the gate of Changyuan Hall.

783
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:01,910
Well.

784
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,470
Have the Goddess of Snow,
Goddess of Rain and Goddess of Flower

785
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
admitted?

786
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,760
They all admitted

787
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,760
and said they were

788
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,320
the lady who was held by Master Bai Jue.

789
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,870
Isn’t this becoming a mysterious case?

790
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,470
Where did Ice Cube and that lady

791
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,000
come out from?

792
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,080
Were they from the Love Cave?

793
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,280
I don’t know this.

794
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,560
You have to ask Puhua about this.
He knows the best.

795
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,230
Master, Puhua went
to the Immortal Realm.

796
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,000
He’s not in the God Realm.

797
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
Why he’s not here

798
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,760
at this moment!

799
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,190
He’s obviously avoiding me!

800
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,150
Master, don’t worry about it.

801
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,230
These are some rumors.

802
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,600
People won’t talk about it
after a few days.

803
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,630
Bring me Zhiyang’s wine.

804
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,120
Yes.

805
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,500
(Endure the Hardship)

806
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,600
Her Grace asked me to

807
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,430
put these things here first.

808
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,870
If she wants to play in her spare time,

809
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,800
it’s convenient for her to fetch.

810
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,600
Master, you haven’t written
the instruction feather for many years.

811
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,560
Who are you going to write to?

812
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,320
Elder Feng Yun from the Feng Clan.

813
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,080
Shanggu’s God vessels are opened now.

814
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,910
It’s time for her to go to the Feng Clan
to choose a Divine Beast.

815
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,630
Why you choose Feng Yan?

816
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,950
That smelly bird is very fancy
and most useless.

817
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,230
Before the Ancestral God shattered the void,
he gave the imperial order.

818
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,820
The Divine Beast must come
from the Feng Clan.

819
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,470
Moreover, most of the Divine Beasts
of heaven and earth are single.

820
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,910
Only the Feng Clan is strong.

821
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,520
If Queen of Phoenix can become
Shanggu’s Divine Beast,

822
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,910
the Feng Clan must be the most loyal

823
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,360
and the most powerful boost to Shanggu.

824
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,800
Master is thoughtful.

825
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,670
But I just heard that

826
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,670
Feng Yan is almost in her nirvana.

827
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,710
After her reborn,

828
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,840
I don’t know whether her temperament
will change drastically.

829
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,840
It’s better to find one like me.

830
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,000
I’m honest and loyal.
I can also chat with Her Grace.

831
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,080
I think it would be nice for me
to find a dumb,

832
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,040
so I don’t have to hear you
talking every day.

833
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,910
It’s annoying.

834
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,390
It’s been 100,000 years…

835
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,230
This is the first time
you joked with me!

836
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,560
Her Grace is so great!

837
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,910
What has it got to do with her?

838
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,760
Yes. Yes.
It has nothing to do with Her Grace.

839
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,800
I’m gonna send preserves to Her Grace.

840
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,800
Open your feet and straighten your arms.

841
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,190
To the right and to the down. Exhale.

842
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:45,600
Move back.

843
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,190
Arms up. Put your right foot in front.
Exhale.

844
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,670
Move back.

845
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,320
Lift your right foot
and open your hands.

846
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,230
Inhale and stretch.

847
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,120
Relax your body and empty your spirit.

848
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
Up and forward.

849
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,430
Try to integrate your body and mind.

850
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,560
Stop.

851
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,630
Your grace, you are a beginner.
Don’t rush it.

852
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,190
Use the strength of your legs.
Don’t focus too much on your posture.

853
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,670
It’s mainly about your mind.

854
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,230
Okay.

855
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,230
