00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 40=

3
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,650
I’m in debt to Master Shanggu.

4
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,730
I’ll willing to help you

5
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,450
with this plan.

6
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,690
Over the hundreds of thousands of years,

7
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
I’ve already seen Houchi

8
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,970
as my own daughter.

9
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,120
It pains me

10
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,920
to see her heartbroken.

11
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,410
Then why didn’t you do anything

12
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,960
when she confined herself to
the Hidden Mountain for so long?

13
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,170
You could’ve stopped it

14
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,490
but you sit back and watch

15
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,850
the newly-wed separated

16
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,000
for decades.

17
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,600
I accept whatever my fate is

18
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,810
but it’s not even 100 years.

19
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,560
Houchi hasn’t come back.

20
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,170
I can’t give up now.

21
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,770
No one knows

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,570
how much Qingmu
has suffered better than me.

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,080
I can’t imagine how Houchi feels.

24
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,680
Give Qingmu back!

25
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,680
He’s dead.

26
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,130
His spiritual sense
must still be intact.

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,240
I need that back.

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,490
Forget it.

29
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,570
The past is the past.

30
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
I understand.

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,320
I’ll also

32
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,850
keep everything secret.

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,650
But

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,650
Houchi is helplessly
in love with Qingmu.

35
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,880
You can’t talk her

36
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,240
into giving him up.

37
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,240
Do you have other ideas?

38
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,680
Not yet.

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,930
What about that demon

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,520
you fought against
in the Parasol Forest that day?

41
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:08,850
Do you know who that is?

42
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,720
It was Wu Huan.

43
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,520
I let her out of
the Nether World on purpose.

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,960
Strangely,

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,770
I couldn’t detect any trace
of Devilish Energy on her.

46
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,410
Why did Wu Huan do that?

47
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
She’s the Heavenly Empress.

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,770
We need solid proof

49
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,210
to call her a demon.

50
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
I don’t care

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,650
who she is.

52
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,570
It’s just that after my awakening,

53
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,010
I went to the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

54
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,080
My power was weakened

55
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,130
to stall the Tribulation of Chaos.

56
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,130
We don’t know what the demons are up to,

57
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,770
so we must be careful.

58
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,800
Check everything secretly.

59
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,720
This time,

60
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,210
no accident

61
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,440
is allowed.

62
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,570
Yes.

63
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,600
Go back and comfort Houchi.

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,370
I hurt her feelings

65
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,240
when she came to see me.

66
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,240
She must be upset.

67
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,240
The future can’t be changed.

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,720
I have no choice

69
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,440
but to be indifferent.

70
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,050
From now on,

71
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,770
Houchi and I had better

72
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,840
not see each other again.

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,930
If you really care about her,

74
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,440
then pay more attention to her.

75
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,970
Better a little loss than a long sorrow.

76
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,650
Yes, Master.

77
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,530
Master.

78
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,490
I saw God Light flash across the Dome.

79
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,120
Was that God Gu Jun?

80
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,050
He came for his daughter Houchi.

81
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,370
Master, you should know

82
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,690
Qingmu and I also had an engagement.

83
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,280
Without Houchi,

84
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,280
we would’ve gotten married long ago.

85
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,810
You two had an engagement?

86
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:13,770
Yes.

87
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,000
Father betrothed me to him.

88
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,320
I let you stay at the Dome

89
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
only because you saved me.

90
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,050
You’d better not

91
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,880
transfer your affections

92
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:26,810
from Qingmu to me, too.

93
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,250
I didn’t mean that, Master.

94
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,210
You’re a god.

95
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,250
My feelings are insignificant.

96
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,440
But if you wish

97
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,210
to cut all ties with the Qingchi Palace,

98
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,160
once we get married,

99
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,770
Houchi will give up.

100
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,880
I have no feelings for you at all.

101
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,600
Aren’t you worried
about your reputation?

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,090
I wouldn’t even dream of your love.

103
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,970
Marrying you

104
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,440
is all I can hope for.

105
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,210
Are you sure?

106
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,320
Heaven and earth can be my witnesses.

107
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,370
Fine. You’ll get what you wish for.

108
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,930
Thank you, Master.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,650
Qingmu.

110
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Do you regret

111
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,250
doing all this for me?

112
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,400
As long as you’re with me,

113
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,530
I have no regrets at all.

114
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,320
Let’s be an ordinary couple,

115
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,530
living long

116
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,400
and growing old together.

117
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,050
Qingmu.

118
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,530
Shanggu, come back!

119
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,970
Please!

120
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,840
I’m entrusting the Three Realms

121
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,050
with you.

122
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,370
In the next life,

123
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:03,770
I don’t want to be a god,

124
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,560
but to be with you.

125
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,090
The Three Realms live and die with you.

126
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,320
You cannot die!

127
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,970
Turns out Master Bai Jue

128
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,490
cares so much about Master Shanggu.

129
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,370
Who are you?

130
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,160
Chief Goddess Shanggu,

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,120
finally, you can see me.

132
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,530
I’ve been alone in this void
for thousands of years.

133
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,120
You’re my first visitor.

134
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,880
You must be lonely.

135
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,970
Why do we look identical?

136
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,280
I wish we didn’t.

137
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,090
Unfortunately,

138
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,370
I was born

139
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,490
to be a container
of your Spiritual Strength.

140
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,560
I didn’t have a choice.

141
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,650
A container?

142
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,440
What does that mean?

143
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,650
Since the Tribulation of Chaos,

144
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,050
I’ve been wandering
in the void, you know?

145
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,000
I feel sorry for you, too.

146
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,770
You don’t know who you are

147
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,370
or why you exist.

148
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,050
I’m fine.

149
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,770
Now, you’re here with me, aren’t you?

150
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
Could you

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
tell me more?

152
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,370
What do you want to know?

153
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,130
Did you

154
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,200
see Bai Jue outside?

155
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,010
Him?

156
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,810
He’s fine,

157
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,600
but Qingmu is gone.

158
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,280
Qingmu?

159
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,200
I’m your surrogate

160
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,890
and Qingmu is Bai Jue’s.

161
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,890
When you woke up,

162
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,520
we’d disappear.

163
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,760
No one would remember us.

164
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,370
I don’t get that.

165
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,450
Bai Jue’s mission
is to guard the Three Realms.

166
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,330
Why would he hurt anyone

167
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,450
for himself?

168
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,160
He just did.

169
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,640
I begged him

170
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,600
to give Qingmu back to me,

171
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,130
but he only saw Qingmu as dust

172
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,600
that he could crush or blow away easily.

173
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,890
Has he ever considered

174
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,250
my feelings?

175
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,250
Fate is always fair to everyone.

176
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,690
When it comes,

177
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,720
we can only accept it.

178
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,370
All we can do

179
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,250
is to ask ourselves

180
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,370
what choices we should make

181
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,760
and what our duty is.

182
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,130
Liar!

183
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,930
If our fate is to be Gods,

184
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,570
what about yours?

185
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,450
You sacrificed yourself

186
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,520
in face of the Tribulation of Chaos.

187
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,760
Was that for the greater good?

188
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,130
Of course.

189
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,050
I’m the Chief God.

190
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,050
Hadn’t I done that,

191
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,400
millions of innocent lives

192
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,520
would be gone

193
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,960
for nothing.

194
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,890
Then before you died,

195
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,490
why did you wish not to be a god again?

196
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Chief God or not,

197
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,890
I’m just like an ordinary person.

198
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,050
I simply wish

199
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,760
I could be with

200
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,250
the love of my life.

201
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,960
I lost Qingmu.

202
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
Could I wish for our reunion
in the next life?

203
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,280
Qingmu!

204
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,010
Qingmu!

205
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,960
If it were you,

206
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,400
would you forgive them?

207
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,280
Qingmu,

208
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:35,840
do you know

209
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,720
why I always win you by half a point?

210
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,280
Now,

211
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,760
let me show you my move.

212
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,250
You were an attacker

213
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,720
and you always placed
the pieces like this.

214
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,330
While I’m a defender,

215
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:55,840
so I could block you.

216
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,720
You know

217
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,760
you were fearless.

218
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
You’d rush in and make a mess.

219
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,370
I was cautious

220
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,010
and thorough.

221
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,840
So we always

222
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,520
ended up in a stalemate.

223
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
But check out

224
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,960
this move.

225
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,570
I deliberately made a mistake

226
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,080
to lure you in.

227
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,370
You were eager to win

228
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,690
and make a clean sweep.

229
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,330
But I

230
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,520
blocked your way out

231
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,690
and get rid of your help.

232
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,890
That way,

233
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,080
I’d win you by exactly half a point.

234
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,050
I see.

235
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,640
That’s right.

236
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,640
No more no less.

237
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,220
(Qingmu’s Tomb)

238
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,780
(Qingmu’s Tomb)

239
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,690
Your Grace,

240
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,370
which one do you think

241
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,640
is better?

242
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,720
If Houchi gives birth to a baby girl,

243
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,450
she can wear the pink one.

244
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,330
I like the red one.

245
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,450
It’s adorable.

246
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,280
Keep them both then.

247
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,720
Sure.

248
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,280
Houchi grew up

249
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,200
with these toys.

250
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,570
Put them in, too.

251
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,960
You mean these?

252
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,450
Boys would love them.

253
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,330
Girls may not.

254
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,050
Her Grace

255
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,840
was such a tomboy when she was little.

256
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,720
Put these ducks
and carriages in the case, too.

257
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,200
Girls may also like them.

258
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:23,960
I agree.

259
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,200
Your Grace,

260
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,810
you’ve been picking toys for four hours.

261
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,570
The case is almost filled up.

262
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:29,890
You can buy more toys

263
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,450
when the baby is born.

264
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:32,600
You’re right.

265
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,810
There’s still plenty of time.

266
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,810
Bring these back

267
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,250
to the study.

268
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:40,450
Yes.

269
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,250
What’s the occasion?

270
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,720
Your Highness,
you probably haven’t heard

271
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,130
that Princess Jingzhao
will soon be married into the Dome.

272
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,370
Really?

273
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,640
His Majesty betrothed her

274
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,200
to True God Bai Jue and he said yes.

275
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:09,570
Everyone in the Palace

276
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,760
is busy preparing for the wedding.

277
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,400
Enough!

278
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,640
You volunteer to guard the Demon Region?

279
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,250
Yes.

280
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,010
I’ve told you

281
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,600
Master Bai Jue had imprisoned Fengran

282
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,840
simply to

283
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,080
find the demon behind.

284
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,600
So

285
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,250
I wouldn’t blame you for letting her go.

286
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,370
Why are you punishing yourself?

287
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:40,450
Father,

288
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,960
news came in last night

289
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,450
about Sen Yu’s suspicious moves lately.

290
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,570
I’m getting worried,

291
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,960
so I’m going to the Demon Region soon

292
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,130
for the safety of the border.

293
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,640
How dare those demons
stir up trouble again!

294
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,720
But with Master here,

295
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,690
those demons won’t be a problem.

296
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,890
You can leave

297
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,930
after your sister and Master’s wedding.

298
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,080
Yes.

299
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,160
Father,

300
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,130
have you found anything about

301
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,810
the Devilish Energy
that killed the Feng Clan?

302
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:09,960
Nothing so far.

303
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,250
The only eyewitness Elder Danfeng

304
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,450
is missing.

305
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,960
Isn’t that my feather?

306
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,010
Where did you get it?

307
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,720
Jingjian?

308
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,130
Jingjian?

309
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:33,960
Father.

310
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,600
Are you alright?

311
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,280
You seem worried

312
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,960
and pale.

313
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,330
I might be sleep-deprived lately.

314
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,520
Father, if there’s nothing else,

315
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,400
I’d like to go back and rest.

316
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,120
Jingjian.

317
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,480
What’s wrong?

318
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,880
Nothing.

319
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,810
I still have work to do.

320
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,210
Please excuse me.

321
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,240
Hold on.

322
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,090
Do I look like a monster?

323
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,210
I know there are
unresolved issues between us

324
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,090
in terms of the Twin Spear.

325
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,120
But that was a long time ago.

326
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,480
Now that we’re finally together,

327
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,000
why not bury the hatchet

328
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,050
and move on?

329
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,690
Mother,

330
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,970
just drop that caring look.

331
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,050
It only

332
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,760
freaks me out.

333
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,520
What are you talking about?

334
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,810
I’ll leave for the Demon Region

335
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,570
after Jingzhao’s wedding.

336
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,160
And

337
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,850
I won’t come back again.

338
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,330
Please don’t

339
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
betray Father’s trust again

340
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,970
for my sake.

341
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,050
Jingjian!

342
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,450
Jingjian!

343
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:36,610
Your Highness,

344
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,090
Prince Jingjian has been like that

345
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,400
ever since he came back
from the Parasol Forest.

346
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,090
Did he

347
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,450
stumble on the secret there?

348
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,210
Go check it out.

349
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,690
I want to know

350
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,610
everything he did there.

351
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,160
Yes.

352
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,360
Master,

353
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,970
I failed in my duty.

354
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,970
Fengran has been back at
the Qingchi Palace for days,

355
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,570
but there’s nothing new
regarding the Parasol Forest case.

356
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,520
Do you...?

357
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,520
Demons are the key to that case.

358
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,640
As long as the God Realm reopens,

359
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,850
demons won’t be our match
even with a new Devil God.

360
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,970
We’ve had three out of Four Weapons:

361
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,850
Taicang Spear,
Purple Moon Whip, Twin Spear.

362
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,280
But there’s no trace of
the Ancestral Sword.

363
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,420
All of you, be careful!

364
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,140
You’re holding the fine wine

365
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,300
all races made for
Master and my wedding.

366
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,020
If it’s spilled,

367
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,540
I won’t be easy on you!

368
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,140
Focus!

369
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,140
No mistake is allowed.

370
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

371
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,780
I’m getting married.

372
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,540
Why are you sulking?

373
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,180
That’s the spirit.

374
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,660
I didn’t teach her well.

375
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,300
Please forgive me.

376
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,020
Is it true?

377
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,140
Absolutely!

378
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,540
That river deer next door told me.

379
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,540
I didn’t believe him

380
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,900
and went uphill to ask around.

381
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,980
All Three Realms have known it.

382
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,380
They all say Master Bai Jue

383
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,020
and Princess Jingzhao
are getting married.

384
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,380
How could Qingmu do that?

385
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,060
Even if he didn’t remember
young Goddess,

386
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,500
how could he marry Jingzhao?

387
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,020
I’m going to give God Gu Jun a heads-up.

388
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,540
Go tell everyone in the Palace

389
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,300
not to say a word to young Goddess.

390
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,300
Got it?

391
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,420
Have you seen Houchi?

392
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,540
No.

393
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,980
I’ve been looking for you everywhere.

394
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,180
There you are.

395
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,660
What do you need me for?

396
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,180
Jingjian sent us a letter,

397
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,060
saying Qingmu’s tomb
at the North Sea is done.

398
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,540
I guess you’d like to take a look.

399
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,980
Fengran,

400
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,860
Ghost Suppressing Tower
is no longer in the Huajing Pond.

401
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,380
What about Boxuan?

402
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,380
Qingmu began to look for his memory

403
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,420
because of him.

404
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,180
That Tower protecting Boxuan is gone.

405
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,140
Maybe Qingmu
has something to do with it.

406
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,380
No way.

407
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,660
Only Master, you and I
have access to this place.

408
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,900
No one else can come in.

409
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,380
I’m going to the North Sea.

410
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,060
I’ll join you.

411
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,780
I can go there myself.

412
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,660
Houchi!

413
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,380
Your Highness, Fengran went
to the Parasol Forest

414
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,140
to meet with Elder Danfeng.

415
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,380
Why that little bastard?

416
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,420
I heard her mumbling something

417
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,180
about “Queen of Phoenix’s daughter”

418
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
and “Abyssal Ridge Swamp”.

419
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,180
It was you!

420
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,540
You killed Queen of Phoenix!

421
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,300
No, I didn’t do it!

422
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,780
I didn’t kill her!

423
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,900
Queen of Phoenix’s fake spirit
didn’t fool me.

424
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,380
When I finally tracked down

425
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,900
Wuxi and Feng Yan,

426
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,540
Feng Yan was already pregnant.

427
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,900
I asked you to kill them,

428
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,620
but unexpectedly,

429
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,980
you let their daughter go

430
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,140
behind my back!

431
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,140
You killed the Feng Clan!

432
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,420
It was you!

433
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,180
You should’ve been dead long ago.

434
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,620
Wu Huan,

435
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,420
once Queen of Phoenix returns,

436
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,140
you’ll end up in hell!

437
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,660
Speak!

438
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,300
Is Fengran

439
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,180
her daughter?

440
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,740
Wu Huan, you’ll meet your doom!

441
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,380
We still have plenty of

442
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,140
unborn phoenixes.

443
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,060
Once our clan is rebuilt,

444
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,180
you’ll be the only Chief Elder.

445
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

446
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,260
Fengran,

447
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,620
if you really are her daughter,

448
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,180
then you leave me no choice.

449
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,380
Your Grace,

450
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,780
Bai Jue and Jingzhao
are getting married!

451
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,140
Those two are getting married?

452
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,500
Your Grace,

453
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,660
how could he do this to Houchi?

454
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,860
Fengran!

455
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,540
Don’t worry too much.

456
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,300
Houchi has left for the North Sea.

457
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,260
That place is almost empty.

458
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,900
She won’t hear anything.

459
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,260
Listen,

460
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,900
Master Bai Jue is no longer Qingmu.

461
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,300
Whatever happens in the Heavenly Palace
has nothing to do with us.

462
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,900
Don’t stick your nose

463
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,620
into the Dome’s business.

464
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

465
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,140
Master Bai Jue,

466
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,140
is this how you

467
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,300
force Houchi to give up?

468
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,140
It’s rather cruel

469
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,180
to her.

470
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,420
Don’t you find it strange

471
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,620
that His Grace didn’t do anything

472
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,380
when the Heavenly Palace

473
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,420
insulted Houchi like this?

474
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,540
Knowing how sad young Goddess is,

475
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,860
God Gu Jun must be sadder.

476
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,300
I guess he chose to do nothing

477
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,480
in order to

478
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,860
protect his daughter.

479
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,020
Instruction feather from the Dome.

480
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,920
Is Master Bai Jue

481
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,540
inviting us to his wedding?

482
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,760
I’ll go tell His Grace.

483
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,520
Hold on.

484
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,500
It’s not for him.

485
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,140
It’s for me.

486
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,020
You?

487
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,020
He asked to see me in the Dome

488
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,860
to tell me about my background.

489
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,540
How could he know that?

490
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
He and Jingzhao’s wedding is a day away.

491
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,380
He’s calling you now...

492
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,180
Perfect timing.

493
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,980
He betrayed Houchi.

494
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,020
His Grace might be able to suck that up,

495
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,780
but I can’t!

496
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,660
My lady,

497
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,980
His Grace just ordered us

498
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,300
to behave ourselves.

499
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,980
I know what I’m doing. Don’t tell him.

500
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,020
Heavenly Empress?

501
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,380
You used Bai Jue’s feather

502
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,900
to lure me here.

503
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,060
That’s right.

504
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,420
I faked that instruction feather.

505
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,860
You impersonated a god.

506
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,500
Aren’t you afraid Bai Jue
will punish you?

507
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,540
Punish me?

508
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Once you’re dead,

509
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,780
who’d know you were here

510
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,420
or punish me

511
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,900
for a missing person?

512
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,660
I’m a member of the Qingchi Palace.

513
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,260
You think God Gu Jun
wouldn’t do anything?

514
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,060
What could he do?

515
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,060
A Fire Phoenix indeed!

516
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,020
When Chief God was around

517
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,140
and asked me to pick
the Divine Beast in the Feng Clan,

518
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,180
you weren’t my best choice

519
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,420
for your humble birth.

520
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,140
But one thing led to another,

521
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,180
Chief God was in favor of you

522
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,260
and you entered The Pilgrimage Hall
of the God Realm.

523
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,900
Also, your distinguished service

524
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,260
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp Battle

525
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,780
can’t be neglected.

526
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,460
Our whole clan is proud of you.

527
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,940
Now, I’m appointing you

528
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,380
Leader of the Feng Clan.

529
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,100
Wu Huan,

530
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,740
are you up for it?

531
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,820
Leader of the Feng Clan?

532
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,700
I...

533
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,100
I’m only a fifth-level phoenix.

534
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,580
Am I really qualified?

535
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,740
Queen’s nirvana

536
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,820
is delayed for some reason.

537
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,740
Well,

538
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,700
everything happens

539
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,100
for a reason.

540
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,980
But remember,

541
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,460
no matter what happens in the future,

542
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,060
you must wait until
the new Queen is born

543
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,140
and give your position back to her.

544
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,340
Understand?

545
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,260
I...

546
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,340
Keep this in mind

547
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,100
that the Queen of Phoenix is reborn

548
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,980
at the Fire Phoenix’s nirvana.

549
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,980
Only the Fire Phoenix

550
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,340
is our hope.

551
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,260
You should’ve been dead
when you were born.

552
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,260
All these years are borrowed.

553
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,100
But you were still unsatisfied

554
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,460
and insisted on going to
the Parasol Forest

555
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,860
to find out who you are
and steal my position.

556
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,500
Fengran,

557
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,620
you only end up like this

558
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,940
because you want more
than you should have.

559
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,100
It’s greed

560
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
that buries you eventually.

561
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,460
You were there when I was born?

562
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,620
I’m really a phoenix!

563
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,140
Who are my parents?

564
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,220
Why did they abandon me?

565
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,980
You don’t know?

566
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,460
Fine.

567
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,100
I’ll tell you everything before you die.

568
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,260
Your mother is Feng Yan,

569
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,460
a phoenix after nirvana

570
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,700
and the only Fire Phoenix.

571
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,460
But she disregarded our mission

572
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,740
to be a Divine Beast

573
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,740
and eloped with Wuxi,
the founder of the Parasol Forest.

574
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,380
You’re their daughter,

575
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
so you’re also a Fire Phoenix

576
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,860
and entitled to be the Queen.

577
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,100
If I could be the next Queen,

578
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,140
why did they dump me at
the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

579
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,860
when I was born?

580
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,940
I did that.

581
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,220
How could I allow another phoenix

582
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,940
to threaten my position?

583
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,460
So I had them stalked

584
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,980
and killed by Danfeng.

585
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,740
But little did I know

586
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,220
that she left you there

587
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,740
and spared your life.

588
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,700
You killed my parents!

589
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,100
I’ll destroy you!

590
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,220
Your spiritual power will be sucked dry

591
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,140
and made into a core

592
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,820
by this Blending Formation in 24 hours.

593
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,140
By taking it,

594
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,260
I’ll become the true Queen of Phoenix.

595
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,260
Fengran,

596
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,140
you’ll never be able to

597
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,740
get your revenge!

598
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,620
Today is a big day

599
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
for both me and my daughter.

600
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,620
Fengran is in danger!

601
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,380
(Double Happiness)

602
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,580
So what if he married you once?

603
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,860
He’s marrying me now.

604
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,620
Jingzhao.

605
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,620
Greetings, Mother.

606
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,340
You may leave.

607
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,980
- Yes.
- Yes.

608
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,620
Is there anything you’d like to tell me?

609
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,140
When today is over,

610
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,220
you’ll become the noblest figure
in all Three Realms.

611
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,980
Have you ever considered

612
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,220
what you will do

613
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,980
if those of the Qingchi Palace

614
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,460
come to sabotage your wedding?

615
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,220
I won, and she lost.

616
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,500
What else could she do?

617
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,140
Like she could turn
the world upside down!

618
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,940
It’s not that simple.

619
00:33:59,260 --> 00:33:59,980
Never mind.

620
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,940
From now on,

621
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,500
you can relax
and be the prettiest bride.

622
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,060
I’ve asked Jingyang

623
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,980
to send a strong force to the Dome.

624
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,260
If Houchi breaks in to make trouble,

625
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,260
she won’t be able to get out.

626
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,140

even to this day,

629
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,620
I can’t accept the fact

630
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,900
that you’re gone.

631
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,060
This is an empty tomb.

632
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,580
What’s the proof of death?

633
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,660
