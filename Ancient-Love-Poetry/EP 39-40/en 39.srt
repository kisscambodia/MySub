=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 39=

3
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,200
Have you long known that

4
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,550
Bai Jue is back?

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,160
He’s...?

6
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,040
Yes.

7
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,350
Houchi,

8
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,840
Qingmu is Bai Jue.

9
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
I had thought

10
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,310
you could enjoy a happy reunion

11
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,120
for at least a while.

12
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,120
I never expected...

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,440
The day has finally come.

14
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,200
Houchi,

15
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,720
now that Bai Jue woke up,

16
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,760
Qingmu no longer exists.

17
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,000
To Bai Jue,

18
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
the relationship between you and Qingmu

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
means nothing.

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,000
No way!

21
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,920
He’s Bai Jue and he’s Qingmu, too.

22
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,400
He won’t ever forget me.

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
Houchi.

24
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,040
He has forgotten you.

25
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,790
Fengran,

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,230
tell me.

27
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,510
What on earth happened?

28
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,670
Why did Jinglei say
you slaughtered the Feng Clan?

29
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,360
I was drawn to the Parasol Forest

30
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,120
when the Feng Clan
had already been exterminated.

31
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,870
Later, Jingjian and I

32
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,510
were trapped by some weird power.

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,430
Only Qingmu

34
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,120
fought the woman who pretended to be me.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
When we woke up,

36
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,230
he had become Bai Jue.

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,000
He didn’t remember anything.

38
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,760
He forgot everything.

39
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,950
He didn’t remember anything
about Qingmu, either.

40
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,760
Where’s Bai Jue?

41
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,870
He rebuilt Changyuan Hall,

42
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,400
and now in the Dome,

43
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,790
he is commanding the Three Realms
as the True God.

44
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,790
Houchi!

45
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,870
Where are you going?

46
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,790
I’m going to see him.

47
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,560
He doesn’t remember you anymore.

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,950
If you leave now,

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
what’s the point
of a hundred years’ captivity?

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,670
If I don’t see him myself

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,230
and he doesn’t tell me he forgot me,

52
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,560
I won’t believe that

53
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,710
he no longer remembers me.

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,360
It was him

55
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,400
who set up this barrier.

56
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,510
Ordinary immortals

57
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,480
can only get in but can’t get out.

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,350
Even if

59
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,710
you don’t care about your life,

60
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,640
what about the baby?

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,120
You want to die with him?

62
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,640
My life?

63
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,150
Qingmu’s life is mine.

64
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,640
He abandoned everything for me.

65
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,040
He’s waiting for me,

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,430
but I’ll only care about my life,

67
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,280
instead of saving him?

68
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,230
Houchi, wake up.

69
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,400
He’s now Bai Jue.

70
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,560
No one is waiting for you anymore.

71
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,280
You said that

72
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,200
if Shanggu woke up,

73
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,760
I might be gone.

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,390
Is it the same thing

75
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,870
between Qingmu and Bai Jue?

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,390
Do you think

77
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,640
Bai Jue will allow Qingmu to exist?

78
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,040
Then I’ll get back
the Ghost Suppressing Tower!

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,430
I must find Qingmu!

80
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,480
Houchi!

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,590
Qingmu’s spiritual sense was crushed
by the power of True God.

82
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,150
Let alone the Ghost Suppressing Tower,

83
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,390
even the Ancestral God couldn’t help.

84
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,480
He and I had a wedding

85
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,080
and we promised to grow old together.

86
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,080
He has never changed his promise

87
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,550
or broken it.

88
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,310
Neither will I.

89
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,870
No matter who he is now,

90
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,920
he’s always my husband

91
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,640
and the father of my baby.

92
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,870
Jingyuan,

93
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,200
please let me get out.

94
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,150
If you get out now,

95
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,520
you’ll only hurt yourself.

96
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,270
Jingyuan,

97
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,590
Qingmu has no father or mother.

98
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,390
He even has only a couple of friends.

99
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,920
Maybe from this day on,

100
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,710
no one will remember

101
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,710
his existence in this world.

102
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,590
His feelings

103
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,760
and his life

104
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,920
can’t be decided by someone else.

105
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,520
Now, I’m the only one
who can struggle for him.

106
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,550
When there’s even slim hope
to keep him alive,

107
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,590
I won’t give up.

108
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,110
Unless I see True God Bai Jue in person,

109
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,550
I won’t believe that

110
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,200
he can be so cruel

111
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,270
and fate can be so heartless to us.

112
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,760
Jingyuan,

113
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,920
I beg you. Let me out.

114
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,480
All right.

115
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,870
I can let you out.

116
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,110
But you must promise me something.

117
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,480
What?

118
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,150
Accept the truth

119
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,480
and bid farewell to Qingmu.

120
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,590
I don’t have a choice.

121
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,830
After I kill Tianqi and Bai Jue,

122
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,040
I’ll return to an immortal again.

123
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
I hear that

124
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,830
True God Bai Jue has forgotten
all the past.

125
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,480
He doesn’t remember who Qingmu is.

126
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,710
He doesn’t remember

127
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,870
or he pretends he doesn’t?

128
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,680
He split his Original Being

129
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,150
and was in sleep
for sixty thousand years.

130
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,550
When he woke up,
he had a great fight with you.

131
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,830
His Spiritual Strength
must have been injured.

132
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,360
Whether it’s true,

133
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,990
I’ll try and see.

134
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,830
Your Highness,

135
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,590
Prince Jingyang has been waiting outside
for a long time.

136
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,550
Thank you so much

137
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,800
for helping me when I’m in trouble.

138
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,550
I’m flattered, Your Highness.

139
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,590
It was my duty to help you.

140
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,640
From this day on,

141
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,430
we must be very careful
in doing anything.

142
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,520
Keep it to yourself

143
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,870
that I’ve become a devil.

144
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,270
I understand, Your Highness.

145
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,920
Greetings, Mother.

146
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,800
You may rise.

147
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,830
Mother, I come to get you back.

148
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,390
You indeed care for me most.

149
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,830
Jingyang,

150
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,870
it’s not a hundred years yet.

151
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,830
Why did your father
suddenly want me back?

152
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,710
Mother, something happened
to the Feng Clan.

153
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,310
Father invited you to go back

154
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,870
and handle the Parasol Forest problem.

155
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,800
What happened to the Parasol Forest?

156
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,990
I don’t dare to talk about it.

157
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,480
Mother, please go back

158
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,320
and discuss with Father.

159
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,480
Mother,

160
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
True God Bai Jue woke up, too.

161
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,750
He did?

162
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,000
It’s great luck for immortals.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,630
Yes.

164
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,680
But Bai Jue is Qingmu...

165
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,360
It doesn’t matter who he was.

166
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,270
Now that Bai Jue woke up,

167
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,680
I should go visit him.

168
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,320
It’s been sixty thousand years.

169
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,710
I wonder if he’s still

170
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,750
the True God he used to be.

171
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,880
Now that you want to visit him,

172
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,630
I’ll tell Jingzhao first.

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,120
Why?

174
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,750
Since True God Bai Jue woke up,

175
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,590
he’s been staying in the Dome

176
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,560
and Jingzhao has been looking after him.

177
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,710
At present,

178
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,920
she’s obviously been

179
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,510
in charge of the Dome.

180
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,140
(Changyuan Hall)

181
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,710
Greetings, Mother.

182
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,320
You may rise.

183
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,950
Let me take a good look at you.

184
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Mother, I haven’t seen you for years.

185
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,590
How are you keeping these years?

186
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,440
Everything is fine with me.

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,950
I have something private
to tell my mother.

188
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,270
You don’t need to serve us.

189
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,630
Leave us.

190
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,750
Mother,

192
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,830
let me show you around the garden.

193
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,480
All right.

194
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,040
I knew you would come today,

195
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,560
and I asked Master Bai Jue

196
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,510
to order the Flower Fairy
to get all flowers in full bloom

197
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,270
so that you can enjoy them.

198
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,800
Jingzhao,

199
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,510
does Bai Jue really not remember Qingmu?

200
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,440
He doesn’t, I suppose.

201
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,830
Otherwise,

202
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,270
he wouldn’t be so nice to me.

203
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,360
He’s very nice to you?

204
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,040
No one is close to him,

205
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,150
but me.

206
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,440
I also take care of everything

207
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,800
in Changyuan Hall.

208
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,510
But Bai Jue never likes any girl.

209
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,360
Why is he so different to you?

210
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,830
Can he be fooling you?

211
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,240
Mind your words, Mother.

212
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440
Are you sure

213
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,590
what you exactly want?

214
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,880
Mother,

215
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,000
all I want

216
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,710
is to stay with Master every day.

217
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,560
That’s enough for me.

218
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,070
It’s not enough.

219
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,480
You must get the status you deserve.

220
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,440
There’s no rush about it.

221
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
You must make Bai Jue like you

222
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,800
and marry you with a wedding.

223
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,320
Only when you

224
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,590
become the real hostess of the Dome

225
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,920
can you get the most benefits.

226
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,630
Don’t worry, Mother.

227
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,390
When I’m here in the Dome,

228
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,920
I understand it.

229
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,000
No one can be the most honorable,
but the True God.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,950
Good girl.

231
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,920
You look

232
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,240
as dignified as me

233
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,710
when I first took charge
of the Pilgrimage Hall.

234
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,510
Master Bai Jue really cares
for Princess Jingzhao.

235
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,240
When she simply said
she wanted to enjoy the flowers,

236
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,070
he summoned the Flower Fairy

237
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,120
and she conjured the flowers overnight.

238
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,040
Yeah.

239
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
Master Bai Jue is cold,

240
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,880
but he dotes on Princess Jingzhao.

241
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,830
He also only lets her serve him.

242
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,920
Looks like there’ll be a wedding

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,950
in the Dome.

244
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,040
Ladies,

245
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,040
why did I hear that

246
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Master had married Goddess Houchi

247
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,440
in the Human Realm a hundred years ago?

248
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,800
Could he marry someone else?

249
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,710
Don’t talk nonsense.

250
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,150
It was North Sea Lord

251
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,510
who had an engagement with Houchi.

252
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,880
What does it concern Master Bai Jue?

253
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,150
Besides,

254
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,240
Houchi is no longer a goddess.

255
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,360
How can she be compared
with Princess Jingzhao?

256
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,240
But isn’t North Sea Lord

257
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
Master Bai Jue?

258
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,440
His Majesty issued an order.

259
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,590
Qingmu

260
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,800
is a mere body of Master Bai Jue’s.

261
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
Don’t talk nonsense.

262
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,590
Or I’ll tell Her Grace about it.

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,070
You’ll no longer be an immortal

264
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,800
and will be exiled to the Human Realm.

265
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,560
I won’t.

266
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,070
Lingzhi,

267
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,000
I don’t dare to talk about this again.

268
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,190
Who’s there?

269
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,880
How dare you break into the Dome!

270
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
This place is a wild swamp,

271
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,040
under no jurisdiction
of the Three Realms.

272
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,240
Why can’t I get in?

273
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,710
This place

274
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
is where True God Bai Jue
cultivates himself.

275
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,590
No one of the three Realm shall come in,

276
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,560
unless summoned.

277
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,830
If you want to get in,

278
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,150
you should tell us your name,

279
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,120
submit a visiting card

280
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,320
and request to see Princess Jingzhao.

281
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,710
Submit a visiting card

282
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,800
and request to see Jingzhao?

283
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,480
Then go ask Qingmu for me.

284
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,590
Can I not come to the Dome

285
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,390
unless he summons me?

286
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,630
You...

287
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,320
You are...?

288
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,680
What?

289
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,630
Recognized me?

290
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,360
Greetings, Goddess Houchi.

291
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,590
Where’s Qingmu?

292
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,070
Goddess Houchi,

293
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,480
do you mean Master Bai Jue?

294
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,390
Don’t ask questions to which
you already know the answer.

295
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,830
Master...

296
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,320
At this time every day,

297
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,190
he’s reading in the peach forest.

298
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,120
Unless the sea gets dry,

299
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,680
I’ll always be with you.

300
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,560
Bow to each other.

301
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,830
In a hundred years,

302
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,630
remember

303
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,190
to get me home.

304
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,270
The tea is cold. I don’t need more.

305
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,680
Qingmu,

306
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,190
I’m back.

307
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,880
I know.

308
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,590
When you promised me something,

309
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,880
you wouldn’t break it.

310
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,800
Qingmu,

311
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,680
is that you?

312
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,590
You can recognize me, right?

313
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,680
You look like her.

314
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,480
But you’re not her.

315
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,510
Qingmu,

316
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,630
I’m your wife who you proposed to
with your body.

317
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,920
You promised

318
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,070
to grow old with me

319
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,440
and never leave me even when we die.

320
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,150
You promised me

321
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,480
you would wait until I came back.

322
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,440
I’m not Qingmu.

323
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,880
I’m not married.

324
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,000
Who are you?

325
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,040
Master.

326
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,120
This is Goddess Houchi
from Qingchi Palace.

327
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,560
Gu Jun’s daughter?

328
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,800
You’re a mere immortal.

329
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,040
How dare you call yourself Goddess!

330
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,190
When you kept mentioning Qingmu,

331
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,190
I answered you a bit more.

332
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,070
Qingmu

333
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,390
is an immoral body of mine.

334
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,070
No matter how you’re related to him,

335
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,040
it means nothing to me.

336
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,510
See her out.

337
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,990
You heard Master.

338
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,800
This is the Dome,

339
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,270
instead of your Qingchi Palace.

340
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,990
You can’t do whatever you want

341
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,150
or disturb Master Bai Jue.

342
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,720
Master?

343
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,560
Look carefully.

344
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,840
Looking at his face and heart,

345
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,870
he’s Qingmu!

346
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,270
All right.

347
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,990
If you’re not Qingmu...

348
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Master Bai Jue,

349
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,870
please give Qingmu back to me.

350
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,870
He’s dead.

351
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,320
His spiritual sense must be there.

352
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,560
Give it back to me.

353
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,720
When I woke up,

354
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,630
his spiritual sense disappeared.

355
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,800
He’s dead.

356
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,800
No matter whether you believe it,

357
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
this is the truth.

358
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,510
Also,

359
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,080
I shouldn’t pay the price

360
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,960
for your relationship.

361
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,990
Master Bai Jue is kind to you,

362
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,040
for the sake of his friendship
with your father.

363
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,040
Please behave yourself.

364
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,960
Is dinner ready?

365
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,440
Yes.

366
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,870
All your favorite dishes.

367
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,150
I made them myself.

368
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,560
Thank you.

369
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,870
Forget it.

370
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,390
I won’t punish you today.

371
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,560
Declare to the Three Realms.

372
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,270
Set up a cenotaph in the North Sea

373
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,080
so that Qingmu’s friends of this life

374
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,800
could go and mourn for him.

375
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,440
However,

376
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,270
if anyone breaks into the Dome again

377
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,440
in the name of looking for Qingmu,

378
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,630
I won’t let him go.

379
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,990
Yes.

380
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,150
Cenotaph?

381
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,040
A True God like him

382
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,920
sent me away

383
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,040
with a mere cenotaph.

384
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,230
In his eyes,

385
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,630
is Qingmu only a tool

386
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,560
to make him wake up?

387
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,750
When I see you trapped in love,

388
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,080
I’m overjoyed.

389
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
As you can see,

390
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Qingmu has chosen me this time.

391
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,680
No.

392
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
I mean Master Bai Jue.

393
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,040
Who cares?

394
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,720
Anyway, I won.

395
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,510
If you’re wise enough to know yourself,

396
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,920
don’t come to pester him again.

397
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,230
He’s the True God, so what?

398
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,680
Even if I have to go against the world,

399
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,270
I’ll get justice for Qingmu.

400
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,150
Greetings, Master.

401
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,230
Don’t bother. You may rise.

402
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,230
It’s been years.

403
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,960
Master, you still look awesome.

404
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,150
I haven’t changed.

405
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,680
But you’ve changed a lot.

406
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,560
Wu Huan,

407
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,040
over the past years,

408
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,560
you and Muguang have protected immortals
and defended the Heavenly Realm.

409
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,270
You’ve had hard work.

410
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,080
Without the instruction
from you and Goddess Shanggu,

411
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,960
I would have still been
a mere colorful phoenix.

412
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,270
That year, Master Zhiyang

413
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,320
left the Immortals to us.

414
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,320
We just did what we should do.

415
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
We don’t dare to take credit.

416
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,320
You’re as modest as you were.

417
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,720
Don’t worry.

418
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,080
I’ll remember

419
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,630
what you and Muguang have done.

420
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Now the Feng Clan is in trouble,

421
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
and devil power is involved.

422
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,510
You were just back

423
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,080
from the Nether World
where devils are sealed.

424
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,470
You should figure out the truth
as soon as possible,

425
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,560
suppress the devil power

426
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,560
and bring peace back
to the Three Realms.

427
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,870
Yes, Master.

428
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,200
Master,

429
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,750
I have something to tell you.

430
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,510
What is it?

431
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,560
You just woke up

432
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,920
and you may not know it.

433
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,870
The Demon God Tianqi isn’t dead.

434
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,080
He hides in the Demon Realm,
under the assumed name of Jingyuan

435
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,920
and does harm to the Three Realms.

436
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,080
Speaking of it,

437
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,990
you killed the Demon God in person.

438
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,990
What do you mean?

439
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,470
I just have some confusion.

440
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,800
I wonder why Tianqi came back to life.

441
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,230
Tianqi destroyed the world

442
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,230
and he deserves to be killed.

443
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,320
I was badly wounded at that time.

444
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,200
Maybe,

445
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,680
that’s why he kept some
of his Spiritual Strength.

446
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Who knows?

447
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,320
I see.

448
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,040
That year,

449
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,080
demons helped Tianqi
to destroy the world.

450
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,800
Is it the reason
why you keep fighting them

451
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
over the past sixty thousand years?

452
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,680
You know the fights
between immortals and demons?

453
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,800
When the God Realm existed,

454
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,200
immortals and demons
could stay in peace.

455
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,630
Now, there’re continuous fights.

456
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,800
I fail to live up

457
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,560
to your trust on me.

458
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,800
You don’t need to apologize.

459
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,750
It’s your duty.

460
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,870
Yes.

461
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,800
Master,

462
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,750
you must have seen Houchi.

463
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,350
Don’t you think

464
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,990
she looks like Shanggu?

465
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,200
Shanggu, no contest.

466
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,040
How dare you compare
an ordinary immortal to Shanggu!

467
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,470
I’m sorry.

468
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,600
It’s just that
when I think of what happened,

469
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,320
I couldn’t help feeling sad.

470
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,600
I couldn’t believe that

471
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,390
Goddess Shanggu indeed disappeared.

472
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,870
It’s been sixty thousand years.

473
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,870
The dead won’t come back to life.

474
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,150
Mother,

475
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,720
Master Bai Jue just woke up.

476
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,200
Why must you bring this up

477
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,320
to make him sad?

478
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,750
Master,

479
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,960
my mother seldom came to the Dome.

480
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,270
Let’s invite her to stay for dinner,

481
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,320
shall we?

482
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,990
Now that you care for your mother,

483
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,680
let’s do it, then.

484
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,080
Thank you, Master.

485
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,800
Thank you, Master.

486
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,630
Lord,

487
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,350
why did you let Her Grace go and suffer?

488
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,800
One has to enjoy and suffer

489
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,350
what he deserves.

490
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,630
What goes around comes around.

491
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,960
Now that she has left,

492
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,960
why don’t you go back
to the Third Heaven first?

493
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,320
When you were away,

494
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,990
the tribe was turbulent.

495
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,920
I know.

496
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,720
About the Demon Gathering Streamer,

497
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,350
he’s been dissatisfied with me.

498
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,870
It doesn’t matter.

499
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,920
I know the score.

500
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,800
But...

501
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,560
All right.

502
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,990
Send Fengran back to Qingchi Palace.

503
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,230
I’ll stay for a few more days.

504
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,960
I’m afraid

505
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,680
there’ll be something wrong
with Bai Jue.

506
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,470
Yes.

507
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,270
No matter whether you believe it,

508
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,680
this is the truth.

509
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,720
Qingmu

510
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,960
is an immoral body of mine.

511
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,870
No matter how you’re related to him,

512
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,230
it means nothing to me.

513
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,200
No matter whether you believe it,

514
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,320
this is the truth.

515
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,200
Declare to the Three Realms.

516
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,750
Set up a cenotaph in the North Sea

517
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,320
so that Qingmu’s friends of this life

518
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,110
could go and mourn for him.

519
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,920
Houchi!

520
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,720
Father.

521
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,750
Fate makes fool of people.

522
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,150
If I hadn’t been softhearted,

523
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,440
you wouldn’t have been suffering.

524
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,470
Houchi,

525
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,350
do you feel better?

526
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,840
Father.

527
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,630
Come on.

528
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,560
He’s lost his memories.

529
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,150
He doesn’t remember anything.

530
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,390
I wonder what happened.

531
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,720
You went to see him?

532
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,870
He doesn’t remember anything?

533
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,920
That doesn’t matter.

534
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,110
As long as I’m alive,

535
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,720
the sky won’t fall.

536
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,440
I couldn’t recognize him at all.

537
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,440
He’s totally another man.

538
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,720
Is there really no hope

539
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,800
to bring Qingmu back to life?

540
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,920
He was an immortal.

541
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,350
But he just disappeared?

542
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,800
Take care of your baby first.

543
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,440
I’ll think of a way for you.

544
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,800
Father.

545
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,600
Look at you.

546
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,110
You’re pregnant,

547
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,110
but you didn’t tell me first.

548
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,440
I mean...

549
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,870
It’s our happy event.

550
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,150
I’m going to be a grandfather.

551
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,800
Take a good rest.

552
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,630
Father.

553
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,560
Tomorrow,

554
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,350
I’ll go prepare something

555
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,750
for my grandson.

556
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,080
Let Fengran do that.

557
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,040
No.

558
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,470
How can I let her go?

559
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
She has a bad taste.

560
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,920
Besides,

561
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,680
I picked every single thing

562
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,270
you used

563
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,630
when you were little.

564
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,230
So, when I was little,

565
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,510
I was like a boy.

566
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,960
How can we distinguish the gender

567
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,200
of a little baby?

568
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,150
Then you only bought me

569
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,110
toys for boys,

570
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,150
like carriage, slingshot and weapon?

571
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,560
I didn’t know

572
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,270
what girls would like.

573
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,320
Then why didn’t you

574
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,200
ask the female immortals around you?

575
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:40,920
You’ve been alone all these years.

576
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,720
Don’t you have even one female friend?

577
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,270
I’m...

578
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,320
I’m not very good at that.

579
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:52,990
Father,

580
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,320
if I also leave someday,

581
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
you’ll be lonely in Qingchi Palace.

582
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,800
You’d better have some company.

583
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:01,840
Right?

584
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,960
You also leave?

585
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,390
What do you mean leave?

586
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:05,920
Where are you going?

587
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,470
Houchi,

588
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,350
as long as you’re in Qingchi Palace,

589
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,920
I won’t feel lonely.

590
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Look at you.

591
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,440
You’re so anxious.

592
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,680
I don’t want my grandson

593
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,110
to be like you.

594
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,510
If your grandson

595
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,080
is like Qingmu,

596
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,270
that’ll be great.

597
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,350
Why?

598
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,230
I’m the most important person for him.

599
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,960
After he’s born,

600
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,230
I’ll take care of everything for him.

601
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:45,920
Don’t cry.

602
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,320
All right.

603
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,150
Have a good rest.

604
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:52,960
Come on.

605
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,920
Let me help you.

606
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,350
When you wake up,

607
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,270
everything will be fine.

608
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,110
Your Highness,

609
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,390
His Majesty came at dinner.

610
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,390
He did?

611
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,510
What did he say?

612
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,150
Nothing.

613
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
When His Majesty knew

614
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,350
you had dinner at Master Bai Jue’s hall,

615
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,800
he was very happy.

616
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,040
He said you suffered in the Nether World

617
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,440
and asked us to take good care of you.

618
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,990
Sounds like he has forgiven me.

619
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,870
I think

620
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,720
His Majesty still cares a lot about you

621
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,320
and wants a good relationship with you.

622
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,960
You’re still the most honorable goddess.

623
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,150
Before,

624
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,870
when I heard this,

625
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,800
I would be very happy.

626
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,720
But now...

627
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,840
After I suffered in the Nether World,

628
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,870
I made up my mind.

629
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,750
I must decide it myself

630
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,800
whether I’m the most honorable goddess.

631
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,470
Even the Heavenly Emperor

632
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,390
can’t decide it for me.

633
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,040
Sorry, I didn’t mean that.

634
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,200
Please punish me, Your Highness.

635
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,470
You may rise.

636
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,230
You don’t need to kneel.

637
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,800
I wasn’t angry.

638
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,920
I wasn’t feeling sorry
for myself, either.

639
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,720
I’m not in such a mood.

640
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,560
In the Dome,

641
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,680
did you figure out the truth?

642
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,920
Bai Jue was very cautious.

643
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,840
He didn’t admit that he was Qingmu

644
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,320
or that Houchi was related to Shanggu.

645
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,990
If Master Bai Jue remembered Qingmu,

646
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,510
he wouldn’t have invited you
to stay for dinner.

647
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,110
Bai Jue is meticulous.

648
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,040
I strongly feel that

649
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,110
he became Boxuan

650
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,470
and lived in Qingchi Palace

651
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,750
so that he could bring Shanggu
back to life.

652
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,150
If Houchi is really Shanggu,

653
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,750
she has seen what I’ve done

654
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,150
over the years.

655
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,990
When she wakes up,

656
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,990
I’ll have nothing, but punishment.

657
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,440
I only meant to suppress Houchi.

658
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,200
But now,

659
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,750
I must find a chance to exterminate her

660
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
to get rid of future trouble.

661
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,440
Master Bai Jue won’t let you do that.

662
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,680
I also don’t understand

663
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,600
why he’s stalling.

664
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,320
Bai Jue hasn’t got his power back yet.

665
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,390
He still looks weak.

666
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,320
He can’t cover it up.

667
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,630
To me,

668
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,040
it’s a great chance.

669
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,800
I’ll cultivate myself carefully.

670
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,320
When I achieve enough devil power

671
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,270
and become the Devil God,

672
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,870
I’ll be afraid of no god or goddess.

673
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,230
All problems

674
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,390
will be readily solved.

675
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,510
What are we going to do next?

676
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,840
I’ve completed the first step

677
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,680
of leaving the Nether World.

678
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,080
Fengnyu,

679
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,560
go find Elder Danfeng to me.

680
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,990
When she is still alive,

681
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,560
I can’t sleep soundly.

682
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,230
Yes.

683
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,870
To be a god or devil,

684
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,110
does it matter?

685
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,720
It does, of course.

686
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,080
I’m the Heavenly Empress.

687
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,350
How can I become a devil?

688
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,270
You’re wrong.

689
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,200
Who judges the god or devil,

690
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,920
and who determines life and death...

691
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,750
That’s the most important thing.

692
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,640
Greetings, Master Bai Jue.

693
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,800
I knew you would come.

694
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,510
Master Bai Jue,

695
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,950
I came here

696
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,640
to ask you something.

697
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,910
Do you remember

698
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,950
the Tribulation of Chaos
sixty thousand years ago?

699
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,950
When the Three Realms live, you live.

700
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,470
You’re the Chief God of Chaos.

701
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,880
I won’t let you die.

702
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,800
I won’t let you die!

703
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,560
Master Bai Jue,

704
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,270
my master’s spiritual sense

705
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,600
has been bred for forty thousand years,

706
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,470
but she hasn’t got out yet.

707
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,990
You spent half of your power

708
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,270
to draw the God-reincarnation Spell.

709
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,750
It will disappear tomorrow.

710
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,640
If my master can’t come out today,

711
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,470
our efforts over so many years

712
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,430
will be wasted.

713
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,990
She’s Shanggu.

714
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,470
If she can’t change her fate,

715
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,800
who else can help her?

716
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,400
Master!

717
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,270
Keep your voice down.

718
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,750
Don’t disturb her.

719
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,800
She’s just come into being

720
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,600
and she’s very weak.

721
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,160
You must take good care of her.

722
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,320
Yes.

723
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,800
Master,

724
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,270
why did you seal her Spiritual Strength?

725
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,750
On the Heaven and Earth Platform,

726
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,840
she said she didn’t want
to be a goddess again.

727
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,880
Now that this is her wish,

728
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,560
in this life,

729
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,040
she’ll no longer be Shanggu.

730
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:00,990
But...

731
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,270
We never know what will happen.

732
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,800
And the future is unpredictable.

733
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,840
When she’s no longer the Chief God,

734
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,160
she doesn’t need to bear responsibilities
for the whole world.

735
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,510
It’s her luck.

736
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,040
Woods sway in the wind.

737
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,120
Houchi means the rising moon.

738
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,640
Houchi will be your name, then.

739
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,160
Houchi,

740
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,320
grow up happily.

741
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,640
I’ll take care of you in this life

742
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,320
and make you safe and carefree.

743
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,990
Houchi.

744
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,880
You gave her the name.

745
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,120
To save Goddess Shanggu,

746
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:47,910
you became Boxuan and took care of her

747
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,470
for tens of thousands of years.

748
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,430
But when Goddess Shanggu
comes back to life,

749
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,160
it means

750
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,160
the Tribulation of Chaos
hasn’t disappeared.

751
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,990
No one but I

752
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,990
knew that

753
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,320
it was you

754
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,560
who sealed the Tribulation
for the moment.

755
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,400
Why are you bringing this up?

756
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,120
Later,

757
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,750
you suffered the pain
of splitting your Original Being

758
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,360
and made another body

759
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,800
to absorb the demon power.

760
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,320
Ten thousand years ago,
you went to the North Sea,

761
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,640
trying to mix your immortal power

762
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,430
with his demon power

763
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,470
so that you can get the Power of Chaos.

764
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,640
So?

765
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,160
So,

766
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,160
I came to make clear.

767
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,510
When you’re back now,

768
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,510
will you stick to the original plan?

769
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,840
Will you still sacrifice yourself

770
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,750
for Goddess Shanggu

771
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,160
and for the Three Realms?

772
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,320
If you stick to the plan,

773
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,640
why did you pretend
you lost your memories,

774
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,160
destroy Qingmu

775
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,640
and make Houchi so sad?

776
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,040
I planned everything,

777
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,990
but I didn’t predict that

778
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,710
the body that absorbed the demon power

779
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,600
and possessed supreme demon power

780
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,190
had generated his own Spiritual Strength

781
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,270
and swallowed me

782
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,160
when I was going to mix with him.

783
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,880
Tens of thousands of years later,

784
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,270
I woke up and found out that

785
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,080
he had been in love with Houchi.

786
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,270
Why did I pretend to have lost memories?

787
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,160
I should ask you.

788
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,160
What were you doing?

789
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,190
Why didn’t you stop it?

790
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:34,710
I...

791
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,510
I tried to stop it but failed.

792
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,880
I’m dying already.

793
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,640
Only when I deceive Houchi

794
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,190
and end our relationship

795
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,950
will she give up on me.

796
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,910
But...

797
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,160
When Goddess Shanggu wakes up

798
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,080
and knows you were harsh to Houchi

799
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,430
and you took the Tribulation for her,

800
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,950
she will hate you.

801
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,430
It’s better than losing her life.

802
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,640
As long as she hates me,

803
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,360
she won’t get hurt because of my death.

804
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,560
When she’s alive,

805
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,910
I’ll be satisfied

806
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,400
and there’ll be hope
for the Three Realms.

807
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,400
Master,

808
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,120
I’m in debt to Master Shanggu.

809
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,080
I’ll willing to help you

810
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,120
with this plan.

811
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,080
Over the hundreds of thousands of years,

812
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,800
I’ve already seen Houchi

813
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
as my own daughter.

814
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:33,880
It pains me

815
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,400
to see her heartbroken.

816
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,710
Then why didn’t you do anything

817
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,190
when she confined herself to
the Hidden Mountain for so long?

818
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,190
You could’ve stopped it

819
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,040
but you sit back and watch

820
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,320
the newly-wed separated

821
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,840
for decades.
