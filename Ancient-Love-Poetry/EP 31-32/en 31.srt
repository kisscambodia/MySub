2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 31=

3
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,570
Father. Please come.

4
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,530
Houchi, what makes you so happy?

5
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,020
These are made by hand,

6
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,340
not by immortal skill.

7
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,420
You haven’t eaten dishes

8
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,140
of the human world for long, right?

9
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,380
Please sit and try it.

10
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,380
You made all these dishes?

11
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,570
I didn’t make the dishes.

12
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,810
But they contain my goodwill.

13
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,340
Qingmu made all these for you.

14
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,490
The fish is very fresh.

15
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,420
He caught it himself.

16
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,530
The fruit wine was brewed

17
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,980
by him from the plums
on the back mountains.

18
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,300
It took him a whole day

19
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,580
to finish all these dishes.

20
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,090
Please don’t give him
the cold shoulder again.

21
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,090
Houchi.

22
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,500
He made all these? Is it true?

23
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,010
Yes.

24
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,530
Have a try.

25
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,530
I may only eat

26
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,010
a meal he cooked once in this life.

27
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,010
Forget it.

28
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,860
Father.

29
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,810
If you like the meal,

30
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,140
Qingmu can cook it for you every day.

31
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,370
Lord Qingmu.

32
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,730
Yes?

33
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,420
Please be at ease.

34
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,220
Only if you are at ease,

35
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,530
I will feel at ease.

36
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:06,980
Yes.

37
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:08,940
Chang Que.

38
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:09,980
Yes, Your Grace.

39
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,090
Go bring ten
ten-thousand-year luminous pearls

40
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,500
as gifts for North Sea Lord.

41
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,140
Yes.

42
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,340
You made me a meal.

43
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,810
I give you ten luminous pearls.

44
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,530
I believe it’s fair to you.

45
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,810
Now it’s late.

46
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,210
I’m sorry we can’t keep you staying.

47
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,530
Please return to the North Sea early.

48
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,090
Fengran.

49
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,620
See our guest out.

50
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,050
Father.

51
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,420
Houchi.

52
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,740
God Gu Jun.

53
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,700
I love Houchi deeply

54
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,580
and sincerely hope

55
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,050
I can marry her.

56
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,140
Your Grace, why do you

57
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,530
insist on refusing?

58
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,580
Lord Qingmu.

59
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,180
You saved her many times.

60
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,180
We have a great appreciation for it.

61
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,580
You are a great one

62
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,330
from the Immortals.

63
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,810
But my daughter is too naughty.

64
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,620
She isn’t a good match for you.

65
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,460
Your Grace, you keep refusing.

66
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,180
Why are you so dissatisfied with me?

67
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,370
The only reason

68
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,650
is I don’t want
my precious daughter to leave me.

69
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,490
I disagree

70
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,370
with

71
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,180
your marriage.

72
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,700
Father.

73
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,490
Fengran.

74
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,050
See him out.

75
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,210
Yes, Your Grace.

76
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,490
Lord Qingmu, please.

77
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,050
Excuse me.

78
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,300
Qingmu.

79
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,490
Qingmu!

80
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,250
Qingmu!

81
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,860
Father.

82
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,740
Father!

83
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,740
Father, why do you hate Qingmu so much?

84
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,740
I’ve said

85
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,980
it’s because I don’t want you to leave.

86
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,700
Since when you became so unreasonable?

87
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,490
All in the Three Realms look down on me.

88
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,370
But Qingmu never does.

89
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,860
He’s sincere to me,

90
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,620
always makes me happy,

91
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,900
and protects me with his life.

92
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,900
He’s willing

93
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,740
to be against the whole
Three Realms for me.

94
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,530
Why did you refuse him

95
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,490
with such a perfunctory excuse?

96
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,370
I didn’t mean that.

97
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,090
I have my reason.

98
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,370
It’s not up to me.

99
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,020
Why?

100
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,740
Because of my lot?

101
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,740
I always wanted to ask you about it.

102
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,580
I wasn’t given birth by Wu Huan,

103
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,050
and I have no blood of the flood dragon.

104
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,020
You didn’t take me back from somewhere.

105
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,420
I always thought

106
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,700
I couldn’t cultivate my spiritual power

107
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,250
because my spiritual veins
hadn’t been unleashed.

108
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,530
But Jingyuan told me

109
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,020
there is a powerful seal in me.

110
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,700
It suppressed my spiritual power.

111
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,210
I know he didn’t lie.

112
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,930
Because I often see

113
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,330
memories that don’t belong to me.

114
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,810
I even saw memories about the God Realm

115
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,620
when I was in the Pilgrimage Hall.

116
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,740
Father.

117
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,140
Why is it that I can see
memories about the God Realm?

118
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,490
Why is it that I can absorb
the Pilgrimage Hall’s spiritual power

119
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,860
that even the Heavenly Emperor can’t?

120
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,740
Houchi.

121
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,050
You’ve grown up.

122
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,420
I can’t keep hiding your lot from you.

123
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,980
Actually, the spiritual strength

124
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,330
of a Goddess is sleeping soundly in you.

125
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,940
And you

126
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,060
are her.

127
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,500
You mean

128
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,210
a Goddess from the God Realm?

129
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,500
The Tribulation of Chaos occurred
60,000 years ago.

130
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,180
Devils came to attack us.

131
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,690
Gods and Goddesses fell.

132
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,300
You once helped me a lot
with my cultivation.

133
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,450
I kept a little of your

134
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,130
spiritual strength

135
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,500
with all my God power in the calamity.

136
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,210
But it’s too weak.

137
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,090
So, I went to the human world

138
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,260
and cultivated it in the Huajing Pond
for thousands of years.

139
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,890
Then you were born.

140
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,860
How about Boxuan?

141
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,690
Is he from the God Realm as well?

142
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:20,690
No.

143
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,450
He’s just a usual immortal
in the Three Realms.

144
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,620
I helped him when I went to
the Immortal Realm.

145
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,620
In order to repay me,

146
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,380
he agreed to stay in the Qingchi Palace
to take care of you.

147
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,530
The spiritual strength in you

148
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,860
was sealed by Boxuan and me.

149
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,330
Father.

150
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,330
I still don’t understand.

151
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,890
She helped you.

152
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,450
Why didn’t you wake her up

153
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,330
after saving her?

154
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,420
That’s her last wish.

155
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,860
As a Goddess,

156
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,210
she would have to
be responsible for all beings.

157
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,980
She couldn’t master her own destiny.

158
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,650
When she died
in the Tribulation of Chaos,

159
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,530
her last wish was...

160
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,060
Wish I wouldn’t be a Goddess

161
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,450
in the next life.

162
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,330
If there is the next life,

163
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,740
she wished never to be a Goddess.

164
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,060
Even if she lost her memories,

165
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,210
she is still the most honorable one

166
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,860
in the Three Realms.

167
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,090
So,

168
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,450
I’m really not your daughter.

169
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,820
I’m just from some spiritual strength.

170
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,330
Boxuan and you are good to me

171
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,820
only because of
that spiritual strength in me.

172
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,180
In order to fulfill her last wish,

173
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,420
you sealed my spiritual power
since I was born,

174
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,060
in spite of making me a laughing stock
across the Three Realms.

175
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,060
Houchi.

176
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,570
It’s not what you think.

177
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,450
Is she Chief Goddess Shanggu?

178
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,500
How could you know that?

179
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,940
I saw her when I devoured

180
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,530
the Pilgrimage Hall.

181
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,090
She looked the same as me.

182
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,890
Father.

183
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,940
Before, I thought

184
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,650
I was abandoned by my mother,

185
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,890
but

186
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,090
Father and Boxuan loved me.

187
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,180
Now I see.

188
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,330
I just exist

189
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,820
for fulfilling another one’s wish.

190
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,740
Since the body shouldn’t belong to me,

191
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,980
why did you give life to me?

192
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,740
I...

193
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,690
never really owned anything.

194
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,420
Identity. Family.

195
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,530
Nothing belongs to me.

196
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,210
Houchi.

197
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,090
Boxuan and I just hope you to be safe

198
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,770
and live a carefree life.

199
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:01,690
I don’t want to hear that!

200
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,650
I don’t want to hear
any of your explanations.

201
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,450
You both care about her only.

202
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,210
Houchi.

203
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,530
Houchi!

204
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,820
I’m sorry.

205
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,330
Houchi.

206
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,380
What is it?

207
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,740
What happened?

208
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,260
Are you angry with your father?

209
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,740
Silly.

210
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,330
Now that he refused me this time,

211
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,770
I can just try harder.

212
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,530
He’s your father,

213
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,530
the one who loves you the most.

214
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,450
You shouldn’t be mad with him for me.

215
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,380
You don’t understand.

216
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,180
He’s not...

217
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,650
Not what?

218
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,330
What happened exactly?

219
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,530
Qingmu, do you like me?

220
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,770
Of course.

221
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,860
Am I really the one you like?

222
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,980
Me, Houchi?

223
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,740
Of course, it’s you.

224
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,010
Who else could it be?

225
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,690
I’ve told you

226
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,770
that it’s destiny that tied us together.

227
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,010
When I saw you for the first time,

228
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,890
I found you very familiar.

229
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,860
I felt that
we had been acquainted for eons.

230
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,530
In fact, I knew you

231
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,010
earlier than you thought.

232
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,940
A thousand years ago,
I woke up in the North Sea

233
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,330
without any memory.

234
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,740
But I kept dreaming of a girl.

235
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,180
What girl?

236
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,090
She’s in a dark black ancient robe

237
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,420
and stands in the thunder.

238
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,300
For eons?

239
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,090
Do you like me

240
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,090
or the one you’ve been missing

241
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,180
for eons in your dream?

242
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,770
It’s you who’s in my dream.

243
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,980
No, it’s not.

244
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:19,770
She and I

245
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,860
aren’t the same person.

246
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,260
I never wore a dark black ancient robe.

247
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,500
And I was never in your dream.

248
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,300
She is not me.

249
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,450
Qingmu, answer me.

250
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:32,860
If you didn’t see

251
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,090
the bracelet on me
on that day when we met

252
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,260
for the first time on Mount Lookout,

253
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,740
or feel

254
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,300
I’m the destined one for you,

255
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,740
would you still have gone to the Demons
with me,

256
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,300
protected me with your life,

257
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,890
and fallen in love with me?

258
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,500
I...

259
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,380
I see.

260
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,820
You are all the same.

261
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,940
You protect me and are good to me

262
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,620
with your life because of

263
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,940
the spiritual strength in me, right?

264
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,740
What spiritual strength?

265
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,690
I don’t understand, Houchi.

266
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,820
The one you like

267
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,260
is in my body.

268
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,260
One body can’t have two souls.

269
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,060
She would devour me.

270
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,130
Or she might completely vanish.

271
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,130
I wish I could be with you

272
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,330
not as a god

273
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,260
in the next life.

274
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,330
Shanggu.

275
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,620
I won’t allow you to die.

276
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,690
If only one can survive,

277
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,450
which will you pick?

278
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,860
Don’t hurt her!

279
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,980
Don’t hurt her?

280
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,740
Leave.

281
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,420
I don’t want to see you ever again.

282
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,940
No, Houchi.

283
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I don’t know why I said so.

284
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,650
Listen to me.

285
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,300
Qingmu.

286
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,570
I’ve told you

287
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,010
not to stay at Qilian Mountains.

288
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,450
Your Grace.

289
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,060
After getting Houchi back,

290
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,890
I will come to apologize.

291
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,330
You are not clear about your feelings.

292
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,180
Even if you get her back,

293
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,940
it will be meaningless.

294
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,380
What do you mean?

295
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,180
Houchi just asked you

296
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,010
which you would pick if only one in her

297
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,260
could survive.

298
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,900
You even couldn’t answer.

299
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,660
How could you say you love her?

300
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,290
I...

301
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,980
I don’t understand.

302
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,090
The spiritual strength in her?

303
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:22,980
What does it mean?

304
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:30,980
Houchi

305
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,620
was not my daughter.

306
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,260
She was cultivated with

307
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,860
the spiritual strength of Shanggu.

308
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,540
The spiritual strength is very powerful.

309
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,900
Once it wakes up,

310
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,170
Houchi will lose her memories,

311
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,500
which means she won’t exist anymore.

312
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,090
Qingmu.

313
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,210
Houchi is not a normal immortal.

314
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,020
You two being together
will only lead to a bad ending.

315
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,690
End your relationship early

316
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,540
so that you won’t get hurt
in the future.

317
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,290
No.

318
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,410
I won’t give up Houchi.

319
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,620
Haven’t you ever doubted?

320
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,260
You feel familiar with her.

321
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,540
You value her.

322
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,170
Is it just because she’s Houchi?

323
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,260
If you even haven’t figured out

324
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,090
who you are exactly,

325
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,930
how could you marry her?

326
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,170
Isn’t it too early?

327
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,780
Excuse me,

328
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,690
but Your Grace,

329
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,860
do you mean True God Bai Jue?

330
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,380
Seems you’ve got an answer.

331
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,210
Boxuan.

332
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,170
Did you take care of me

333
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,860
for requiting favors of Father?

334
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,260
Why do you all protect me?

335
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,260
All for her, right?

336
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,780
Boxuan.

337
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,860
I’ve made up my mind.

338
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,500
I will leave the Qingchi Palace

339
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,540
and travel around the Three Realms.

340
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:35,980
Father.

341
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,780
Jingjian.

342
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,210
What’s that?

343
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
I received a Chihe Jade recently.

344
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,540
Hope you will like it.

345
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,540
Jingjian.

346
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,090
You’ve always been obedient.

347
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,690
As early as your mother
was in the God Realm,

348
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,330
she liked jade from Chihe in particular.

349
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,540
How about giving it to her?

350
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,690
No problem, Father.

351
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,260
Report!

352
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,020
Your Majesty.

353
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:03,980
Information from the Demon Region!

354
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:04,760
Go ahead.

355
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,540
The Demons attacked
the Demon Region again.

356
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,020
Prince Jingyang asked

357
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,780
if you could reinforce

358
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,980
to help him fight back

359
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,380
or even merge the Demons.

360
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,620
Let Jingyang only defend the barrier.

361
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,210
If the Demons don’t attack us,

362
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,020
never send an army into the battle.

363
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,740
Yes!

364
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:24,980
Father.

365
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,780
If the Demon God attacks,

366
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,500
I’m afraid Jingyang will...

367
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,090
It seems

368
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,410
I need to visit the Qingchi Palace
in person.

369
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,540
Your Highness.

370
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,980
I’ve taken away the heavenly guards

371
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,170
according to your order

372
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,090
and framed the Demons.

373
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,900
It caused conflict as expected.

374
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,090
Information from the Demon Region

375
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,380
said Prince Jingyang
had asked for reinforcements.

376
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,210
What did His Majesty say?

377
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,780
His Majesty only wants peace.

378
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,930
He didn’t permit any counterattack.

379
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,410
Sure enough.

380
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,540
Fengnyu,

381
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,450
assign forces

382
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,380
to the Demon Region to help Jingyang.

383
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,020
Remember.

384
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,260
Secretly help him instigate rebellion
within the Demons.

385
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,900
If His Majesty knows this,

386
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,660
he will blame you.

387
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,410
There’ll be deaths in any battle.

388
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,020
The Demon Region will have
much pure evil

389
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,260
that I can use.

390
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,020
Comparing with that,

391
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,140
it doesn’t matter even if I’m blamed.

392
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,020
Let go of me. Let go of me!

393
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,020
Don’t move!

394
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,210
Let go of me!

395
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,780
Let go of me!

396
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,410
Kid!

397
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,780
If you keep being disobedient,

398
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,260
I will swallow you right now.

399
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,410
Immortal Miss, help!

400
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,450
Immortal?

401
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,860
How bold you are!

402
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,020
The Immortals and the Demons shouldn’t
intrude into the human world.

403
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,690
How could you snatch a mortal in secret?

404
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:54,980
Who are you?

405
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,620
How dare you intervene!

406
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,660
I work for the Three-head Fire Dragon.

407
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,260
This girl is an oblation for him.

408
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,540
You’d better get lost.

409
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,020
If he is displeased,

410
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,620
he may destroy your monastery.

411
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,900
My monastery?

412
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,860
If he dares to come to Qilian Mountains,

413
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,690
I will warmly welcome him.

414
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,740
Are you... Goddess Houchi
from the Qingchi Palace?

415
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,260
Let’s go.

416
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,690
What’s your name? Where do you live?

417
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,930
My name is Bai Shuo.

418
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,260
I live in Dibei Town.

419
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,260
How were you taken here?

420
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,500
I don’t know.

421
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,690
I found myself caught once I woke up.

422
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,450
Immortal Miss,

423
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,540
I want to go home.

424
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,740
Don’t worry.

425
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,410
I’ll take you back right now.

426
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,210
Houchi doesn’t want to be
in the Immortal Realm

427
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,110
(Travelling the Three Realms. By Houchi)
or go to the Demon Realm.

428
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,170
She’ll only go to the Human Realm.

429
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,450
Dear,

430
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,380
don’t cry.

431
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,660
I’ve sent the guards to look for her.

432
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,330
It’s useless.

433
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,740
Children got missing one after another.

434
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,900
People say it’s the demons who did that.

435
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,620
I’m afraid Shuo was also taken away.

436
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,170
No, it can’t be.

437
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,290
Shuo!

438
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,540
Shuo!

439
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,210
Dad.

440
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:17,980
Shuo!

441
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,810
Shuo, where have you been?

442
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,690
Dad,

443
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,810
I was caught by the demons.

444
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,900
It’s Immortal Miss who saved me.

445
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,810
Thank you for saving my daughter.

446
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,810
That’s nothing.

447
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,810
Don’t mention it.

448
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,900
I’ve set a barrier out of your mansion.

449
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,500
No demons can come again.

450
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,090
Dear,

451
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,740
leave with Shuo.

452
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,380
All right.

453
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,900
Here’s the thing.

454
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,540
I’m the master here.

455
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,860
Many demons have come to
the town recently.

456
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,050
I assigned many guards to patrol.

457
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,050
But there’re still lots of kids missing.

458
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,260
Now

459
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,450
I really don’t know how to protect

460
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,620
the people in the town.

461
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,450
You are powerful.

462
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,090
Please stay

463
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,290
and defend our Dibei Town, will you?

464
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,330
I will check it right now.

465
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,140
Thank you.

466
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,860
Hey.

467
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,740
Her Grace has left.

468
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,810
But His Grace doesn’t
worry about her at all.

469
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,140
How do you know he doesn’t?

470
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,330
What’s more,

471
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,740
Lord Qingmu has gone to look for her.

472
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,290
They will return very soon.

473
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,540
It isn’t that easy.

474
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,500
I heard

475
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,900
His Grace and Her Grace
had a fierce quarrel.

476
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,690
Her Grace left in tears.

477
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,780
You saw it personally?

478
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,570
No.

479
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,570
Then why did you talk nonsense?

480
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,900
His Grace doesn’t like talking.

481
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,690
But he loves Her Grace the most.

482
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,740
How would he quarrel with her?

483
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,740
Her Grace had been waiting for
her father for long.

484
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,860
Now that she left home.

485
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,380
I’m sure she was heartbroken.

486
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,690
Stop talking nonsense.

487
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,780
If His Grace heard this,

488
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,860
he would feel very sad.

489
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,570
Don’t you have anything to be busy with?

490
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,380
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

491
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:11,860
Your Grace,

492
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,260
I will prepare some herbs.

493
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,690
Please excuse me to leave.

494
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,930
Come on!

495
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,410
Your Grace,

496
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,810
please don’t mind their nonsense.

497
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,050
Houchi is just angry temporarily.

498
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,140
She will come back

499
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,140
after she calms down.

500
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,380
Houchi is in Bai’s Mansion

501
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,450
in the human world with Lord Qingmu
protecting her.

502
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,090
Don’t worry.

503
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,690
You may go rest.

504
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,930
You’ve known it?

505
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,620
(Travelling the Three Realms.
Don’t look for me. By Houchi)

506
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,860
Since the body shouldn’t belong to me,

507
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,050
why did you give life to me?

508
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,170
I...

509
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,900
never really owned anything.

510
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,810
Identity. Family.

511
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,260
Nothing belongs to me.

512
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,570
You both care about her only.

513
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,330
Houchi.

514
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,930
I hope that day

515
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,980
would never come.

516
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:09,860
Let’s go.

517
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:11,810
Stop!

518
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:13,980
Let go of the kids!

519
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:22,690
Houchi...!

520
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,540
If she doesn’t want to see me...

521
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,860
Please spare us! Please!

522
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,450
Who is your master?

523
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,260
How dare you snatch kids here!

524
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,450
We work for Three-head Fire Dragon.

525
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,140
He ordered us to come to the human world

526
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,210
to get boys and girls
for his cultivation.

527
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,330
Please spare us!

528
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,930
We did this by order.

529
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,740
Three-head Fire Dragon?

530
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,500
Go back to the Demon Realm.

531
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,170
If you invade the human world again,

532
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,500
I will let you vanish.

533
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,660
Yes! Yes!

534
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:27,930
The Heavenly Emperor and the Demon King

535
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,260
made an agreement 60,000 years ago.

536
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,290
Neither the Immortals nor the Demons can
invade the human world.

537
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,450
How come Three-head Fire Dragon
is so bold?

538
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,570
Maybe

539
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,330
something happened to the Demons.

540
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,170
Go to the Xuanjing Palace
and tell Jingyuan

541
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,020
that I’m waiting for him in Dibei Town
in the human world.

542
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,210
I need to protect the people here first.

543
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,500
It’s been 60,000 years.

544
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,780
The Qingchi Palace hasn’t changed.

545
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,570
Gu Jun.

546
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,380
It was my fault
that I didn’t protect Houchi well

547
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,620
on that day
on the Green Dragon Platform.

548
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,050
Let bygones be bygones.

549
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,810
I don’t think you are here

550
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,290
for a general talk, right?

551
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,090
Gu Jun.

552
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,570
Tell me the truth.

553
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,450
Is Houchi Master Shanggu?

554
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,500
No.

555
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,410
If not, how could she

556
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,290
get into the Pilgrimage Hall

557
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,570
and inherit the Power of Chaos in it?

558
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,620
Houchi could get into
the Pilgrimage Hall

559
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,090
all because of an opportunity.

560
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,210
She was lucky.

561
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,690
Forget it.

562
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,980
If you don’t want to mention it,

563
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,930
I won’t ask.

564
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,740
I believe you’ve known
that the Demon God appeared.

565
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,450
Unexpectedly,

566
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,290
he hides in the Demon Realm in the name
of Demon Lord Ziyue.

567
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,170
He’s patient enough

568
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,860
for appearing till now,

569
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,780
given his temper in old days.

570
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,660
The Demon God is ambitious.

571
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,780
He tried to become the God of Chaos

572
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,050
with the lives of the Three Realms.

573
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,570
Now he’s back.

574
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,620
Surely he would do the same thing again.

575
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,170
We need to find a way to stop him.

576
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,330
Only the three True Gods

577
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,020
could stop him at that time.

578
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,930
Now, all of them already fell.

579
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,740
Nobody can stop the Demon God

580
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,930
if he really wants to
destroy the Three Realms.

581
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,740
He used his power
at the Heavenly Palace last time.

582
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,290
I could feel that his power

583
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,540
as a True God hasn’t recovered.

584
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,380
Even so,

585
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,260
I’m not sure if we can kill him

586
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,570
with the power of us three.

587
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,690
But if

588
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,380
we can restart the God Realm

589
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,500
and wake up the sleeping Gods,

590
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,500
maybe we can stop him.

591
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,450
Restart the God Realm?

592
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,140
It won’t be that easy.

593
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,450
If only we get
the four weapons of True Gods,

594
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,620
we can restart the God Realm.

595
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,810
Now the Taicang Spear
has chosen its master.

596
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,900
The Twin Spear’s buried near the barrier
between the Immortal and Demon Realms.

597
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,210
Once we find the Ancestral Sword
and the Purple Moon Whip,

598
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,020
it won’t be hard to restart
the God Realm.

599
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,980
The Purple Moon Whip disappeared

600
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,900
during the Tribulation of Chaos.

601
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,330
I’m afraid the Demon God already got it.

602
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,170
So, we need to

603
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,380
find out the other three weapons

604
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,260
before his power of True God recovers.

605
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,540
In that case,

606
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,090
we will have a chance to win.

607
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,690
Gu Jun.

608
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,690
No matter how hard it is,

609
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,570
we have to try.

610
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,330
Master Zhiyang

611
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,260
left the Three Realms to us.

612
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,860
We can’t just watch it

613
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,810
being destroyed by the Demon God.

614
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,620
It’s about the beings.

615
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,020
I shouldn’t refuse.

616
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,860
We’ve tried last time,

617
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,330
but we couldn’t open the Skyreach Pillar

618
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,690
and get the Twin Spear.

619
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,900
That’s why I’m here today.

620
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,450
I want you to take Qingmu with you

621
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,930
to go to the Skyreach Pillar.

622
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,330
Both the Taicang Spear
and the Twin Spear

623
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,570
were made by Ancestral God Qingtian.

624
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,620
Maybe

625
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,570
Qingmu can take back the Twin Spear

626
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,570
with the power of the Taicang Spear.

627
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,980
After getting the two weapons,

628
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,660
even if we can’t restart the God Realm,

629
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,690
we can restrict the Demon God at least.

630
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,210
Okay. I will do it.

631
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,610
Fengran, go take Qingmu back.

632
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,020
Yes, Your Grace.

633
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,740
He must have returned to the North Sea.

634
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,130
Immortal Miss.

635
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,850
What is it?

636
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,650
Immortal Miss,

637
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,890
whom are you missing?

638
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,210
I’ve been calling you for a long time.

639
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,580
What’s the matter?

640
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,020
Could you play with me?

641
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,410
Okay. Let’s go.

642
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,410
You really aren’t clear about your mind?

643
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,890
I only love Houchi.

644
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,130
How could you say so?

645
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,450
It’s just that I dare not see her.

646
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,450
I worry that our happiness
won’t last long.

647
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,500
Why not long?

648
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,610
If you are determined,

649
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,740
how could it end in a flash?

650
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,690
No matter what, it’s about Houchi.

651
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,210
I have to think it twice.

652
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,210
By the way,

653
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,690
God Gu Jun wants to see you.

654
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,930
God Gu Jun wants to see me?

655
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,340
Maybe I can’t

656
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,340
help clear up your confusion now.

657
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:30,740
But when you go back,

658
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:31,980
you may win

659
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,170
that picky old man’s favor.

660
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:41,930
Your Majesty.

661
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,060
Your Majesty.

662
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,340
I just came back
from the Parasol Forest.

663
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,370
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

664
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,210
What happened to the Feng Clan?

665
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,740
A group of phoenixes will pip.

666
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,410
Phoenix’s pipping is a major event.

667
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,690
I’m the leader of the Feng Clan.

668
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,210
How could I not be there?

669
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,130
So, I stayed in the Parasol Forest
for a few days

670
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,370
and attended some affairs.

671
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,370
Huan.

672
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,210
Just ask Fengnyu

673
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,060
to deal with the chores.

674
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,020
You don’t need to work so hard.

675
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,020
Elder Feng Yun appointed me

676
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,370
as leader of the Clan before his death.

677
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,170
I can’t betray his trust.

678
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,890
You are already occupied with
managing the Heavenly Palace.

679
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,410
I just hope you can be
a little light-hearted.

680
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,740
Forget it.

681
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,580
Let’s not talk about it.

682
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,210
Do you like

683
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,020
the Chihe Jade?

684
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,850
Very much.

685
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,410
That’s nice.

686
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,060
Your Majesty,

687
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,500
I don’t think you asked me here

688
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,740
only for this.

689
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,930
The Immortals and the Demons
are fighting in the Demon Region.

690
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,580
Did you send reinforcements
for Jingyang?

691
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,210
The Demons always want a fight.

692
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,740
Now that the battle has started,

693
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,740
how could they stop easily?

694
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,370
You ordered Jingyang not to attack.

695
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,890
He has no helping hand
in the Demon Region.

696
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,170
If anything happens to him,

697
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,060
what should I do?

698
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,650
Jingyang is always impatient.

699
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,170
This is a chance

700
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,100
for him to practice.

701
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,890
Do you remember the peace

702
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,210
of the Three Realms

703
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,210
before the God Realm was closed?

704
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,340
But now, the Immortals and the Demons
don’t get along.

705
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,740
We don’t live up
to Master’s expectation.

706
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,890
You are the Heavenly Emperor.

707
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,890
You can ignore Jingyang’s safety
for the Three Realms.

708
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,060
But I’m a mother.

709
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,980
I can’t leave my child alone.

710
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,690
Huan.

711
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,020
I know you worry about him.

712
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,060
But as for increasing forces,

713
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,980
I hope it won’t happen again.

714
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,130
Your Highness.

715
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,450
It’s the critical moment to increase
my God power.

716
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,300
Nobody can stop me.

717
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,100
Kill those who have a big mouth.

718
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,540
Yes.

719
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,380
(Qingchi Palace)

720
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,060
The Demon God is still alive?

721
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,780
God Gu Jun.

722
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,340
True God Bai Jue

723
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,500
killed the Demon God at that time,
didn’t he?

724
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:58,890
Nobody can figure out

725
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,300
his thoughts.

726
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,210
Four True Gods were like brothers.

727
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,540
Maybe True God Bai Jue
wasn’t that hardhearted.

728
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,980
A God who tried to
destroy the Three Realms.

729
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,060
I don’t think mercy was necessary.

730
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:19,740
You are young.

731
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,300
You may say so.

732
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,650
I called you here because

733
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,980
I want you to help the Heavenly Palace
restart the God Realm

734
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,100
to defend the Three Realms.

735
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,210
God Gu Jun, please rest assured.

736
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,980
I’ve got the Taicang Spear.

737
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,850
Even if you didn’t ask me to,

738
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,740
I would not allow the war between
the Immortals and the Demons to begin.

739
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:41,980
Good.

740
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,170
In this case,

741
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:45,930
you may take a break today

742
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,650
and go with me

743
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,980
to the Skyreach Pillar
for the Twin Spear.
