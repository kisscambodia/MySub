=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 26=

3
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,840
Where are you going?

4
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,230
It’s a secret of the Qingchi Palace.

5
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,230
I can’t tell you.

6
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,720
All right.

7
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,630
We are even now.

8
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,720
Since you won’t tell me,

9
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
I’ll just follow you.

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,230
But this place is very dangerous.

11
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,280
Lady Fengran.

12
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,390
You should be careful and stay alert.

13
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,030
Your Highness.

14
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,360
I grew up

15
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,760
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

16
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,030
You should take care of yourself.

17
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,000
Fengran, where is this place?

18
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,840
Old man.

19
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,350
I’m back to see you.

20
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,790
Don’t worry.

21
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,560
I’m living a great life now.

22
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,520
I eat well and drink well
at the Qingchi Palace.

23
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,350
There is also a little stubborn girl

24
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:50,990
keeping me company.

25
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,960
Don’t worry about me.

26
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,600
Fengran.

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
This is...?

28
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,750
This is the one who died
at the hands of Sen Yun and Jingyang.

29
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,030
He was also the only family I got.

30
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,390
I was born ominous.

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,110
Before I opened my eyes,

32
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,710
I was left at the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

33
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,430
When the old Tree Demon found me,

34
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,840
I was barely alive.

35
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,960
The demons in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp
said that I couldn’t be saved.

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,350
But he wouldn’t believe it.

37
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,990
He used his demon core

38
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,200
to warm my body for three days
and three nights.

39
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,600
Then I started to come back to life.

40
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,160
I asked him

41
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,790
why a demon like him saved a phoenix.

42
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,320
He said

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,600
he never left the Abyssal Ridge Swamp
in his life.

44
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,400
Now he was too old

45
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,960
to travel far.

46
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,160
He hoped I could

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,760
take him to travel around
the Three Realms

48
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,320
and see the world outside
when I grew up.

49
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,190
But one day,

50
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,990
the Immortals and the Demons started
a war above the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

51
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,550
and the creatures there were
plunged into an abyss of misery.

52
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,600
When Sen Yun and Jingyang were fighting,

53
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,120
I was hiding under the tree.

54
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,350
In order to protect me,

55
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,040
the old Tree Demon was burned
to death in the heavenly fire.

56
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,160
Help! Help!

57
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,480
Grandpa, no!

58
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,040
Grandpa!

59
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,550
Grandpa!

60
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,320
Grandpa, no!

61
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,830
Grandpa, no!

62
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,390
Grandpa!

63
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,080
Grandpa, no! Grandpa!

64
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,880
Grandpa!

65
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,990
Grandpa...

66
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,880
Grandpa...

67
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,430
Fengran.

68
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,710
I’m willing to pay for

69
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,990
my brother’s mistake.

70
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
The old man’s body and spirit
were exterminated.

71
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,670
How are you going to pay for it?

72
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,880
I know my life can’t

73
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,080
undo the damage my brother caused.

74
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,990
But if you want my life,

75
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,080
I won’t complain.

76
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,230
You are you.

77
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,880
Jingyang is Jingyang.

78
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,550
I will end my feud with him

79
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,830
in person.

80
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,390
Please rest assured.

81
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,800
I will take good care of Fengran.

82
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,390
Old man.

83
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,760
Don’t worry.

84
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,390
One day,

85
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,360
I will make the person who killed you

86
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,550
pay for what he did.

87
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,880
Old Dragon.

88
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,430
How dare you treat me like this!

89
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,800
I’ll flatten

90
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,990
your Abyssal Ridge Swamp!

91
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,990
You led the heavenly soldiers

92
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,510
and occupied our land
of spiritual power,

93
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,640
making me cultivate myself
in these disgusting methods.

94
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,800
Today,

95
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,670
I will suck all the spiritual power

96
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,830
out of you and those heavenly soldiers.

97
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,390
You immortals deserve it!

98
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,710
My Lord, the immortals are here.

99
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,920
I advise you to release me now.

100
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,220
If my father comes here,

101
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,600
he will take your life.

102
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,600
You talk too much.

103
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,990
Who are they?

104
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,550
My Lord,

105
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,670
they are four young people.

106
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,950
Judging by their cultivation,
they should be upper immortals.

107
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,510
Bring them here.

108
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,990
I want to meet them.

109
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:53,720
Yes.

110
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
You guys, come with me.

111
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,640
Yes.

112
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,950
Have you turned down the marriage?

113
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,510
Don’t worry.

114
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,760
I’ve figured out a way to make
the Heavenly Emperor take it back.

115
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,480
The Four Seas and the Three Realms

116
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,080
all know that the Heavenly Emperor
granted you a marriage.

117
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,880
Can you turn it down that easily?

118
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,830
Jingyang and a group of
heavenly soldiers

119
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,390
went missing here not long ago.

120
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,950
Jingyang’s spiritual power is not weak.

121
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
But he just vanished.

122
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,670
Jingjian and I speculate

123
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,200
that he was caught by
the Three-head Fire Dragon.

124
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,800
So I volunteered to come.

125
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,320
The Heavenly Emperor said

126
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,200
that if I could bring Jingyang back,

127
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,160
he would promise me one request.

128
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,270
By that time,

129
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,550
I’ll ask him to take the order back.

130
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,080
I feel a little uncomfortable.

131
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,710
Why?

132
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,510
Do you still remember what happened
in the Xuanjing Palace?

133
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,800
Do you know

134
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,080
why Fengran killed the Third Prince
of the Demons, Sen Yun?

135
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,510
Even if Sen Yun deserved death,

136
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,430
he is still the Third Prince
of my Xuanjing Palace,

137
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,160
and my... favorite son!

138
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,240
During the battle between
the Immortals and the Demons,

139
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,240
Sen Yun and Jingyang accidentally

140
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
killed the old Tree Demon
when they were fighting.

141
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,680
In order to avenge
the old Tree Demon’s death,

142
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,510
Fengran set herself against
the Immortals and the Demons.

143
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,440
She can’t wait to take Jingyang’s life.

144
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,270
But now you are going to save Jingyang

145
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,680
and use it as a bargaining chip
to turn down the marriage.

146
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,440
I just wanted to break it off
as soon as possible.

147
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,830
I didn’t know Jingyang

148
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,950
killed Fengran’s family.

149
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,270
I was thoughtless.

150
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,600
It’s not your fault.

151
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,120
I didn’t tell you before.

152
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,480
No matter what,

153
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,600
we can’t ignore Fengran’s feelings.

154
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,710
Let me figure out another way.

155
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,120
What about you?

156
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,950
Why are you here?

157
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
Fengran said that there were signs
of a Demigod becoming a God here.

158
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,070
I thought Boxuan might be here.

159
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,070
So we came here.

160
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,560
Who are so bold

161
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,830
as to break into
the Abyssal Ridge Swamp?

162
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,600
You toyboy.

163
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,440
Are you the rescuers of the immortals
from the Heavenly Palace?

164
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,800
What immortals?

165
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,800
Who are you?

166
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,160
We are the subordinates of
the Three-head Fire Dragon.

167
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,160
Are you afraid now?

168
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,120
The Three-head Fire Dragon captured
the immortals from the Heavenly Palace.

169
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,920
Take them both.

170
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,920
Yes.

171
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,600
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

172
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,710
It’s the Spirit Gathering Array.

173
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,510
The Three-head Fire Dragon
goes against the heavenly principles

174
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,390
and sucked the spiritual power
of the heavenly soldiers.

175
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,070
The evil power is strong here.

176
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,310
I’m afraid those from
the Heavenly Palace have been killed.

177
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,040
We underestimated the power
of the Three-head Fire Dragon.

178
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,560
I’m afraid he will become a God soon.

179
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,710
You are going to die.

180
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,680
And you are still concerned with
love and romance?

181
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,270
What a pair of brave lovebirds.

182
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,390
You sucked so much spiritual power
from those heavenly soldiers.

183
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,750
Aren’t you afraid of
the Heavenly Emperor’s punishment?

184
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,830
After Lord of Dragon becomes a God,

185
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,440
your Heavenly Palace

186
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,040
will be ours sooner or later.

187
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,870
A few immortals mean nothing.

188
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,630
Hurry.

189
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,000
- Come on.
- Go.

190
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,680
Qingmu?

191
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,560
Jingyang?

192
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,680
Well, Jingyang.

193
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,040
You were also caught by the Three-head
Fire Dragon as the sacrifice.

194
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,390
Heaven is fair.

195
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,360
You took advantage of your identity
as a prince of the Heavenly Palace

196
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,600
and took my fiancée from me.

197
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,630
I’m going to kill you today.

198
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,800
Chanyu, go to report to His Lordship.

199
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,560
Tell him

200
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,000
that we have caught
the immortals who broke in.

201
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,510
Ask His Lordship to come back
for the sacrifice ceremony.

202
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,120
I’ll stay here.

203
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,240
Yes. Let’s go.

204
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Either you die or I die today.

205
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,000
Your Highness.

206
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,390
It was an imperative situation.

207
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,040
Please forgive me.

208
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,480
With your spiritual power,

209
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,190
will you be afraid of those pawns?

210
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,800
I know you just wanted to embarrass me.

211
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,950
After I return to the Heavenly Palace,

212
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,750
I will tell my mother about this

213
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,440
and punish you for offending me.

214
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
You are already in such bad shape.

215
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,630
But you are still so imposing.

216
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,710
It’s not easy.

217
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,680
Qingmu.

218
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,560
Father has betrothed Jingzhao to you.

219
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,310
Why are you still with her?

220
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,190
Do you want a wife
and a concubine to serve you

221
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,950
so that you can enjoy the happiness
of having two women?

222
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,390
Why should we save this kind of person?

223
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,600
Just let him be the sacrifice
of the Fire Dragon.

224
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,240
Qingmu.

225
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,480
You...!

226
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,390
It won’t work.

227
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,600
The Three-head Fire Dragon
has reached the peak as a Demigod.

228
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
You can’t break his barrier.

229
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,390
We need to figure out a way to get out.

230
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,870
I have an idea.

231
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,070
But Prince Jingyang
will suffer a little.

232
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,870
You don’t get along well
with my Qingchi Palace.

233
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,190
If you want us to save you,

234
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,600
this is the only way.

235
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:08,920
What is it?

236
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,070
The Three-head Fire Dragon
is about to become a God.

237
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,240
I think he has been

238
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,510
waiting for his thunder trial.

239
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,160
If there are thunder strikes
in the cave now,

240
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,830
the Three-head Fire Dragon will believe

241
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,480
that it’s the thunder trial
for him to become a God.

242
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,310
In order to enter the cave
to pass the trial,

243
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,190
he will open the barrier first.

244
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,920
I guess the prestigious
Princess Jingyang

245
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,360
hasn’t received the blessing from a God.

246
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,750
You are so lucky.

247
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,800
That’s a great honor.

248
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,750
I wouldn’t give my blessing
to any ordinary person.

249
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,270
Fengran.

250
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,480
Do you remember you once saved...

251
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,600
The thunder trial?

252
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,000
I’ve been waiting for this day

253
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,710
for tens of thousands of years.

254
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:45,950
Thunder strikes?

255
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,560
How could there be thunder strikes
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp?

256
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,160
Is the Three-head Fire Dragon
going to become a God?

257
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,270
No, it’s Houchi.

258
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,460
Not good.

259
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,040
My blessing contains
the charm of heaven and earth.

260
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,000
You must cherish it.

261
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,310
The first blessing is,

262
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,560
may Your Highness

263
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,920
marry a violent and ruthless
beautiful wife soon.

264
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,870
Looks like you really like my blessing.

265
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,120
The second blessing is,

266
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,120
may Your Highness
be surrounded by your children

267
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,000
and may you never have peace
in your family.

268
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,440
As for the third blessing...

269
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,190
It’s not a festal occasion

270
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,190
for Your Highness to prostrate yourself.

271
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,040
I won’t feel at ease taking it.

272
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,750
But I won’t take advantage of
Your Highness.

273
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,600
As for the third blessing,

274
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,310
I’ll just return your prostration.

275
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,830
Thousands of years ago,

276
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,040
the flame flowed down

277
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,600
and the old Tree Demon was burned alive.

278
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Compared with what you did

279
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,160
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp that day,

280
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,830
what I did today

281
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,440
is too merciful for you.

282
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,310
Who are you?

283
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,310
How dare you tease me!

284
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,630
Qingmu from the North Sea
greets Lord of Dragon.

285
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,470
The Taicang Spear?

286
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,990
How could you have the Taicang Spear?

287
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,990
Leave the Spear

288
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,160
and I can spare your lives.

289
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,160
Three-head Fire Dragon.

290
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,720
You sucked the spiritual power
of the immortals to enhance your evil power.

291
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,080
You don’t deserve
to touch the Taicang Spear.

292
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,230
Just a few immortals.

293
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,870
What’s the big deal
that I swallowed them?

294
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,350
However,

295
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,750
I’ve shown you a way out.

296
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,560
If you don’t take it,

297
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,720
then you can’t blame me.

298
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,470
After I kill you,

299
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,470
the Spear will still be mine.

300
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,440
You little girl.

301
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,870
Your spiritual power is not that strong.

302
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,270
But your physique is quite special.

303
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,630
You two

304
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,990
will be my sumptuous meal for today.

305
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,230
Houchi.

306
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,960
Did he hurt you?

307
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,800
I’m fine.

308
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,870
It’s you.

309
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,920
How dare you fight with me!

310
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,440
Now you have no one to protect you.

311
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,960
Lord of Dragon.

312
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,320
Houchi is my best friend.

313
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,350
I must take her out safely today.

314
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,160
Please be merciful and let us go.

315
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,720
Houchi?

316
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,870
The daughter of Gu Jun.

317
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
The fourth God in the Heavenly Realm.

318
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,840
You made friends with your enemy.

319
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,720
I’m quite impressed.

320
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,160
Jingjian.

321
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,390
Why are you with this demon?

322
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,870
From today, the Heavenly Palace and
the Qingchi Palace are at daggers drawn.

323
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,560
Jingyang.

324
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,080
Watch your words.

325
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,150
Jingjian,

326
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,350
is this the secret of
the Heavenly Palace you talked about?

327
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:07,960
Step aside.

328
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,960
Fengran.

329
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,390
We’re here to save Jingyang

330
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,590
because Qingmu needs to
use my brother’s life

331
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,080
to break off the engagement
with Jingzhao.

332
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,110
If you kill him,

333
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,680
Qingmu can’t break it off.

334
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,440
What should Houchi do then?

335
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,080
Fengran.

336
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,270
I didn’t know

337
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,680
that Jingyang killed your family.

338
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,920
I feel guilty.

339
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,110
If you want to
take revenge on him today,

340
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,720
I won’t stop you.

341
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,560
You ungrateful brat.

342
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,630
The Heavenly Palace treats you well.

343
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,720
But you take the side of that demon!

344
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,200
Little girl.

345
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,320
Don’t forget

346
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,960
the old Tree Demon

347
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,440
was burned alive by Jingyang.

348
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Have you forgotten
the vengeance for his death

349
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,960
and become a lackey of
the Heavenly Palace?

350
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
That’s impossible.

351
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,440
Good.

352
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,720
If you wipe out these immortals for me,

353
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,350
I promise

354
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,870
I will let you skin Jingyang alive
in person

355
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,320
and break his soul into pieces.

356
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,200
Houchi.

357
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,080
Don’t let Fengran keep making mistakes.

358
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,630
Fengran.

359
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
No matter what you do,

360
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,320
I’ll support you.

361
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,200
One day,

362
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,270
I’ll take vengeance on him in person.

363
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,040
But today,

364
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,630
I have to take Houchi away.

365
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,510
Wrong choice.

366
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,630
I’ll show you what I got.

367
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,560
I’ll eat you down

368
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,200
and become a God.

369
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,440
You want me to pass the trial now.

370
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,110
How blind you are!

371
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,800
Let’s go now!

372
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
What are you waiting for?

373
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,840
After he becomes a God,

374
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,920
none of us can escape.

375
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,040
Once the Three-head Fire Dragon
becomes a God,

376
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,870
the Baili Palace in the Abyssal
Ridge Swamp will be destroyed.

377
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,230
Houchi is right.

378
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,510
By his very nature,

379
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,870
he will go on a murderous rampage.

380
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,200
I’m afraid even the Heavenly Emperor
and Queen can hardly kill him.

381
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,840
Houchi,

382
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,080
do you want to stop him
from becoming a God?

383
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,200
No, it’s too dangerous.

384
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,750
Fengran, leave with Houchi first.

385
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,080
I’m gonna help him.

386
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,160
You’d better stay here.

387
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,750
Your spiritual power
is too weak to help them.

388
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,270
He failed to become a God.

389
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,720
He won’t let us go.

390
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,390
Fengran,

391
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,110
you grew up here.

392
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,350
Is there any other place we can hide?

393
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,080
There is a place

394
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,320
even the Three-head Fire Dragon
doesn’t dare to go.

395
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:27,960
Come with me.

396
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,270
Today,

397
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,680
none of you can escape!

398
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,510
Fengran, is this where
the Destruction War took place?

399
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
What Destruction War?

400
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,680
It’s said that 60,000 years ago,

401
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,870
Demon God Tianqi set up the Destruction
Formation in the Lower Realm,

402
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,160
attempting to engulf the Three Realms

403
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,160
and become the God of Chaos.

404
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,630
True God Bai Jue led other Gods
to the Lower Realm and killed him.

405
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,080
That’s how the catastrophe
was prevented.

406
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,840
That’s right.

407
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,320
This is the place where the Demon God
attempted to destroy the world.

408
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,870
I grew up in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

409
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,080
Neither the immortal nor the demon
dare set foot in this place,

410
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,590
not even the Three-head Fire Dragon.

411
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,230
There is the True God
guarding in this mist.

412
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,870
We will die if we stay here.

413
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,040
Let’s go out.

414
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,320
You can go out by yourself.

415
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,630
The Three-head Fire Dragon
is waiting to kill you

416
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,560
at the gate.

417
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,160
Don’t panic.

418
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,630
Maybe I know how to handle it.

419
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,200
Before we left, Lord Donghua said
that your divine weapon

420
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,750
could cope with the remaining influence
of the formation.

421
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,990
I didn’t expect
that it could be used here.

422
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,230
The Land of Destruction?

423
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,320
It’s just a broken altar.

424
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,510
What’s so scary?

425
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,720
It was still easily taken care of
by our immortal.

426
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,160
A second ago, someone was too scared
to think clearly.

427
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,200
He even wanted to leave here.

428
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,230
Why don’t you leave now?

429
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,270
- You...!
- Jingyang.

430
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,440
Ease up a little.

431
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,560
Jingjian.

432
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,270
What kind of drug
did this witch give you?

433
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,510
Why do you protect her like that?

434
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,040
Fengran.

435
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
My brother is the prince
in the Heavenly Palace

436
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,440
and the future lord of the Feng Clan.

437
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,630
You are just a demon
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

438
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,960
You don’t even deserve
to be a maid of him.

439
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,960
Just give up pestering him.

440
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,590
Jingyang.

441
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,390
Fengran.

442
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,510
Jingyang got injured.

443
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Don’t take it personally.

444
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,800
The prince in the Heavenly Palace.
The lord of the Feng Clan.

445
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,920
I should have thought of it.

446
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,720
There is no difference
between you and Jingyang.

447
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,870
I didn’t kill him today

448
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,920
for the sake of Houchi and Qingmu.

449
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,230
But I will kill him in person one day.

450
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,990
If you dare to stop me at that time,

451
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,750
don’t blame me for being ruthless then.

452
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,680
Jingjian.

453
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,320
There are so many good girls
in the Three Realms.

454
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,470
Why do you have to...?

455
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,390
Stop it, Jingyang.

456
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,440
Fine.

457
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,080
If Fengran comes to
take my life one day,

458
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,200
what will you do?

459
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,440
If there is such a day,

460
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,960
I will use my life

461
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,230
to end your grudge.

462
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,720
Jingyang’s fault

463
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,800
still implicated Jingjian.

464
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,920
I don’t see a future
for him and Fengran.

465
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,470
Jingjian and Fengran...

466
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,440
He treats Fengran very differently.

467
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,800
Is there any way

468
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,870
to end the feud?

469
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,960
I’m afraid it’s hard.
Jingyang killed her family.

470
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,750
I know Fengran well.

471
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,200
Once she makes a decision,

472
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,990
she won’t change it even facing death.

473
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,510
Qingmu.

474
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,230
We owe it to Fengran today.

475
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,160
Shanggu.

476
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,580
Shanggu?

477
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,230
What’s wrong?

478
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,840
I saw some strange images.

479
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,200
What did you see?

480
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,440
I saw...

481
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,750
Then you will understand

482
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,510
what Bai Jue’s remnant soul said
was true

483
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,680
when you were on Mount Lookout that day.

484
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,630
You should have been
the most respected one in the world.

485
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,230
Nothing.

486
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,160
I just feel she is very sad.

487
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,470
She seems to be waiting for something.

488
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,350
Here are the remains
of the battle of the Gods.

489
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,840
This stone statue must be
a Goddess in the God Realm.

490
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,560
Although she is dead,

491
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,110
her thoughts are enough to move people.

492
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,280
You are still alive?! Prepare to die!

493
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,920
Be careful.

494
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,280
Fengran, take Houchi away.

495
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,110
Let’s go!

496
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,920
Are you all right?

497
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:22,960
I’m fine.

498
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,040
Jingyang!

499
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,350
Go!

500
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,800
The power of the True God.

501
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,080
You can actually master
the spiritual power of True God Bai Jue!

502
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,590
I’ll cut your divine vessels

503
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,080
if you don’t leave now.

504
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,920
You will never be able to
run wild again.

505
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,470
Qingmu.

506
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Qingmu, are you all right?

507
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,040
I’m fine.

508
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,750
Now you have saved Jingyang.

509
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,080
Go back to the Heavenly Palace now

510
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,320
and break off the engagement
with Jingzhao.

511
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,080
Fengran.

512
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,840
I won’t use Jingyang
as a bargaining chip.

513
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,750
I’ll figure out another way to solve it.

514
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,230
Tell me what the other way is.

515
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,840
I understand the good intention
of you and Houchi.

516
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
I’ll take revenge on him
sooner or later.

517
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,590
But that can wait.

518
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,280
Being used as a bargaining chip

519
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,630
is a good deed of Jingyang.

520
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,440
Since the Heavenly Emperor
has promised you,

521
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,920
you should go back
to the Heavenly Palace

522
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,590
and turn down the marriage.

523
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,750
Only you and Houchi
have no worries about the future

524
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,630
can I feel at ease.

525
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,840
Since Lady Fengran said that,

526
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:49,920
Qingmu,

527
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,390
don’t refuse it.

528
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,110
Fengran.

529
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,350
I’ll remember what you did for us today.

530
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,680
Thank you, Fengran.

531
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,870
Houchi, there is no need for that
between us.

532
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,710
As long as you two are happy,

533
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,110
it will be the best thing
you can do for me.

534
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,200
Houchi.

535
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,680
Go back to Qilian Mountains
with Fengran first.

536
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,160
After I report this
to the Heavenly Emperor

537
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,990
and break off the engagement
with Jingzhao,

538
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
I’ll go back to the Qingchi Palace
to see you.

539
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,800
I don’t trust the Heavenly Palace.

540
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:16,920
I’ll go with you.

541
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:18,470
No!

542
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,230
Qingmu is going there
to break off the engagement.

543
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,920
If you go with him, the Queen of Heaven
won’t tolerate you.

544
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,920
This is between me and Qingmu.

545
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,280
I can’t let him bear it alone.

546
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,440
Houchi.

547
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,870
My father is not unreasonable.

548
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,440
Now you have saved Jingyang,

549
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,200
he will keep his promise.

550
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,960
I didn’t save Jingyang
to break off the engagement.

551
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,200
If it weren’t for the cruel
Three-head Fire Dragon, I wouldn’t

552
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,590
get myself involved in the disputes
between the Immortals and the Demons.

553
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,280
Considering what Jingyang did back then,

554
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,230
I should have killed him.

555
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,430
There is no reason to save him.

556
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,230
Never mind.

557
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,640
You are not Jingyang.

558
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,910
You are also implicated by him.

559
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,710
I shouldn’t have given you
that attitude.

560
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,640
Fengran, go back to
Qilian Mountains first.

561
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,280
I just said no.

562
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,230
Those in the Heavenly Palace
are cunning.

563
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,470
I can’t let you go there by yourself.

564
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,470
Before you two

565
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,560
have solved your problem,

566
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,910
I won’t cause you any trouble.

567
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,950
Fine.

568
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,280
In this case,

569
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,910
let’s go back to
the Heavenly Palace together.

570
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,470
Three-head Fire Dragon.

571
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
I gave you the purple fire.

572
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,640
How did you fail to become a God?

573
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,710
If it weren’t for Qingmu’s

574
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,120
sneak attack on me
while I was about to become a God

575
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,600
and he let the divine thunder
strike one of my heads,

576
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,950
I would have become a God now!

577
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,950
It must be because you coveted
Jingyang’s spiritual power

578
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,280
and brought those immortals there.

579
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,670
How precious is
the divine flame of Master.

580
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,600
You wasted his efforts.

581
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,750
Becoming a God is risky anyway.

582
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,950
You can’t convict me of another crime

583
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,560
just because I failed to become a God.

584
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,280
Your Majesty, please punish me.

585
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,080
Master thinks highly of you.

586
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,990
It’s not my turn to punish you.

587
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,120
I just feel that it’s a pity.

588
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,080
Your Majesty, don’t feel pity about it.

589
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,280
Although I failed to become a God,

590
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,400
that brat didn’t get anything good.

591
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,470
He inhaled my dragon breath.

592
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,120
He is just an immortal.

593
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,430
The dragon breath will invade
his spiritual veins sooner or later.

594
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,670
The North Sea Lord

595
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,750
only has a few more days to live.

596
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,190
Qingmu caught your dragon breath?

597
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,230
Three-head Fire Dragon.

598
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,600
Don’t tell Master about it.

599
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,400
Qingmu has never stepped in the fights
between demons and immortals all along.

600
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,560
We’ve never been enemies.

601
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,400
But he broke into the Demon Realm
and saved Fengran last time,

602
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,880
and he prevented you from
becoming a God this time.

603
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,950
Obviously, he has turned to
the Heavenly Palace.

604
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,990
He seems to have
an acquaintance with Master.

605
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,710
Now he is the owner
of the Taicang Spear,

606
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,280
the first immortal
in the Immortal Realm.

607
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,120
It’s good for us

608
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,950
if he dies.

609
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,430
Your Majesty, rest assured.

610
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,670
He prevented me from becoming a God.

611
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,560
I wish he died sooner.

612
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,640
I won’t tell Master about this.

613
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,990
The Zisong Hall is ahead.

614
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,400
Qingmu and I are going to
report to Father first.

615
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,230
You two rest here.

616
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,280
Just tell the Attendant Immortals

617
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,990
if you need anything.

618
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,750
Your Highness, don’t be humble.

619
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,710
It’s such an enchanting place.

620
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,150
What else can we need?

621
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,280
Let’s go.

622
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,430
Please.

623
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,750
There will be ample time.

624
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,470
I also went through a lot
when I pursued Houchi.

625
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,150
My own brother

626
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,230
killed her family.

627
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,430
I’m afraid it’s even harder
for Fengran and me to be together.

628
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,750
Don’t talk about me.

629
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,880
Since we entered the Heavenly Palace,

630
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,400
you seem to be worried.

631
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,750
What’s wrong?

632
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,880
I’m worried

633
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,400
that Houchi will get in trouble

634
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,600
in the Heavenly Palace.

635
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,560
Jingzhao is a little spoiled.

636
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,470
But if Father issues an edict,

637
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,280
she won’t keep pestering you.

638
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,280
Hope so.

639
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:49,950
Qingmu.

640
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,150
I hope you can do me a favor.

641
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,430
What is it?

642
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,750
Breaking off the engagement

643
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,670
will hurt Jingzhao.

644
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,280
She has always been arrogant and proud.

645
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,880
I hope you can show her enough respect

646
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,560
when you tell Father that you want to
break off the engagement.

647
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,230
Of course. Don’t worry.

648
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,120
Okay.

649
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:08,830
Let’s go.

650
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,640
Let’s go.

651
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:17,950
What’s wrong?

652
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:21,710
Nothing.

653
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,800
Let’s go.

654
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,150
I know there is a problem
between you two.

655
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,230
But Jingjian also means well.

656
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,510
Have you forgotten

657
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,400
that he also protected you
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp?

658
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,400
I’m grateful to him.

659
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,600
But he is still Jingyang’s brother.

660
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,400
I’d better keep some distance from him.

661
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
I think it’s her.

662
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,750
She should be Goddess Houchi.

663
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,510
Who is there?

664
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,360
What are you whispering?

665
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,040
Get out!

666
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,080
- Greetings, Goddess Houchi.
- Greetings, Goddess Houchi.

667
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,430
- Greetings, Lady Fengran.
- Greetings, Lady Fengran.

668
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,040
We are fairy maidens
in the Heavenly Palace.

669
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,040
What are you doing here
in broad daylight?

670
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,560
For your information, Lady Fengran,

671
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,120
we are here to see Goddess Houchi.

672
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,600
Me?

673
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,230
You are the supreme Goddess,

674
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
but you seldom appear in public
in the past 60,000 years.

675
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,190
Ridiculous!

676
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,080
What do you think Goddess Houchi is?
A rare beast?

677
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,400
Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you.

678
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,470
Please punish me.

679
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,560
Don’t panic.

680
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,080
Now that you came to see me,

681
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,430
and you have seen me,

682
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,510
you may leave
if there is no other business.
