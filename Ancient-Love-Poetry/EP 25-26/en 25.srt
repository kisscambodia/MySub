=Ancient Love Poetry=

2
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,340
=Episode 25=

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,730
Master,

4
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,650
aren’t we here to celebrate
the birthday of Her Grace?

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,930
Why don’t you go to her?

6
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,680
Zihan.

7
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,200
We’ve been in the Qingchi Palace
for a while.

8
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,810
There are still many things

9
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,650
I need to deal with
in the Demon Realm.

10
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,730
Let’s go back.

11
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,760
Sen Jian will take care of it.

12
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,600
We can stay in the Qingchi Palace
for a few more days.

13
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,240
Wu Huan knows who I am now.

14
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,330
The Demons will be prepared.

15
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,480
Your Highness, you brought these
heavenly soldiers to the Qingchi Palace.

16
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,520
What do you mean by that?

17
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,920
I’m here to bring the edict
from the Heavenly Palace

18
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,010
to Qingmu.

19
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,280
Please let us in, Lady Fengran.

20
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,690
Since it’s the edict from
the Heavenly Palace,

21
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,880
you can go inside, Your Highness.

22
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,970
But it’s the rule in the Qingchi Palace

23
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,920
that people with no fixed duties
are not allowed to enter.

24
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,450
The carriages should be left outside.

25
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,770
You shall wait here.

26
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,090
Yes.

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,480
Why did the Heavenly Palace
order you to come here

28
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,920
with heavenly soldiers?

29
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,600
To pressure or to provoke us?

30
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,440
Is it because you think you can
push us around in the Qingchi Palace?

31
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,050
If God Gu Jun were here,

32
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,720
how dare you run wild here?

33
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,600
Calm down first.

34
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,050
Let’s talk inside.

35
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,800
I won’t.

36
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,930
Then let me ask you,

37
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,410
where is Qingmu?

38
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,720
Answer my question first.

39
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,800
Why do you want to see Qingmu?

40
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,330
Fine.

41
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,210
Since you won’t tell me,

42
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,000
I’ll ask someone

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,640
to poke the hornet’s nest
in front of the mountain.

44
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,330
We will see how your
heavenly soldiers are going to suffer.

45
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,970
Do you have a problem with it?

46
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,080
I dare not.

47
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,970
It’s totally up to you

48
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,850
whether to poke the hornet’s nest
of the Qingchi Palace or not.

49
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,410
I’m glad you know it.

50
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,770
After you vent your anger,

51
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,330
I’ll give them some plasters

52
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,850
to relieve swelling and pain.

53
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,050
You are going to suffer

54
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,360
if the Queen of Heaven hears that.

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,330
As long as you are happy.

56
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,440
Forget it.

57
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,240
Those heavenly soldiers
just take orders.

58
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,570
They shouldn’t be punished.

59
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
The one who should be punished

60
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,410
is you.

61
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,240
Yes, yes.

62
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,360
After this is over,

63
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,520
you can do whatever you want to do.

64
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,490
You are even more stubborn

65
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,440
than stone.

66
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,690
Huan.

67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,330
What are you thinking about?

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,970
You’ve been unsettling recently.

69
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,000
What’s on your mind?

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,570
What else can I think about?

71
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,970
It’s still about our child.

72
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
Is it for Jingzhao’s marriage?

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,490
Jingjian has gone to see Qingmu.

74
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
He will give us his answer.

75
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,290
What if he rejects it?

76
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,690
Qingmu were close to Houchi

77
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,450
when they were on Mount Lookout.

78
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,570
I’m afraid

79
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,690
he has feelings for her.

80
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,320
Your Majesty!

81
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,850
Jingzhao is infatuated with him.

82
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,890
But if Qingmu doesn’t love her,

83
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,240
we should just let it go.

84
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,730
Looks like I worry too much about it.

85
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,450
What do you mean?

86
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,970
Qingmu has the Taicang Spear.

87
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,640
If he can’t be used by us,

88
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,320
I’m afraid it will remain
a distant possibility

89
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,290
to reopen the God Realm.

90
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,730
Just tell us.

91
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,080
What exactly does
the Heavenly Palace want?

92
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,970
Are you here to get back at Qingmu

93
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,170
for hurting your younger sister

94
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,360
on Mount Lookout?

95
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,410
Jingjian.

96
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,200
You and Qingmu are close friends.

97
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,450
You can’t just turn your back on him.

98
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,320
Fengran.

99
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,010
His Highness said

100
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,200
the edict from the Heavenly Palace
is for Qingmu.

101
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,360
Since it’s between them,

102
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,240
I don’t think we should intervene.

103
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,240
Don’t make it difficult for him.

104
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,760
Houchi.

105
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,080
I know it’s improper to bring
those heavenly soldiers,

106
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,010
but my mother ordered me to do it.

107
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,320
Since it’s her order,

108
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,570
you don’t need to explain it.

109
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,690
I don’t want

110
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,010
to hear a word about her.

111
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,360
What’s going on here?

112
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,690
Ask him.

113
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,010
Weren’t you on good terms yesterday?

114
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,890
Why are you being so cold today?

115
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,480
We are never on good terms.

116
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,480
Qingmu.

117
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,170
It’s serious. Don’t make jokes.

118
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,450
I need to have a word with you.

119
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,040
Just stay.

120
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,360
Fengran, let’s go somewhere else.

121
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,610
What puts you

122
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,040
in a spot like this?

123
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,760
You can be frank with me.

124
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,290
It’s not that I don’t want to be frank.

125
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,200
I just don’t think
you are going to like it.

126
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,970
My father and mother

127
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,170
want you to take over
the Commander in Chief

128
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,890
and command 100,000 heavenly soldiers.

129
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,640
Because of the Taicang Spear?

130
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,970
Yes.

131
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,170
I don’t like constraint.

132
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,920
You know it.

133
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,610
Just turn them down for me.

134
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,410
It would be easy
if that was the only reason I’m here.

135
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,970
I also brought Father’s edict to you.

136
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,130
He asked me to come to
the Qingchi Palace

137
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,480
and grant a marriage
to you and Jingzhao.

138
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,080
What did you say?

139
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,920
You know that Houchi is the one I...

140
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,170
Qingmu.

141
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,360
Calm down.

142
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,240
How would I not know your feelings?

143
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,730
It’s just...

144
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,730
You should take the whole situation
into consideration this time.

145
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,760
Although you were possessed by

146
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,200
the remnant soul of the True God

147
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,800
on Mount Lookout that day,

148
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,200
you still fought with me and Jingzhao.

149
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,010
Firstly, it undermined
the prestige of the Heavenly Palace.

150
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,200
Secondly,

151
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,040
others will be suspicious of
your true intentions.

152
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,730
Thirdly,

153
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,360
you also entered the Qingchi Palace.

154
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,640
So they want to tie me up
with this marriage?

155
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,410
Although my father and mother said

156
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,760
they just wanted you to come over
to the Heavenly Palace,

157
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,360
they ordered soldiers
to follow me here.

158
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,570
I’m afraid

159
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,480
it’s not just about
granting you a marriage.

160
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,290
To intimidate the Qingchi Palace?

161
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,240
If you turn them down,

162
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,520
I’m afraid...

163
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,320
The Heavenly Palace is overbearing.

164
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,360
There will only be more troubles.

165
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,800
I don’t mind it because I’m all alone.

166
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
But God Gu Jun is not here.

167
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,730
Houchi is in the Qingchi Palace
by herself.

168
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,200
She will be in danger.

169
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,240
I’ll go to the Heavenly Palace
with you now

170
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,480
to end this thing.

171
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,610
Okay.

172
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,480
Qingmu, are you really going to
hide it from Houchi

173
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,640
and not say goodbye to her?

174
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,570
I can’t let Houchi know it.

175
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,690
I need to go and return quickly

176
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,850
and turn down this marriage.

177
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,240
Qingmu!

178
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,410
I know it already.

179
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,730
I heard your conversation with Jingjian.

180
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,170
Don’t worry.

181
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,730
I won’t marry Jingzhao.

182
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,170
I’ll turn down the marriage granted by
the Heavenly Emperor right now.

183
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,810
Then what?

184
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,000
Then...

185
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,610
Then I’ll come back here

186
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,760
to protect you and stay with you.

187
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,490
I won’t leave you again.

188
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,000
You also know it’s not that simple.

189
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,000
We just got together.

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,290
I don’t want you to leave,

191
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,490
but I don’t want you
to be in danger either.

192
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,170
You must be

193
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,410
cautious in your words
and deeds this time.

194
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,760
The Heavenly Emperor

195
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,250
only wants your Taicang Spear.

196
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,520
As for the marriage,

197
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,610
he can’t tie you up.

198
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,410
He would be like a bandit
in the lower realm in that way.

199
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,930
But just in case,

200
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,520
if he is really going to hurt you,

201
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,850
don’t act recklessly.

202
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:40,970
You still got me.

203
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:42,850
Are these words

204
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,170
really from Goddess Houchi

205
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:45,970
who has always despised me?

206
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,680
And also,

207
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,250
when you are in the Heavenly Palace,

208
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,250
you mustn’t look at Jingzhao

209
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,610
or talk to her.

210
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,730
You are mine now.

211
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,520
If there is any rumor coming out,

212
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,050
do you know the consequences?

213
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,080
Of course.

214
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,880
Not to mention Jingzhao,

215
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,290
I won’t look at any woman.

216
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,640
When did you two get together?

217
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,410
I’m really happy for you.

218
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,880
Houchi.

219
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,730
You and Qingmu truly love each other.

220
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,370
It’s really enviable.

221
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,410
Don’t worry.

222
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,760
After we arrive at the Heavenly Palace,

223
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,410
I’ll defend Qingmu

224
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,520
and remind him all the time,

225
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,520
helping him express
his thoughts to Father.

226
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

227
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,610
No need to call him “Your Highness”.

228
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,810
Just say his name.

229
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,050
Don’t worry.

230
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,930
I’ll be back soon.

231
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:47,880
Let’s go.

232
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,290
Master.

233
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,290
I’ve followed your instructions

234
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,520
and secretly summoned the demons.

235
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,520
As long as Wu Huan takes any move,

236
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,250
we will declare war on
the Immortals immediately.

237
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,170
It’s no hurry.

238
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,000
Muguang wants to find
the Purple Moon Whip through you

239
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,410
to reopen the God Realm.

240
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,490
Wu Huan is not that bold

241
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,640
to start a war between
the Immortals and the Demons

242
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,850
and enrage Muguang.

243
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,730
I was going to help you become a God.

244
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,200
But after some thought,

245
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,080
I still think it’s improper.

246
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,520
You are the Demon King.

247
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,520
If you become a God on top of that,

248
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,170
I’m afraid it will attract
the fear of the Immortals.

249
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,250
Wu Huan might take that opportunity

250
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,930
to start a war between
the Immortals and the Demons.

251
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,560
Then it’s not worth it.

252
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,970
You’ve done a lot to protect the Demons

253
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,250
for tens of thousands of years.

254
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,560
I understand it.

255
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,000
I remember

256
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,930
the Three-head Fire Dragon
in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp

257
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,520
has strong spiritual power.

258
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,810
If we help him become a God,

259
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,170
firstly,

260
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,760
we can threaten the Immortals.

261
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:23,930
Secondly,

262
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,680
we won’t cause much trouble.

263
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,520
This is a ray of pure spiritual power

264
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,320
I drew from the Purple Moon.

265
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,640
Take it to Three-head Fire Dragon

266
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,050
and help him become a God.

267
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,880
If we have one more God
among the Demons,

268
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,440
I think Wu Huan dare not act rashly.

269
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,170
Yes, Master.

270
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,610
Greetings to Your Highness.

271
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,930
North Sea Lord does have
an extraordinary bearing.

272
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,000
No wonder Jingzhao likes you.

273
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,120
Don’t feel constrained.

274
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,250
Have a seat.

275
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,410
Thank you, Your Highness.

276
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,170
I heard from Jingjian

277
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,120
that you are here today

278
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,490
because you have something important
to tell me.

279
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,880
Your Highness.

280
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,200
I’m here

281
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,250
for my marriage with Princess Jingzhao.

282
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,730
Marriage is too important
to be treated carelessly.

283
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,370
I don’t have

284
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,320
any affections for Princess Jingzhao.

285
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,200
There is someone else I love.

286
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,370
I won’t accept this marriage.

287
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,410
Please take back your order.

288
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,200
Since Jingjian is willing to
make friends with you,

289
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,880
I guess you are a smart person.

290
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,410
This marriage is
not just about affections.

291
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,810
Do you understand?

292
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,050
Yes, I do.

293
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,880
You understand it
and you still turn it down.

294
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,250
You are a young hero indeed.

295
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,490
High-spirited and vigorous.

296
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,730
But you are still too young.

297
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,120
You are impulsive

298
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,680
and you forget to weigh
the pros and cons.

299
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,120
Your Highness.

300
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,560
I’ve made up my mind.

301
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,850
It’s not an impulsive decision.

302
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,320
I’ll just forget

303
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,370
what you said today.

304
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,520
Go back and think about it.

305
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,080
Fengnyu.

306
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,490
Walk North Sea Lord out.

307
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,810
Excuse me, Your Highness.

308
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,640
Mother didn’t get mad at you.

309
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,490
That’s strange.

310
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,970
I also think it’s strange.

311
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,880
Today I bluntly turned her down

312
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,760
and told her I love someone else.

313
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,170
But the Queen of Heaven
didn’t get angry

314
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,000
or allow me to turn the marriage down.

315
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,810
I really can’t figure out
what she is thinking.

316
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,080
Mother has always
loved Jingzhao the most.

317
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,080
Could it be...

318
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,290
...that she doesn’t want to
see Jingzhao sad

319
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,440
and she thinks there is room
for maneuver?

320
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,250
In this case,

321
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,370
I might as well give the Taicang Spear
to the Queen of Heaven.

322
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,050
The Spear can recognize its owner.

323
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,560
Do you think you can
give it away that easily?

324
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,880
Besides,

325
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,370
such a big thing happened

326
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,930
on Mount Lookout that day.

327
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,560
It’s got the True God
and the Devine Beast involved.

328
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,730
If you really want to give it away,

329
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,880
you need to find an excuse.

330
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,610
In my opinion,

331
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,170
we need to give the matter
further thought.

332
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,560
Further thought?!

333
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,680
I’m afraid if I don’t solve it now,

334
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,050
Houchi will only get
more worried and upset.

335
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,560
They all say that a grown-up girl
can’t be kept at home.

336
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,320
I think

337
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,850
you are the one who can’t be kept.

338
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,730
You are really clingy.

339
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,680
I’m clingy indeed.

340
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,610
Why am I telling you that?

341
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,610
All right.

342
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,680
I’ll wait for a while.

343
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,930
Although I’m not in the Qingchi Palace,

344
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,560
I have a lot of ways to be with her

345
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,850
and make her think of me every day.

346
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,440
Have you heard about it?

347
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,290
I begged Father and Mother for so long

348
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,930
and they finally agreed
to let me marry Qingmu.

349
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,170
But Qingmu turned it down.

350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,370
As the Princess of the Heavenly Palace,

351
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,730
I condescend to marry him,

352
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,320
yet I still can’t move him.

353
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,170
What is it that I’m not
good enough for him?

354
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,610
My sister is good enough

355
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
for any man.

356
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,810
But love is the only thing

357
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,370
that has no criteria.

358
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,520
It can’t be forced.

359
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,560
It can’t be forced...

360
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,490
Jingjian.

361
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,080
Be frank with me.

362
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,250
When Mother sent you
to the Qingchi Palace that day,

363
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,370
you didn’t want to go at all.

364
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,370
Is Houchi the one

365
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,640
whom Qingmu has feelings for?

366
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,290
I knew it.

367
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,080
That woman in the Qingchi Palace
must have bewitched him!

368
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,410
Jingzhao.

369
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,370
Jingzhao!

370
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,170
Jingzhao!

371
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,810
Clear my mind

372
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,560
and let the energy flow.

373
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,080
I got a great book.

374
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,640
Merry Immortal and Pretty Lady.

375
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,610
Their love

376
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,250
is heart-stirring and moving.

377
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,970
Houchi, take a look.

378
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,080
Let me try again.

379
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,320
And this one.

380
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,050
Fox Tantalizes the Immortal.

381
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,370
It’s a love story of an immortal
and a demon.

382
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,400
It’s really interesting.

383
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,970
Houchi, I promise you will like it.

384
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,680
Fengran.

385
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,320
Recently, you’ve been bothering me

386
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,280
every time I cultivate myself.

387
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,280
Is there nothing else you can do

388
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,400
in the Qingchi Palace?

389
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,200
It was my fault before.

390
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,440
I only focused on your cultivation.

391
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,850
I didn’t expect you

392
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,490
to be so boring and dull now.

393
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,970
You just fell in love.

394
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,850
You need some skills.

395
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,890
Let me explain it to you.

396
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,730
You should keep these books.

397
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,730
I have other things to do.

398
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,530
Houchi.

399
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,320
Let’s share the books together.

400
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,080
Just read them.

401
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,560
She would meditate
at the bottom of the pool

402
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,970
or cultivate herself every time
she gets something on her mind.

403
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,610
I don’t know whom she got it from.

404
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,680
Looks like I have to
use the second trick.

405
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,080
Why do you want to see me

406
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,280
in such an urgency?

407
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,970
Well, Your Grace.

408
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,440
I know our Qingchi Palace

409
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,320
usually doesn’t receive guests.

410
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,920
But think about it,

411
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,440
when the holiday comes, or when it’s
someone’s birthday or any baby is born,

412
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,560
you’ll have to

413
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,320
make social visits.

414
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,730
What’s more,

415
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,890
you will be in charge of
the Qingchi Palace one day.

416
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,280
Why don’t we

417
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,920
start with identifying all those people?

418
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,970
Why are you bringing this up
so suddenly?

419
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,440
Don’t worry about that.

420
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,080
This is the first disciple of
Lord Jinyao on Mount Nanxian,

421
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,200
Lady Yuehua.

422
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,280
Your Grace,

423
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,200
do you know her?

424
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,040
I don’t care whether she is
Yuehua or Xinghua.

425
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,130
She looks like a one or two
thousand years old junior.

426
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Why should I know her?

427
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,160
Your Grace.

428
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,890
You must not underestimate this woman.

429
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,680
She is gentle

430
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,650
and elegant.

431
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,730
She also has a great reputation
all over the world.

432
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,800
The most important thing is

433
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,680
she declared one hundred years ago

434
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,560
that she would only marry Qingmu.

435
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,650
Do you feel threatened?

436
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,650
And this one.

437
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,920
The Princess Royal
of the Dragon King of the West Sea.

438
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,850
I heard that she and Qingmu

439
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,730
knew each other early in the North Sea.

440
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,320
She claims that they are
childhood sweethearts.

441
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,680
It is inevitable that you will meet her.

442
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,130
You must be on your guard.

443
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,080
Chang Que.

444
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,280
What’s this about?

445
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,080
Your Grace.

446
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,610
To be honest,

447
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,920
before Lord Qingmu left,

448
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
he asked us to find some ways

449
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,080
to make you happy

450
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,970
or make you think of him.

451
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
We can’t let you
worry about him too much.

452
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,680
And you can’t

453
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,130
hold everything back to yourself.

454
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,200
What kind of method is this?

455
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,200
You are making me

456
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,040
flustered and anxious.

457
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,080
And I’m feeling very insecure right now.

458
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,920
Your Grace.

459
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,440
It’s all my fault.

460
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,610
I swear

461
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,560
I won’t upset you

462
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,040
with these portraits again.

463
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,130
Fengran, come in.

464
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,040
Stop eavesdropping on us.

465
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,680
I mean,

466
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,040
there are all kinds of
things Qingmu can do.

467
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,530
But he prepared those portraits
of beauties for you.

468
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:22,970
I mean,

469
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,040
what is he thinking?

470
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,080
He is dumb but cute.

471
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
He doesn’t know how to please girls.

472
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,280
Then what do you like about him?

473
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,440
I like his integrity and sincerity.

474
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,610
He is stupid, cute, and impulsive.

475
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,130
I like everything about him.

476
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,800
Why am I telling you this?

477
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
My good lady.

478
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,530
You finally have some energy.

479
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,730
Since Qingmu left,

480
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,610
you’ve been frowning all day.

481
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,130
You barely smile.

482
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,440
Do you see my belly?

483
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,850
I ate two steamed buns today.

484
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,920
I haven’t digested them yet.

485
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,920
Do you know why?

486
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,730
Why?

487
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,650
Because I’m feeling peaceful

488
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,970
like still water.

489
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,320
Your Grace, something happened!

490
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,200
Jingzhao came to our Qingchi Palace!

491
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,560
She handled herself over.

492
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,850
I’m going to teach her a lesson.

493
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,970
Looks like you are filled with anger.

494
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,400
Is this how peaceful you are

495
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,320
like still water?

496
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,680
I’m peaceful.

497
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,280
I’m very peaceful.

498
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,920
Your Grace.

499
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,080
Are you going to meet her like this?

500
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,370
Go back to my room with me.

501
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,680
Yes.

502
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,380
(Qingchi Palace)

503
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,440
I’ve been waiting for some time.

504
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,160
Why hasn’t anyone come out to greet me?

505
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,040
Is this how they treat
their guest in the Qingchi Palace?

506
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,800
Your Grace, don’t be impatient.

507
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,560
Don’t forget what
the Queen of Heaven said.

508
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,730
We have our own ways
to treat guests in the Qingchi Palace.

509
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,610
If you want to horse around,

510
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,370
just go back to your Heavenly Palace.

511
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,920
Besides, you are not
a guest of my Qingchi Palace.

512
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,320
Houchi?

513
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,970
You are not Houchi.

514
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,530
Or did you use any witchcraft?

515
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,970
You Grace, you know the best

516
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,850
whether she is Goddess Houchi or not.

517
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,890
If you can’t remember it,

518
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,730
Goddess Houchi can summon
a few more thunder strikes

519
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,200
to strike some sense into you.

520
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,080
How dare you!

521
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,730
You are just a nameless immortal,

522
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,890
how dare you be rude to me!

523
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,320
Save it, Jingzhao.

524
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,890
You made a big deal of coming here.

525
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,610
What are you up to?

526
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,280
Your Grace.

527
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,250
I was young

528
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,610
and thoughtless before.

529
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,320
I offended you many times.

530
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,280
I hope you can forgive me.

531
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,280
I’m here today

532
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,440
to send you the invitation.

533
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,890
My mother’s birthday is coming soon.

534
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,770
She wants to meet you.

535
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,490
Blood is thicker than water.

536
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,680
I hope you can come
for the sake of your relationship.

537
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,970
Princess Jingzhao.

538
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,010
Please go back and tell your mother

539
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,530
that the Qingchi Palace wants nothing
to do with her.

540
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,970
We hope she can leave us alone.

541
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,320
How is that going to work?

542
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,010
Aren’t you Qingmu’s friend?

543
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,970
If you don’t come to
the birthday banquet,

544
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,010
how are you going to see

545
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,490
my engagement ceremony with Qingmu?

546
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,680
What did you say?

547
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,440
Goddess Houchi.

548
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,080
North Sea Lord has accepted the marriage
granted by the Heavenly Emperor.

549
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,280
He doesn’t want to destroy
the harmony between the two palaces.

550
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,160
He hopes you can let go of the past

551
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,490
and don’t be stubborn.

552
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,920
How is it possible?

553
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,440
Qingmu loves Houchi.

554
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,610
How would he marry you?

555
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,400
Qingmu only stayed in the Qingchi Palace
for a few days.

556
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,610
How come you have
such a misunderstanding?

557
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,200
Right,

558
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,130
you always covet what I have.

559
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,650
Qingmu is no exception.

560
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,770
This time we are going to
become an immortal couple.

561
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,970
Are you still going to pester him?

562
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,850
What a joke.

563
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,970
If I want someone,
do I even need to pester him?

564
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,440
Not to mention

565
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,010
you are the rival.

566
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,320
What do you mean?

567
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,770
I mean

568
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,800
if you don’t get out of
the Qingchi Palace now,

569
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,440
don’t blame me for letting you
feel the thunder strike again.

570
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,440
You… You are threatening me!

571
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
It’s not a threat,

572
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:19,890
but a punishment.

573
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,970
To punish you for having no respect
for your superior, being ignorant

574
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,610
and trespassing the Qingchi Palace.

575
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,530
These three sins can
get you punished hard.

576
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,850
With your little power,

577
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,770
I don’t think you can take
these few thunder strikes.

578
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,490
Your Majesty.

579
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,160
I’m here this time

580
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,440
to give you the spiritual power
of Demon Lord Ziyue

581
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,010
and help you become a God.

582
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,280
This is of great importance

583
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,490
and you mustn’t make any mistake.

584
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,080
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

585
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,320
I’ve been cultivating myself here
for tens of thousands of years.

586
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,560
This day is what I’ve been waiting for.

587
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,280
With the help of Demon Lord Ziyue,

588
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,890
I’ll become a God in one fell swoop.

589
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:41,970
That’s good.

590
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,440
It’s the people
from the Heavenly Palace.

591
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,400
The First Prince, Jingyang?

592
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,850
He got the nerve to come.

593
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,010
Hold on.

594
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,890
The Heavenly Palace
has noticed something.

595
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,650
Before becoming a God,

596
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,970
you mustn’t get yourself exposed.

597
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,490
You are right, Your Majesty.

598
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,130
I’ll start cultivating myself right away

599
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,010
and not let the Heavenly Palace
take the lead.

600
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,160
Your Majesty, you must be busy.

601
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,370
Please go back.

602
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,160
Remember,

603
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,370
look

604
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,130
before you leap.

605
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

606
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,850
Please.

607
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,970
Prince Jingyang.

608
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,010
I remember

609
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,080
he led the heavenly soldiers
and had a big fight with

610
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,280
Sen Yun in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

611
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,010
He treated me like dirt.

612
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,160
I’m about to become a God anyway.

613
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,250
Would I be afraid of
the Heavenly Palace?

614
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,320
I have to avenge myself.

615
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,040
How can there be divine weapons

616
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,610
on such desolate land?

617
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
They still insist that
I search this place.

618
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,560
You guys.

619
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Take a quick look in the forest.

620
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:12,920
Yes!

621
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,650
Jingyang.

622
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,770
Long time no see.

623
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,400
Who is that?

624
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,400
Three-head Fire Dragon.

625
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,250
It’s you old brat.

626
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,200
I didn’t kill you

627
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,770
when you were cultivating yourself
in seclusion.

628
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,530
You got the nerve to
seek your doom again.

629
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,680
All right.

630
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,370
I’ll give you a quick death today.

631
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,800
It has been tens of thousands of years,

632
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,200
but you are still using
the same old moves.

633
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,130
Jingyang.

634
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,160
Even you are not bored,

635
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,800
I’m bored of it.

636
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,040
I’m not going to walk anymore.

637
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,200
What on earth is this place?

638
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,610
They don’t even have a chariot.

639
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,370
I have to walk down the mountain.

640
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,080
Your Grace.

641
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,250
The rules of the Qingchi Palace
have always been like this.

642
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,490
No matter who,

643
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,320
the guards must be left
outside the palace

644
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,370
and no chariot can enter.

645
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,560
This is still the land of the Immortals.

646
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,680
Why should I obey the rules
of the Qingchi Palace?

647
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,490
Your Grace, just hold on for a while.

648
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,680
We are going to leave the palace soon.

649
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,920
I don’t care.

650
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,770
Do whatever you can

651
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,530
to get a chariot for me.

652
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,610
Yes.

653
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,530
Are we really going to do this?

654
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,610
This princess is ill-tempered.

655
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,200
If we get caught...

656
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,400
What are you afraid of?

657
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,490
We are at our Qingchi Palace.

658
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,200
She got the nerve to run wild here.

659
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,040
We can’t just let it go.

660
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,200
You bold birds!

661
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,730
I’m a Gold Dragon.

662
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,970
How dare you tease me!

663
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,730
You are asking for your death!

664
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,920
What did you say?

665
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,890
Jingzhao went to the Qingchi Palace

666
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,650
and told them
that I had agreed to marry her?

667
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,160
Did Houchi buy her words?

668
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,080
She kicked Jingzhao out?

669
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,680
This is the woman I fall for.

670
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,920
It’s the signal
that Father convenes a meeting.

671
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,040
Something happened to
the Heavenly Palace.

672
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,040
Let’s go take a look.

673
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,650
Let’s go.

674
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:34,970
What did you say?

675
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:36,800
Your Highness.

676
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,200
We lost the track of Prince Jingyang

677
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,130
and the heavenly soldiers
after they entered

678
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,130
the Abyssal Ridge Swamp yesterday.

679
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,010
There is still no news about them.

680
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,560
How come?

681
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,250
Father, please try to tell

682
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,770
if Jingyang is in danger by telepathy.

683
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,160
I’ve checked it.

684
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,970
Jingyang’s spiritual aura is weak.

685
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,800
But he is safe now.

686
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,770
Your Majesty.

687
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,080
Prince Jingyang went there
for the divine weapons.

688
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,200
Now he is missing in
the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

689
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,890
It must be the Demons who did it.

690
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,560
Lord of Wind,
that’s not necessarily true.

691
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,650
The Abyssal Ridge Swamp was abandoned
by the Immortals and the Demons.

692
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,890
There are both immortals and demons.

693
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,010
And most of them are rebels.

694
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,770
Even if it’s the Demons who did it,

695
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,370
even the powerful Demon King

696
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,850
can’t take away so many people
without anyone noticing it.

697
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,010
As for whether
it’s the Demons who did it,

698
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,370
I need you to find it out

699
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,200
at the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

700
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,920
That’s right, Your Majesty.

701
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,770
It’s imperative

702
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,610
to rescue Prince Jingyang first

703
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,530
lest a long delay may cause trouble.

704
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,160
Father.

705
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,490
I know who can do it.

706
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,130
Jingjian, what are you doing?

707
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,680
Don’t worry. I’ll let you
get what you want.

708
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,250
Father.

709
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,850
I think

710
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,440
Qingmu is perfect for this task.

711
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,850
Lord Qingmu has
the True God’s divine weapon,

712
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,530
the Taicang Spear, to fight with them.

713
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,970
He is the best choice.

714
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,920
Lord Donghua.

715
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,490
North Sea Lord is not from
the Heavenly Palace.

716
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,250
He isn’t holding any post
in the Heavenly Palace.

717
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,920
I don’t think it’s proper to let him

718
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,280
take on such an important task.

719
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,560
Lord of Wind, do you mean

720
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,320
you are willing to
lead the army and go there?

721
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,800
My ability is limited. I’m afraid...

722
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,010
Father.

723
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,920
Since no one in the Heavenly Palace
can take on this task,

724
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,200
it’s better to let Qingmu do it.

725
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,280
I’m willing to go with him

726
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,440
to rescue Jingyang.

727
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,040
But it’s extremely dangerous.

728
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,490
And this is the first time for Qingmu
to enter the Heavenly Palace.

729
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,490
If he can rescue Jingyang,

730
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,530
the Heavenly Palace must give him
a generous reward.

731
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Of course.

732
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,890
Qingmu.

733
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
I promise you a generous reward

734
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,490
if you can rescue Jingyang.

735
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,530
Are you willing to do it?

736
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,010
Your Majesty.

737
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,370
Of course, I am.

738
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,080
But I don’t want any generous reward.

739
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,370
I only have one condition.

740
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,040
How dare you, Qingmu!

741
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,040
You are just a little immortal
in the North Sea.

742
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,080
Why do you think you can
bring terms to His Majesty?

743
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,200
Your Majesty, don’t worry.

744
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,010
What I want

745
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,800
is not about the Immortals
or the Heavenly Palace.

746
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
It’s a private matter.

747
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,530
If Your Majesty can promise me,

748
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,680
I will head for the Abyssal
Ridge Swamp immediately

749
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,680
and bring Prince Jingyang back safely.

750
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,250
Okay.

751
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,650
I grant you one promise.

752
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

753
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,280
Houchi.

754
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,610
Are you still angry at
Jingzhao’s tricks?

755
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,010
It’s not about Jingzhao.

756
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,130
She came to cause a scene.

757
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,280
Looks like Qingmu has difficulties
in turning down the marriage.

758
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,080
I’m worried about Qingmu’s safety now.

759
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,200
But I’m afraid it’ll intensify conflicts
if I go to the Heavenly Palace now.

760
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,850
I’ve never

761
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,800
hated my incompetence so much.

762
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,530
There is nothing I can do

763
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,560
to help him.

764
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,970
Jingjian asked someone
to send us a message

765
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,440
that Qingmu just got a chance

766
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,560
and he might be able to break it off.

767
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,250
He asked us to wait for their news

768
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,400
and not to worry too much about it.

769
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,440
What... What chance?

770
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,370
Is it safe?

771
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,040
Don’t worry.

772
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,610
But there is another news.

773
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,370
Do you want to hear it?

774
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,490
News?

775
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,290
It must be good news.

776
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,120
I notice that you haven’t found Boxuan.

777
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,570
So I asked my former friends
to look out for him.

778
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Did they find Boxuan?

779
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,290
A little demon told me that

780
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,600
there was a sign of a Demigod becoming
a God in the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

781
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,810
I suspect that the Demigod
is probably Boxuan.

782
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,680
The Abyssal Ridge Swamp?

783
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,680
I’ve been looking for him for so long.

784
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,050
But I overlooked a few

785
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,530
dangerous places left over
from ancient times.

786
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,290
If the Demon King becomes a God,

787
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,920
there should be a big scene about it.

788
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,730
But the Immortal Realm
and the Demon Realm are peaceful now.

789
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,770
Maybe it’s really Boxuan.

790
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,440
That’s right.

791
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,290
Instead of filling your head
with foolish notions,

792
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,920
you’d better go out and look for Boxuan.

793
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,600
Okay.

794
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,250
Let’s set off immediately.

795
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,600
This place is really unique.

796
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,010
The spiritual power is so thin here.

797
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,120
I once cultivated myself here
when I was young.

798
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,050
There is biogas everywhere.

799
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,640
Those who stay here are mostly powerful

800
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,290
and brutal demons.

801
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,200
We must be careful.

802
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,570
Have you been here before?

803
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,640
I’ve not only been here,

804
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,600
I almost died in the mouth of the demons

805
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,440
when I was young and overconfident.

806
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,120
There is a sound.

807
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,680
Come on.

808
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,920
My good goddess.

809
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,530
Let me ride with the wind
next time, all right?

810
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,570
I’ve never been good at flying.

811
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,730
I just wanted to practice it.

812
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:56,920
Houchi?

813
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,290
Let’s go.

814
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,090
Let’s take a look ahead.

815
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,050
Why are you stopping me
from seeing my wife?

816
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,250
She’s not your wife yet.

817
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,250
What do you mean?

818
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,770
You two haven’t met for days.

819
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,250
You must miss each other a lot.

820
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,810
Well,

821
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,290
I’ll draw Fengran away later.

822
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,290
Good idea.

823
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:17,810
Not only that...

824
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,810
Okay.

825
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,640
Let’s go.

826
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,680
The Power of Rules here
is quite confusing.

827
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,290
What would Boxuan be doing here?

828
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,640
This is just the periphery
of the Abyssal Ridge Swamp.

829
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:34,570
By the way,

830
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,090
you have to put
your immortal power away later.

831
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,290
Don’t let someone else notice you.

832
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,160
Someone else?

833
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,810
There are many demons here.

834
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,810
There must be a lot of demons
who have the power of a lord.

835
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,290
When I was thrown here back then,

836
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,810
if it weren’t for
the old Tree Demon’s care,

837
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,160
I would have died many times.

838
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,530
Is there any powerful figure

839
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,010
in the place we are heading for?

840
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,330
I can handle

841
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,640
most of them.

842
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,160
But there is a Three-head Fire Dragon

843
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,920
from ancient times.

844
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,250
He got some serious power.

845
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,200
Although he doesn’t like immortals,

846
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,290
he is not bloodthirsty.

847
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,400
As long as we don’t cause any trouble,

848
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,530
we will be fine.

849
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,680
Jingjian.

850
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,050
Why are you here?

851
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:11,810
Something happened to Qingmu.

852
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,010
Qingmu is also here?

853
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,160
Qingmu and I were ordered to
look for some people.

854
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,160
But we got surrounded by
a group of demons

855
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,290
just as we arrived here.

856
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,200
Qingmu gave cover for me to leave.

857
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,050
I’m afraid his life is in danger now.

858
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,770
Fengran.

859
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:22,810
Please go with me to help.

860
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,680
I’m going with her.

861
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,600
Your spiritual power is weak.

862
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,250
Stay here to protect yourself.

863
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,600
All right, we are far enough.

864
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,810
We won’t disturb them now.

865
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,730
You found it out?

866
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,680
With your exaggerated performance,

867
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,400
if it wasn’t because Houchi was worried,

868
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,570
she wouldn’t have fallen for your lie.

869
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Lady Fengran, please don’t get mad.

870
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,120
Who is that?

871
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,810
Who is this immortal?

872
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,570
You got some nerve

873
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,640
to trespass on this land.

874
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,640
I... I didn’t recognize the road

875
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:05,920
and I strayed.

876
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,050
Please show some mercy

877
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,160
and let me go.

878
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,640
How can I let you go?

879
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,730
I haven’t eaten any immortal
for thousands of years.

880
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,810
Finally, there is
such a beautiful immortal.

881
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,640
How can I let you go?

882
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:22,970
Just eat me.

883
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,920
I’m not afraid.

884
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
However, can you let me

885
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,440
send an instruction feather
to the man I love

886
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,530
and tell him my last words

887
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
before I die?

888
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,160
The man you love?

889
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,290
What are you going to say to him?

890
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,160
You are unfaithful!

891
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,640
You betrayed me
and chose Princess Jingzhao!

892
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,920
I don’t love you anymore.

893
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,200
I didn’t choose Jingzhao.

894
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,840
You are the only one I love.

895
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,440
Untie me now.

896
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,400
Jingjian said you were in danger.

897
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,010
Luckily, you are fine.

898
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,530
I was so worried about you.

899
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,490
But you still made fun of me.

900
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,160
All right.

901
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,810
It was my fault.

902
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,810
I shouldn’t have listened to
Jingjian’s bad idea.

903
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,330
He asked me to scare you first

904
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,290
and then come to your rescue.

905
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,490
I won’t listen to him anymore.

906
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,680
This is all Qingmu’s idea.

907
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,120
He asked me to draw you away,

908
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,250
so he could stay with Houchi alone.

909
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,530
He is stronger than me.

910
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
I had to do what he asked me to do.

911
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,290
Please don’t blame me.

912
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,970
Your Highness.

913
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:28,970
We haven’t met for only a few days,

914
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,600
but you have become much bolder.

915
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,970
Now you even dare to lie to me.

916
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,730
I listened to you

917
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,810
to let them bond tighter.

918
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,840
When did you ever
listen to me like that?

919
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,680
When have I not

920
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,250
listened to you?

921
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,050
I’m glad you get the point.

922
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,330
Then let’s wait here.

923
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,490
Let’s not be the third wheels.

924
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,200
Did you and Qingmu follow us

925
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,640
to the Abyssal Ridge Swamp?

926
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,010
Of course not.

927
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
We are here...

928
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,120
Lady Fengran.

929
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,570
It’s my father’s edict.

930
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,290
It’s a secret of the Heavenly Palace.

931
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,730
Sorry that I can’t tell you about it.

932
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,810
Forget it.

933
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,730
I don’t care that much
about the Heavenly Palace.

934
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,360
Where are you going?

935
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,970
It’s a secret of the Qingchi Palace.

936
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,770
I can’t tell you.

937
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,290
All right.

938
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,290
We are even now.

939
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,330
Since you won’t tell me,

940
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,570
I’ll just follow you.

941
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,010
But this place is very dangerous.

942
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:35,010
You should be careful
and stay alert, Lady Fengran.
