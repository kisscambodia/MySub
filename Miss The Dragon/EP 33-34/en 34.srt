=Episode 34=

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,520
Back then,

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,960
I was the cold-hearted Lonely Star,

19
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,350
one of the 36 Heavenly Generals.

20
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,960
That day, I was ordered to hunt down

21
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,800
the Evil Spirit who sneaked into
the heavenly realm.

22
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,680
Who are you that dare to molest me?!

23
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,040
You darn lothario!

24
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,040
I was kind enough to help you
clean up the sludge.

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,270
How could you slander me?

26
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,470
You were kind?

27
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,350
It was you who knocked me out!

28
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,520
Sorry.

29
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,910
I only focused
on killing the Evil Spirit.

30
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,240
It was my mistake

31
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,470
to make you fall into the puddle.

32
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,760
I’m the most beautiful Blue Swallow
in the Heavenly Realm.

33
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,190
But you made me fall into a puddle!

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,070
Look…

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,760
Why am I clean?

36
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,040
Then…

37
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,240
You washed my whole body?

38
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,470
It’s my fault.

39
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,400
It’s what I should do. You’re welcome.

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,070
What do you mean?

41
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,680
Then…

42
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,190
You’ve touched me all over?

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,680
I’m not a flirtatious bird!

44
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,120
No. No.

45
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,520
I mean, I did touch…

46
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,320
No, no!

47
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,040
I mean I did wash you.

48
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,160
No…

49
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,630
Sorry, I didn’t think about this.

50
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,550
Sorry for my rudeness.

51
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,190
I’ll stand here still so you can

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,880
vent your anger at will.

53
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,830
You said you’d

54
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,120
stand still here.

55
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,240
Don’t move.

56
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,190
Don’t blame me for being rude
if you don’t stop.

57
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,960
This was the first time in 3,000 years

58
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,750
that I smiled.

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,000
It was because of Blue Swallow.

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,630
The Lonely Star had a lonely destiny,

61
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,150
but she made me feel that

62
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,280
my heart was not lonely.

63
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,870
She loved to travel in the three realms,

64
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,150
and loved to fight for justice

65
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,030
even though her power was not strong.

66
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,120
In case that she got into troubles,

67
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,680
I made Three-call Spell with her.

68
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,840
But one day…

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,070
It’s evil energy!

70
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,630
The Evil Spirit will cause trouble
in human world.

71
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,440
It’s the Ugly Evil Spirit!

72
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,120
He should be trapped in the Sky Net
of Luofeng Pavilion.

73
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,590
How did he get out?

74
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,000
I have to ask someone to take him back.

75
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,800
Lonely Star, Lonely Star…

76
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,750
Wait.

77
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,240
Now he must be guarding
the Terrace of Goddess Nuwa.

78
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,870
I can follow this ugly monster first

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,800
to see where his lair is.

80
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,070
Where are you going?

81
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,750
Don’t come close!

82
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,630
Or I will call someone here!

83
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,560
Lonely Star!

84
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,150
Lonely Star! Lonely Star!

85
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,470
Qing?

86
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,720
Lonely Star…

87
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,560
Lonely Star… Lonely Star!

88
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,520
Qing?

89
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,190
Qing! Qing!

90
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,560
Lonely Star,

91
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,960
I’m fine.

92
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,000
Don’t cry.

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,030
You look better when you smile.

94
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,870
But, don’t

95
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,800
forget me in the future.

96
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,590
I… Why am I back alive?

97
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,710
In my body…

98
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,080
It’s your Inner Star?

99
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,080
Are you stupid?

100
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,270
Why did you use it to save me?

101
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,080
I’m destined to be alone.

102
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,150
For the past thousand years,

103
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,950
I’ve never felt terrible for
being alone at all.

104
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,880
But just now,

105
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,270
I knew

106
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,030
I couldn’t bear to lose you.

107
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,640
But, you shouldn’t have used
your Inner Star.

108
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,590
I just need to rest for a few days.

109
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,030
You can keep it.

110
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,680
Next time if I don’t arrive in time,

111
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,800
it can protect you.

112
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,000
As long as we don’t be apart,

113
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,030
I’ll be fine.

114
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,510
You look good when you smile.

115
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,710
After we went back,

116
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,390
we thought everything would be fine.

117
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
Stone of Goddess Nuwa!

118
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
What’s wrong?

119
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
It’s gone!

120
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,440
Lonely Star,

121
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,320
are you on duty today?

122
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,470
Yes.

123
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,080
Lonely Star!

124
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,830
Because of your absence,

125
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,350
dragon demon Yuchi Longyan stole the
Stone of Goddess Nuwa!

126
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,680
Do you plead guilty?

127
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,640
Take the Lonely Star and the
Blue Swallow into custody together!

128
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,830
Why are you arresting her as well?

129
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,710
This is my dereliction of duty,

130
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,320
all the consequences are borne
by me alone.

131
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,710
This is the Emperor of Heaven’s order.

132
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,470
You want to disobey it?

133
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,270
I advise you to accept it.

134
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,560
Maybe the Emperor will show mercy

135
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,680
and you can be punished lightly.

136
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
That day, I let go of your hand.

137
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,270
But I never thought that

138
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,510
I’d never be able to hold it again.

139
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,150
Lonely Star, do you plead guilty?

140
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,830
It’s my dereliction of duty.

141
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,240
I’m willing to be punished.

142
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,880
According to the Heavenly Rules,

143
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,760
Lonely Star should be punished with
the Heavenly Thunders.

144
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,760
Blue Swallow, you seduced
the Heavenly General.

145
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,150
Do you plead guilty?

146
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,470
We’re just in love with each other.

147
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,950
Why are we guilty?

148
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,880
You’re still impenitent.

149
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,760
From now on,

150
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,000
you and Lonely Star can’t
get together again!

151
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,590
Lonely Star!

152
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,470
Lonely Star!

153
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,680
Emperor,

154
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,270
please!

155
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,240
Please spare Lonely Star!

156
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,680
He has suffered eight thunders

157
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,590
and is already at his last gasp.

158
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,030
The last one…

159
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,680
Lonely Star…

160
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,880
Please let me withstand it for him!

161
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,950
We have no relationship now.

162
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,080
You should go.

163
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,240
No.

164
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,880
No!

165
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,760
No!

166
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,030
Qing!

167
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,150
Qing! Qing!

168
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,440
I…

169
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,710
am…

170
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,350
sorry…

171
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,910
How ignorant.

172
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,150
The Nine Heavenly Thunders

173
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,080
are not something that a lower-ranked

174
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,880
half-immortal like you can withstand.

175
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,240
How incorrigible.

176
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,200
Open the Evil Spirit Portal.

177
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,080
No!

178
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,870
I used my last power

179
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,390
to send her to the mortal world.

180
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,750
My memory was removed.

181
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,480
I was renamed Xue Qianxun,

182
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,800
and became the Lord of Luofeng Pavilion,
who sends souls

183
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,270
to go through tribulations

184
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,910
for a term of 3,000 years.

185
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,320
Blue Swallow fell into the mortal world,

186
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,910
and after a thousand years
of cultivation,

187
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,870
she became my Qingqing.

188
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,270
Emperor, the one who stole

189
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,680
the Stone of Goddess Nuwa is
this bold dragon demon.

190
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,080
Then, I wonder

191
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,960
why the Heavenly General was not there.

192
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,870
Emperor, we should find out if any

193
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,960
Heavenly General left the position.

194
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,320
That absent Heavenly General

195
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,510
turns out to be Xue Qianxun?

196
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,150
(Punishment of the Lonely Star)
The Lonely Star got his memory removed

197
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,390
and Blue Swallow reentered
the mortal world.

198
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,110
What a fate.

199
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,910
Deep love will be broken.

200
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,750
The Star against the Heaven
will be lonely.

201
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,230
Is Xue Qianxun

202
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,840
doomed to be lonely forever?

203
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,030
I was about to go to see you.

204
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,110
Do you remember

205
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,150
the Punishment of the Lonely Star
2,000 years ago?

206
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,630
You remember it now?

207
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,990
Qingqing passed out suddenly
and her power is weak.

208
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,390
This is also related to you.

209
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,110
I want to know

210
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,150
besides the punishment
of Heavenly Thunders,

211
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,320
and removal of my memory,

212
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,110
is there anything I don’t know?

213
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,980
(Chronology)

214
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,440
Why do you have this book?

215
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,720
Immortal of Fate gave it to me.

216
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,390
Why didn’t he give me that directly?

217
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,480
He doesn’t know how to tell you.

218
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,110
So he wants me to tell you.

219
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,020
(Punishment of the Lonely Star)

220
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,320
Deep love will be broken.

221
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,110
Fate can’t be decided by himself.

222
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,960
The Star against the Heaven
will be lonely with a cursed kiss.

223
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Why is this page

224
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,840
complete in your hand?

225
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,990
You mean

226
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,440
you have read this book

227
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,320
but there was no this page?

228
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,360
Deep love will be broken.

229
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,080
That’s to say,

230
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,320
once Qingqing and I are deep in love,

231
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,030
her soul will be broken.

232
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,150
Once I kiss her,

233
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,510
that will get her cursed.

234
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,680
Maybe that’s the meaning.

235
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,230
I’ll ask you for one last time.

236
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,270
Why do you have this page?

237
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,960
Are you doubting me?

238
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,840
Yes.

239
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,960
I was the cause of this
incident that year.

240
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,360
So, you’re afraid to tell me

241
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,800
and hiding everything from me?

242
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,600
I just got to know that you were

243
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,110
the Lonely Star who was guarding
the Terrace of Goddess Nuwa then.

244
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,800
What else haven’t you told me?

245
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,360
Nothing.

246
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,800
Say it!

247
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,910
I have been waiting for you.

248
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,510
I was about to go to you.

249
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,080
But you come to me yourself.

250
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,440
That curse is really strong.

251
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,150
But, what a pity.

252
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,990
A thousand years ago,

253
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,110
you should have been a happy couple.

254
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,510
But the arrogant Yuchi Longyan

255
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,200
made you be far apart from each other.

256
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,230
Is there any way to break it?

257
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,030
I’m asking you!

258
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,080
Are you angry now?

259
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Answer me!

260
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,270
If you hadn’t had the great joy
and great anger,

261
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,320
this ancient spell couldn’t
have been finished!

262
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,080
What ancient spell?

263
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,630
Because the poison you got

264
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,150
needs anger as its guiding drug.

265
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,510
What are you talking about?

266
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,360
At this last moment,

267
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,080
I’ll let you know it clearly.

268
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,150
Smell the fragrance.

269
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,960
This fragrance

270
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,320
is not the fragrance of Datura Flower.

271
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,320
I’ve replaced the Datura Weaver Ribbon

272
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,800
with the Sorrow of Hell Maid.

273
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,150
Alright.

274
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,150
Take it.

275
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,840
And, the tea you drink often

276
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,030
is not Three Pearl Leaf Tea.

277
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,600
It’s

278
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,990
Heavenly Break.

279
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,750
This is Three Pearl Leaf Tea
made by God Gou Mang

280
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,720
with leaves like pearls.

281
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,990
It has a miraculous effect on
meridian injuries.

282
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,800
Remember to let him drink it regularly.

283
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,030
Don’t tell anyone
you exchanged it with me.

284
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,360
Alright.

285
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,630
Let me give you some more jars
of Three Pearl Leaf Tea.

286
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,680
Why?

287
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,910
What are you going to do?

288
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,870
The Sorrow of Hell Maid and
the Heavenly Break.

289
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,910
If you take the two poisons of
heaven and hell every day,

290
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,840
your mind and body won’t be
under your own control.

291
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,110
To finish this ancient spell,

292
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,110
great joy and great anger

293
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,080
are needed as the guiding drugs.

294
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,960
The great joy is every time you think
about the Blue Swallow.

295
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,840
The great anger is you thought
Dragon King lied to you.

296
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,390
Say it!

297
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,840
The ancient spell is finished.

298
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,600
From today on,

299
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,230
you should obey my orders.

300
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Yes.

301
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,390
Emperor, today I have compiled

302
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
the events of the immortal world
in the past year,

303
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,480
and found that someone has taken
away the Fire Protection Shield

304
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,200
and stolen the Rain Wand.

305
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,870
That’s an important matter.

306
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,840
Please decide the way to deal with it.

307
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,510
Who is it?

308
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,800
It’s the last dragon demon of

309
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,480
the Candle Dragon Clan,

310
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,320
Yuchi Longyan.

311
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,560
Immortal Ziyang, take that
dragon demon here to me.

312
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,600
Yes.

313
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,990
That dragon demon is cunning.

314
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,630
I suggest to let
Lord of Luofeng Pavilion

315
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,960
to go together to help.

316
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,870
Xue Qianxun, you go with him.

317
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,110
Yes.

318
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,840
Xue Qianxun,

319
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,630
what’s wrong with you?

320
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,910
Seven Deadly Spell?

321
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,030
You want his soul to be annihilated?
