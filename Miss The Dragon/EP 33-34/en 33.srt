16

=Episode 33=

17
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,430
It’s an ancient spell,
the Nightmare Spell.

18
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,280
One year in the dream is one day
in the real world.

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,630
In seven days, her soul

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,110
will be slowly absorbed by the one
who cast the spell.

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,160
We have to find the spell caster
within seven days

22
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,160
and kill him.

23
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,390
You can enter the dream world
through your spiritual awareness.

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,070
The caster presents the dream

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,960
as if it were real,

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,990
but there will inevitably be flaws.

27
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,430
You can find out

28
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,320
who the caster is from the flaws.

29
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,880
But…

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,240
But I can’t wake up

31
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,120
from the dream either.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,400
You can only tell us who the caster is

33
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,960
and we go kill him.

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,240
What if

35
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,880
we fail to kill the caster
within seven days?

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,800
You’ll be trapped in her dream.

37
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,400
Your soul will fall into the nightmare.

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
Let’s do it.

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,120
It’s Liuying’s room.

40
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,270
The spell caster knows

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,120
the things of Qingyan’s past life?

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,160
This place looks so real.

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,550
He must have used hair

44
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,470
or skin of people familiar with
Xiahou’s Mansion

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,880
to make this.

46
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,430
What’s going on?

47
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
He is fake.

48
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,710
How dare you pretend to be me!

49
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,240
Come with me.

50
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,630
So lively here!

51
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,960
Kunlun Hall?

52
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,520
What kind of awful place is this?

53
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,000
I want you to carry me home.

54
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,720
Yuchi took me here before!

55
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,680
You’re the real one!

56
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,870
Darn it!

57
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,070
It was not a dream that day?

58
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,750
Star Halo!

59
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,520
This place

60
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,750
is where I came with Liuying.

61
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,070
What’s going on?

62
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,240
Yuchi! Look!

63
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Star Halo!

64
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,120
It’s so amazing!

65
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,560
Yuchi,

66
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,120
I want to see fireflies. May I?

67
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,960
So many fireflies!

68
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,640
Yuchi.

69
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,590
Yuchi, thank you.

70
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,880
Let’s stay here

71
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,240
and don’t leave, alright?

72
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,680
Alright.

73
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,390
Let’s stay here.

74
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,240
Looks like

75
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,030
he is also reluctant to leave
this dream now.

76
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,080
Dragon King! You can’t stay there!

77
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,760
You have to find the spell caster!

78
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,350
Hurry up!

79
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,680
Qingqing,

80
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,590
the one who can
make Yuchi Longyan obsessed

81
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,640
must also know him well.

82
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,680
Why do I feel like

83
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,560
this dream is a trap

84
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,200
specially made for them both?

85
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,390
Yes.

86
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,680
Let me think about who

87
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,800
they both offended at the same time.

88
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,440
Who did they offend together?

89
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,030
Who can it be?

90
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,440
Yuchi,

91
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,800
let me take you to some good places.

92
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,950
It tastes good!

93
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,800
The Durian Cake tastes good?

94
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,120
Liuying and I actually

95
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,590
know that we don’t like durian.

96
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,390
But others don’t know.

97
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,000
The kitten was also

98
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,510
present at the time.

99
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,200
Cat demon Marble.

100
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,270
But, how does she know about
Xiahou’s Mansion?

101
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,710
We can have a good talk next time!

102
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,000
About the past 200 years ago.

103
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,760
200 years ago?

104
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,120
She must have got to know the story

105
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,150
of Xiahou’s Mansion from Qingqing.

106
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,880
Yuchi,

107
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,150
among all these places,

108
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,590
this place is my favorite.

109
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200
Do you like it?

110
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,950
Of course.

111
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,560
But, we have been
to so many places today

112
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,680
and you must be tired.

113
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,390
How about we have a rest here?

114
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,390
We can go buy chestnuts
after you wake up,

115
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,320
alright?

116
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,560
Sure!

117
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,150
He is about to control his body.

118
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,390
Then,

119
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,910
now he can hear us?

120
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,910
He really heard us!

121
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,000
Did you find the caster?

122
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,830
I see.

123
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,880
These are two buns!

124
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,240
They can move?

125
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,510
Fairy! Right?

126
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,800
Two idiots.

127
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,710
Scratch?

128
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,320
Grab?

129
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,030
Paw!

130
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,350
Bear demon!

131
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,200
I see!

132
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,800
Water snake demon!

133
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,560
I see!

134
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,830
Immortal of Wine!

135
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,560
No! No!

136
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,200
Monkey demon!

137
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,910
Lick himself?

138
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,000
Lick himself?

139
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,390
Ears.

140
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,760
Cat’s whiskers.

141
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,350
Catwalk.

142
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,640
Cat demon!

143
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,950
Cat demon!

144
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,080
It’s really the cat demon!

145
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,440
This evil demon!

146
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,510
I even wanted to make good
friends with her!

147
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,640
How could she be so vicious?

148
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,270
But, where can we find her now?

149
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,640
Your hair.

150
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,800
Let me comb your hair.

151
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,640
I got it!

152
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,680
She combed my hair

153
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
just to get my hair and make the dream!

154
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,000
So insidious! What a bad demon!

155
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,710
My hair can be used to trace?

156
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,200
Every single hair of yours is mine.

157
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,390
You bad demon!

158
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,110
Liuying saved you. Qingyan let you go.

159
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,440
How could you bite her hand
that feeds you?

160
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,960
Bite her hand?

161
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,680
I’m not!

162
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,560
I just want to avenge my sister.

163
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,800
But, I never hurt Qingyan.

164
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,150
You never hurt her? But…

165
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,080
Why do you want her soul?

166
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,270
Soul?

167
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,360
The Nightmare Spell will only
make her sleep for days.

168
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,510
Looks like you don’t know it.

169
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,750
Who taught you that spell?

170
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,840
I…

171
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,360
Xue Qianxun!

172
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,320
What… What’s wrong with her?

173
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,720
Qianji Heart Thunder.

174
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,630
What’s that?

175
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,230
The person behind this is so cruel.

176
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,230
Her soul has been scattered.

177
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,510
We lost the clue again.

178
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,560
My head hurts.

179
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,600
It’s good that you’re awake.

180
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Yuchi.

181
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,800
I had a really long dream.

182
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,030
That dream

183
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,910
was like reality.

184
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,630
It had Fallen-flower Valley,

185
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,750
Star Halo,

186
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,440
and those fireflies.

187
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,360
Qingyan.

188
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,990
You had been in a coma for six days.

189
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,480
Your master must be worrying about you.

190
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,630
Six days?

191
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,680
Oh, no!

192
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,270
No. No. No.

193
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
Master will scold me!

194
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,750
No hurry. I’ll send you back.

195
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,910
Yuchi, is there

196
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,910
really a Fallen-flower Valley?

197
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,960
Can we go find it together later?

198
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,840
If you want to go,

199
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,480
I can take you there at any time.

200
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,750
But now you have to

201
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,510
think about

202
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,990
how to explain to your master.

203
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,440
There will be a way.

204
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,630
Anyway, I’ll just do

205
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,840
what Master tells me to.

206
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,510
I have experience in it.

207
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,870
Alright.

208
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,750
I’ll stop here.

209
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,110
That’s so soon.

210
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,030
Go back and have a good rest now.

211
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,840
Then, Yuchi,

212
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,150
I’ll go now.

Yes, Master.

251
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,440
Master, 20 days

252
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,750
are too long.

253
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,030

254
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,230

Qingyan,

257
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,630
don’t be sad.

258
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,680
20 days will be over soon.

259
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,270
Thank you, Qingfeng.

260
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,720
There is no barrier back
in the mountain.

261
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,990
I can call Qingqing there to
play with me.

262
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,510
This Golden Eagle Dagger

263
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,510
may hurt Qingqing.

264
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,270
What’s on your mind?

265
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,230
Qingfeng, there is no point

266
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,800
of taking this dagger with me
while reflecting on myself.

267
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,440
It’s so heavy and useless.

268
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,680
How about you keep it for me

269
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,600
and give it back to me

270
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,110
after I leave there?

271
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,320
Look at you. It’s just a dagger.

272
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,390
How heavy could it be?

273
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,870
Thank you. I gotta go now.

274
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,080
Dragon King.

275
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,480
Immortal, what’s the matter?

276
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,270
Xue Qianxun asked me about

277
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,910
his punishment for many times.

278
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,230
I searched through all the records

279
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,200
and found it.

280
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,150
(Chronology)
Qingqing and Xue Qianxun

281
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,800
(Chronology)
are destined to meet

282
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,800
but they can’t be together.

283
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,200
Why?

284
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,750
Xue Qianxun’s punishment

285
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,230
is related to Blue Swallow’s punishment.

286
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,740
(Punishment of the Lonely Star)

287
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,540
(Punishment of the Blue Swallow)

288
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,480
Turns out that

289
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,630
Xue Qianxun is the Lonely Star

290
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,630
and Qingqing is the Blue Swallow.

291
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
It’s not proper

292
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,390
for me to tell this.

293
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,560
Xue Qianxun is your friend.

294
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,720
And it has something to do with you.

295
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,030
You’re the better one to tell him.

296
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,870
I have told you about this.

297
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,360
(Chronology)
It’s up to you whether to tell him.

298
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,870
You bold demon!

299
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,200
How dare you come to our place!

300
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,560
Xue Qianxun! Xue Qianxun!

301
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,030
Xue Qian…

302
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,910
Xue Qianxun.

303
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,750
Xue Qianxun, Xue Qianxun!

304
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,870
They want to kill me without any reason.

305
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,600
I didn’t do anything bad!

306
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,800
(Back Mountain)
Guys, this girl is my friend.

307
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,680
Could you please spare her life

308
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,960
for my sake?

309
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,680
What girl? She is just a demon!

310
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,510
You…!

311
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,720
You have an immortal aura,
and speak politely.

312
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,230
You should be a heavenly immortal.

313
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,230
Why are you protecting this demon?

314
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,200
She is a demon, but she’s cultivating
with her sincerity.

315
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,960
In time, she can become an immortal.

316
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,870
Don’t think that you are an immortal,

317
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,200
so you can do whatever you want!

318
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,990
Kunlun Sect is enforcing justice
for heaven

319
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,110
by eliminating demons!

320
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,270
If you interfere with this,

321
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
it’s also against the heavenly rules!

322
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,960
You…!

323
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,480
Did you see that?

324
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,080
People from Kunlun are always like this!

325
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,150
So unreasonable!

326
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,910
This demon sneaked into our place

327
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,080
with a suspicious manner.

328
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,680
If we don’t eliminate her now,

329
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,910
it will be too late when she causes
a trouble.

330
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,080
If I use my power in human world,

331
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,630
it will break the heavenly rules.

332
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,110
But I can still deal with you

333
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,510
without using my power.

334
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,270
Today, I must take her away.

335
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,200
Watch out!

336
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,390
No!

337
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,320
Qing!

338
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,750
So, this scar

339
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,840
was left by the Heavenly Thunder.

340
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,600
You also recalled it?

341
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,320
I just had those

342
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,320
flashes in my head.

343
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,110
Did we

344
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,720
know each other a thousand years ago?

345
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,990
Yes.

346
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,150
The Blue Swallow lured the Lonely Star
to leave his position.

347
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,840
