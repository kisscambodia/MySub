17
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,880
You’re awake?

18
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,350
Big brother, where are we?

19
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,430
On the way back to Kunlun Mountains.

20
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,880
Thank you for saving my life today.

21
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
You’re welcome.

22
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,830
What’s your name, please?

23
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,550
I’m Yuchi Longyan.

24
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,550
Yuchi,

25
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,830
have we met before?

26
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,470
Why did you ask?

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,430
No reason. I just find you familiar.

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,710
Yes.

29
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,800
We met a long time ago.

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,320
Why can’t I remember?

31
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,910
It doesn’t matter.

32
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,160
This is for you.

33
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,960
How lovely!

34
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,240
Do you like it?

35
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,430
Yes.

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,760
Thank you, Yuchi.

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,960
You’re welcome.

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,120
When can I

39
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,350
see you again?

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,710
Not until you grow up.

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,760
I have to wait that long?

42
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,710
Yeah.

43
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,680
When I’m 18,

44
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,430
come and tell me

45
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,430
the old story,

46
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,680
will you?

47
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,320
I will.

48
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,470
I’m leaving, Yuchi.

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,120
Be careful.

50
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,680
Why did you leave Qingyan alone

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
outside of the inn?

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,400
Gather our men and go look for her!

53
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,960
You must get her back!

54
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,240
Yes.

55
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,350
Master.

56
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,710
Kneel!

57
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,830
How dare you!

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
You remember to come back?

59
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,990
Who allowed you to leave?

60
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,680
I’m sorry, Master.

61
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,830
I was standing outside the inn,

62
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,120
but I met a demon.

63
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,270
A demon?

64
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,070
How did you get away?

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,600
The demon was about to eat me.

66
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,960
Luckily, Yuchi saved me.

67
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,600
Yuchi?

68
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,470
Which sect is he from?

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,550
I didn’t ask.

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,910
You didn’t know who he was,

71
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,270
and you let him walk you back?

72
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,070
What if he’s a bad man?

73
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,910
If he were a bad man,
he wouldn’t have saved me.

74
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,550
You...

75
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,470
Anyway,

76
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,910
you must be cautious against strangers.

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,750
I see.

78
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,150
Stand up.

79
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,840
When practicing in our sect,

80
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,280
you must learn to calm down first.

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,520
If you don’t calm yourself down,
how can you learn arts of immortality?

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,280
From now on,

83
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,470
you must play the Mind-clearing Song
two hours a day

84
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,190
until you can remove
distracting thoughts

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,750
and are no longer fun-loving.

86
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,120
Yes, Master.

87
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,000
Why must you kill me?

88
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,190
Cat demon, how dared you
disturb the human world

89
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,560
and seduce Mr. Xu!

90
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,590
My husband and I have true love
for each other.

91
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,870
Please let us go.

92
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,560
But Master said that
demons and humans were different races.

93
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,960
They mustn’t get married.

94
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,400
But my husband and I love each other.

95
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,870
Why can’t we get married?

96
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,910
No one can tear us apart.

97
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,440
Qingyan, kill her!

98
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,720
Stop her from talking nonsense.

99
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,870
Darling!

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,750
Chengcheng.

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,840
Darling, leave! It’s dangerous here.

102
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,630
Chengcheng hasn’t done anything evil.

103
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,750
She...

104
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,070
She’s my dear wife.

105
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,560
Please let her go.

106
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,680
Do you know she’s a demon,
instead of a human?

107
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,630
I don’t care what she is.

108
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,720
I just know she’s my wife.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,910
She has totally muddled your mind!

110
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,960
Senior,

111
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,350
looks like they have true love
for each other.

112
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Can you let her go?

113
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,030
Demons and humans are different races.

114
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,190
Don’t you remember what Master said?

115
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,030
Let’s go.

116
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,440
Stop!

117
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,030
Darling!

118
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,560
I... I didn’t mean to kill him.

119
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,520
I had meant to kill the cat demon.

120
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Chengcheng...

121
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,310
You killed him.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,030
I’ll make you pay with your lives!

123
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,350
Chengcheng!

124
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,710
Darling!

125
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,910
Darling!

126
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,760
Darling!

127
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,950
Demon, how dare you hurt my junior!

128
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,880
-Darling, I’m here.
-Senior!

129
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,350
Chengcheng, you...

130
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,320
Leave.

131
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,560
My husband and I love each other.

132
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,590
What wrong have we done?

133
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,910
I beg you.

134
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,640
Please bury me

135
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,950
with my husband.

136
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,910
Darling,

137
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,440
wait for me.

138
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,470
I’m coming to you.

139
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,320
She...

140
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,800
She exploded her inner core.

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
She...

142
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,150
She really died for love?

143
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,760
Humans, immortals and demons
turn out to be void.

144
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,560
All realms and destinies
end up in Luofeng.

145
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,390
People in Kunlun Sect

146
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,000
are quite merciless.

147
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,120
Mortals usually think

148
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,830
all the other races are vicious,

149
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,200
not to mention the demons.

150
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,200
What about immortals and demons?

151
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,710
Even if the Three Realms collapse
and the world reveres,

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,440
I won’t leave you.

153
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,470
When I see Qingyan feeling sad,

154
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,640
how I wish I could make her happy!

155
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,240
She isn’t Feng Chenyue anymore.

156
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,350
She’s Qingyan, who is always determined
to kill demons.

157
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,910
You must be very careful
and don’t get close to her.

158
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Understand?

159
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,390
Let’s go.

160
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,490
Humans, immortals and demons
turn out to be void.

161
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,230
All realms and destinies
end up in Luofeng.

162
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,200
Let’s take Qingwu back
and have Master cure him.

163
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,390
Qingfeng,

164
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,200
bury the man.

165
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,350
Senior, but the cat demon said...

166
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,880
How can a demon be buried with a human?

167
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,320
If Mr. Xu hadn’t been obsessed with her,

168
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,910
he wouldn’t have died.

169
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,830
Please bury me

170
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,120
with my husband.

171
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,680
A smell of demon?

172
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,760
Pay with your lives for my sister!

173
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,910
Where’s my sachet?

174
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,350
I didn’t go anywhere else today.

175
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
It’s really here.

176
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,950
The cat demon is your sister?

177
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,470
Qingyan’s voice.

178
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,390
Why is there another demon?

179
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,120
Stop!

180
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,830
You’re a demon, too.
Why don’t you help me?

181
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,240
I am helping you!

182
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,590
If you hurt her, you’ll be dead.

183
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,150
You’re scared that
Kunlun Sect will take revenge?

184
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,000
I’m not scared.

185
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,080
I must avenge my sister.

186
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,910
You...

187
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,640
You’re the cat demon’s sister?

188
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,350
Did you see her kill your sister?

189
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,950
I...

190
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,000
Because of demons like you

191
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,320
who mistake people indiscriminately

192
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,240
and hurt humans,

193
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,560
mortals have a deep understanding of us.

194
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,150
Why does she look so familiar?

195
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,200
How did you hurt your paw?

196
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Let’s go up the mountain

197
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,680
and I’ll pick some herbs for you.

198
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,320
I’ll cure you.

199
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
It’s her.

200
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,680
If you dare to hurt her again,

201
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,000
I’ll call for helpers.

202
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,760
Then you can’t easily get away.

203
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,150
Are... are you alright?

204
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,760
I’m fine. She can’t hurt me.

205
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,680
Qing...

206
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,270
I’m Qingqing.

207
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,240
I’m the prettiest bird demon.

208
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,150
Qingqing?

209
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,470
I’m Qingyan.

210
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,470
Thank you for helping me.

211
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,150
I thought you...

212
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,240
You thought all demons hurt humans

213
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,200
who couldn’t tell right from wrong?

214
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,200
I had thought like that.

215
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,710
But you surprised me.

216
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,240
Many more things will surprise you.

217
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,560
Nothing.

218
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,880
Tell me.

219
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,950
Why are you coming here
in the middle of night?

220
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,240
I’m here to fulfil her last wish.

221
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,470
You fulfilled their last wish.

222
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,910
(Mr. Xu’s Tomb)
They’ll be grateful in the heaven.

223
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,030
I hope that

224
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,240
they can still be together
in their next life.

225
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,800
I must go back soon.

226
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,390
Qingqing,

227
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,590
can we be good friends?

228
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,230
You and me?

229
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,560
But I’m a bird demon.

230
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,270
Don’t you worry about your master?

231
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,960
Master said that

232
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,320
all demons were evil.

233
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,840
But I think

234
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,870
all creatures can be kind and evil.

235
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,720
Yes, yes. You’re much smarter than him.

236
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,910
Don’t criticize my master.

237
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,600
All right.

238
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,560
Let’s...

239
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,990
Let’s be good friends secretly.

240
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,990
All right.

241
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,680
There’s a circle
around the Kunlun Mountains.

242
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,870
What should I do if I want to see you?

243
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,440
Let me teach you the Three-call Spell.

244
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,990
Follow me.

245
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,680
Put your palms together.

246
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,870
Turn.

247
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,990
Clever girl.

248
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,150
Call my name three times.

249
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,870
Qingqing. Qingqing. Qingqing!

250
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,270
When you want to see me,

251
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,440
use the Three-call Spell.

252
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,230
I promise I’ll turn up.

253
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,750
I’ll often summon you, then.

254
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,680
Qingyan,

255
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,510
where are you going?

256
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,960
I...

257
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,440
What are you hiding?

258
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,230
Osmanthus cake?

259
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,320
Give me a piece.

260
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,230
Qingfeng,

261
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,630
may I ask you something?

262
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,510
Do you think

263
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,840
there are kind demons?

264
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,510
According to Master,
all demons are evil.

265
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,910
But think about it.

266
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,680
There’re kind and evil humans.

267
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,800
There must also be kind and evil demons.

268
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,080
You make some sense.

269
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,200
But what Master says

270
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
matters more.

271
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,110
But...

272
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,480
What are you doing here,

273
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
instead of practicing?

274
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,840
Master.

275
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,630
When I was practicing,

276
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,960
I felt hungry.

277
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,150
I asked Qingyan
to get me something to eat.

278
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,150
Lately, demons are raging in town

279
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,800
and have hurt many people.

280
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:27,960
I guess the dragon demon did it.

281
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,200
It has been living nearby for years.

282
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,990
When I track him down,

283
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,680
I’ll take men to kill him.

284
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,960
You two should also practice hard

285
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,910
so that you can kill demons

286
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,560
as soon as possible.

287
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,200
Yes, Master.

288
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,030
Why does my heart hurt

289
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,440
when he mentions the dragon?

290
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,870
Is it delicious?

291
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,200
Yes.

292
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,910
You still remember
I like osmanthus cake?

293
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,230
Remember? What do you mean?

294
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,990
How do you know

295
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,110
I like osmanthus cake?

296
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,230
I guessed.

297
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,720
Because I like it.

298
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,510
I think you like it, too.

299
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,870
So, I’m right about it.

300
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,600
It tastes great.

301
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,080
Enjoy more.

302
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,440
Let me wipe your mouth.

303
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,990
Qingyan!

304
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,080
Qingqing,

305
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,030
my master is coming. Leave immediately.

306
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,360
Qingyan!

307
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,080
Master, you’re looking for me?

308
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,840
Didn’t I ask you to practice?

309
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,320
Why are you here?

310
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,200
The...

311
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,680
The scenery is great here.

312
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,800
Qingyan,

313
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,440
when you were here,

314
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,990
did you feel anything unusual

315
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,390
or did you see anyone?

316
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
No.

317
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,750
That’s weird.

318
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,030
The dragon demon’s smell is near.

319
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,560
Even the Dragon-slaying Sword
can sense it.

320
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,870
Master,

321
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,480
I didn’t see any dragon demon.

322
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,750
Qingyan, I know you’re a kind girl.

323
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,840
But under the circumstances,

324
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,080
I have to tell you something.

325
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,910
You have a special soul

326
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,720
that demons eagerly want.

327
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,200
That’s why

328
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,630
I always tell you that

329
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,150
all demons come to you

330
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,750
with a purpose.

331
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,630
I...

332
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,990
I have a special soul?

333
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,910
So, you must stay away from demons,

334
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,840
especially the dragon demon.

335
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,510
What’s wrong?

336
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,750
Nothing, Master.

337
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,870
You must be very careful.

338
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,910
Thank you for your concern, Master.

339
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,440
Since I took you back,

340
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,150
the dragon demon
has been lingering around.

341
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,110
Dragons have strong bloodline.

342
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,110
If they go the right way,
they’ll be Immortal of Dragon.

343
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,990
If they stay in the human world,
they’ll be evil dragons.

344
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,360
You must keep it in mind.

345
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,200
Yes, Master.

346
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,150
Go on with your practice.

347
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,270
Six day. Seven days. Eight days.

348
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,910
Nine days. Ten days.

349
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,030
Qingyan.

350
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,990
Qingfeng.

351
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,360
You’re turning 18 in a couple of days.

352
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,320
Senior Sister is learning
to steam the peach-shaped cake for you.

353
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,200
Look.

354
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,600
Smells great.

355
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:12,840
Have some, too.

356
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
I don’t like sweet food.
Enjoy it yourself.

357
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,030
Bring my gratitude to her.

358
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,480
How many days did I count?

359
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,840
Yuchi.

360
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,030
On my 18th birthday,

361
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,990
will I see you?

362
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,800
Qingqing. Qingqing.

363
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,910
Qingqing!

364
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,480
Qingqing!

365
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,110
Qingyan, osmanthus cake for me again?

366
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,720
Not osmanthus cake.

367
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,600
Look. Peach-shaped cake.

368
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,390
Peach-shaped cake?

369
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,110
I remember
it’s not your 18th birthday yet.

370
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,600
It’s in a couple of days.

371
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,080
But Senior Sister cares for me.

372
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,270
She made the cake for me in advance.

373
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,560
It’s so nice of her.

374
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,390
Is there anything wrong

375
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,080
with the cake?

376
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,270
No. No.

377
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,320
Then why are you staring at me?

378
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,750
I want to ask you

379
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,600
if it tastes delicious.

380
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,630
Yes. Sure, it does.

381
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,630
Qingqing,

382
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,840
I have something to ask you.

383
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,150
What?

384
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,990
Look at this.

385
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,720
Looks so beautiful.

386
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,110
Is it for me? It’s so sweet of you.

387
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,510
No, no.

388
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,560
It’s not for me?

389
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,270
Well, the style

390
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,560
doesn’t suit me.

391
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,630
Its color suits men more.

392
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,840
Do you really think
it’s suitable for a man?

393
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,870
If I want to give it to someone,

394
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,720
shall I embroider some flowers on it?

395
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,440
As played in the drama,

396
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,600
if an unmarried girl

397
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,910
gives a man something she embroidered,

398
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,150
it’ll be a love token!

399
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,440
Love token?

400
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,270
Who will you give it to?

401
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,910
Who is he and what’s his name?

402
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,030
Who’s there in his family?

403
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,200
The man I told you last time...

404
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,840
Yuchi.

405
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
Him?

406
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,270
He’ll like whatever you give him.

407
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,720
Really?

408
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,390
Yes.

409
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,110
Am I really going to give him
a love token?

410
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,030
Isn’t it too soon?

411
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,560
He won’t realize anything, will he?

412
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,870
What’s on your mind?

413
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,480
Nothing.

414
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,440
Then why are you giggling?

415
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,990
I’m not.

416
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,270
You are.

417
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,320
I’m not.

418
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,600
You are. You are!

419
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,720
I’m not.

420
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,840
Qingqing, I heard that

421
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,110
a dragon demon had appeared nearby.

422
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,910
Then?

423
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,440
Master told me that

424
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,360
no dragons became Immortal of Dragon.

425
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,870
They’re all...

426
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,360
All what?

427
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,630
What’s wrong?

428
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,840
I don’t know why,

429
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,230
but every time I mention a dragon,

430
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,750
my heart hurts.

431
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,870
Did your master tell you that

432
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,720
all dragon demons
were overbearing and cruel?

433
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,270
The dragon demon is overbearing.

434
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,600
But he isn’t cruel,

435
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,720
especially to...

436
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,080
Dragons...

437
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,270
Dragons are nice.

438
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,080
Really?

439
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,990
Yes.

440
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,230
Xue Qianxun, your Three Pearl Leaf Tea.

441
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,600
Drink it.

442
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,840
What’s behind your back?

443
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,560
This is for you.

444
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,080
It’s...?

445
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,990
It’s the feather you took off.

446
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,390
It’s for me?

447
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,680
You gave me a present.

448
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,720
I...

449
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,270
I want to give you a present, too.

450
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,030
The Datura Weaver Ribbon you gave me
is so precious.

451
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,990
My feather is far less valuable.

452
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,320
The Datura Weaver Ribbon
is an external thing.

453
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,390
But the feather is from your body.

454
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,990
It’s precious for sure.

455
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,630
Qingqing,

456
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,230
how are you going
with Heaven Secret Art?

457
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,720
Oh, dear.

458
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,630
Why did he ask about my practice

459
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,080
at such a romantic moment?

460
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,110
What kind of immortal

461
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,110
am I in love with?

462
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,150
The tea is quite bitter.

463
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,030
I’ll go get you some sweetmeats.

464
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Do you know

465
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,390
why I ask you to keep practicing?

466
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,360
Because I’m too weak.

467
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,720
You don’t want others to think
I’m not good enough for you.

468
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,150
Nonsense!

469
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,510
As long as I like you,
you’re good enough for me.

470
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,110
You will die,

471
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,390
unless you become an immortal.

472
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,320
Bird demons have a short life.

473
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,030
But I...

474
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,150
I want to be with you
for thousands of years.

475
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,910
Qingqing,

476
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,560
when you become an immortal,

477
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,390
I want you to marry me.

478
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,960
What are you talking about?

479
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,840
I haven’t promised to marry you so soon.

480
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Qingqing and I in my memories

481
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,990
seem different from what we are now.

482
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,980
(Initial Practicing Method)

483
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,990
You gave me so many books.

484
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,200
Which one

485
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,080
can speed up my practice?

486
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,750
There’re thousands of books here.
I can’t remember all.

487
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,560
Here should be a book
Supreme Ancient Scripture.

488
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,200
You may find a way in it.

489
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,960
Your good friend Qingyan...

490
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,480
She’s turning 18, right?

491
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,360
Yeah.

492
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,680
Not only Dragon King is expecting,
I’m excepting it, too.

493
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,440
Me, too.

494
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,150
