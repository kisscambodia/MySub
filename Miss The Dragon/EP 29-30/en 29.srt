Dragon King must have taken Chenyue

18

back to Dragon Pool to get married.

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,240
No!

20
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,200
I have to prepare the dowry for Chenyue!

21
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,480
It’s not the human world here.

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,560
There is no need for

23
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,240
betrothal gifts and dowry.

24
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,200
Your immortals’ marriage is so boring!

25
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,480
No. Other things can be unnecessary,

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,600
but the red wedding dress and
the love token are indispensable.

27
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,800
They have already had love tokens.

28
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,600
Then, they need red wedding dress!

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,400
I need to go to tell them!

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,160
I’m going!

31
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,550
But the red wedding dress and
the love token are indispensable.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,830
Greetings.

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,760
My Lord, what brings you

34
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,190
to my place?

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,120
Can’t I come for nothing?

36
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,320
You can, of course.

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,190
I’ll just look around.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Enjoy yourself.

My Lord, are you

42
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,630
looking for some treasure?

43
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,350
You get me wrong.

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,400
But now that you mentioned the treasure,

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,240
I’d like to have a look.

Xue Qianxun...

47
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,710
Why doesn’t he admit
he’s coming to look for treasure?

48
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,830
Enjoy it, please.

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,960

They’re all killing weapons.

57
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,400
Is there something elegant?

58
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,120
The Eternity Jade Brush is good.

59
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,240
Qingqing uses no pen,
but an eyebrow pencil.

60
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,630
She won’t like this Jade Brush.

61
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,870
Keep it to yourself

62

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,630
Looks like

64
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,440
you don’t have any treasure

65
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,240
that is elegant or gorgeous.

66
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,800
Are you looking for some treasure

67
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,720
for a girl?

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,070
What a ridiculous thought!

69
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,910
You’re not?

70
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,070
I’m thinking too much, then.

71
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,350
Keep pretending.

72
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,440
What’s in the box?

73
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,310
It’s...

74
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,310
It’s a treasure I just found.

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,960
What?

76
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,310
I can’t see it?

77
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,470
No.

78
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,470
The Datura Weaver Ribbon

79
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,630
has gorgeous and complicated patterns.

80
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,800
I don’t think you’ll like it.

81
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,000
Datura Weaver Ribbon?

82
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,350
How does it function?

83
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,470
It’s made

84
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,870
by Weaver Fairy.

85
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,000
It feels as soft as breeze.

86
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,590
Mostly importantly,

87
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,560
it can cover all kinds of scars
and then disappear.

88
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,400
Its fragrance calms people down, too.

89
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,070
It took me many efforts to find it.

90
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,030
It’s useless to you.

91
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,350
Come and check the Supreme Sword.

92
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,350
No.

93
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,070
I want the Ribbon.

94
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,800
Come on.

95
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,030
Xue Qianxun.

96
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,350
I haven’t enjoyed it yet.

97
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,310
I know your rule.

98
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,190
I must exchange one treasure
with another.

99
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,350
Xue Qianxun!

100
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,680
Why isn’t he in?

101
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,960
What the hell!

102
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,030
It looks so beautiful.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,910
What’s...? What’s this?

104
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,590
The patter of the headband...

105
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,590
And the color...

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,750
How old-fashioned it is!

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,070
He’s always dressed plainly.

108
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,590
But the headband for a girl
looks so ugly.

109
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,590
For a girl?

110
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,560
I’m the girl staying with him,

111
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,720
aren’t I?

112
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,190
He’s giving me a present?

113
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,590
-Give me a present...
-Qingqing?

114
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,720
I come to discuss with you
about the present for Chenyue.

115
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
When I didn’t see you,
I got in directly.

116
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,310
This box looks pretty.

117
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,400
It does?

118
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,590
Yes.

119
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,520
It also looks expensive.

120
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,470
Is it a present for someone?

121
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,120
I didn’t mean to give it to you now.

122
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,470
But it seems that

123
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,870
you like it a lot.

124
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,280
What do you think?

125
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,240
Is it nice?

126
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,280
Yes!

127
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,630
The pattern looks...

128
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,750
beautiful.

129
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,680
The color is...

130
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,270
yellow.

131
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,030
You’re always dressed nicely

132
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,120
and your present for someone

133
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,030
also looks nice.

134
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,240
I’m glad you like it.

135
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,590
This is my love token for you.

136
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,470
Love token?

137
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,270
He gave me a love token?

138
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,120
God, what a surprise!

139
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,760
The color is quite...

140
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,830
Luckily, I’m the prettiest bird.

141
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,470
Close your eyes.

142
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,880
My Meteor mark...

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,830
It’s gone.

144
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,710
It’s really gone!

145
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,150
What’s this?

146
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,760
It must be valuable.

147
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,030
I got it accidentally.

148
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,800
Immortal-trapping Net?

149
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,560
I made it myself.

150
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,680
I’ll exchange it
for the Datura Weaver Ribbon.

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,470
Are you serious?

152
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,270
The Immortal-trapping Net
cost large power.

153
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,950
It took you three hundred years
to make one.

154
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,910
Aren’t you suffering great losses?

155
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,910
Come on.

156
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,200
Take away the Three Pearl Leaf Tea, too.

157
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,470
Thank you, then.

158
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,320
It doesn’t matter.

159
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
I like whatever you give me.

160
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,200
Thank you.

161
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,640
I’m going to help Chenyue
with her wedding.

162
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,390
So beautiful!

163
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,150
Is it you...

164
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,080
Not me.

165
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,710
It’s God’s will.

166
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,880
With the Star Halo as a proof

167
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,510
and the Dragon Pool as the present,

168
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,200
Chenyue,

169
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,150
will you marry me,

170
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,710
and never leave me?

171
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,950
I will.

172
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,080
You’ve given me so many things,

173
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,470
but I have nothing to reward you.

174
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,030
I want nothing,

175
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,800
but you.

176
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,200
I see.

177
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,150
Take my hair and I’ll be with you
now and forever.

178
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,560
Now and forever.

179
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,590
Why did you squeeze me?

180
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,830
Don’t squeeze me.

181
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,710
They nearly kissed.

182
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
Go on. Go on.

183
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,470
-Yes.
-Go on with that.

184
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,080
We’re leaving immediately.

185
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,030
We’re leaving.

186
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,000
Congratulations, Dragon King.

187
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,030
-Congratulations, Dragon King.
-Congratulations on your marriage.

188
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,800
Has the Star Halo satisfied you?

189
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,560
Thank you, Immortal of Rain.
Thank you, everybody.

190
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,350
Dragon King, you get married at last.

191
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,880
We’ll no longer worry

192
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,910
you’ll break into the palace again.

193
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,030
He’s right, Dragon King.

194
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,910
We also helped a lot

195
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,150
with your marriage.

196
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,640
Propose more toasts to us.

197
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,760
No problem.

198
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,640
General, when you get married,

199
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,560
you should follow the mortal way.

200
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,760
It’ll be more interesting

201
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,640
when you wear the red wedding dress,

202
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,880
drink cross-cupped wine
and bow in the wedding.

203
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,390
Dragon King, you’ve already prepared it.

204
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,910
This wedding robe looks so gorgeous.

205
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,710
With so many layers,

206
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,510
it looks terrific.

207
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,830
It was prepared a century ago.

208
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,800
Liuying is me.

209
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,440
I’m Liuying.

210
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,680
Right?

211
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,350
Sure.

212
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,080
This wedding dress looks more beautiful

213
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,030
than the one Consort Yu wore.

214
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,880
Dragon King cares a lot about you.

215
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,030
You’re Liuying.

216
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,030
But you’ve lived a military life.

217
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,680
You must have a different taste.

218
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,950
I guess you’ll like this better.

219
00:15:59,270 --> 00:15:59,950
Yes. Yes.

220
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,760

in this kind of dress.

Thank you, everybody.

245
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,110
We’ve watched you for over a century.

246
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,560
At last, you get married.

247
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,230
Here’s a Karma Stone,

248
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,320
as our wedding present.

249
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,600
Karma Stone?

250
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,840
You broke Matchmaker’s stone?

251
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,560
Nonsense. We didn’t dare to.

252
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,320
You have no idea.

253
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,230
This is quite popular lately.

254
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,600
Use the power
around the real Karma Stone.

255
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,110
Lethe Ice and pottery clay

256
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,560
are mixed

257
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,230
and made into the small Karma Stone.

258
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,030
When the couple’s names
are craved on it,

259
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,600
they’ll always be together

260
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,230
and have unforgettable good luck.

261
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,560
Is that so?

262
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,320
You really know how to live it up.

263
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,230
It’s a great present.

264
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,600
Thank you.

265
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,780
(Longyan)

266
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,840
How beautiful!

267
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,390
You haven’t changed at all.

268
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,910
They’re for you two.

269
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,200
You take this one with his name on.

270
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,480
And you take this one with her name on.

271
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,030
You own him and he owns you.

272
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,460
(Longyan & Chenyue)

273
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,440
Time for the cross-cupped wine.

274
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,680
After that,

275
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,320
you can go back to your bedroom.

276
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,870
Wait!

277
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,840
Wait. Wait.

278
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,840
Dragon King,

279
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,080
I must remind you.

280
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
Your wedding should be in the future,

281
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,630
instead of now.

282
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,630
She’s the soul bred in the world.

283
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,150
Without experiencing in the human world,

284
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,030
how long do you think she can exist?

285
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,480
She lives

286
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,030
as long as I live.

287
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,800
I know you’re going to protect her soul
with your own power

288
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,200
and make her live forever.

289
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,510
But don’t forget.

290
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,110
She’s still the Yin soul
all demons want.

291
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,230
Are you sure you won’t leave her
for even a second?

292
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,600
What do you think

293
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,910
I should do?

294
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,270
When she lives in the human world

295
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,680
and learns arts of immortality,

296
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,270
with your help,

297
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,360
she can become immortal
with a human body.

298
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,480
By then, she can stay with you frankly

299
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,390
and you can never leave each other.

300
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,720
Dragon King, he makes sense.

301
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,840
But...

302
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,390
I agree.

303
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,110
I don’t want to live

304
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,320
under your protection forever.

305
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,080
You can’t defend me

306
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,750
for thousands of years

307
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,200
and never leave me alone.

308
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,600
I don’t want to be your burden.

309
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,680
I want to face everything

310
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,480
with you.

311
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,720
By then,

312
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,630

Besides practicing arts of immortality
and martial arts,

you must remember our rules clearly.

Every member of our sect

355
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,630

no matter when or where.

357
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,360

Yes!

00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,870
Come.

366
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,080
What about you?

367
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,110
Enforce justice and kill...

368
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,750
Kill demons.

369
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,680
Thank you, Qingfeng.

370
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,680
Kill...

371
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,080
Qingyan,

372
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,230
why can’t you even remember
such simple rules?

373
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,990
Master, why must we kill demons?

374
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,990
It’s our duty to kill demons

375
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,150
so that they won’t hurt the human world.

376
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,110
It’s also the natural rule.

377
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,750
What about kind demons?

378
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,510
Can’t we stay with them in peace?

379
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,840
All demons are evil.

380
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,800
Every demon comes to the human world
with a purpose.

381
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,750
I hear that

382
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,480
swallows delivering messages
to Queen Mother of the west

383
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,320
are also demons. But they’re not evil.

384
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,480
Swallows?

385
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,910
They’re domesticated.

386
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,480
They’re different, of course.

387
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,270
We can’t domesticate them
if we kill them.

388
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,360
Anyway,

389
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,600
our duty is to follow the natural rule
and protect common people.

390
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,360
Every member of our sect
must kill all demons they see.

391
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,320
Understand?

392
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,870
I do.

393
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,270
I don’t.

394
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,840
If you don’t,
go out and have a time-out!

395
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,800
Why did Qingyan get punished again?

396
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,080
Don’t go there.

397
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,910
If we get close to her again,

398
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,990
she’ll be more severely guarded.

399
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,360
Then we can’t even peek at her.

400
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,360
But...

401
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,080
No buts!

402
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,390
Look.

403
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,560
Look at her.

404
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,200
Does she look like she’s being punished?

405
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,910
She’s quite enjoying herself.

406
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,680
Master,

407
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,840
I sensed the dragon demon again.

408
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,030
Take some men

409
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,560
to check the circle I set.

410
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,080
Let nothing go wrong.

411
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,150
Master,

412
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,630
why does the dragon demon
approach our sect

413
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,230
again and again?

414
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,960
If the Yin soul is used by demons,

415
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,910
it’ll play a dreadful role.

416
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,440
Demons will have extra power
of one hundred thousand years.

417
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,320
This is why

418
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,750
I brought Qingyan back to us.

419
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,630
I don’t want any ambitious demon

420
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,960
to have the Yin soul.

421
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,960
You mean

422
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,270
the dragon demon comes for Qingyan?

423
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,150
I’m not sure yet.

424
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,910
But he’s indeed getting closer.

425
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,480
Luckily, the Yin soul easily dissipates.

426
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,750
But it’s hard to be taken away.

427
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,720
It must be raised by abundant power,

428
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,720
strengthened by spirit
and protected by aura.

429
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,270
The longer, the purer.

430
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,750
Qingyan is still a little girl.

431
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,320
We don’t need to worry now.

432
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,600
Whoever wants it
won’t take rash action, either.

433
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,870
But the dragon demon...

434
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,230
Don’t bother.

435
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,560
If he takes any unusual action,

436
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,630
I’ll kill him

437
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,110
with my Dragon-slaying Sword.

438
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,750
What are you doing?

439
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,110
I understand how you feel.

440
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,840
It’s hard to wait when failing
to see the destination.

441
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,200
It’s the hardest to wait

442
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,320
when seeing the destination.

443
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,680
You’ve waited for such a long time.

444
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,320
Can’t you wait patiently
for another dozen of years?

445
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,630
Don’t rush to approach Qingyan.

446
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,840
Your strong dragon breath

447
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,150
will hinder her soul development.

448
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,150
Qingyan has a special soul.

449
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,560
She needs the spirit
from the Kunlun Mountains.

450
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,910
After she reached the Foundation Phase
at the age of 18,

451
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,910
she won’t be interfered by your breath.

452
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,960
Then with the help of elixir,

453
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,390
she can enjoy a long life forever

454
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,110
and become an immortal.

455
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,030
Figured umbrellas.

456
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:23,880
Fun, isn’t it?

457
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,220
Yes.

458
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:26,860
Thank you.

459
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,410
Father, look. That’s so fun.

460
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,010
Be careful.

461
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,870
Cosmetics.

462
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,410
Sachets.

463
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,220
Sachets. Pendants.

(Qi’s Jewelry, Yuxing Inn)

465
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,330
Figured umbrellas.

466
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,980
Sachets. Pendants.

467
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,110
Qingyan,

468
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,510
why did you follow me sneakily?

469
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,840
I want to come with you

470
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,230
and visit the fair in town.

471
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,720
I’m not coming to visit the fair.

472
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,150
Demons have appeared lately.

473
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,910
Master asked me to come down
and check on them.

474
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,860
Come with me.

475
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,620
(Qi’s Jewelry, Yuxing Inn)

476
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,750
Qingyan,

477
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,750
I’m getting in and ask for some info.

478
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,630
Stay here and don’t leave.

479
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,840
If you get lost,
I won’t go look for you.

480
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,960
Roasted chestnuts!

481
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,390
Roasted chestnuts!

482
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,680
I can’t go. I can’t go.

483
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,200
She asked me to stay here

484
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,800
and not to leave.

485
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,390
I can’t go. I can’t go.

486
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,390
Sweet and delicious roasted chestnuts!

487
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,230
Sweet roasted chestnuts!

488
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,990
Sweet and delicious roasted chestnuts!

489
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,080
Roasted chestnuts!

490
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,800
Little girl,

491
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,230
you want some roasted chestnuts?

492
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,320
I want to...

493
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,110
Have a look at the dragon tassel.

494
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,080
You want this?

495
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,680
Come closer.

496
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,910
Then you can look more clearly.

497
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,910
Come over.

498
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,600
Girl,

499
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,990
you have such a special soul.

500
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,360
If I eat your soul,
my power will be greatly enhanced.

501
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,360
