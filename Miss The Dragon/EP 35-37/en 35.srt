29

at Introspection Wall

30

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,350
can you come to tell me

Anyone here?

59
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,240
Hello?

60
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,680
Anybody here?

61
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,520
Don’t come in!

62
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,310
Yuchi!

63
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,590
I told you not to come close!

64
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Yuchi,

65
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,800
is it you?

66
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,840
Yuchi, you got hurt?

67
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,520
Mortal,

68
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,840
why are you here

69
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,590
in my place?

70
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,000
Yuchi,

71
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,070
what are you talking about?

72
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,470
Look carefully.

73
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,190
I’m Qingyan!

74
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,470
Qingyan?

75
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,750
I miss you so much.

76
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,910
Yuchi.

77
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,830
You have mistaken me for someone else.

78
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,240
I will never mistake you.

79
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,910
You are Yuchi.

80
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,680
Why don’t you recognize me

81
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,080
after just a few days?

82
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,030
Is it because

83
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,910
you got hurt?

84
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,470
Your body is so hot.

85
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,320
Let me get you some water.

86
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,390
Don’t bother.

87
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,320
You should leave now.

88
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
I need to heal your wounds!

89
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,390
Yuchi,

90
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,680
why are you pretending
you don’t know me?

91
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,830
You are a human.

92
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
I’m a demon.

93
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,390
We are different.

94
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,270
You should go now.

95
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,830
You really don’t know me anymore?

96
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,950
I never keep those

97
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,510
unimportant things in my mind.

98
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
It’s getting dark.

99
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,880
You should go now.

100
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,270
Unimportant things?

101
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,680
Go now!

102
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,830
It’s raining outside.

103
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,510
Can I wait for a moment?

104
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,390
It has already stopped.

105
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,120
But it’s still thundering.

106
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,760
It’s just thunder.

107
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,910
Then…

108
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,640
I’m going.

109
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,800
My mind had been settled as still water

110
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,240
through the previous thousand years.

111
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,080
The only thing that made my heart ripple

112
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,080
was meeting you.

113
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,830
You’re the shimmer in the dark night,

114
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,910
letting me see a glimmer of light.

115
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,830
Wait.

116
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,440
It’s dark outside.

117
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,560
Let me walk you back.

118
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,830
But, your wound…

119
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,680
It’s just Seven Deadly Spell.

120
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,680
I once said to myself that

121
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,510
I would never let anyone else
take care of you.

122
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,440
But this time

123
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,150
I have to break my promise.

124
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,390
I dare not to recognize you
not because I don’t want to,

125
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,880
but I don’t want you to suffer

126
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,150

191
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,880
The Seven Deadly Spell
has hurt me deeply.

192
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,760
I can’t hold on much longer.

193
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,640
Maybe…

194
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,030
I can’t protect you anymore.

195
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,800
Although it’s a torture to wait
and protect you for hundreds of years,

196
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,510
I’m glad to do it.

197
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,590
You gave me the Dragon Pendant.

198
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,350
I give you a sky full of fireflies.

199
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,120
I have got such a beautiful thing

200
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,440
to look forward to

201
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,390
in such a long time.

202
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,390
I have seen your youth,

203
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,470
your wedding,

204
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,150
your happiness

205
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,320
and sadness.

206
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,800
I was insisting on accompanying you
to go the long way,

207
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,510
to watch many fireworks,

208
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,270
but now

209
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,080
we can only stop here.

210
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,240
There are so many things
you can’t deny in this world.

211
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,000
Even though I enjoy the last time

212
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,950
with you so much,

213
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,710
I can only

214
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,080
keep you in my heart now.

215
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,840
Where else could she be
if not in the Kunlun Sect?

216
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,320
With Dragon King.

217
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,600
Where is Dragon King?

218
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,200
With Qingyan.

219
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,200
How dare you!

220
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,910
About the weird things Yuchi said…

221
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,110
Seven Deadly Spell…

222
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,440
It can’t be a normal wound.

223
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,320
I remember reading about it in a book.

224
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
The Seven Deadly Spell is based

225
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
on the sorrow, bitterness, loneliness,
separation, resentment,

226
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,680
hatred and anger, and unstoppable

227
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,910
(Seven Deadly Spell)
with the seven blades of Yin Wind.

228
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,680
The one injured by it
will have all the organs damaged,

229
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,870
the seven apertures blocked

230
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,360
and be slowly suffocated and dead.

231
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,800
So, Yuchi will die?!

232
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,180
(Mind-clearing Spell)

233
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,800
Yuchi.

234
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,560
I must be dizzy now.

235
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,480
It looks like

236
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,440
you’re standing in front of me
and smiling at me again.

237
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,720
You didn’t see it wrong.

238
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,390
I’m back.

239
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,440
Didn’t I tell you to leave

240
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,720
and not come back?

241
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,480
I won’t leave.

242
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,910
You told me

243
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,720
parting needed to be faced with.

244
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,110
But, I want to ask you,

245
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,680
if you don’t have much time left,

246
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,150
what do you want to do?

247
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,390
If it were me,

248
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
I’d want to stay with my beloved one.

249
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,110
Why bother letting your beloved one

250
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,390
suffer the pain of parting?

251
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,990
Parting is painful.

252
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,110
But if you can’t even share the pain

253
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,800
with your beloved one,

254
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,600
isn’t it another kind of pain?

255
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,600
I’m afraid the time left is too short

256
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,990
to say anything before

257
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,510
we say goodbye.

258
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,510
Even if only for a moment.

259
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,110
But this moment

260
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,960
is precious to me.

261
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,440
I think it’s worth it.

262
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,080
Sometimes,

263
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,440
a lifetime feels like a moment.

264
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,200
But sometimes,

265
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,480
a moment is eternal.

♪Do I have repeated lives

267

feels like a moment.

269
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,450

eternally in my heart.

276
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,840
No matter how short our time

277
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,440
together will be,

278
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,960
I want to be by your side.

279
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,200
I’m not afraid of the pain of parting.

280
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,360
I’m only afraid that

281
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,720
I can’t be with your

282
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,680

I don’t know why.

304
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,030
I feel so familiar with this place.

305
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,870
It’s like I’ve been here before.

306
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,030
What’s on your mind?

307
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,110
I don’t have much wealth.

308
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,680
I only have this Dragon Pool

309
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,270
and my thousand-year power.

310
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,030
I hope you don’t mind.

311
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,320
I don’t care about that.

312
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,320
I only care about you.

313
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,390
Now you have known that I’m a demon.

314
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,910
I saw your Dragon Horn that day.

315
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,840
Then, will you be responsible for me?

316
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,680
Responsible?

317
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,110
Don’t you know that?

318
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,870
The play says that

319
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,990
if a man looks at a woman’s body,

320
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,270
the woman loses her chastity.

321
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,440
Then the man has to be responsible
for the woman

322
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,960
and will definitely marry her.

323
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,390
Now you have seen my horn.

324
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,600
I’ve lost my chastity.

325
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,270
I just saw your horn.

326
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,440
It’s not so bad like
you lost your chastity.

327
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,150
About my chastity,

328
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,150
if you want it,

329
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,910
I’m happy to give it to you.

330
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,230
I don’t really want it.

331
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
I have so many things I want to do,

332
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,230
but I don’t know which one to do first.

333
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:52,840
Then, do the one
you want me to do the most.

334
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,600
Where are we going now?

335
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
To see the beautiful place
in your dream.

336
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,320
Don’t be afraid.

337
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,480
I’m here with you.

338
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,220
(Luofeng Pavilion)

339
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,960
Finally! You’re awake.

340
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,720
Where is Xue Qianxun?

341
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,230
Lord left with Immortal of Fate.

342
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,680
Where did they go?

343
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,870
I didn’t ask.

344
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,480
But, Lord looked weird.

345
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,990
I thought something was wrong.

346
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,200
Can you find him?

347
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,960
Xue Qianxun! Xue Qianxun! Xue Qianxun!

348
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,390
Even the Three-call Spell can’t work.

349
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,360
He must be in a trouble.

350
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,030
My feather!

351
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,910
What are you doing?

352
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,800
I’m activating my inner core

353
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,030
to take my feather back to my body.

354
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,720
Then I can have the strength
to go find Xue Qianxun.

355
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,270
But, you can only get a temporary

356
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,480
effect by absorbing the power so fast,

357
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,360
and it will affect your longevity!

358
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,680
Xue Qianxun didn’t answer
my Three-call Spell.

359
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,910
He must be in a trouble!

360
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,600
Do me a favor, please!

361
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,750
It’s so beautiful!

362
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,840
How I wish

363
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,560
time can stop at

364
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,510
this moment.

365
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,910
Although this moment is beautiful,

366
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,990
I wish

367
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,360
you can have more beautiful moments.

368
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,720
I have had.

369
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,440
This feeling is so familiar,

370
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,200
as if I’ve dreamed

371
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,390
of it before.

372
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,720
It’s not a dream.

373
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,840
In fact, I’ve been with you
for a long time.

374
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,110
We did

375
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,630
fall in love with each other here.

376
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,270
But back then, we could only

377
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,320
be each other’s passerby.

378
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,630
And now,

379
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,630
we can finally have each other.

380
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,840
How come I don’t know any

381
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,360
of what you’re talking about?

382
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,990
There are things

383
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,150
that just need to be known by me alone.

384
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,230
I don’t like this.

385
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
I hope I can bear all the things

386
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,320
together with you in the future.

387
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,560
I promise.

388
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,480
How did you

389
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,680
fall in love with me at the beginning?

390
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,320
Because you are my destiny.

391
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,870
I want to be with you forever.

392
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,750
Just like this.

393
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,230
What’s wrong?

394
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
I don’t know.

395
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,480
Feels like some kind of power

396
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,270
is tearing me.

397
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,630
Someone is putting his hand
to your soul.

398
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,680
Show up.

399
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,870
Surprise!

400
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,230
Just because of the Yin Soul,

401
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,320
when I asked you
for the Book of Fate of Liuying,

402
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,870
you said you didn’t have it.

403
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,480
You’ve been coveting it

404
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,270
since then, right?

405
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,390
I just didn’t want you to have

406
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,230
too many entanglements

407
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,510
with that mortal girl at that time.

408
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,840
You used me to help her
become a princess,

409
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,360
nourishing her soul with the noble power
of the royal family.

410
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,800
Then you let her be born
in the general’s family

411
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,480
to strengthen her essence.

412
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,270
And in the end you arranged her
to cultivate immortality,

413
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,110
nourishing her soul
with the spirit power

414
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,630
of the Kunlun Sect.

415
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,600
The purer her soul is,

416
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,230
the more power you will gain.

417
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,750
That’s right.

418
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,800
With the nourishment of noble power,

419
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,230
the power of strong essence
and the protection of spirit power,

420
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,870
the Yin Soul can be mature enough.

421
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,030
If it can be used by the people

422
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,960
with cultivation like me,

423
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,110
it can become a heaven defying thing.

424
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,800
By then,

425
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,750
I’ll be no longer the Immortal of Fate,

426
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,990
but the master of the whole world!

427
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,840
During all these years,

428
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,990
aren’t you afraid that someone else
will take her away?

429
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,230
You’re here with her.

430
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,200
You’re such an infatuated one.

431
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,840
You’re so scheming.

432
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,680
I’m scheming?

433
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,030
How was I treating you

434
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,110
before you met Liuying?

435
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,320
We’ve been friends for years.

436
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,080
Don’t force me.

437
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,510
You’re hurt by Seven Deadly Spell.

438
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,600
What else can you do?

439
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,720
Darn it!

440
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,960
So, he was just trying
to cast blindfold spell

441
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,360
by having such a long talk with me.

442
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,990
I’d like to see where else you can hide!

443
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,190
Immortal of Fate wants
to take Qingyan’s soul away.

444
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,840
I thought about it.

445
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,360
This is the safest place.

446
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,880
You dragon demon!
How dare you talk nonsense!

447
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,430
Immortal of Fate is an immortal!
Not a demon!

448
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,510
Why would he want Qingyan’s soul?

449
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,030
I warn you…

450
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,270
Priest Xuanyang,

451
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,230
please help me take good care
of her in the future.

452
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,190
Qingyan is my apprentice.

453
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,880
I will take care of her.

454
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,400
Qingyun, bring me
the greatest treasure of our sect.

455
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,230
Gather all the disciples.

456
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,670
I will set up a barrier
with everyone’s power.

457
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,950
No immortal or demon

458
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,270
will be allowed to step in.

459
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,360
Yes.

460
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,160
Before that,

461
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,400
I’ll help you hold them back.

462
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,270
You?

463
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,360
You’re hurt badly.

464
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,320
No big deal.

465
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,270
Alright, I’ll lead you out.

466
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,990
Qingfeng, be on guard.

467
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,950
Yes.

468
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,560
Yuchi Longyan,

469
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,430
we’ve been friends for a thousand years.

470
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,120
Once I get the soul,

471
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,400
you can join me to rule
the three worlds!

472
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,400
If you dare to hurt Qingyan,

473
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,120
I will make you disappear!
