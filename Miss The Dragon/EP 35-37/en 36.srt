17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,200
Immortal of Fate wants to take
Qingyan’s soul away.

18
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,750
I thought about it.

19
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,310
This is the safest place.

20
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,840
You dragon demon!
How dare you talk nonsense!

21
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,240
Immortal of Fate is an immortal!
Not a demon!

22
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,390
Why would he want Qingyan’s soul?

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
I warn you…

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,160
Priest Xuanyang,

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,160
please help me to take good care
of her in the future.

26
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,160
Qingyan is my apprentice.

27
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,800
I will take care of her.

28
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,350
Qingyun, bring me the
greatest treasure of our sect.

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,120
Gather all the disciples.

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
I will set up a barrier with
everyone’s power.

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,990
No immortal or demon

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,070
will be allowed to step in.

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,320
Yes.

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,120
Before that,

35
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,240
I’ll help you to hold them back.

36
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,040
Yuchi Longyan,

37
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,800
we’ve been friends for a thousand years.

38
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,430
Once I get the soul,

39
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,710
you can join me to rule
the three worlds!

40
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,710
If you dare to hurt Qingyan,

41
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,350
I will make you disappear!

42
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,120
What a waste of our friendship.

43
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,960
Up to you now.

44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,680
Wake up!

45
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,030
He won’t wake up.

46
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,630
Even if he wakes up,
he won’t forgive you.

47
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,750
After all, he becomes like this
because of you.

48
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,240
Why am I here?

49
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,680
Master,

50
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,310
where is the man who took my back?

51
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,870
You shouldn’t get anxious.
Calm down.

52
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,280
Master, just tell me.

53
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,960
I will go find him if you don’t tell me.

54
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,190
Master! Let go of me!

55
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,000
Qingyan,

56
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,120
the one who took you back
is not a human!

57
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,470
He is a dragon demon!

58
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,400
Master,

59
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,440
you know he is a dragon demon?

60
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,070
Did you hurt him?

61
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,680
He approaches you

62
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,280
just for your soul!

63
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,400
Fortunately, I found it in time

64
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,400
and didn’t get you hurt.

65
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,630
Master, it’s impossible!

66
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,150
He has been protecting me
for hundreds of years.

67
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,590
He will never hurt me.

68
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,680
Don’t you remember what I told you?

69
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,400
Human and demon are different.

70
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,000
Master, our love for each other
is true and sincere!

71
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,120
He got hurt by Seven Deadly Spell.

72
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
I have to help him!

73
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,310
You’re bewitched by him.

74
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,070
I forbid you to go to him again.

75
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,590
Just play the Mind-clearing Song

76
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,870
here alone to calm down.

77
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,030
Master!

78
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,280
Master!

79
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,590
Master!

80
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,400
Master!

81
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,070
Master!

82
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,400
Master! Let me out!

83
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,400
You’re hurt by Seven Deadly Spell.

84
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,400
If you use your power at this time,

85
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,910
you will be killing yourself.

86
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,240
It’s going to be a tough battle,

87
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,120
but I can delay it

88
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,590
as much as I can.

89
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,030
Put it into the barrier.

90
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,630
You will die soon

91
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,120
without your inner core!

92
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,350
This may be the last time

93
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,240
I do my best to protect her.

94
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,680
What should I tell her if she asks

95
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,280
about you after she wakes up?

96
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,960
Tell her to forget about me.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Tell her that

98
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,310
I approached her

99
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,910
just for her soul.

100
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,030
Aren’t you afraid that
she will misunderstand you?

101
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,400
As long as I can make her forget me.

102
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,440
I don’t want her to live in pain.

103
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,150
I’m ashamed

104
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,960
of my prejudice in the past.

105
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,000
Master! Let me out!

106
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,240
Master!

107
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,240
Master!

108
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,720
You can’t leave Yuchi

109
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,310
there alone!

110
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,070
Master!

111
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,120
Master! Let me go out!

112
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,470
Master!

113
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,400
Master…

114
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,640
You integrated your inner core
into the barrier?

115
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,440
You really want to die!

116
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,200
Since

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,590
you don’t want to live anymore,

118
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,080
I don’t have to show mercy on you.

119
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,150
Master said you couldn’t leave!

120
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,800
No one can stop me today!
Step aside!

121
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,880
No! You can’t leave here!

122
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,800
The entire Kunlun Mountain
is protected by a barrier.

123
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,200
Master.

124
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,950
Senior, I’m sorry.

125
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,640
Yuchi,

126
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,080
I hate you!

127
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,030
I hate you!

128
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,710
Not because of your ridiculous excuse

129
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,640
of approaching me on purpose

130
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,030
for my soul,

131
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,760
but because you want to
hide it from me again.

132
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,440
You are

133
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,440
facing something alone again.

134
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,240
Didn’t we agree to share it together?

135
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,880
Don’t try to leave me alone again!

136
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,270
You’re looking for death!

137
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,950
Qingyan!

138
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,240
We promised

139
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,950
to face it together.

140
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,150
It’s too late.

141
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,470
Once Immortal-trapping Net
is started,

142
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,510
nothing can stop it.

143
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,880
You disappointed me a lot.

144
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,880
You should be happy for me.

145
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,150
I’m about to be the supreme King

146
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,560
of the three worlds!

147
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,950
You said you would marry me.

148
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,470
But, I can’t wait till that day now.

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,320
that caused all of this!

191
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,990
I will make you pay back

192
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,150
for all these!

193
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,360
Xue Qianxun! Stop!

194
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,990
Dragon King!

195
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,750
Are you going to kill him?

196
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,270
Xue Qianxun! Xue Qianxun!

197
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,680
No! No!

198
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,800
I won’t let you get yourself killed!

199
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,510
Xue Qianxun!

200
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,110
Wake up!

201
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,390
Xue Qianxun!

202
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,080
Emperor!

203
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,840
Help me!

204
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,750
Yuchi Longyan has absorbed the Yin Soul

205
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,360
and is going to rebel!

206
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,910
Emperor!

207
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,800
I don’t want to die! I…

208
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,030
You took her away from my world!

209
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,750
I will now return

210
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,630
all this pain to you

211
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,990
a hundred times,

212
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,600
a thousand times!

213
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,320
Xue Qianxun!

214
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,440
Xue Qianxun! You…

215
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,960
Wake up…

216
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,080
Qingqing,

217
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,390
it’s so good to see you.

218
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,630
You can’t die.

219
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,230
Hang in there.

220
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,030
I’m the Lord of Luofeng Pavilion.

221
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,320
I won’t die.

222
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,390
Don’t leave me here alone.

223
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,910
Don’t cry.

224
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,600
I remember you said

225
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,030
I look good when I smile.

226
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,390
Xue Qianxun!

227
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Deep love will be broken.
Fate can’t be decided by himself.

228
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,080
The Star against the Heaven
will be lonely with a cursed kiss.

229
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,390
But if you’re willing to die for each other,

230
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,110
this curse

231
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,270
can be reversed.

232
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,840
A bloody kiss can reverse the curse.

233
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,800
The Lonely Star can be
against the Heaven.

234
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,910
Your fate is in your own hand.

235
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,360
The deep love is a sure thing.

236
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,870
Qing.

237
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,480
I first met you a hundred years ago.

238
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,360
The bride was not you

239
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,630
when I was the groom,

240
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,150
and the groom was not me

241
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,080
when you were the bride.

242
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,990
I had prepared the most beautiful
wedding for you,

243
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,510
but now

244
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,560
I can’t wear the red dress for you,

245
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,110
but I can only wear the
mourning clothes for you.

246
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,800
What’s the point of living

247
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,390
with only me left?

248
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,800
If I can’t remember you in my next life,

249
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,800
you must remind me early

250
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,440
of our promise.

251
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,150
I will.

252
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,200
I’ll seize you tightly.

253
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,360
Hope you’ll be well prepared.

254
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,720
I’m now by your side,

255
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,630
reminding you every moment,

256
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,360
but you don’t remember our promise.

257
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,960
Bold Yuchi Longyan!

258
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,510
How dare you absorb the Yin Soul!

259
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,440
The rebellious act against the heaven

260
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,720
will get yourself destroyed!

261
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,800
That is…

262
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,600
Supreme Thunder.

263
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,110
It can crush all things

264
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,320
and all souls.

265
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,600
Nothing can withstand it.

266
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,990
We could have been together.

267
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,440
But the heaven broke us up.

268
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,390
Since the heaven broke us up,

269
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,910
I will get justice from it!

270
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,680
The heaven

271
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,030
has deceived my for three lifetimes!

272
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,080
I will make you pay back

273
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,960
what I have lost doubly!

274
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,680
All the demons and ghosts!

275
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,840
Gather and work for me!

276
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,840
He is summoning the resentment
of the demons and ghosts!

277
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,270
Under the Supreme Thunder,

278
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,840
everything will become ashes.

279
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,990
Their souls

280
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,870
are destroyed.

281
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,910
Actually…

282
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,110
Isn’t Dragon King stupid?

283
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,360
How could he fight against the heaven?

284
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,800
If he pled with the Emperor,

285
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,750
there might be some chance
of reviving Liuying.

286
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,480
Immortals have the most
magic treasures, right?

287
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:56,840
But…

288
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,870
I know.

289
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,440
Don’t comfort me.

290
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,960
It’s not his style to

291
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,870
talk nicely and beg someone humbly.

292
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,110
But, I think,

293
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,750
that’s all?

294
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,720
He had waited for hundreds of years.

295
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,030
But, this is how it ends?

296
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,480
It’s not like that…

297
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,360
No.

298
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,510
Don’t tell me that

299
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,720
they once had each other at least.

300
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,270
They should be together
for at least one lifetime.

301
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,230
I agree.

302
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,870
So,

303
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,320
look.

304
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,200
What’s this?

305
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,480
I just used the Immortal-trapping Net

306
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,990
to take in their souls.

307
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,030
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

308
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,440
Tell you earlier?

309
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,030
You didn’t allow me to.

310
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,320
Great! They can finally

311
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,870
be together!

312
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,270
And I don’t need to fix the Sky Net.

313
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,440
I’ll leave the job to the two of them.

314
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:19,780
Yes.

315
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,020
