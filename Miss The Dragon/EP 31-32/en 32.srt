17
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,160
Bold wolf demon!

18
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,710
Smells so good! It’s the Yin Soul!

19
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,560
You come to me yourself!

20
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,270
Garuda Flower?!

21
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,680
You deceitful cat demon!

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,120
I’ll take you back!

23
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,120
Yuchi!

24
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
Leave it to me.

25
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,400
Yuchi! Let me help you!

26
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,960
Yuchi, you got hurt!

27
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,040
It’s fine.

28
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,990
Let me walk you home.

29
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
You got poisoned by the wolf.

30
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,680
You need to sit in meditation
and adjust breath to recover.

31
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,800
Let me help you with my herbs.

32
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,400
Ouch! It hurts!

33
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,720
You look like the one who got hurt.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,720
It’s fine. Don’t worry.

35
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,190
How could I not?

36
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,030
The wolf poison is strong.

37
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,310
I’ll recover in days.

38
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,590
Don’t move!

39
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,630
You know what?

40
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,870
If you dare to escape again,

41
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,000
I will not spare you.

42
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:01,840
Rest assured.

43
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,240
I’m clear about grudges and kindness.

44
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,680
Since you have saved my life,

45
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,910
I won’t run away again.

46
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,120
You don’t need to tie me up.

47
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,520
It’s you!

48
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,630
It’s been more than 200 years.

49
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,470
I can’t believe you are still with her.

50
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,190
She is the cat Liuying saved.

51
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,910
Wait.

52
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,400
You don’t have inner core.
You’re just an ordinary person.

53
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,520
How could you still be together?

54
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,800
200 years?

55
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,350
Are you taking me as that Liuying again?

56
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,800
I’m Qingyan.

57
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,240
How could I…

58
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,120
Shut up!

59
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,870
Maybe I really mistook you for her.

60
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,400
Yuchi, are you alright?

61
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,470
I’m fine.

62
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,870
Your injury can no longer be delayed.

63
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,030
I’ll go collect some herbs.

64
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,870
Wait.

65
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,590
It’s such a tiring work.

66
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,120
Just let the cat do it.

67
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,750
Yes, I can go do it.

68
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,190
You?

69
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,520
Can you recognize the herbs?

70
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,120
You just want to escape!

71
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,470
I won’t!

72
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,560
But it’s good if I can have someone

73
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
to help me.

74
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,240
You! What did you do to me?

75
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,000
I sealed your power up.

76
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,190
If you dare to escape again,

77
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,470
I will not spare you!

78
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,350
Yuchi, have a rest.

79
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I’ll be back soon.

80
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,680
Thanks.

81
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,190
Let’s go.

82
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,310
If you get Qingyan tired,

83
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,000
wait and see how I will punish you.

84
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,280
Luckily, there are many herbs
in the mountain.

85
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,720
Kitty!

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,350
So cute!

87
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,840
Seems that
they have been hungry for long.

88
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,400
Newborn kittens should not

89
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,310
leave their mother for too long.

90
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,590
They will die.

91
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,000
I’ll go find their mother.

92
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,240
So, you’re hungry?

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,750
Don’t worry.

94
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,840
Your mom is coming back soon.

95
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,960
Why are you back so soon?

96
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,070
Where is their mom?

97
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,630
She died.

98
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,910
Just under the tree over there.

99
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,070
She went to find food,

100
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,120
but died by the trap
set by animal hunters.

101
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,240
What about these kittens now?

102
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,470
Humans only keep hurting us.

103
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,750
Actually, there are both

104
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,960
good people and bad people.

105
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,800
My sister, Chengcheng,

106
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,310
lost her mom when she was

107
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,120
as little as them.

108
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
Luckily, I picked her up

109
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,680
and made her the name Chengcheng.

110
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,030
From that on,

111
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,000
we have relied on each other
and become sisters.

112
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,390
However,

113
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,800
she was still killed by

114
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,880
you people from Kunlun.

115
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,440
Don’t be sad.

116
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,350
I hope you can meet her again

117
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,120
after she goes through the tribulation
to her next life.

118
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,910
I know I have to go back
to Kunlun with you.

119
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
But, Qingyan,

120
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,710
please give me some time,

121
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,910
so I can help them

122
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,470
find another mom cat
who can take care of them.

123
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,680
Can I?

124
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,950
Alright.

125
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,200
Thank you, Qingyan!

126
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,590
Then let’s pretend that

127
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,200
I have never met you.

128
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,710
Take good care of them.

129
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,080
A mere wolf demon can actually hurt you?

130
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,830
Why is your power so weak that you can’t

131
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,350
get rid of the wolf poison yourself?

132
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,830
Did Qingyan use Golden Eagle Dagger?

133
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Qingyan has found
that you are the Dragon King?

134
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,590
Did you take the Soul-devouring Fan
with you?

135
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,440
Lend it to me for two days.

136
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,950
To cover your Dragon Breath again?

137
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,120
I’m by Qingyan’s side.

138
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Xuanyang will come

139
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,350
to kill me with Dragon-slaying Sword.

140
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,710
Thanks.

141
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,640
The Golden Eagle Dagger you said
must be dangerous.

142
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,950
What if she hurts you?

143
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,350
She won’t!

144
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,150
Qingyan knows that I’m bird demon.

145
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,320
But we are now good friends.

146
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,320
She won’t hurt me.

147
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,120
But he has already got hurt.

148
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
No, you can’t stay by Qingyan’s side.

149
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,800
Go back with me.

150
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,150
No! I won’t! I don’t want to!

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,120
No!

152
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,440
No!

153
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,240
I’m here to see Qingyan.

154
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,270
You have so much work to do
in Luofeng Pavilion.

155
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,710
You’d better go back now.

156
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,470
Who is she?

157
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
No way. I have to find the answer.

158
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,080
I just pushed him lightly.

159
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,800
He just really left again.

160
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,420
(Luofeng Pavilion)

161
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,760
The Lonely Star was absent
without leave,

162
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,390
being punished by removing the position
of the Heavenly General,

163
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,950
taking out a rib and making a lute

164
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,030
to accompany him to reflect on his sin.

165
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,000
He drank the Lethe Tea willingly

166
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,950
to forget all the past

167
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,830
and was stationed at Luofeng Pavilion
for 3,000 years.

168
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,140
(Punishment of the Lonely Star)

169
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,240
It’s weird.

170
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,910
The details of this case are missing!

171
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,880
Immortal, did you find the

172
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
missing passage of the Punishment
of the Lonely Star?

173
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,510
Why did I leave
Terrace of Goddess Nuwa back then?

174
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,910
I have searched for a long time,

175
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,470
but I really can’t find it.

176
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,760
But,

177
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,440
I heard that some
of the Immortal Swallows

178
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,390
know about it.

179
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,080
I can help you ask about it.

180
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,470
Thank you.

181
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,640
My pleasure.

182
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,940
(Chronology)

183
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,460
(Punishment of the Lonely Star)

184
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,100
(Left Terrace when Immortal Qingqing
was trapped by Evil Spirits…)

185
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,830
Qingqing!

186
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,000
What brings you here?

187
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,150
I didn’t even call you.

188
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,440
How do you know I’m here?

189
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,350
I heard there were
bad wolf demons nearby,

190
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,510
so I came to have a check.

191
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,270
But surprisingly,

192
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,000
I feel your breath here.

193
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,800
So, here I am!

194
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,240
But, there is only

195
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,830
someone I don’t know inside.

196
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,080
He is Yuchi I mentioned to you before.

197
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,390
Come on, let’s talk inside.

198
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,320
Yuchi.

199
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,910
This is my friend, Qingqing.

200
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,710
She is not an ordinary human.

201
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,910
She is a bird demon.

202
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,270
We are secret friends.

203
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Hi, Ms. Qingqing.

204
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,760
I’ll go make you the medicine.

205
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,470
Hot! It’s too hot!

206
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,830
-Too hot!
-Come here.

207
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,590
Give me that.

208
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,470
What’s this? It’s so dark

209
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,200
and smells so bad.

210
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,800
It’s the medicine made of herbs.

211
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,950
Herbs?

212
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,800
Let me try.

213
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,680
What’s this?

214
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,320
It’s too bitter!

215
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,320
I need water!

216
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,950
Why do you humans

217
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,350
drink such a terrible thing?

218
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,200
Yuchi, take it.

219
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,120
It can help you with the wolf poison.

220
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,440
Yes, right.

221
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,560
Yuchi, drink it now.

222
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,320
Alright.

223
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,470
Be careful of the heat.

224
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,590
Qingyan!

225
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,680
Qingyan!

226
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,710
What’s wrong?

227
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,710
Qingyan,

228
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,080
there… there are a bunch
of wolf demons at the gate,

229
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,320
saying to eat you!

230
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,200
You… You should leave now!

231
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,270
Eat me?

232
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,710
Ridiculous! With Dragon…

233
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,120
With me here, who dares?

234
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,880
You are the one that day…

235
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,680
Yes.

236
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,560
I’m the prettiest bird demon
in the world!

237
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,390
Why are you here?

238
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,440
Of course I should be here.

239
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,800
Qingyan is my friend.

240
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,080
Anyway, let’s leave now.

241
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,990
Calm down.

242
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,630
Where are those demons from?

243
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,960
Come on, let’s go have a check.

244
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,110
Come on. Let’s go together.

245
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,960
These are…

246
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,990
All those demons?

247
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,270
They were obviously

248
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,270
burnt to ashes by the Dragon Fire.

249
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,080
To protect Qingyan,

250
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,320
Dragon King left none of them alive.

251
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,870
Looks like they can’t eat us now.

252
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,800
It’s fine.

253
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,960
Let’s go back now.

254
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,510
Come on.

255
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,600
I left Yuchi

256
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,510
alone there!

257
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,800
I need to be back now!

258
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,750
Thank you for coming to inform us.

259
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Liuying is my benefactor.

260
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,480
I will do anything to help
my benefactor out of trouble.

261
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,030
Liuying?

262
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,990
Your benefactor?

263
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,030
Yuchi!

264
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,960
Luckily you’re fine.

265
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
Why does his face feel hot?

266
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,720
He is having a fever!

267
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,600
Is it because of the wolf poison?

268
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,270
What to do now?

269
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,600
Master said that

270
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,480
fever might hurt the brain.

271
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,230
Senior said skin scraping
could bring down a fever.

272
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,720
Wait for me!

273
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,630
Skin scraping?

274
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,030
What’s that?

275
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,800
I need to take off my clothes?

276
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
What… What is she doing?

277
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,510
Why is he still so hot?

278
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,270
Senior said

279
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,990
covering more and sweating more

280
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,440
could also cure the fever.

281
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,510
Yuchi,

282
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,080
let me get you another quilt.

283
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,990
Is this how humans

284
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,110
treat themselves when they are sick?

285
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,750
You’re sweating now!

286
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,230
Hot.

287
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,750
It’s really hot.

288
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,560
You’re getting better.

289
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,110
I’m not!

290
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,680
My heart is beating faster

291
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,910
and I feel hotter now.

292
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,560
Why are you sweating this much?

293
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,510
Come on!

294
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,320
We are both Liuying’s old friends!

295
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,230
Yes!

296
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,960
I didn’t expect to meet you here!

297
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,870
Come on!

298
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,560
Another toast! Cheers!

299
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,680
Cheers!

300
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,720
This is to you for Qingyan.

301
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,990
Loyal friend!

302
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,230
Cheers!

303
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,080
Look at you.

304
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,750
You’re really a loyal friend.

305
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,840
Qingyan has already let you go,

306
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,150
but you came back again tonight
to help her.

307
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,440
Wait! One more toast!

308
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,840
Of course.

309
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,560
I will do anything to help
my benefactor out of trouble.

310
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,840
You’re so loyal!

311
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,870
I’ll definitely make friends with you!

312
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,030
Let’s finish this pot!

313
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,110
Cheers!

314
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,560
-Nice!
-Great!

315
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,750
So happy!

316
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,750
It’s such a happy night!

317
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,510
Yes!

318
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,440
Let’s continue tomorrow!

319
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,480
Yes!

320
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,510
Tonight we just had a good time.

321
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,200
Tomorrow, we should have

322
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,080
-the best time ever!
-Best ever!

323
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,560
The best time ever!

324
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,800
Qingqing.

325
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,480
Xue Qianxun?

326
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,600
Your best time ever?

327
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,480
Where did you get drunk
like a drunk cat?

328
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,630
Just in the woods over there.

329
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,200
And, I’m not a drunk cat.

330
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
She is

331
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,150
the drunk cat.

332
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,630
Do you know how long I have been
waiting for you here?

333
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,630
You didn’t tell me you’d come.

334
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,560
Let’s go inside the room.

335
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,560
How dare you be drunk like this!

336
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,150
Don’t do this again.

337
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,960
Why didn’t you take the sachet
I gave you with you?

338
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,230
Sachet?

339
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,990
It’s here.

340
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,150
I took it off when I changed my clothes.

341
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,800
This sachet must not leave you.

342
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,230
Remember?

343
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,480
I know.

344
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,680
You…

345
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,110
You cast Tracing Spell on it.

346
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,510
No wonder you can find me

347
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,510
immediately no matter where I go.

348
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,030
You are so active and nosy.

349
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,200
No one knows what kind of trouble
you might get into.

350
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,720
I… I… I…

351
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,840
I have Three-call Spell.

352
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,800
I will call you if I’m in danger.

353
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,960
What if you pass out?

354
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,320
Anyway, only when I can find you
at any time

355
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,510
can I feel at ease.

356
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,800
At ease?

357
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,480
Alright.

358
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,360
I will take it with me
wherever I go, alright?

359
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,910
I’ll take it with me when I eat, walk,

360
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,720
sleep, and do everything.

361
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,870
I’ll take it as you
and hold it all the time.

362
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,510
Qingyan

363
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,230
is sleeping in Dragon King’s room.

364
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,230
Then, let’s go to sleep, too!

We birds

are not so finicky like humans.

371
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,600
There are no unnecessary formalities
between males and females.

372
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,390
And, we birds

373
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,240

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,030
we can also kiss.

377
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,990
♪The heart beats fast and deafening♪

378
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,200
♪Wait until the red sunset♪

384

After so long,

385
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,910
now you are not picky about beds.

386
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,960
But you still only recognize me.

387
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,720
You haven’t changed at all.

388
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,990
You! Why are you in my bed?

389
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,630
I…

390
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,510
Don’t get close!

391
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,600
Get out of it!

392
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,320
What did you do to me?

393
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,200
I…

394
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,150
You what?

395
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,200
How could you not
get my consent before…?

396
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,630
You have to be responsible for me!

397
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,110
Coming!

398
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,800
-Qingqing, good morning!
-Marble?

399
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,990
It’s early in the morning.
What’s the matter?

400
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,480
You said you liked my

401
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,560
hair clasp last night, didn’t you?

402
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,840
I bought you the same one in the market!

403
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,910
Yeah, right, last night.

404
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,390
You still remember it?

405
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,110
You’re so nice.

406
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,080
We are friends. Don’t say that.

407
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,200
Qingqing, why is your face

408
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,630
so blushed?

409
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,870
It’s a mosquito bite!

410
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,680
Let me help you comb your hair.

411
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,230
It’s brighter in the yard.
Let’s go to the yard.

412
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,110
You really decide to let me go?

413
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,360
You came back to tell me

414
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
there was a danger.

415
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,750
That means you are a kind one.

416
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,390
I’ll let you go this time.

417
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,510
But you have to be good in the future.

418
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,440
We can have another good talk next time.

419
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,720
About the past of 200 years ago.

420
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,440
Then,

421
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,800
see you.

422
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,270
Your sister is killed
by people from Kunlun.

423
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,480
Don’t you want to avenge her?

424
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,480
As long as Qingyan is not harmed

425
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,910
and I can avenge my sister,

426
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,230
I’ll do whatever I can.

427
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,800
Qingyan!

428
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,030
I’ve called you three times.

429
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,390
Why are you still in bed?

430
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,600
Qingyan?

431
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,910
Qingyan!

432
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,320
Qingyan!

433
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,110
What’s wrong with Qingyan?

434
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,200
I don’t know why.

435
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,150
I can’t wake her up anyway.

436
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,600
It’s an ancient spell,
the Nightmare Spell.

437
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,360
One year in the dream is one day
in the real world.

438
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,800
In seven days, her soul

439
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,230
will be slowly absorbed by the one
who cast the spell.

440
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,480
Qingyan!

441
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,680
Qingyan!

442
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,910
Qingyan is sleeping so peacefully.

443
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,910
The spell caster

444
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,960
must know her past very well

445
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,870
so that she can’t distinguish
between dream and reality,

446
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,910
staying in the beautiful dream
and not willing to wake up.

447
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,560
But she doesn’t know
she is in a dream?

448
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,680
No, she doesn’t.

449
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,030
We have to find the spell caster
within seven days

450
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,150
and kill him.

451
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,510
But we have no any single clue now.

452
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,080
Where should we find him?

453
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,440
You can enter the dream world
through your spiritual awareness.

454
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,150
The caster presents the dream

455
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,150
as if it were real,

456
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,080
but there will inevitably be flaws.

457
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,430
You can find out

458
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,190
who the caster is from the flaws.

459
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,030
But…

460
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,230
But I can’t wake up

461
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,190
from the dream either.

462
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,560
You can only tell us who the caster is

463
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,920
and we go kill him.

464
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,080
But we can’t hear

465
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,560
your voice in the dream world.

466
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,600
You have to sit still and concentrate

467
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,160
in order to connect to reality,

468
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,880
provide clues with your movements,

469
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,400
and you can hear our response.

470
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,750
What if

471
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,430
we fail to kill the caster
within seven days?

472
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,430
You’ll be trapped in her dream.

473
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,030
Your soul will fall into the nightmare.

474
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,030
That’s so dangerous!

475
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,640
Let’s do it.

476
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,400
It’s Liuying’s room.

477
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,750
The spell caster knows

478
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,560
the things of Qingyan’s past life?

479
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,560
This place looks so real.

480
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,880
He must have used hair

481
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
or skin of people familiar
with Xiahou’s Mansion

482
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,190
