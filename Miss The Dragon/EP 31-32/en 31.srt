(Initial Practicing Method)

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,800
You gave me so many books.

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,110
Which one

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,030
can speed up my practice?

21
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,600
There’re thousands of books here.
I can’t remember all.

22
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,600
Here should be a book
Supreme Ancient Scripture.

23
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,160
You may find a way in it.

24
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,800
Your good friend Qingyan...

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,430
She’s turning 18, right?

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,350
Yeah.

27
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,800
Not only Dragon King is expecting,
I’m excepting, too.

28
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,240
Me, too.

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,120
Why do you expect?

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,160
Oh, right, you and Dragon King
are good friends.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,470
You should feel happy and look

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,630
forward to it for him.

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,960
Yes, that’s right.

34
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,320
Qingqing,

35
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
your Datura Weaver Ribbon

36
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,070
seems to be lack of power.

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,520
Take it off

38
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,320
and let me give it more power.

39
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,430
Immortal, you’re so nice.

40
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,350
My pleasure.

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,800
Alright, here you are.

42
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,600
How is it? Does it look better?

43
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,710
Thank you, Immortal.

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,960
And,

45
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,960
thanks for your books.

46
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,960
See you!

47
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,680
Master’s birthday is coming up.

48
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,630
What should we give him as the gift
this time?

49
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,350
I heard the Garuda Flower
on the Sorong Volcano

50
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,430
is extremely precious.

51
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,830
It’s the sacred flower
of the immortal world.

52
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,240
Sorong Volcano is shrouded
in dark clouds

53
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,550
without sunlight for years.

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,270
Demons never like to go near it.

55
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,760
There are three trails

56
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,430
leading to the three peaks of it.

57
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,910
The sacred flower of the immortal world,

58
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,070
Garuda Flower, can be found there.

59
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,840
How do you know so much about it?

60
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,120
When I was helping Master
clean up his study,

61
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,840
I read these in an ancient book.

62
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,630
No wonder Master always

63
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,720
praises Qingyan for being gifted.

64
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,720
(Sorong Volcano)

65
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,070
This place is really scary.

66
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,280
That’s here.

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,350
One of the three trails

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
can lead us to the Garuda Flower.

69
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,120
Here is it.

70
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,190
I’ll go the right one.
Qingfeng, the middle one.

71
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,520
Qingyan, the left one.

72
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,120
Yes, Senior.

73
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,440
Remember. Whether we get it or not,

74
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,400
we have to return to the Hall

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,240
before tomorrow morning.

76
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,120
Yes.

77
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,030
See you.

78
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,940
(Sorong Volcano)

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,560
According to the ancient book,

80
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,440
the Garuda is an ancient
Dragon-eating Golden Eagle.

81
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,440
Its body fluid turned into flowers,

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,120
which are Garuda Flowers.

83
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,070
Eagles like to be on the cliff.

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,560
Then the Garuda Flower must also
grow on the cliff.

85
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
It’s Garuda Flower!

86
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,240
I can.

87
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,000
I can make it.

88
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,070
Master will definitely be happy!

89
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,080
Luckily, there are these leaves.

90
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,710
Why is this mountain so high?

91
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,510
How can I get up there?

92
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,880
I’d better go the other way.

93
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,000
Are you sure you’re going

94
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,000
to let her take the Garuda Flower away?

95
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,710
It’s just a flower.

96
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,590
But, what if Priest Xuanyang gets it

97
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,590
and makes a weapon of it?

98
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,510
It will be able to hurt

99
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,200
both demons and immortals.

100
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,390
Then, you’ll be in danger.

101
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,320
He can do nothing to me even if

102
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,470
he plants a courtyard of it.

103
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,680
Good.

104
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,120
But now, with her power,

105
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,910
she can feel my Dragon Breath.

106
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,910
If I want to protect her closely,

107
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,080
I’m afraid she would be scared.

108
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,240
She has met you once.

109
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,150
If she really likes you,

110
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,710
she won’t care about it.

111
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,510
But I care.

112
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,470
I hope our second meeting

113
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,150
can be beautiful,

114
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
not scary.

115
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,950
You’re thinking too much.

116
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,030
This fan can temporarily shield
immortal or demon breath.

117
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,950
I can lend it to you for now.

118
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,120
Soul-devouring Fan?

119
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,240
One of Luofeng Pavilion’s tokens.

120
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,590
So, I can only lend it
to you temporarily.

121
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,440
Remember to return it.

122
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,000
Don’t worry.

123
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,830
I can find a way out.

124
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,950
Why is there a firefly here?

125
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,200
Little firefly,

126
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,000
are you taking me out?

127
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,740
(Sorong Volcano)

128
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,560
I really walked out!

129
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,760
Little firefly, thank you!

130
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,950
Who are you?

131
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,470
It’s me.

132
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,830
Yuchi?! Is it really you?

133
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,030
Liuying, you are having a dream.

134
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,800
I’m Qingyan, not Liuying.

135
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,830
Yes,

136
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,080
now you are Qingyan.

137
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,830
Yuchi, you finally come to see me.

138
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,760
Although it’s in my dream,

139
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,350
I’m still so happy!

140
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,440
It will be my

141
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,240
18th birthday in a few days.

142
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,000
At that time, you need to tell me

143
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,680
the stories a long time ago.

144
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,440
Then,

145
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,830
since it’s in my dream,

146
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,590
can you

147
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,950
grant me all my requests?

148
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
I want you to carry me home.

149
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,320
Yuchi,

150
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,560

Was that

189
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,030
Qingyan,

190
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,320
Garuda Flower is just
what I need right now.

191
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,910
Master, I went together with

192
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,200
my seniors.

193
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,030
It’s just that I got more lucks.

194
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
You’re all my good apprentices.

195
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,960
Do you know why

196
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,600
I need this flower?

197
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,080
Could it be

198
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,600
that you’re worried
about the dragon demon’s attack?

199
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,960
That’s right.

200
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,870
With this flower,

201
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,720
I can rest assured.

202
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:40,720
Master,

203
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,030
the one who hurt people
down the mountain was a cat demon,

204
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,080
and recently there was one
of her accomplices.

205
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,080
That cat demon is very powerful.

206
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,960
Qinglu got wounded
while trying to catch her.

207
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,560
I arrived in time,
but she still fled away.

208
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,990
But she was also badly injured.

209
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,680
Master,

210
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,480
I don’t think she can go too far.

211
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,560
Let’s go and catch her now.

212
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,110
Lately, I can feel many

213
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,990
demons around Kunlun.

214
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,840
Maybe it’s not a coincidence,

215
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,510
but because of Qingyan.

216
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,630
The unique soul of Qingyan

217
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,320
is like a tempting ripe fruit

218
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,270
to the demons.

219
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,270
Cat or fox demons are no big deal.

220
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,320
What I’m worried about

221
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,480
is the dragon demon which has been

222
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,870
around Kunlun for years.

223
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,150
I have refined the Garuda Flower

224
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,080
into this Golden Eagle Dagger.

225
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,800
Master!

226
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,680
Senior is going to catch the cat demon

227
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,720
which hurt Qinglu.

228
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,440
I want to go with him.

229
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,030
-No!
-No!

230
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,800
Why?

231
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,910
Qingyan,

232
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,510
just listen to me.

233
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,200
Qingyan,

234
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,230
I’ll take your seniors to catch
the cat demon down the mountain.

235
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,870
Take this Golden Eagle Dagger with you.

236
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,080
Make sure to carry it with you.

237
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,720
Take care of yourself.

238
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,600
Thank you, Master.

239
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,150
Qingqing. Qingqing.

240
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,840
Qingqing!

241
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,840
What’s wrong?

242
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,270
Is there any demon?

243
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,560
Are you alright?

244
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,680
Did you get hurt?

245
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,680
I’m fine. Don’t worry.

246
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,080
That’s good.

247
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,990
You haven’t used Three-call Spell
for a long time,

248
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,030
and you called me over
in the middle of the night.

249
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,750
I thought you were in danger.

250
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,110
My master and seniors are out today.

251
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,800
So I came here to meet you.

252
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,270
So, you’re just missing me!

253
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,320
Why don’t you

254
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,440
bring me anything to eat today?

255
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,560
How could I not?

256
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,680
Look!

257
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,110
These are the apricot and peach

258
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,480
preserves my senior made for me.

259
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,150
They are delicious! Have a try!

260
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,200
Your senior is so nice!

261
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,320
Does it taste good?

262
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,510
Yes! Great!

263
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,320
And,

264
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,680
my master gave me another treasure.

265
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,720
Let me show you.

266
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,200
Look!

267
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,510
Golden Eagle Dagger!

268
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,080
Take… Take it away now!

269
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,960
Take it away!

270
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,200
-Take it away!
-What’s wrong?

271
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,200
You…

272
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,990
Your dagger has

273
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,080
the power of Garuda Flower,

274
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,030
which can absorb
the power of demons.

275
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,630
You just opened it a bit but

276
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,800
it already got me a serious headache.

277
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,320
It’s so dangerous!

278
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,840
No wonder Master asked me
to take it with me.

279
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,110
Turns out that it can protect me
from demons.

280
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,600
Alright.

281
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,510
Qingyan,

282
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,680
just like humans,

283
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,480
there are also good demons
and bad demons.

284
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,360
You have to be clear about this.

285
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,510
Of course, I know it.

286
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,360
By the way,

287
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,480
I made a unique skill recently.

288
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,480
Let me show you.

289
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,800
So beautiful!

290
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,390
But, what is the

291
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,750
purpose of this skill?

292
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,840
It’s… It’s beautiful!

293
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,510
Yes, it is.

294
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,990
I made it to miss Yuchi

295
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,480
in my dream.

296
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,360
The fireflies are beautiful.

297
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,990
But it can only be used to tease girls.

298
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,480
Master,

299
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,080
we made Seventy-two Heavenly Formation

300
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,270
and finally caught

301
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,750
the evil cat demon.

302
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,840
Very good.

303
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,270
From today on,
you all take turns on guard duty.

304
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,270
This cat demon is very cunning.
Don’t take it lightly.

305
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,680
Yes.

306
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,630
Say it!

307
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,870
Why did you hurt people?

308
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,110
What’s your intention?

309
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,680
You killed my sister Chengcheng

310
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,720
and you ask me what I’m up to?

311
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,440
I’m just avenging my sister!

312
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,440
She deserves to die
for hurting my junior brother!

313
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,320
I was already generous
for not destroying her soul.

314
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,080
I’ll give you a chance.

315
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,480
If you tell me where the fox demon is,

316
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,870
I’ll spare your life.

317
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,270
Or, you can wait for your power

318
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,560
to be burned dry by the True Fire

319
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,910
and your cultivation
to be completely destroyed!

320
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,630
I have nothing to say to you!

321
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,480
Senior.

322
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,680
Don’t stop the True Fire unless she

323
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,440
tells the hiding place of the fox demon.

324
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,560
Yes.

325
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,230
Liuying!

326
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,680
Liuying! It’s me!

327
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,030
I’m Marble!

328
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,080
You saved me 200 years ago!
Don’t you remember?

329
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,910
Liuying?

330
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,840
Liuying, you are having a dream.

331
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,080
I never saved you.

332
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,750
It’s fine if you don’t remember.

333
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,960
I remember.

334
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,560
You are Liuying.

335
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,230
You saved me 200 years ago.

336
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,560
You’re my benefactor.

337
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,800
Even my name, Marble,

338
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,560
is made by you.

339
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,200
It hurts?

340
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,080
The fire burned up my power

341
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,030
and now it keeps

342
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,630
drilling into my body.

343
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,750
It hurts so much.

344
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,630
Then you can just tell

345
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,150
the hiding places of other demons.

346
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,840
My master will let you go after that.

347
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,360
I want to tell you.

348
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,510
But I really don’t know it.

349
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,910
Liuying,

350
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,840
you saved me 200 years ago.

351
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,560
Can you save me again?

352
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,990
Just stop the True Fire for a moment

353
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,480
and let me take a breath. Only a breath.

354
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,840
Master said that

355
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,230
we couldn’t stop the fire.

356
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,360
He was afraid that I would escape.

357
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,750
But, the fire

358
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,750
has already burnt up my power.

359
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,960
I can’t escape even if I want to.

360
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,440
Please! I beg you!

361
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,320
Her power does feel weak now.

362
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,390
And her painful appearance

363
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,270
doesn’t look like she is pretending.

364
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,480
I’ll never be soft-hearted to demons

365
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,560
like you who harmed people.

366
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,360
What about the dragon demon
with you before?

367
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,150
You also killed him?

368
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Dragon demon?

369
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,200
What dragon demon?

370
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,110
You also forgot him?

371
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,870
He was so nice to you.

372
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,510
Who was nice to me?

373
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,960
What are you talking about?

374
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,080
How could you forget him?

375
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,480
As long as you let me take a breath,

376
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,080
I can tell you his name.

377
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,320
Tell me.

378
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,390
Come here.

379
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,270
His name is…

380
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,560
What?

381
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,560
How could you still use your power?

382
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,030
It’s not my power.

383
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,110
It’s you human’s knockout drops.

384
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,230
Very often,

385
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,840
humans are more vicious than demons.

386
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,750
Master,

387
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,200
Qingyan is just knocked out by the drug.
She is fine.

388
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,360
Cat demon!

389
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,990
Master, Senior, I’m sorry!

390
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,910
It’s my fault
for trusting that cat demon

391
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,600
and letting her out.

392
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,960
But I’ll definitely find her back.

393
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,110
Qingyan,

394
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,030
you made such a big mistake this time.

395
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,270
Do you know how many people were injured
by that cat demon?

396
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,680
Not only did we not catch other demons,

397
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,080
but even she escaped.

398
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,360
Since you have awakened,

399
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,870
you will be punished to go
to Introspection Wall

400
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,360
behind the mountains
to reflect on your mistakes.

401
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,480
Master.

402
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,230
No,

403
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,200
I have to get that cat demon back.

404
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,230
It’s easier to let her go

405
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,390
than to catch her again.

406
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,560
I can find her.

407
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,480
I cast Tracing Spell on her.

408
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,990
As long as I follow the firefly,
I can find her.

409
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,960
Firefly? Tracing Spell?
What are you talking about?

410
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,440
I never heard of it.

411
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,270
Behave.
Master is really angry this time.

412
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,480
Don’t go against his words.

413
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,510
You’d better go
to the Introspection Wall first.

414
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,750
I’ll go help him
to catch the cat demon again.

415
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,480
I let the demon go.

416
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,990
I should find her back myself.

417
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,230
What do you want? Who are you?

418
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,840
Thanks for your help.

419
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,600
May I know who you are?

420
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,960
Sorry for being rude.

421
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,960
You don’t need to know who I am.

422
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,960
Then, how should I repay your favor?

423
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,360
You don’t need to.

424
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,680
I’ll help you again.

425
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,840
May I ask why you want to help me?

426
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,720
Your enemy is also my enemy.

427
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,720
That’s the reason.

428
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,840
Enemy?

429
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,390
Your sister is killed by people
from Kunlun.

430
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,200
Don’t you want to avenge her?

431
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,910
I want.

432
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,150
I’ll definitely avenge her.

433
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,390
But,

434
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,200
Priest Xuanyang’s power…

435
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,150
I can help you to do it.

436
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,150
But you have to help me
get close to Gu Qingyan.

437
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,630
Qingyan?

438
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,200
Master,

439
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,560
I would say nothing
if it’s anything else.

440
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,870
But, Qingyan saved me
hundreds of years ago.

441
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,110
I can’t do such a vicious thing.

442
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Don’t worry.

443
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,870
I’m not trying to hurt her.

444
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,320
I just want one thing from her.

445
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,510
As long as Qingyan is not harmed

446
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,150
and I can avenge my sister,

447
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,600
I’ll do whatever I can.

448
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,080
Good.

449
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:46,990
Very good.

450
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,270
Bold wolf demon!

451
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,910
Smells so good! It’s the Yin Soul!

452
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,680
You come to me yourself!

453
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,510
Garuda Flower?

454
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
You deceitful cat demon!

455
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,390
I’ll take you back!
