=Episode 28=

17
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,820
(Luofeng Pavilion)

18
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,800
Are you sure?

19
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,480
I knew what Qingqing wants most

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
is to get rid of the Meteor Mark.

21
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,390
I should have done this earlier.

22
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,670
Pulling out the string is just like
pulling out your tendons.

23
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,470
Can you bear it?

24
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,350
I’m a bit reluctant to do it.

25
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,400
You’d better do it yourself.

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,190
If I can do it,
why bother to come to you?

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,630
I tried.

28
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,910
It’s hard to pull it out.

29
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,710
You have to use your power.

30
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,070
Then, get ready for it.

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,270
Come on.

32
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,990
I think you’d better give up now.

33
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,190
Don’t stop!

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,120
Can you still hang in there?

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,160
Cut the cackle. Keep on.

36
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,600
Dragon King!

37
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,800
What are you doing?

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,350
Stop!

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
It will hurt his soul!

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,350
You’re killing him!

41
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,470
Come here.

42
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,600
He wants to give you the string.

43
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,270
I don’t want it!

44
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,710
How silly you are!

45
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,270
Do you know what you are doing?

46
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,240
Meteor Mark is just a mark.

47
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,990
I don’t mind it now.
Why are you worried about it?

48
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,630
It’s just a string.

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,710
I’ll be fine.

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,960
I don’t allow you to hurt yourself.

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,550
Don’t you know that it’ll break my heart

52
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
to see you do this?

53
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,120
Don’t cry.

54
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,550
I like to see you smile.

55
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,000
You have a beautiful smile.

56
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,240
Smile.

57
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,910
You taught me last time

58
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,350
how should I smile to look natural.

59
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,030
Fool.

60
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,680
Like this.

61
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,240
Do it like me.

62
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,750
Curl up the corners of your lips
like the gold ingot.

63
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Why can’t you learn?

64
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,960
You have to learn it hard.

65
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,350
I don’t want to see a cold face

66
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,350
that does not smile every day.

67
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,440
Let’s try together.

68
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,150
You hurt yourself again
after you just recovered.

69
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,910
Here. Have the tea.

70
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,870
Eat the leaf, too.

71
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,280
Tea leaf?

72
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,350
It helps you recover faster.

73
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
Do I look that funny?

74
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,750
No, no.

75
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,310
I…

76
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,470
I’m laughing at myself.

77
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,470
I suddenly feel that

78
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,470
I’m so unfaithful in love.

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,720
Who is that?

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
Who else do you like?

81
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,310
Look at you!
I haven’t finished my words.

82
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,190
I mean

83
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,190
I like every look of you.

84
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,680
So do I.

85
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,030
Look at you!

86
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,590
You need to get well quickly,

87
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,800
then we can…

88
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,030
We can what?

89
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,520
I won’t tell you.

90
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,310
Your Majesty,

91
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,030
I got a secret report, saying

92
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,680
that the King of Dongluo has died

93
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,030
and the Second Prince has ascended
to the throne.

94
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,030
And, they are preparing to break
our agreement and start a war again.

95
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,350
What a liar!

96
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,800
What do you think we should do?

97
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,520
I request to go to fight them
and defend our country

98
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,280
so that they can’t cross the border.

99
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,150
Great!

100
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,910
That’s my Great Lady General.

101
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,200
Your Majesty,

102
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,030
(Memorial)
This is the evidence of the

103
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,470
secret meeting between Mr. Guo

104
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,800
and the Crown Prince of Dongluo.

105
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,440
Minister Xu! That’s nonsense!

106
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,640
You’re slandering me!

107
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,950
Your Majesty! I’m wronged!

108
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,700
Your Majesty, Minister Xu
is slandering me!

109
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,300
(Help to get in…)

110
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,240
Shut up!

111
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,510
Consort Rui has told me everything.

112
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,910
You mean she is also slandering you?

113
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,830
Guards!

114
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,000
Take him out and punish him with
a hundred strokes of the plank,

115
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,830
dismiss him from his position
and send him to the border.

116
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,680
He should never be hired again!

117
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,270
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

118
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,120
Your Majesty!

119
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Your Majesty! I’m really wronged!

120
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,680
-Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
-Go!

121
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,590
-I’m really wronged!
-Go!

122
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,560
Your Majesty! I’m wronged!

123
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,270
Your Majesty!

124
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,000
General, you have killed many
enemies this time.

125
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,320
Your kung fu has improved.

126
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,590
We killed the enemies together.

127
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,000
General.

128
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,950
Why is a kid here in the military camp?

129
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,640
Sweetheart.

130
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,000
Sweetheart! Come here.

131
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,080
I told you not to run around.

132
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,000
Uncle Zhao, she is…

133
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,320
Look.

134
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,440
Does she look like me?

135
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,910
She is my daughter.

136
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,350
Baby, I’ll take you to practice
sword later.

137
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,120
Sword? Please don’t!

138
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,800
Chenyue, don’t blame me for saying this.

139
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,760
You have achieved great war credits.

140
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,270
Now it’s time for you to get

141
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,470
a perfect beloved mate

142
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,270
to make a happy family.

143
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,590
That’s the best ending.

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,710
Uncle Zhao, just go back
to your business.

145
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,030
Even if you dislike my nagging

146
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,030
and drive me away,

147
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,760
I still have to say that.

148
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,680
-I will say it every time I see you.
-Alright, alright.

149
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,590
Alright, let’s go

150
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,120
to play over there!

151
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,440
Look! Look!

152
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,800
Uncle Zhao is right.

153
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,470
I have to build a family.

154
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,800
After coming back from the battle,

155
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,270
it’s good to have

156
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,470
someone to talk to

157
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,240
and rely on at home.

158
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,080
Do you think so?

159
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,000
General, they are still waiting for me
to train.

160
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,390
Excuse me for my leave.

161
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,320
Here. This is delicious.

162
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,390
Chenyue!

163
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,240
No matter how many times
you will escape

164
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,120
and not admit,

165
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,390
I just have the feeling that

166
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,150
you are my Dragon King.

167
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,120
Report!

168
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,880
General, Emissary Lu is here.

169
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,880
Let him in.

170
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,710
-Mr. Lu.
-Mr. Lu.

171
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,880
I applied to His Majesty

172
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,830
to come back here to be the Emissary.

173
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,150
It’s in the middle of nowhere here,

174
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,710
not like Wind City.

175
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,270
I’m willing to even if it’s hard.

176
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,440
Don’t you understand my feelings?

177
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,240
Zheng,

178
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,440
I already have someone in mind.

179
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,470
Someone in mind?

180
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,710
Chenyue, I know.

181
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,120
You can tell me directly

182
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,800
if you want to reject me.

183
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,800
I can bear it.

184
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,270
My love to you is my own business.

185
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,510
You don’t need to worry.

186
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,510
Zheng,

187
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,910
that is not my excuse.

188
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,200
It’s true.

189
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,080
I never had this feeling before.

190
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,000
Feeling?

191
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,320
I have got this feeling

192
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,240
since the first time I met him.

193
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,910
It has never stopped,

194
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,800
but it’s even getting stronger
and stronger.

195
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,270
I’m sorry.

196
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,880
You don’t need to apologize to me.

197
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,320
Why are you telling me this?

198
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,680
Zheng,

199
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,880
you will definitely find

200
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,200
your true love one day.

201
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,590
Then,

202
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,680
you will still call me Zheng, right?

203
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,590
Of course.

204
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,800
Dragon King!

205
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,710
I know you’re by my side!

206
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,390
Why can’t you show up and face me?

207
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,120
Dragon King,

208
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,710
you will come to me,

209
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,440
right?

210
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,510
Chenyue,

211
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,800
forgive me for not being able
to face you

212
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,470
and tell you the truth.

213
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,830
But I’ll always be by your side.

214
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,590
So many butterflies!

215
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,320
Yuchi! Look!

216
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
These butterflies can perceive
human emotions!

217
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,990
Yuchi.

218
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Dragon King,

219
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,200
I have got the answer in my mind.

220
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,720
It’s been only half a day.

221
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,440
Your wound is healed so soon.

222
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,990
It’s not serious.

223
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,320
How long will you protect me?

224
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,990
Forever.

225
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,600
Keep your words.

226
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,870

It’s OK.

one day you would tell me

251
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,390
that you are him,

252
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,110
but unfortunately,

253
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,840
I failed to hear it this life.

254
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,750
But I think it was worth

255
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
the wait,

256
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,230
because no matter it’s the battlefield

257
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,320
or the beautiful scenery,

258
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,600
you always

stay by my side.

260
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,910
But, Yuchi,

261
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,870
aren’t you going to accompany

262
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,480
Liuying, the girl you love?

263
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,080
You are Liuying.

264
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,030
You’re the same person.

265
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,720
We’re the same?

266
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,840
A long time ago, your name was Liuying.

267
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,510
Later, you were called Ayu.

268
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,960
You mean,

269
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,480
I’m your beloved

270
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,230
Liuying?

271
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,150
Yes.

272
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,230
I’m Yuchi Longyan.

273
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,600
You used to

274
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,990
call me Dragon King.

275
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,390
Dragon King?

276
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,870
Finally you’re willing to admit

277
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,560
that you are the Dragon King.

278
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,440
Yes.

279
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,840
Finally I can

280
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,960
have you for real.

281
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
General!

282
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,030
Qingqing? Why are you here?

283
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,800
Why is the physician also here?

284
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
Qingqing is a Blue Bird actually.

285
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,080
And he is

286
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,750
the Lord of Luofeng Pavilion.

287
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,600
Blue Bird?

288
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,720
So, you’re also not an ordinary person?

289
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,080
Lord of Luofeng Pavilion?

290
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,320
Now you look

291
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,270
matched with my Qingqing.

292
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,390
Qingqing is always
with Luofeng Pavilion.

293
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,150
She is never yours.

294
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,720
Chenyue, I’m a bird demon,

295
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,600
but we can still be friends, right?

296
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,600
Of course!

297
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,600
Then, do you always know

298
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,600
that he is the Dragon King?

299
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,200
Yes!

300
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,680
I know everything!

301
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,870
But I can’t tell you anything!

302
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,230
You know me.

303
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,270
I know so many secrets

304
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,600
but I can’t tell any of it!

305
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,840
It makes me so anxious!

306
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,910
Sorry, Qingqing.

307
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,080
But, why did you all hide it from me?

308
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,680
We won’t do it again.

309
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,870
This time,

310
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,990
you can’t pour the Lethe Tea again.

311
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,110
That’s against the rules of Heaven.

312
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,720
But, will I forget everything

313
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,630
after I drink it?

314
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,480
Including Dragon King?

315
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,840
Yes.

316
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,030
The Lethe Tea is supposed

317
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,720
to make people forget the past.

318
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,800
Then, I disagree to drink it.

319
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,270
Even if you don’t remember,

320
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,270
I will go find you

321
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,150
and marry you in the human world.

322
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,680
But, why should I wait for you
in the human world?

323
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,960
Let’s go.

324
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,910
Why is Chenyue taking Dragon King away?

325
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:31,990
What

326
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,800
are they going to do?

327
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,510
Get married.

328
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,560
(Luofeng Pavilion)

329
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,750
Chenyue, where are you taking me to?

330
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,720
To get married!

331
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,200
What’s wrong?

332
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,230
Yes, let’s get married!

333
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,600
You’re the Dragon King. Do you have
a palace underwater?

334
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,840
Let’s go get married there!

335
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,080
I’m not the Dragon King of the sea.
Come with me.

336
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,990
Alright.

337
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,030
I’m flying in the sky now!

338
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,600
You’re taking me fly in the clouds!

339
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,560
This is just like what I imagined!

340
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:12,960
You imagined this?

341
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,990
Yes, I did!

342
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,080
For so many times.

343
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,680
I imagined flying with you

344
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,480

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,320

Yes!

349
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,150
This is my Dragon Pool.

350
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,600

00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,910

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,680
Chenyue.

377
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
So,

378
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,440

Dragon King must have taken Chenyue

back to Dragon Pool to get married.

397
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:07,960
No!

398
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,080
I have to prepare the dowry for Chenyue!

399
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,320
It’s not the human world here.

400
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,440
There is no need for

401
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,990
betrothal gifts and dowry.

402

Your immortals’ marriage is so boring!

403
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,080
No. Other things can be unnecessary,

404
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,270
but the red wedding dress and
the love token are indispensable.

405
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,440
They have already had love tokens.

406
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,230
Then, they need red wedding dress!

407
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,030
I need to go to tell them!

408
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,750
I’m going!

409
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,320
But the red wedding dress and
the love token are indispensable.

-Not me.

412
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,960
It’s God’s will.
