17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,960
General.

18
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,070
I heard the sound of fighting.

19
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,800
Where is the assassin?

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,430
Jin got poisoned.

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,280
Long Yan is helping her.

22
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,240
Let me have a check.

23
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,960
Ah, it looks painful.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,520
Dragon King is only gentle to Chenyue.

25
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,990
That’s really him.

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,070
How is her now?

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,630
The poison of Mandrake is removed.

28
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,430
Great!

29
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,100
(General’s Mansion)

30
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,400
Over the years

31
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,600
I have mistaken Han Xiyun
as my benefactor

32
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,680
and helped him do
countless wrong things.

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,070
You shouldn’t have saved me.

34
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,550
You still have me.

35
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,100
(Jin)

36
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,550
General, your old injury recrudesces.

37
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,040
You should take more rest.

38
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,550
You came quickly tonight.

39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,760
Why do I feel like you’re watching me

40
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,960
every minute of every day?

41
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,270
Don’t you need to sleep?

42
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,800
It’s my duty.

43
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,630
Oh, really?

44
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,070
Is there any other reason?

45
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,000
It’s late now.

46
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,910
General, you should go to bed.

47
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,440
Are you alright?

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,910
You haven’t answered my question.

49
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,560
You make my wound hurt.

50
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,440
You have to relieve my pain.

51
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,960
General, how should I do it?

52
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,280
Take me to the city wall to watch
the fireworks again.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,150
City wall?

54
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,560
There are no fireworks now.

55
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
It’s late at night now.

56
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,590
You need more rest.

57
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,190
Alright, alright.

58
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,870
But, before I fall asleep,

59
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,190
you can’t leave.

60
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,240
Yes, General.

61
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,240
Let’s see if I can dream

62
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,310
of the fireworks on the city wall.

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,240
This dream is so beautiful!

64
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,310
Yes.

65
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,190
Yuchi!

66
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,120
You finally come to see me.

67
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,350
It’s so beautiful.

68
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,280
Now you’re a general,

69
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,240
but you still like these things.

70
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,190
I like the fallen flowers,

71
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,310
the fireflies,

72
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,350
and the fireworks.

73
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Yuchi,

74
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,440
are you going to leave me

75
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,030
after I wake up?

76
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,520
This is just a dream.

77
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,800
I’m not the real me in the dream.

78
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,630
You will forget this dream.

79
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,800
Since I will forget it,

80
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,310
I can do whatever I want now.

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,590

Seems like

97
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,680
I had a nice dream last night.

98
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,800
But

99
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,590
I can’t remember it now.

100
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,950
What…

101
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,270
What’s wrong with me?

102
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,830
Tell me!

103
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,880
Or I will kill you!

104
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,350
Your Highness, please calm down.

105
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,440
Your symptoms seem to be

106
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,030
the addiction to Mandrake

107
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,510
after taking Life-saving Pill.

108
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,640
Now you have to go back to Dongluo

109
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,150
to take new Life-saving Pills.

110
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,590
Only that can relieve your pain.

111
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,710
Life-saving Pill?

112
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,950
How…

113
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
How come I took Life-saving Pill?

114
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,590
How come I took Life-saving Pill?

115
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,030
How come I took Life-saving Pill?

116
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
Go back to Dongluo now!

117
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,830
After I recover,

118
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,240
I will find out the truth!

119
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,100
(Tiger’s Howl Valley)

120
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,830
I’ve checked what happened
seven years ago.

121
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,910
The Tiger’s Howl Valley back then

122
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,710
was a trivial area on the border
of four countries.

123
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,350
Later, someone said that

124
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,390
secret treasures of the former dynasty
were hidden there,

125
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,590
which attracted people from four
countries to fight for it.

126
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,120
At that time, Feng Army was on guard
at the border,

127
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,830
and was not involved in the seizure
of the treasures.

128
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,270
You mean,

129
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,830
my father went there
to find the treasures?

130
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,910
I don’t know who got the treasures

131
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,800
seven years ago.

132
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,320
But, I found a map.

133
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,310
(Tiger’s Howl Valley)
I planned to go there

134
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,740
to check in person.

135
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,950
But now I think

136
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,830
you should go find the truth yourself.

137
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,300
(Tiger’s Howl Valley)

138
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,320
Seems that there was
a fierce fight here.

139
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,460
(Tiger’s Howl Valley)

140
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,080
This should be the place where
the treasures were hidden back then.

141
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,300
(Jin)

142
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,260
(Jin)

143
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,460
(Jin)

144
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,590
This is…

145
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,580
(Jin)

146
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,590
Dad is so great!

147
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,640
Does it look good?

148
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,830
Yes!

149
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,510
Excuse me.

150
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,000
I’m Jin Ge, a guard of the King
of Dongluo.

151
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,950
Father!

152
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
It’s really you!

153
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,880
What happened?!

154
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,760
I’m Jin Ge, a guard of the King
of Dongluo.

155
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,120
I was ordered to come here to find the
treasures of the former dynasty.

156
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,910
Kill!

157
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,200
But, when we

158
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,710
found the treasures
and prepared to leave,

159
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,320
we got attacked by the Feng Army.

160
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,830
We fought with them,

161
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,560
but we were outnumbered.

162
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,910
The enemy’s sword went through my chest.

163
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,640
But he didn’t know that

164
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,350
my heart was born on the right side.

165
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,910
His sword

166
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,760
didn’t kill me.

167
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
When I woke up from the coma,

168
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,150
I found that all my brothers were dead.

169
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,240
And the Feng Army was packing up
the treasures.

170
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,240
Then, I heard people talking.

171
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Their voices were so familiar to me.

172
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,800
Your Highness,

173
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
with these gold,

174
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,320
we can bribe all the ministers.

175
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,390
You are sure to get
the throne of the Crown Prince

176
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,080
Burn all the bodies.

177
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:29,950
Yes.

178
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,240
I sneaked away while they were
packing up the treasures.

179
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,680
-But…
-Take a head count before that.

180
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,390
The Eldest Prince found that
a body is missing

181
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,080
and knew that I escaped.

182
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,390
The man who escaped is Jin Ge.

183
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,000
He has an only daughter, Jin.

184
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,030
If Jin Ge is still alive,

185
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,880
he will go find Jin.

186
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,680
We can go back
and get Jin under control.

187
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,440
If you find Jin Ge,

188
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,390
bury him alive.

189
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,640
If you can’t find him,

190
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,560
you won’t need to come back.

191
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,470
Yes, Your Highness.

192
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,030
I wanted to risk my life to fight,

193
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,150
but if I die,

194
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,870
Jin will be in danger.

195
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,200
If they don’t know whether I’m
alive or dead,

196
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,560
they won’t dare to hurt Jin.

197
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,990
Father,

198
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,600
you did all this for me.

199
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,440
It’s been days.

200
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
But we still haven’t found him.

201
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,560
Yes. When can we find him?

202
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,320
Anyway, just keep searching.

203
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,840
Alright, let’s go.

204
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,870
I have spent my life

205
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,080
(Jin)
working for Dongluo.

206
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,960
But in the end, I was killed

207
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,910
by people of Dongluo,

208
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,960
(Jin)
and got my daughter involved.

209
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,270
Now I know I will die of my
severe wounds.

210
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,270
I write this letter with my blood
to tell the truth,

211
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,270
hoping one day

212
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,910
my beloved daughter Jin can read this.

213
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,270
Jin,

214
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,230
forgive me for not being able to
protect you anymore.

215
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,680
Take good care of yourself.

216
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,030
Jin Ge’s last words.

217
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,630
Father!

218
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,990
I’m not filial

219
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,480
that I’ve just found you.

220
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,630
Han Xiyun,

221
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,200
I will give what you

222
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,230
did to me all back to you.

223
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,870
My Lord,

224
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,910
your tea.

225
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,750
Have it when it’s still warm.

226
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,510
When can you stop being so shy?

227
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,230
I don’t know.

228
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,990
I was not like this
when I saw you before.

229
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,800
I could even say bad things about you.

230
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,270
But now…

231
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,270
Stop looking at him.

232
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,630
I’m getting more and more nervous!

233
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,510
My Lord, since you finish the tea,

234
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,630
I will take it away.

235
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,480
Why is my face so hot?

236
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,110
Am I having a fever?

237
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,230
My heart is beating so fast!

238
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,630
Calm down! Calm down!

239
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,030
Calm down!

240
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,440
But,

241
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,800
he really

242
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,510
looks better now.

243
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,030
The Three Pearl Leaf Tea

244
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,870
really works.

245
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,560
There’s only a little bit left?

246
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,630
Qingqing.

247
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,990
Why are you here?

248
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,510
What’s in your hand?

249
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,600
No… Nothing.

250
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,030
Feather?

251
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,200
Who hurt you?

252
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,630
Nobody hurt me.

253
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,510
Tell me!

254
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,840
It’s myself.

255
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,270
Why?

256
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,030
No reason.

257
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,480
Look at me.

258
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,840
Look at me!

259
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,030
Alright, I’ll tell you.

260
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,270
But, you can’t get angry.

261
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,600
I won’t.

262
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,910
You got hurt.

263
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,960
So, I went to Immortal of Fate
for Three Pearl Leaf Tea.

264
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,800
You know his principles.

265
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,200
I can’t get it for free.

266
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,510
So, I pulled out a Feather
to exchange it with him.

267
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,870
You said you wouldn’t get angry.

268
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,630
I’m angry with myself.

269
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,720
Don’t waste your power.

270
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,630
Now the most important thing

271
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,270
is that you get well.

272
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,230

What’s wrong?

311
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,110
General, I just got the news that

312
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,390
the Crown Prince of Dongluo was
assassinated by his guard

313
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,110
when he was leaving Wind City.

314
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,840
And I heard the assassin has been
torn into pieces.

315
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,080
