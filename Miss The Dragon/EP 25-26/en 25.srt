=Episode 25=

17
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,750
You look so calm and relaxed that

18
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,670
you don’t seem to be worried at all.

19
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,200
Of course! Chenyue is valiant
and skilled.

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,390
There won’t be any problem.

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,030
But it’s already this time.

22
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,160
They should be back from the raid.

23
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,550
Don’t worry.

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,830
Listen! There are footsteps!

25
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,520
-Emissary Lu!
-It must be them!

26
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,320
-Emissary Lu!
-Finally you’re back!

27
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,630
Listen to me.

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,470
General Feng accidentally
fell into the cliff.

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,630
What?!

30
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,120
When we were retreating,

31
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,550
we were surrounded and intercepted
before we got out of the territory

32
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,190
of the Nanzhao army and had an accident.

33
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,430
I intercepted several attacks

34
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,430
but we failed to beat them.

35
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,550
Now give me the order

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,880
to take a troop to search and rescue!

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,830
No, wait.

38
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,680
What about Long Yan? Didn’t he
protect her?

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,910
Long Yan followed her
and jumped off the cliff.

40
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,710
That’s great.

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,800
Long Yan is there. Chenyue will be fine.

42
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,600
General Zhao, lead the counterattack
immediately!

43
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,160
We must save Chenyue!

44
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,040
Yes, sir!

45
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,840
Where is this place?

46
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,440
I remember my arm got hurt.

47
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,630
Why is it cured now?

48
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,000
Long Yan?

49
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,070
Why are you…?

50
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,240
Why are we here?

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,070
Like you, General, I was forced

52
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,680
by the enemy to jump off the cliff.

53
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,240
But, fortunately, I was lucky to be

54
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,030
hung by a protruding branch.

55
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,150
Are you hungry now?

56
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,590
Have some fruit.

57
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,820
(Luofeng Pavilion)

58
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,870
Lord Qianxun, do you know

59
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,440
why Dragon King hasn’t been back
to his Dragon Pool lately?

60
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,150
He is in the human world.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,240
He went to see Liuying again?

62
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,960
Dragon King loves her.

63
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,720
He would be happy as long as he

64
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,120
can see her one more time.

65
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,870
You used to distain

66
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,240
love affairs.

67
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,520
But now you seem to understand
the Dragon King’s mind.

68
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,960
How are you getting along with
your little Blue Bird?

69
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,280
It’s my business. You don’t need to
worry about it.

70
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,000
Dragon King is carried away by love.

71
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,520
You’d better not follow his steps.

72
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,800
I’m afraid it’s difficult for that
lazy little Blue Bird

73
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,350
to get into immortality.

74
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,560
So you shouldn’t take her too seriously.

75
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,800
Why not?

76
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,680
So what if Qingqing fails
to become immortal?

77
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,190
You think only human and demon
are different?

78
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,070
Immortal and demon can’t have
a good end either.

79
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,960
You and I are immortals
with eternal lives.

80
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,910
But bird demon can only live for
500 or 600 years.

81
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,910
How can you be together forever?

82
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,150
To avoid the pain of separation
in the future,

83
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,750
I advise you to

84
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,400
not take it seriously.

85
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,000
Not take it seriously?

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You have written so many fates.

87
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,590
The love stories you wrote were all
not serious?

88
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,680
I’m just being nice and reminding you.

89
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,440
Forget what I said.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,870
See you.

91
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,120
It’s more important to help her through

92
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,590
the tribulation and become immortal
in the future.

93
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,960
The Meteor Mark is no big deal.

94
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,190
I don’t think it’s ugly.

95
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,910
Still can’t use it.

96
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,960
General.

97
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,150
Just sit.

98
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,910
Yes.

99
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,720
The commander is missing during the
war between two armies.

100
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,910
It will affect the morale of the army.

101
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,870
I wonder if Uncle Zhao and Zheng…

102
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,150
General, don’t worry.

103
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,590
Although we have fallen off the cliff,

104
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,280
our previous sneak attack plan

105
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
has been successful.

106
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,270
The enemy’s provisions have been
destroyed

107
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,680
and the plants have been poisoned.

108
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,910
I believe our soldiers will

109
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,390
be able to drive the Nanzhao Army
away from the border.

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,680
Uncle Zhao is experienced.

111
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,590
I was overthinking it.

112
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,950
General,

113
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,560
the one who forced you off the cliff

114
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,950
with sword was one of our soldiers.

115
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,680
Did someone plot to kill you?

116
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,680
I have thought about it.

117
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,270
But what’s the motive

118
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,470
of the person behind?

119
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,320
At the beginning, Mr. Guo

120
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,910
paid assassins to come to my place
to cause trouble,

121
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,320
then someone stole the Fengs’
Commanding Badge to frame me,

122
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,510
and then the soldier on the cliff.

123
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,080
I think there is some kind of

124
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,150
connection between these things.

125
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,950
And on the day we set off,

126
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,440
what on earth did Jin want to tell me?

127
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,800
I think that is also related
to this thing.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,590
But now

129
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,320
it’s not my biggest concern.

130
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,440
What I’m most worried about

131
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,560
is how we should

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,240
climb up this high cliff.

133
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,150
Chenyue!

134
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,470
I clearly remember that

135
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
you were far away from the cliff.

136
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,640
Did you jump off to save me?

137
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,830
It’s my duty to protect General.

138
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,800
Sorry.

139
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,200
I was lost in thought

140
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,350
and took you for my sister.

141
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,470
So,

142
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,270
you have a sister?

143
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,760
Yes.

144
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,150
She is at the same age as you.

145
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,880
It’s so good to have a brother like you.

146
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,470
I used to have a brother

147
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,510
who always protected me as well.

148
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,590
I’m Qingqing’s brother.

149
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,200
So, of course I’m also your brother.

150
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,910
Then,

151
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,880
I can see you anytime?

152
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,030
I used to have a brother
who always protected me as well.

153
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
I’m always by your side.

154
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,030
We’ll live and die together.

155
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,270
OK!

156
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,710
We’ll definitely win!

157
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,710
What?!

158
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,240
Why is this mark still here?

159
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,030
Are the pains I suffered

160
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,030
in vain?

161
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,910
I can do peach blossom makeup
for you every day,

162
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,150
alright?

163
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,150
Calm down!

164
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,150
It’s not the first time he fools you!

165
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,350
Last time, when he saw the mark,

166
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,200
he turned around and left right away.

167
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,910
Actually,

168
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,240
this Meteor Mark

169
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,640
is pretty special.

170
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,510
Special?

171
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,760
That also means it’s ugly!

172
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,760
You have pretty face. You don’t
understand my trouble.

173
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,320
But, you really look so pretty.

174
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,800
Listen,

175
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,510
do not only know to play.

176
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,680
Remember to practice everyday

177
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,950
to become immortal soon, you know?

178
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,000
I never said I wanted to
become immortal.

179
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,950
If you don’t,

180
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
how would you be with me forever?

181
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,240
Take this.

182
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,830
(Heavenly Secret Guidebook)

183
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,270
You’re not enlightened.

184
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,950
This is the Secret Guidebook
for your practice.

185
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,200
You must practice diligently
according to it.

186
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,440
Don’t be lazy.

187
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,470
There are so many words!

188
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,270
I’ll check on your practice next time
I come.

189
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
If you slack off,

190
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,590
I will punish you.

191
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,830
Why do you just leave again?

192
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,640
Stay with you?

193
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,510
If I became an immortal,

194
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,800
why should I still be your maid?

195
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,270
What’s the point of it?

196
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,760
I won’t!

197
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,980
(Heavenly Secret Guidebook)

198
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,470
Xiyun!

199
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,800
Xiyun!

200
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,440
Haven’t you come to Wind City long ago?

201
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,200
Why did you come to see me only now?

202
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,510
Do you not love me anymore?

203
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,910
How could I not?

204
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,680
You may leave first.

205
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,080
Let me tell you a piece of good news.

206
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,350
Feng Chenyue fell off the cliff
and disappeared.

207
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,080
Is she dead?

208
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,510
I hope so.

209
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,830
Can you do me a favor?

210
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,640
I want you to go to convince the King

211
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,560
to send people to investigate the
disappearance of Feng Chenyue.

212
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Why?

213
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,710
Why?!

214
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,200
Don’t you really know why?

215
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,800
Xiyun, it hurts!

216
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
How did your brother’s eye get blind?

217
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,000
Don’t you want to revenge me?

218
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,150
If you don’t,

219
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,830
my love for you is in vain.

220
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,830
But…

221
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,030
But what?

222
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,910
No more talks.

223
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,880
Not only do I want her dead,

224
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,950
I also want her to
be charged with treason.

225
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,910
That would be even better if I could

226
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,880
bury her with my own hands.

227
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,910
Chenyue,

228
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,390
where are you?

229
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,440
Let’s split up

230
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,800
and see if there’s a way up.

231
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,270
We’ll meet back at the cave at noon.

232
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,470
General, be careful.

233
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,240
There are no trees on this cliff

234
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,870
except weeds.

235
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,030
Like you, General, I was forced

236
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,600
by the enemy to jump off the cliff.

237
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,110
But, fortunately, I was lucky to be

238
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,270
hung by a protruding branch.

239
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,510
When we sneaked up on Dongluo Army,

240
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,360
how come none of the arrows

241
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,360
flying towards me hit me?

242
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,560
The Dragon King in my dream

243
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,440
must be you, right?

244
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,600
Why don’t you admit it?

245
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,990
Look!

246
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,910
Are you making fun of me?

247
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,230
What are these? Why armors?

248
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,720
They are so heavy!

249
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
You go fight a war and let me

250
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,150
pretend to be General and ride
a horse there?

251
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,600
Do you want to tire me out?

252
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,480
Well, Qingqing…

253
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,390
It’s fine.

254
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,560
Qingqing, we need to thank you
this time.

255
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,080
We can’t let the enemy

256
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,510
know Chenyue’s disappearance.

257
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,600
Yes.

258
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,200
If they knew General

259
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,440
was in their territory,

260
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,510
it would be dangerous.

261
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,150
Don’t worry.

262
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,910
Chenyue will be fine.

263
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,800
I hope so.

264
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,080
So,

265
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,990
we have to recapture this place
as soon as possible.

266
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,600
Now Nanzhao has lost all its provisions,
the morale is destroyed.

267
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,630
I heard that

268
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,110
they have been hunting for food

269
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,320
in the mountains for days.

270
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,720
The beasts are all eaten up.

271
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,360
Now there are only some fish and
shrimps left.

272
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
They can’t hang in there for long.

273
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,200
Lay a fish net in the upper stream.

274
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,320
I want them

275
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,960
not even able to have fish and shrimps.

276
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,270
Give my order.

277
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,840
All get ready to attack at any time.

278
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,840
Yes, sir.

279
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,600
General! Go now!

280
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,600
Gao Yang!

281
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,270
49 days have finally passed.

282
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,080
General.

283
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,800
You are still up so late.

284
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,030
I dreamed of my soldiers.

285
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Are you alright?

286
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,390
It’s so dark here.

287
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,320
So many fireflies!

288
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,560
As long as you fly a firefly,

289
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,800
it will come to me

290
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,560
and lead me to you.

291
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,800
Then,

292
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,630
I can see you anytime?

293
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,840
So beautiful!

294
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,990
So beautiful!

295
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,230
General, do you know how long can
they live?

296
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,150
Seems to be only seven days.

297
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,560
Although their lives are short,

298
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,360
they still live so bright and shiny

299
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,510
in this short period of time.

300
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,230
It’s a meaningful life.

301
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,110
Just like our fallen brothers.

302
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,560
They also shined bright

303
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,030
in their own lives.

304
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,680
They had no regret

305
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,510

Emissary Lu,

335
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,200
His Majesty sent an envoy here!
It’s Mr. Guo!

336
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,680
I’m afraid Mr. Guo is coming
with a bad intention.

337
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,440
-Mr. Guo.
-Mr. Guo.

338
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,080
Gentlemen, please excuse me.

339
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,480
Mr. Guo, please.

340
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,960
Please have some tea.

341
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,360
Where is General Feng?

342
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,630
I’m here on His Majesty’s order.

343
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,030
I need to see General Feng.

344
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,320
General Feng fell off a cliff
in enemy’s territory.

345
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,720
She is now missing.

346
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,800
We’re doing our best to find her.

347
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,870
Missing?

348
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,320
It’s just like the rumors.

349
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,800
How could she, the General Feng,

350
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,390
disappear?

351
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,800
Could it be that she ran away
from the battlefield?

352
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,510
-How could our general run away?
-You…

353
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,360
When the enemy comes,

354
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,800
our general will never run

355
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,390
even if all your family have fled away!

356
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,110
You’ve got a lot of nerve!

357
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,030
How dare you!

358
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,990
Mr. Guo, please tell His Majesty for us

359
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,510
that General will never run away.

360
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,080
You know what?

361
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,720
I need to

362
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,390
see her if she is alive

363
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,840
or her body if she dies.

364
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,680
Now I can’t see neither her

365
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,360
nor her body.

366
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,230
If she didn’t surrender,

367
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,110
then she must have escaped!

368
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,840
I’ll go back to report to His Majesty
right away!

369
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:23,750
Mr. Guo!

370
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,360
Our general is not that kind of person!

371
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,680
You… How dare you…!

372
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,230
I dare!

373
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,510
Mr. Guo has come a long way here.

374
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,320
He needs enough rest.

375
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,200
We need to do our best to find
General Feng first.

376
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,200
Before that,

377
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,990
if Mr. Guo wakes up again,

378
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,510
serve him again in Qingqing’s way.

379
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,360
Emissary Lu,

380
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,510
this is not good.

381
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,990
That will leave a proof.

382
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,680
It will bring us troubles.

383
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,870
Then, what to do?

384
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,600
He will always wake up.

385
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,270
Wait.

386
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,360
This is my ancestral
Seven Days Forgetting Medicine.

387
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,750
He won’t remember anything
after he wakes up.

388
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
This is a good idea!

389
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,480
Now his problem is settled.

390
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,080
And Nanzhao

391
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,720
is also cornered by us.

392
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,150
Now my only worry is…

393
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,320
It’s that

394
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,150
it’s not sure
if Chenyue is alive or not.

395
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,230
That’s it.

396
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,080
Give my order to attack immediately

397
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,720
and find back General Feng!

398
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,990
Yes, sir!

399
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,840
I just found two old vine strips here,

400
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,150
which we can use to climb up.

401
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,750
I also checked around here.

402
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,630
Why didn’t I find them?

403
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,390
This place is not easy to find.

404
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,110
Maybe you missed them.

405
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,840
I think so.

406
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,960
You must be him.

407
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,080
-Chenyue!
-General!

408
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,990
Great! It’s really you!

409
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,960
Are you alright?

410
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,110
Don’t worry.

411
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,680
I can’t be better.

412
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,510
I told you.

413
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,990
Our General is blessed by the God
of Heaven,

414
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,270
and can always turn ill luck into good.

415
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,990
Thanks to Long Yan this time.

416
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,800
You escaped from death in this war

417
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,150
and won a great victory.

418
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,680
I will never let you be in

419
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,910
danger again.

420
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,110
I will petition His Majesty

421
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,630
to summon you back to Wind City
right away.

422
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,320
Nanzhao has retreated?

423
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,990
Yes!

424
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,750
We burnt their provisions.

425
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,600
Then they have no other choices

426
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,560
but only to retreat!

427
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,720
We owe it to you!

428
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,680
Thanks!

429
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,030
Long Yan.

430
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,750
Long Yan?

431
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,200
He is there.

432
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:38,910
Come on!

433
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,630
Let’s make a toast to General together!

434
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,270
Congratulations, General! May the
good luck always be with you!

435
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,600
Nanzhao’s envoy has come
to make peace.

436
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,990
Let’s drink as much as we want

437
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,600
at tonight’s celebration!

438
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,320
Feng Chenyue defeated Nanzhao Army.

439
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,840
How am I going to frame her?

440
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,910
I won’t even believe it myself
if I do that.

441
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,720
Mr. Guo.

442
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,320
This is so weird.

443
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,320
How did I fall into a coma last night?

444
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,320
Such a thing never happened before.

445
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,320
Mr. Guo, you don’t know it.

446
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,360
The heavy dampness in the South

447
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,840
is easy to make people drowsy and tired.

448
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,150
But drinking can help you
relieve fatigue.

449
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,750
Mr. Guo, please drink up.

450
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,910
Cheers.

451
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,990
-Come on.
-Come on. Cheers.

452
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,150
-General.
-General.

453
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,030
Did you see Long Yan?

454
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,110
-No.
-No.

455
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,360
I will remember you.

456
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,270
Wherever you are,

457
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,800
I can always find you.

458
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,560
