Yuchi, don’t leave me.

18
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,520
After the three tribulations,

19
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,240
I won’t give you to anyone.

20
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,190
How is your practice going?

21
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,470
What practice?

22
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,470
Last time I gave you the
Heavenly Secret Guidebook

23
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,320
for practicing to become immortal.

24
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,960
Oh, I remember…

25
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,830
You didn’t even take it seriously!

26
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,830
Why so angry?

27
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,470
Has anyone ever taught you
how to smile?

28
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,240
Just like me.

29
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,430
Curl up the corners of your mouth
like a gold ingot.

30
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,120
That’s the best smile.

31
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,120
You should practice diligently.

32
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,550
Don’t play with these jewelries
all day long.

33
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,120
They can cover my Meteor Mark.

34
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,990
I don’t want you to see it and

35
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,240
dislike me because of it.

36
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,630
You think it’s ugly because you think
I mind it?

37
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,520
You…

38
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,430
So what?

39
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,270
It’s not on your forehead.

40
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,880
Of course you don’t mind it.

41
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:53,630
And,

42
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,160
you don’t care about if I mind that
you mind it.

43
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,470
You know how to help me get rid
of the Meteor Mark.

44
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,600
I just want a string of
your Fleeting Pipa

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,710
to remove the mark on my face…

46
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,040
No, no. Remove the Meteor Mark
on my soul.

47
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,240
It will not

48
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,040
scare you away again.

49
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,310
Maybe

50
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,440
after you get rid of the mark,

51
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,030
you will study the Guidebook seriously

52
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,520
and try to become immortal.

53
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,800
Lord,

54
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,470
I’m really studying the book today.

55
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,590
But I just can’t understand it.

56
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,960
There are so many
drawings on this book.

57
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,280
What do they mean?

58
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,400
You scolded me.

59
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,750
But look at you. The sun is in
the middle of the sky,

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,280
but you’re still sleeping.

61
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,840
Xue Qianxun! Get up!

62
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,400
Lord?

63
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,470
Lord! Lord!

64
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,030
He really pulled out the string?

65
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,470
Yes. But he failed.

66
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,030
That’s great.

67
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,400
Great?!

68
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,310
Explain it to me now.

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,350
Pulling out the string is equivalent to
pulling out his tendons!

70
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,560
If the string is drawn out completely,

71
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,870
it will break all his meridians.

72
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,120
He won’t die since he failed to do it.

73
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,190
He will recover after recuperation.

74
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,440
Die?

75
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,630
How could it be like this?

76
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,590
It’s all my fault!

77
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,630
I shouldn’t have told him about it!

78
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,240
Immortal of Fate,

79
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,310
please! Please help me!

80
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,440
How can I make him feel better?

81
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,000
Or, is there any medicine that

82
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,280
can make him less painful?

83
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,750
There is.

84
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,680
But…

85
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,840
What?

86
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,240
You know the rules here.

87
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,720
I can open the door for you

88
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,590
if you want to borrow books to read.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,310
But if you want to take medicine
and treasures away of my place,

90
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,070
you need to pay a price. You…

91
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,470
I have my feather.

92
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,750
Your feather?

93
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,720
Blue Bird’s feather

94
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,350
is beautiful and gorgeous
like Dragon Scales.

95
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,840
And it’s hard to regenerate.

96
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,840
It is quite rare.

97
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,590
But I heard that

98
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,590
you have to endure a sharp pain

99
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,960
when pulling out the feather.

100
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,470
It’s just like pulling out the tendons.

101
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,030
Look at your thin body.

102
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,870
I think you’d better give up.

103
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,390
Immortal.

104
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,800
Your wound…

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,640
The precious feather of the Blue Bird

106
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,270
really lives up to its fame.

107
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,120
I didn’t expect you to

108
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,390
really do this for him.

109
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,030
You did pull it out yourself.

110
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,240
This is Three Pearl Leaf Tea
made by God Gou Mang

111
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
with leaves like pearls.

112
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,030
It can revive everything

113
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,030
and has a miraculous effect on
meridian injuries.

114
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,880
Remember to let him drink it regularly.

115
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,910
But,

116
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,320
don’t tell anyone
it’s exchanged with me,

117
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,350
or they will all come to me.

118
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,830
I don’t have that much of it.

119
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,320
I got it.

120
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,030
My Lord, have some tea.

121
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,150
Do you feel better?

122
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,470
My Lord,

123
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,270
you suddenly fell into a coma yesterday.

124
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,320
Immortal Taiyi said it might be injury
on your soul.

125
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,150
We must find out the cause,

126
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,080
otherwise…

127
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,560
I’m fine now.

128
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,560
You may leave.

129
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,830
Yes, My Lord.

130
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,560
Why are you pulling a long face?

131
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,830
Sorry, My Lord.

132
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,760
It’s all my fault for talking nonsense

133
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,350
and causing you to pull out the string.

134
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,880
I didn’t know it would hurt your soul

135
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,680
and let you suffer from the pain.

136
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,270
You can punish me or scold me.

137
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,270
Or I can be your maid again.

138
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,710
I can also stop eating and singing.

139
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,640
Don’t cry.

140
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,030
I did it of my own will.

141
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,640
How could I punish you?

142
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,240
Why are you so nice to me?

143
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,560
Now you still ask me why?

144
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,830
It can’t

145
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,270
have no reason…

146
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,590
Because…

147
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,510
Because I like you.

148
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,800
You really like me?

149
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,510
You’re not making fun of me?

150
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,710
It’s always the real one.

151
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
I never made fun of you.

152
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,470
Why are you crying again?

153
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,510
I’m angry with myself.

154
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,830
I’m so stupid and dumb.

155
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,590
You’re always so nice to me,

156
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,390
but I keep doubting you

157
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,880
and ignoring you.

158
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,270
A worthless bird like me is only worthy

159
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,680
of someone like you in my dreams.

160
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,800
No.

161
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,830
What’s wrong?

162
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,510
I… I…

163
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,950
My eyes are swollen from crying.

164
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,470
They don’t look good.

165
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,830
Besides, I didn’t say I like you.

166
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,940
(General’s Mansion)

167
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,200
General, as the old saying goes,

168
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,080
if he doesn’t take the initiative,
you can take it first.

169
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,120
What old saying is it?

170
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,680
Qingqing?

171
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,440
Qingqing!

172
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,470
General, Qingqing is not here.

173
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,710
Then you come to help me.

174
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,640
Bring me the towel on the table.

175
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,030
Yes.

176
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,560
My hands have just applied cream.

177
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
It’s not convenient to do it.

178
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,680
Since she is not here, sorry for
bothering you to help me.

179
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,600
Yes, General.

188
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,480
So she tries hard to keep my feet
in good condition.

189
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,230
Look at my feet.

190
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,200

The feet are a girl’s privacy.

194
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,910
I shouldn’t touch your feet.

195
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,030
But you have already touched them.

196
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,440
Only you and Qingqing

197
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,840
have ever touched my feet in this world.

198
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,720
Keep on drying them.

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,630

After our victory,

210
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,440
many soldiers took leave to return
to their hometown to get married.

211
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,270
Don’t you want to go back to
your hometown?

212
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,440

Star Halo! It’s a good sign!

219
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,680
Sit here. Let’s watch it together.

220
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,320
Why don’t you admit that you’re the
Dragon King?

221
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,030
Could it be that

222
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,200
you have something to hide?

223
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,720
This Star Halo

224
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,440
is just the same as the one
we watched together before.

225
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,150
I’ve never seen Star Halo before.

226
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,230
General, you must have misremembered.

227
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,320
Why do I remember it was you?

228
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,080
It’s cold.

229
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,870
I’ll go get you a coat.

230
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,680
Wait!

231
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,840
Why do you always change the topic

232
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,080
when I mention the past?

233
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,840
What do you mean?

234
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,390
I don’t mean anything.

235
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
My duty

236
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,870
is to protect General.

237
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,440
General!

238
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,440
General!

239
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,230
Come here.

240
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,990
I got information of what

241
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,480
happened in Tiger’s Howl Valley seven
years ago you asked me to investigate.

242
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,300
(Seven years ago
in Tiger’s Howl Valley…)

243
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,320
There is really something wrong.

244
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,360
Seven years ago,

245
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,080
who on earth killed Jin’s father?

246
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,200
Feng Army never sent anyone
to Tiger’s Howl Valley.

247
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,840
The smell of the pills
given by His Highness

248
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,480
is exactly the same as the smell

249
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,800
I smelled
when I first met him and fainted.

250
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,870
What’s this smell?

251
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,270
It smells good.

252
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,910
I feel dizzy…

253
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,270
Mandrake?

254
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,600
You’re not sick.

255
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,600
You’re poisoned by Mandrake.

256
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,320
Don’t take it again.

257
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,390
It can only temporarily
relieve your pain,

258
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,600
but later it will make you suffer more.

259
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,100
All you see it hatred.

260
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,460
(Feng)

261
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,630
(Feng)
Father!

262
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,030
You must remember the hatred.

263
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,270
(Dongluo Hall)

264
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,680
Say it again.

265
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,910
Feng Chenyue

266
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,960
came back unharmed.

267
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,960
You may leave now.

268
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,220
(Dongluo Hall)

269
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,750
Came back unharmed.

270
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,680
Came back unharmed.

271
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,480
Feng Chenyue…

272
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,200
Good…

273
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,960
She came back unharmed.

274
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,360
Feng Chenyue.

275
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,510
How come you just can’t die?

276
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,200
Your Highness.

277
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,870
What’s the matter?

278
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,680
I heard Your Highness is leaving
Wind City.

279
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,390
I wonder if I can get more…

280
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,600
Life-saving Pills?

281
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,720
Yes.

282
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,680
You know it’s hard to make this pill.

283
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,390
Only one can be made in a month.

284
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,870
It’s impossible for me to bring a lot.

285
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,150
If you’re loyal to me,

286
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,390
I will send people to deliver it to you
when the moon is full.

287
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,030
Leave now.

288
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,560
I’ll never dare to betray you.

289
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,480
Wait!

290
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,750
Feng Chenyue.

291
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,200
Feng Chenyue didn’t die,

292
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,150
but now she must be weak.

293
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,960
Yes.

294
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,390
Now you lead other guards

295
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,720
to go assassinate her.

296
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,150
Maybe there’s still a chance.

297
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,270
But, Your Highness,

298
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,270
more people will only attract
more Feng Army soldiers.

299
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,910
Please let me go alone.

300
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,630
You can do it alone?

301
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,870
Your Highness, don’t you remember?

302
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,630
Now I’m Feng Chenyue’s friend.

303
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,680
Attack from a friend

304
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,840
is the hardest to avoid.

305
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,390
Yes.

306
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,680
Don’t waste any time. Go now.

307
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,440
But, I still have one request.

308
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,270
Say it.

309
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,230
I don’t know if I can

310
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,840
come back after this assassination.

311
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,910
I hope I can have a drink
with Your Highness

312
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,230
to thank you for your kindness
these years.

313
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,720
Sure.

314
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,270
Go now.

315
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,800
Excuse me for my leave.

316
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,990
Go.

317
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,110
Feng Chenyue.

318
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,600
I knew you’d came.

319
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,320
Let’s do it.

320
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,030
Han Xiyun sent you to kill me, right?

321
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,150
When did you become his assassin?

322
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,560
Seven years ago,

323
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,840
I became his secret guard.

324
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,080
Han Xiyun is known for his cruelty
in the battlefield,

325
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,150
killing people, even babies.

326
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,560
But you’ve been under his command
for even years.

327
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,480
Why?!

328
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,510
Stop asking questions.

329
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,960
Just kill me.

330
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,560
You came to me

331
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,680
just to let me kill you?

332
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,750
Yes.

333
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,680
No more talks.

334
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,150
Just do it.

335
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,990
Why are you seeking death?

336
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,560
I’ve worked for Han Xiyun for years

337
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,870
and carried countless guilts.

338
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,440
I would like to die

339
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,230
by your hand.

340
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,080
Alright.

341
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,840
Then I’ll kill you now.

342
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,870
It’s too dark and I missed the point.

343
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,910
Do you want me to kill you again?

344
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,360
Jin? Jin!

345
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Can you help her?

346
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,270
I can try.

347
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,360
But no one should be by my side.

348
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,960
Alright.

349
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,600
I’m afraid you’re too silly

350
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,110
to figure it out.

351
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,480
You’re the silly one!

352
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,600
General.

353
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,680
I heard the sound of fighting.

354
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,390
Where is the assassin?

355
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,960
Jin got poisoned.

356
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,680
Long Yan is helping her.

357
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,630
