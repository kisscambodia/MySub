I went and had a nice, hot bath

maybe I'd interview the other Variant.

She came to me on Asgard a long time ago

278

and then she took me
to one of her apocalypses

we hatched our plan together.

They kidnapped you from the timeline,

332
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and erased your memories.

333
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,120
Memories she can access
through enchantment.

334
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:40,790
So before this, you had a past,
maybe you had a family, a life.

335
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,870
Nice try.

336
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,950
That was good. You two, what a pair!

337
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,500
Gosh! Unbelievable. Wherever you go,
it's just death, destruction,

338
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,040
the literal ends of worlds.

339
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,790
Well, I'm gonna have
to close this case now,

340
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,950
'cause I don't need you anymore.

Yeah, or as you might say,
our interests are no longer aligned.

and there are a great many,
you're the biggest.

344
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,160
Why? 'Cause I lied about your girlfriend?

345
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,540
Oh, no. That I can respect.

- Sylvie?
- The Variant, that's what Loki calls her.

She wouldn't have escaped.

Fine.

374
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,450
I received word from the Time-Keepers.

375
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,870
They want to personally oversee
the Variant's pruning.

376
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,370
And they want you there, too.

377
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,950
It's about time. Great.

378
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,450
When... When did you first notice
what was going on with C-20?

379
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,410
Mobius, what is going on with you?

380
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
- Nothing.
- We did it.

381
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,120
- I know.
- The Time-Keepers are happy.

382
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,700
- It's great.
- Mission accomplished.

383
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,790
Mission accomplished.
It was just that she seemed fine when I...

384
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,160
When I saw her.
I mean, a little freaked, but fine.

385
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,910
Well, she quickly wasn't fine.

386
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,620
- Okay.
- Okay.

387
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,660
C-20? The Variant?

388
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,790
All these questions,
what are you getting at?

389
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,870
I don't know. I...

390
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,040
Something just seems a little off.

391
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,500
Fine. You want the truth?

392
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,700
I'm trying to protect you.

393
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,700
Would you normally interview
someone like that? Yeah.

394
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,620
But the Variant scares the hell out of me,

395
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,040
and I didn't want to see
anything happen to you.

396
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,410
C-20 lost her mind.

397
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,330
She couldn't even form words by the end.

398
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:20,160
I just couldn't deal with that
happening to you or anyone else.

399
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,160
Is that what you wanted to hear?

400
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,330
Yeah, if it's the truth.

401
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,700

too much time with Lokis.

402
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,120
<font color="#ff00ff">(CHUCKLES)</font> Yeah.

403
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,870
I definitely have been
spending too much time with Lokis.

404
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,040
What we do here matters.

405
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,410
I know.

406
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,830
When we're out there fighting
for the fate of the Sacred Timeline

407
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,040
we're also fighting for this. For us.

408
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,410
Friends against time, allies to the end.

409
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,370
You've seen all of existence, same as me.
So, you know,

410
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,160
friendship like ours is uncommon.

411
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,580
And worth fighting for.

412
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,790
Same as the Sacred Timeline.

413
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,330
It was a good speech.

414
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,370
Thank you.

Was that so hard to admit?

That's a trick. It's a deception.

- I was created by the Time-Keepers.
