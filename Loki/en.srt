14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,080
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,040
Do you know

16
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
where Cheng Ruoyu is?

17
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,720
Yuzhen Hall?

18
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,520
He's telling you to meet him
at Yuzhen Hall?

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,760
I've already sent someone

20
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,280
to give a letter to His Majesty.

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
If he wants you alive,

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,880
he must come alone.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,320
Do you think

24
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,160
he'll come?

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,080
Who exactly are you?

26
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,560
What is your relationship

27
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,120
to Zhenwu and rebels

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,720
like Wang Yang?

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,840
Why are you seeking revenge
from His Majesty?

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,680
Your Highness Prince Guang.

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
Tell the young talent you chose

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,000
who the real rebel is.

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,760
Eight years ago,

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,400
because Qiu Ziliang was too powerful,

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,080
the late emperor
was like His Majesty now,

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,000
living in torment.

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,760
Li Xu, the Chancellor back then,

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,960
and Fengyang's military commissioner
Zheng Lu agreed

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,280
to use Morning Dew as the name

40
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,080
to lure Qiu Ziliang
to the Left Battle Hall

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,680
and kill him.

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,680
Everyone, this way please.

43
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,560
Everyone.

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,320
Please take a look.

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,040
General Han.

46
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,600
This is Morning Dew?

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,320
Right.

48
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,760
It's such a cold day.

49
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,160
Why is are you sweating so much,
General Han?

50
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,520
I've been sick lately.

51
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,800
Thank you for your concern,
Official Qiu.

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,560
Could it be due to another reason?

53
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,040
There's an ambush.

54
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,920
Run!

55
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,600
Hurry!

56
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,840
Chase after them!

57
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,400
But who knew

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,920
that Qiu Ziliang

59
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,400
received news beforehand

60
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,920
and killed Li Xu and Zheng Lu instead.

61
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,600
He commanded the Shencai Army

62
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,600
to charge into the late emperor's
bed chambers

63
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,920
and locked him up.

64
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,680
What's written in the resume

65
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,600
is false indeed.

66
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,800
Zheng Wu's father wasn't a rebel.

67
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,000
The pitiful Wu.

68
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,960
Wu.

69
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
The late emperor knew
that he was dying soon,

70
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,920
so he wrote a posthumous edict

71
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,560
and commanded

72
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,040
General-in-Chief Han Yue

73
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,680
to bring the posthumous edict

74
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,320
to Chancellor Wang Yang.

75
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,480
Kill him!

76
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,200
- Charge!
- Charge!

77
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,200
Stop!

78
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,440
He's over there!

79
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,320
Hurry!

80
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,680
- Hurry!
- Charge!

81
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,640
- Hurry!
- Stop!

82
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,320
Kill him!

83
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,040
- Don't run!
- Hurry!

84
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,240
- Come on!
- Don't run!

85
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,920
Capture him!

86
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,800
- Let's go!
- Stop!

87
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,760
- Don't run!
- Stop!

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,680
- Stop!
- Don't run!

89
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,920
- After them!
- Stop!

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,840
Kill him!

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,680
Stop!

92
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,960
Stop!

93
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,080
- Stop!
- Charge!

94
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,800
- Chancellor, leave.
- Official Wang.

95
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,120
Chancellor.

96
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,960
Official Wang!

97
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,080
General Han.

98
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,760
- Mr. Han.
- Mr. Han.

99
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,440
General Han.

100
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,520
Official Wang,
receive the imperial edict.

101
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,520
(Chancellor's Residence)

102
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
Charge!

103
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
(Chancellor's Residence)
Charge!

104
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,840
- Charge!
- Charge!

105
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,120
Go, hurry.

106
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,559
Chamberlain.

107
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,480
Save Chancellor!

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
Hurry!

109
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,320
General Han died for them.

110
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,960
However, Qiu Ziliang

111
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,680
appeared at the secret passage's exit

112
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,880
in the end

113
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,440
and stopped Official Wang.

114
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,080
Qiu Ziliang

115
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,240
didn't find

116
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,920
the posthumous edict on them.

117
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Out of anger,

118
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,480
he created a bloodbath in Heng'an

119
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,560
and even used the opportunity to punish

120
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,600
and imprison his political enemies.

121
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,880
Back then,

122
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,600
up to 1,000 officials

123
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,080
were dragged down in the incident.

124
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,960
What does the posthumous edict say?

125
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,760
Pass the throne to Prince Guang.

126
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,200
(Virtuous and Prestigious)
Greetings, Chess Overseer!

127
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,960
Bring people there first

128
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,920
and surround Yuzhen Hall.

129
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,120
I'll catch up with you.

130
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,800
Remember.

131
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,880
Don't alert them.

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
Wait for me to get there first.

133
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,880
All right.

134
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,440
(Qiu)

135
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,160
Follow me.

136
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,200
Chess Overseer.

137
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,960
Chess Overseer.

138
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
Someone named Ziyuan

139
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,360
came to seek help.

140
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,360
She said

141
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,800
that Cheng Ruoyu commanded her to come.

142
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,400
Chess Overseer.

143
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,920
She's the one I mentioned.

144
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,720
Cheng Ruoyu told you to come to me?

145
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,680
Zhenwu's military advisor
occupied Yuzhen Hall

146
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,400
and captured everyone in Yuzhen Hall.

147
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,720
I was the only one
who managed to escape.

148
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,880
How do you want me to help you then?

149
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,040
You two are working together?

150
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,480
Too bad.

151
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,600
You found out too late.

152
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,680
One betrayed Yuzhen Hall.

153
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,000
The other betrayed
Chess of Generals Camp.

154
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,920
You should know

155
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,120
that even if I don't have
any martial arts skill,

156
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
I have at least ten ways

157
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,440
of protecting myself.

158
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,480
Left Knight.

159
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,400
I'll give you one last chance.

160
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,880
As long as you swear

161
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,400
to stop betraying me,

162
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,680
I can forgive you

163
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,600
for what you're doing now.

164
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,960
Qiu Yanzhi.

165
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,680
You're great
in buying people off indeed.

166
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,000
What a shame.

167
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,200
The trick used
in "Seven Captures of Meng Huo"

168
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,600
is completely useless to me.

169
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,920
Can I ask

170
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,840
what your next step is then?

171
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,640
Use you to get Qiu Ziliang involved.

172
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,160
Use...

173
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,920
Rosa rubus.

174
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,600
Both cannons in Huainan.

175
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
Right Chariot in Lucong.

176
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,120
Left Chariot in Zhaoyi.

177
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,400
Now,

178
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,640
these four people
are missing at the same time.

179
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,640
No.

180
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,640
Not at the same time.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,520
Some must have gone missing before
and after each other.

182
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,360
However,

183
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,040
they were brought

184
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,640
to me at the same time.

185
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,240
Who could have done it?

186
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,520
I haven't

187
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,280
been provoked this way in a long time.

188
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,560
I'll investigate immediately.

189
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,760
Eight years ago,

190
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,200
the late emperor

191
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,320
intended to pass the throne
to me indeed.

192
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Qiu Ziliang imprisoned him
for eight years.

193
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,200
The late emperor passed away

194
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,760
in the beginning of this year.

195
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,040
Before he died,

196
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,640
he already tacitly consented

197
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,040
to pass the throne to His Majesty.

198
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,240
Can he not tacitly consent?

199
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,680
Qiu Ziliang was eyeing him
with hostility.

200
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,280
The late emperor had no power
to retaliate.

201
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,960
Those of you living
an ignoble existence,

202
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,280
do you want to wait

203
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,360
until Qiu Ziliang dies of old age

204
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,760
before you free yourself from misery?

205
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Let me tell you.

206
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,960
That's impossible.

207
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,880
The eunuch's power is already
deeply rooted in the hearts of people.

208
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,560
If you don't kill him

209
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
at the peak of his power,

210
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,560
it's impossible to shake his foundation.

211
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,720
How would you kill him?

212
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,280
By relying on Zhenwu?

213
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,720
At least I dare to try.

214
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you?

215
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,320
Qi Yan has arrived.

216
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,600
Since they're all here,

217
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,360
it's time for us to leave.

218
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,750
(Yuzhen Hall)

219
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,820
(Yuzhen Hall)

220
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,680
Isn't Chess Overseer here yet?

221
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
We'll pick her up now.

222
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,840
Wasn't this secret passage sealed?

223
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,320
Even if it was sealed,
it can be reopened.

224
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,200
His Majesty.

225
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,080
Don't worry.

226
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,920
He won't die.

227
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,720
Even if he dies,

228
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,640
he must do it after Qiu Ziliang does.

229
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,920
Let's go.

230
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,640
Master.

231
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,680
Everything is in order now.

232
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,480
All right.

233
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,520
Based on my calculation,

234
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,560
it's about time.

235
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,920
Clean up a bit

236
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,800
before bringing Qi Yan to meet us.

237
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.

238
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,840
Ziyuan.

239
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,400
Do you really want to help
a villain do evil

240
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,360
and continue your wrongdoing?

241
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,360
You're the ones who are wrong.

242
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,320
Let's go.

243
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,700
(Yan's Textile)

244
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,080
Is it here?

245
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,840
Yes, sir.

246
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,200
His Majesty and Left Advisor

247
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,600
are both inside.

248
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,920
- Lead the way.
- Yes.

249
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,800
(Yuzhen Hall)

250
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,960
Official Qiu.

251
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,480
Their throats were all slit.

252
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,680
There were no traces of fighting.

253
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,680
Their facial expressions are very calm.

254
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,119
They must have fainted

255
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,520
before being killed.

256
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,960
See

257
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,000
if you can find His Majesty's corpse.

258
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

259
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,240
This is Chess
of Generals Camp's dungeon.

260
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,000
Indeed.

261
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,840
The most dangerous place

262
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,800
is the safest place.

263
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,280
The military advisor
chose the place well.

264
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,680
Qiu Yanzhi.

265
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,040
You're quite smart.

266
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,440
Eight years.

267
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,080
You suppressed me for eight full years.

268
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,720
This day has finally come.

269
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,160
I guessed that the military advisor

270
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,800
placed a pawn in Chess of Generals Camp.

271
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,920
I didn't expect that it was you.

272
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,280
What do you think?

273
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,640
How does it feel

274
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,120
to be controlled?

275
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,600
You're such a petty man.

276
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,240
No wonder

277
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,520
Father chose me to be Chess Overseer.

278
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,840
How stubborn.

279
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
I'm here.

280
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,720
Where is Cheng Ruoyu?

281
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,680
Release her.

282
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,280
What's the matter?

283
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,480
Are you worried about your little lover?

284
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,320
It's lonely in prison.

285
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,560
Isn't it good to have her

286
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,880
with you?

287
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,440
I don't need her company.

288
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,360
I feel annoyed when I see her.

289
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,240
Release her.

290
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,080
That makes sense.

291
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,160
Since you're already here,

292
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,880
what's the use of keeping her alive?

293
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,560
I'll kill her then

294
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,400
to prevent any issues
in the future.

295
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,960
You just want

296
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,200
me and Qiu Ziliang's life.

297
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
I'll give you my life.

298
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,760
This has nothing to do with her.

299
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,200
Release her.

300
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,440
No.

301
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,640
I planned this for eight years

302
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,760
before I got this opportunity.

303
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,960
I can't allow for any mistakes.

304
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
If you want to blame anything,

305
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,120
blame it

306
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,240
on your ill-fated love,

307
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,840
which will cause her death.

308
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,440
You don't kill innocent people.

309
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,480
Yes.

310
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
That's why the old me died already.

311
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,960
I want to talk to you.

312
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
What do you mean?

313
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,360
What I'll say is very important.

314
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,480
I don't want other people present.

315
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,400
Why should I give you that chance?

316
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,160
Because the General-in-Chief
of Jinwu Guards

317
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
would agree.

318
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,320
Qiu Yanzhi.

319
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,480
I'm warning you.

320
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,480
Don't play any tricks.

321
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,480
Left Knight.

322
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,960
Bring Qi Yan out first.

323
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,920
I want to talk

324
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,520
to Qiu Yanzhi alone.

325
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,080
Yes.

326
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,920
Ms. Ziyuan.

327
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Yu'er's heart meridian is damaged.

328
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,280
She needs to be treated immediately.

329
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,120
Cheng Ruoyu is the bait for Qi Yan.

330
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,000
As for her life,

331
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,440
you can have it.

332
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,200
Where did you bring His Majesty?

333
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,400
Don't move.

334
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,320
What are you planning to do?

335
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,840
Yu'er.

336
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,440
Your life is in danger now,

337
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,680
and you're still worried
about the man you love?

338
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,800
Your Majesty.

339
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,720
Yu'er, sit down.

340
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,160
Go inside.

341
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,600
Your Majesty.

342
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,560
Uncle, are you all right?

343
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,560
Your Majesty, are you all right?

344
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
Are you injured?

345
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,360
Yu'er.

346
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,280
You're injured.

347
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,680
I'm fine.

348
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,720
Savior

349
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,840
already checked my pulse earlier.

350
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,200
I'm fine.

351
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,200
I'll recover very soon.

352
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,680
Why are you smiling?

353
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,880
Nothing.

354
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
I'm just

355
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,680
happy.

356
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,920
You're already a prisoner,

357
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,800
and you're still so happy.

358
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,200
Originally,

359
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,680
I thought that I'd die.

360
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,080
But I didn't.

361
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,600
Originally, I thought

362
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,760
that you're suspicious of me

363
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,080
and that you won't trust me again.

364
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,240
I didn't expect

365
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,280
that you still came to save me.

366
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,360
I just came to catch

367
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,120
the mastermind.

368
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,880
Since we

369
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,560
already know who the mastermind is,

370
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,280
what should we do next?

371
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,960
You don't

372
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
look worried at all.

373
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,760
I'm worried.

374
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,880
But I'm more happy than worried.

375
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,280
I'm happy

376
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,760
that we're one step closer
to the truth again.

377
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,640
How did you know

378
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,760
that I'm the Left
General-in-Chief of the Jinwu Guards?

379
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,600
"The customs are rich.

380
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,200
The emperor is kind and amicable.

381
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,240
Walking while humming a tune,

382
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,440
everything is peaceful."

383
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,120
You are...

384
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,400
That's impossible.

385
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,400
Aren't you already dead?

386
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,920
What about you?

387
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,240
Eight years ago,

388
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,080
I saw you die.

389
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,440
I'm Ruoqing.

390
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,320
Greetings, General-in-Chief.

391
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,080
General Han.

392
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,040
I didn't expect us to meet again.

393
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
You're really

394
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,840
Wang Ruoqing?

395
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,820
(Duke Chu's Residence)

396
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,840
You haven't found them?

397
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,520
Yes.

398
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
Yanzhi, Left Knight,

399
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,080
His Majesty, Prince Guang,

400
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,120
Cheng Ruoyu.

401
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,920
We didn't find any of them.

402
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,520
Oh, right.

403
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,840
Left Advisor too.

404
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
Left Advisor is alive?

405
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,160
You're awake?

406
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Left Knight.

407
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,160
Why am I here?

408
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,800
What happened?

409
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,360
What do you think?

410
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,200
You were the one who lit

411
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
the rosa tubus candle there.

412
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,520
What is your relationship

413
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,600
with Zhenwu's military advisor?

414
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,600
It seems like you're not that stupid.

415
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,240
I didn't expect that
without Qiu Yanzhi,

416
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,480
you

417
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,600
are quite smart.

418
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,360
Why did you do that?

419
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,280
I know.

420
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,920
Qiu Yanzhi and I are the same.

421
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
We hid our real identities.

422
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,120
But I did it to seek revenge.

423
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,160
What about her?

424
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,360
What is the reason? Tell me!

425
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,040
I don't know.

426
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Let's find

427
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,720
the answer together then.

428
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,800
Tell me.

429
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,880
How important are you

430
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,680
to Yanzhi?

431
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,760
Will she kill herself

432
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,360
for you?

433
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,000
Left General-in-Chief
of the Jinwu Guards,

434
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,760
Han Yue?

435
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,080
He's the late emperor's confidant.

436
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,640
During the Morning Dew Rebellion,

437
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,160
he was the one who brought
the posthumous edict

438
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,320
to Wang Yang.

439
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,480
He's not dead?

440
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,000
Your Majesty, you've long known?

441
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,240
Your Majesty.

442
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,440
I'm guilty.

443
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,880
Uncle.

444
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,840
Your Majesty.

445
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,600
Three days
after the Morning Dew Rebellion,

446
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,880
late at night,

447
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,760
someone knocked on the door
of House 16.

448
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,560
After opening the door, I realized

449
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,120
that he was Han Yue.

450
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,720
I took a great risk in saving him.

451
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,640
I even asked someone to send him
outside the border.

452
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,320
But afterwards,

453
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,840
I never heard from him again.

454
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,680
I'm guilty.

455
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,720
You were the one who saved Han Yue?

456
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,080
This is the heavens' will.

457
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,840
You don't need to blame yourself.

458
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,120
He came back this time

459
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,040
to seek revenge for the late emperor.

460
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,520
He wants to kill His Majesty
and Duke Chu.

461
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,680
Your Highness.

462
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,360
Do you also think
that the rebellion back then

463
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,680
was His Majesty's fault?

464
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,920
I

465
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,600
once told you something.

466
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,120
Today,

467
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,840
I'll say it again.

468
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm willing to assist Your Majesty

469
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,480
in making Xing prosperous again.

470
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,520
While I'm still alive,

471
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,760
that will never change.

472
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,880
Uncle.

473
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,600
"Regardless if it's cold
and the horse is freezing,

474
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,120
I only see the wars in the borders
and try my best to kill the enemies."

475
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,600
Thank you

476
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,160
for risking your life to save me

477
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,760
when I was in danger that day.

478
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,120
Ruoqing.

479
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,040
Stand up.

480
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,400
I feel ashamed.

481
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,960
I wasn't able to save you in the end.

482
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,640
When I woke up,

483
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,920
I heard that the entire Wang family

484
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,600
was already sentenced to death.

485
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:01,840
*was already sentenced to death.

486
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,840
Grandfather died by Qi Yan's arrow.

487
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,080
His body was dragged to the downtown
area and cut in half.

488
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,320
Grandfather!

489
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,560
Qi Yan struck an arrow

490
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,320
into my younger sister's heart and mine.

491
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,440
When I woke up,

492
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,320
it was already late at night.

493
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,360
The entire mountain was filled
with corpses.

494
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,840
I looked everywhere,

495
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,240
wanting to find my grandfather
and sister.

496
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,560
I couldn't find them.

497
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,960
Later on, I saw someone came over,

498
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,640
so I can only give up searching

499
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,880
and went down the mountain secretly.

500
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,960
In the end, I fainted

501
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,440
in front of a pharmacy.

502
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,040
Perhaps the heavens were protecting me.

503
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,520
That arrow didn't go through my heart,

504
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,040
so I survived.

505
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,920
(Zhang's Pharmacy)
But I never found my sister,

506
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,120
and I don't know if she's alive or not.

507
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
Fortunately,

508
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,960
the pharmacy's owner has
some medical skills

509
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,840
and cleaned my wound.

510
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,200
Miss.

511
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,920
Miss.

512
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,000
I was afraid of dragging them down,

513
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,240
so I left when I woke up the next day.

514
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,000
Afterwards,

515
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,360
I wandered around

516
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,200
and fell into the hands
of human traffickers.

517
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,640
After being in different places,

518
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,400
I was sold back to Heng'an.

519
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
At that time,

520
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,320
the Music Hall owner who bought me said

521
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,560
that a big shot would be coming tomorrow

522
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,840
and that we should perform well.

523
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,600
Guess who that person was.

524
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,560
Qiu Ziliang.

525
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,400
Sir, please come in.

526
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
Based on your request,

527
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
I picked 20 people.

528
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,000
They're all very clever girls

529
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,520
below 12 years old.

530
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,280
Please come inside.

531
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
Greetings, General-in-Chief.

532
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,199
Why did you come out?

533
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,880
Go.

534
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,360
You know me?

535
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,239
You're the Cavalry General-in-Chief,

536
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,600
Supervising Military Envoy and Military
Commissioner of the Left and Right.

537
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,719
The most powerful man now.

538
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,159
When I saw that Qiu Ziliang
was the one who came,

539
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,600
I was very angry.

540
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,360
But I also knew

541
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,960
that I can't seek revenge
since I'm weak.

542
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,560
I used oleander powder

543
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,520
to ruin my face,

544
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,800
then recommended myself to him.

545
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,720
Who knew that Qiu Ziliang
wouldn't buy it?

546
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,320
After he left,

547
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,080
because I was disrespectful,

548
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,600
I angered the Music Hall owner.

549
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,560
For a period of time,

550
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,040
I wished I were dead.

551
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,600
If I stayed a few more days
back then

552
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,840
to look for you, that would be great.

553
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,360
Perhaps I could bring you with me.

554
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
What a shame, Ruoqing,

555
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,000
I didn't know that you're still alive.

556
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,480
It's my fate.

557
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,280
After two months,

558
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,200
I pulled a trick to kill
the Music Hall owner

559
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,400
and made everyone there convinced.

560
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,680
At that time,

561
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,520
Qiu Ziliang came to pick me up.

562
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,480
It turns out that it was
the last challenge

563
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,720
he gave me.

564
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,360
I passed.

565
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,200
So he personally

566
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,000
chose me to join Chess of Generals Camp.

567
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,760
But I didn't expect

568
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,520
that he made my home

569
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,120
the Chess of Generals Camp's base.

570
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,960
Every day, I keep watching

571
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,320
and wondering

572
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,160
how that place

573
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
turned out this way.

574
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,800
That gave me more motivation to live on.

575
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,240
Live on,

576
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,080
and seek revenge.

577
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,160
General Han.

578
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,280
The grievance for killing
my entire family,

579
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,200
the hatred for massacring my city,

580
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,400
the pain of bringing disaster
upon my nation,

581
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,360
I never dared to forget them.

582
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,160
General Han,

583
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,880
please let me assist you.

584
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,160
Yu'er.

585
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,360
Yu'er.

586
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,080
Are you all right?

587
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,400
I'm fine.

588
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,880
Don't worry.

589
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,360
We can surely find a way

590
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,320
to get out of here.

591
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,320
It's true.

592
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,280
I'm fine.

593
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,280
Don't move.

594
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,320
Yanzhi?

595
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,720
Yanzhi, how are you doing?

596
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,360
Did he give you a hard time?

597
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,920
Are you all right?

598
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,040
You're the ones who are not fine.

599
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,240
His Majesty is here.

600
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,040
My father didn't come.

601
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,040
As long as Father don't come,

602
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,120
I'll be fine.

603
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,280
You were snubbed, didn't you?

604
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,360
She's not in a good mood.

605
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,520
It's probably because she sees me here,

606
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,800
and Qiu Ziliang isn't here yet.

607
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,040
So,

608
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,880
you must know

609
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,440
how luck you are, don't you?

610
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,040
I'm just a guard.

611
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,120
I can't believe I could let you
risk your life by coming here alone.

612
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,200
However,

613
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,720
Yanzhi...

614
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,720
I don't know if Qiu Ziliang

615
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,120
will risk his life

616
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,200
for his goddaughter.

617
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,040
- Let Princess go!
- Let me go!

618
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,320
- Let Princess go!
- Let go!

619
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,880
Let me go!

620
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,880
Kneel!

621
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,560
We're royal retainers

622
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,800
who brought Princess Ninghe
back to Heng'an.

623
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,480
How can you treat us so rudely?

624
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,320
Bring him up.

625
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,120
Yes.

626
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,200
The wound was from a scimitar indeed.

627
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,720
And Zhenwu has

628
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,680
this kind of scimitar.

629
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,720
What does this mean?

630
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,520
Tell me.

631
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,640
Who was His Majesty meeting

632
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,000
in Yuzhen Hall?

633
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

634
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,240
It was your scimitar.

635
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,000
You don't know?

636
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,880
All of us were in the relay station.

637
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,640
No one went out.

638
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,680
Is that so?

639
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,520
Tell me.

640
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,560
What have you seen?

641
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,480
Duke Chu.

642
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,960
I saw this man go out.

643
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,720
You may go.

644
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,920
Yes.

645
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,320
He was talking about you.

646
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,880
Where did you go?

647
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,720
I...

648
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,840
I...

649
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,720
You don't want to tell me?

650
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,000
This is what we'll do.

651
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,400
Since you don't want to tell me,

652
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,000
let's play a game

653
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,680
until you tell me.

654
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,520
This is an hourglass.

655
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,160
All the sand inside

656
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,080
go down there from above.

657
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,040
From this moment on,

658
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,720
what's going down aren't the sand.

659
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,200
It's

660
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,120
ten Zhenwu royal retainers' lives.

661
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,520
Think about it carefully.

662
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,600
Yes.

663
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,960
- Take them away.
- Yes.

664
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,680
- Stand up.
- Let's go.

665
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,960
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

666
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,240
- Let's go.
- Come on.

667
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:10,920
Let's go.

668
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,560
- Don't move around.
- Come on.

669
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,320
Stand up.

670
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,240
Hurry!

671
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,720
- Hurry.
- Come on.

672
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,720
You're randomly killing Zhenwu
royal retainers.

673
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
Aren't you afraid that royal retainers
will create a disturbance?

674
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,920
It's not that I want to kill you.

675
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,720
Lucong's assassin sneaked into Heng'an

676
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,880
and tried to kill His Majesty first,

677
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,600
then he killed Zhenwu's
royal retainers.

678
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,040
You should

679
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,920
settle this score with Lucong.

680
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,880
You're a monster.

681
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,240
I'll kill you!

682
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,400
Princess!

683
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
Princess!

684
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,240
