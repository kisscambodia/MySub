A variation of this guy.

105

A type we should
all be very familiar with,

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
because the TVA
has pruned a lotta these guys,

107
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
almost more than any other Variant.

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,660
And no two are alike.

109
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,120
Slight differences in appearances,
or not so slight.

110
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,700
Different powers, although,
powers, generally include

111
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,830
shape-shifting,
illusion-projection, and my favorite...

112
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,830
Duplication-casting.

113
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,540
Illusion-projection.

114

No, they're two
completely different powers.

115
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,700
How?

116
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,370
Illusion-projection involves depicting
a detailed image from outside oneself,

117
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,370
which is perceptible
in the external world,

118
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,700
whereas duplication-casting
entails recreating

119
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,250
an exact facsimile of one's own body
in its present circumstance,

120
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,830
which acts as a true holographic mirror
of its molecular structure.

121
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,660

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,620
Okay, take a breath. Noted.

including myself and Professor Loki.

124

Why?

125
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,160
Because whoever this Variant is,
we haven't been able to find him.

126
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,000
So let's bring in an expert.

127
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,370

128
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,370
- Do I get a weapon?
- Nah.

129
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,200

Is no one concerned about that?

130
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,160
- Of what?
- Me betraying you.

131
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,450
- No.
- Why not?

132
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,870
You know that we can catch you.

133
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,160
And how's betraying us gonna get you
any closer to the Time-Keepers?

134
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,790
An audience
with the Time-Keepers is on the table?

135
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,200

Let me ask you this,

138
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,700
why don't we just travel
back to before the attack,

139
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,330
when the Variant first arrives?

140
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,290
Nexus events destabilize the time flow.

141
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,620
This branch is still changing and growing,
so you gotta show up in real time.

142
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,080

143
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,950
Well, as many as I could stand.

144
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,000
Your TVA propaganda is exhausting.

145
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,290
And what do these do?

146
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,620
Reset charges prune the affected
radius of a branched timeline,

147
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,500
allowing time to heal all its wounds.

148
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,790
Which sounds like a nice way

149
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,290
of saying disintegrate
everything in its vicinity.

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,120
If you leave this tent,
you'll end up like them.

165
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,120
What do you see?

166
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,620
I see a scheme,

167
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,160
and in that scheme, I see myself.

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,660
We have a saying in Asgard,

169
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,540
"Where there are wolf's ears,
wolf's teeth are near."

170
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
It means to be aware of your surroundings.

171
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,120
Which is absurd, because my people are,
by nature, gullible fools.

172
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,830
A trait that I, the God of Mischief,

173
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,620
exploited time and time again
simply by listening.

174
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,160
My teeth were sharp,
but my ears even sharper.

175
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,450
We're running out of time, Mobius.

176
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,040
Hold it. Just give him a chance.

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,040
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.

Those you underestimate will devour you.

181
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,000
You underestimate me,

182
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,040
just as you
underestimate this lesser Loki.

183
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,080
Which is why, you walk into
one wolf's mouth after another.

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,910
Okay. Come on, Loki,
make a long story short.

That's exactly what
the Variant wants you to do.

188
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,910
It's a trap.
He's waiting for you outside this tent.

189
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,450
Should I secure the reset charges?

190
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,660
No. He wants me. I'm the key to his plan.

191
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,950
- He knows that I'm stronger.
- Almost one unit.

192
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,290
And he rightly believes that together
we can overthrow and rule the TVA.

193
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,160
But that's not what I want.
I have a new purpose.

194
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,790
I'm a servant of the Sacred Timeline.

195
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,790
And knowing
what I now know about his tactics,

196
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,080
I can deliver you the Variant,

197
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,540
but I need assurances.

198
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,620
Yeah?

199
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,040
Assurances that I won't be
completely disintegrated

200
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,080
the moment the job has been done.

it sounds like someone I know.

- What?

Listen, Ravonna, I'm sorry.

236
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,950
I realize that my, you know,

237
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,580
methods with this Loki
are controversial, but...

238
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,950
Towing a dangerous Variant
into the field is controversial.

239
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,580
Yeah, it didn't go exactly
the way I wanted it to today,

240
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,290
but here's what we did find out.

241
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,200
The Variant likes to stall for time,

242
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,080
and, eventually, we'll catch
the other one doing the same thing.

243
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,700
Because understanding
this Loki helps me get closer

244
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,620
to the one we're chasing. Right?

245
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,580
Look, I know you have
a soft spot for broken things.

246
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,200
- I don't think so.
- Yes, you do.

247
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,250
But Loki is an evil, lying scourge.

248
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,790
That is the part he plays
on the Sacred Timeline.

249
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,410
Maybe he wants to mix it up.

250
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,620
Sometimes you get tired
of playing the same part.

251
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,830
Is that possible? He can change?

252
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,910
Not unless the Time-Keepers decree it.

253
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
And then, it shall be so.

That one looks...

259
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,160
The Time-Keepers are monitoring
every aspect of this case.

260
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,160
I've never seen them so involved.

261
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,370

Half the fun of being a trickster

281
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,700
is knowing everyone knows
you're a trickster, and then,

282
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,660
many of your tricks
can come from exploiting

- Okay. Just shut up!

See? There it is. Right there.

294
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,870
I believed, stupidly,

295
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,660
that insecure need for validation
would motivate you to find the killer.

296
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,540
Not 'cause you care about
the TVA mission or bein' a hero,

297
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:24,080
but because you know this Variant
is better than you and you can't take it.

Very nice.

299

What, charm your way

hustle them, and seize control of the TVA?

Okay. Why are you in there

I'll give you two options,

and you can believe
whichever one you want.

309
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,620
A, because I see a scared
little boy, shivering in the cold.

I need to tell you.

Good, 'cause I'm runnin' out of it.

Next step of your manipulation...

This is the final step.
Your last chance.

last chance require?

Work.

319
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,370
Work?

320
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,500
I need you to go over each
and every one of the Variant's case files,

321
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,370
and then, give me your... How do I put it?

Your unique Loki perspective.

323
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,160
And who knows?
Maybe there's something that we missed.

Well, you're idiots.
I suspect you probably missed a lot.

There's, like, a million of 'em.

362

Ragnarok. Are you familiar?

363
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,080
Yes. The destruction of Asgard
and most of its people. I'm sorry.

364
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,750
Yes, very sad.

365
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,160

Well, it's a little more
complicated, but, yeah.

370
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,370
Great. And then that thing
they're not supposed to do,

371
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,000
cascades into a whole range of other
things that aren't supposed to happen.

372
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,790
And so on and so forth, until eventually,
a new timeline branches. Yes?

of a predetermined outcome.

- Mmm-hmm. What are you doing?

375
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,910
...your salad is Asgard in this scenario.

376
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,540
- It's not Asgard, that's my lunch.
- It's a metaphor.

377
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,250
- Just hang in there.
- I want that salad.

378
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,120
And I could go down to Asgard

379
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,040
before Ragnarok
causes its complete destruction

380
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,790
and I could do anything I wanted.

381
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,620
I could, let's say,
push the Hulk off the Rainbow Bridge.

382
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,830
- There he goes.
- The salt's Hulk?

383
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,620
And I could also...
Set fire to the palace.

384
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,910
No, just stop.
Don't set fire to the palace.

385
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,160
Okay? I can do whatever I want to do,
and it would never matter.

386
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,620

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,500
Okay, it was a clumsy metaphor.
But you see what I mean.

399
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,500
It doesn't matter.
It could be any apocalypse.

400
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,910
It could be a tidal wave.
It could be a meteor.

401
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,160
It could be a volcano, a supernova.

402
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,160
If everything and everyone around you
is destined for imminent destruction,

403
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,200
then nothing that I say or do will matter,

404
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,410
because the timeline's not gonna branch.

'Cause it gets destroyed.

406
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:01,160
Hence, the Variant could be
hiding in the apocalypse

407
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,000
and do whatever he wants,
and we wouldn't know!

I think a TVA agent showing up
on a jet ski on the Sacred Timeline,

494
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,040
that would create a branch for sure.

495
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,290
It'd be fun, though.

496
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,870
Yeah, it'd be really fun.

497
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,580
So, why read about them?

498
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:53,000
Just helps remind me
of what we're fighting for.

499
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,790
I mean, you really believe
in all this stuff, don't you?

500
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't get hung up on,
"Believe, not believe."

501
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,200
I just accept what is.

502
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,250
- Three magic lizards...
- Time-Keepers.

503
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,540
- ...created the TVA, and everyone in it...
- Right.

504
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,750
- ...including you?
- Including me.

505
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,870
Every time I start
to admire your intelligence,

506
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,580
- you say something like that.
- Okay, who created you, Loki?

507
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,950
A Frost Giant of Jotunheim.

508
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,370
And who raised you?

509
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,660
Odin of Asgard.

510
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,000
Odin, God of the Heavens.

511
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,370
Asgard, mystical realm, beyond the stars.

512
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,950
- Frost Giants. Listen to yourself...
- It's not the same.

513
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,330
- It's completely different.
- No.

514
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,830
- It's not the same.
- It's exactly the same thing.

515
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,620
Because if you think too hard
about where any of us came from,

516
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,370
who we truly are,
it sounds kinda ridiculous.

517
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,290
Existence is chaos.

518
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,450
Nothing makes any sense,
so we try to make some sense of it.

519
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,830
And I'm just lucky that the chaos
I emerged into gave me all this...

520
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,540
- My own glorious purpose.
- <font color="#ff00ff">(SCOFFS)</font>

521
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,500
'Cause the TVA is my life.

522
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,700
And it's real because I believe it's real.

523
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,330
Fair enough. You believe it's real.

524
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,790
Yeah.

525
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,580
So everything is written.

526
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,830
Past, present, future.

527
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,700
There's no such thing as free will.

528
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,250
Well, I mean, you know,
it's an oversimplification...

529
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,830
So, in fact, in a way,

530
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:21,200
you and I here at the TVA,
we're the only ones who are actually free.

531
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,660
Where are you going with this, Loki?

532
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,200
How does it all end?

533
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,870
That's a work in progress.

534
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,910
Oh, those lazy Time-Keepers.
What are they waiting for?

535
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,200
<i>Au contraire.</i>

536
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,750
No. Because while we protect
what came before,

537
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,410
they're toiling away in their chamber,

538
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,790
untangling the epilogue
from its infinite branches.

539
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,160
Ah, I see. So, when they're finished,
what happens then?

540
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,580
So are we.

541
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,290
No more nexus events.

542
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,410
Just order.

543
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,120
And we meet in peace at the end of time.

544
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,700
Nice, right?

545
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,250
- Only order?
- Mmm-hmm.

546
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,000
No chaos? It sounds boring.

547
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,790
I'm sure it does to you.

548
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,660
You called me a scared little boy.

549
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,200
I called you a lotta things.

550
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,450
You did.

551
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,700
You're wrong, though.

552
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,250
You see, I know something children don't.

553
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,620
What's that?

554
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,580
That no one bad is ever truly bad.

555
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,160
And no one good is ever truly good.

556
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,830
Scared little boy.

557
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,950
Yes, it was quite patronizing.
I thought it was a bit too far, actually.

558
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,790
You're very clever.

559
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
I know.

560
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,830
The Variant left something
behind at an old crime scene.

561
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,870
A cathedral. A candy box.

562
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,250
An obvious anachronism.

563
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,000
I gave it to Analysis,
but they couldn't find anything real.

564
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,660
- Why does that matter?
- 'Cause now we have two variables.

565
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,830
Apocalyptic natural disasters and...

566
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,290
- Kablooie.
- <font color="#138ce9">LOKI:</font> What's that?

567
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,790
Candy. Do you have candy on Asgard?

568
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,290
Yeah. Grapes, nuts.

569
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,750
No wonder you're so bitter.

570
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,830
Okay. Kablooie was only sold
regionally on Earth from 2047 to 2051.

571
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:18,000
We need to cross-reference
that with every apocalyptic event.

572
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,160
I'm gonna give you half.

573
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,830
Have a competition, see who finds it.

574
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,410
- Sure.
- You wanna bet something?

575
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,870
- Yeah.
- Gentleman's bet.

576
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,950
Yeah, let's play for pride.
Okay. May the best man win. Go.

577
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,000
- Anything?
- Uh...

578
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,450
It's not the climate disaster of 2048.

579
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,660
Or the tsunami of 2051.

580
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,700
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

581
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,200
2050.

582
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,750
The extinction of the swallow...
Is that a thing?

583
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,750
Completely screwed up the ecosystem.

584
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,200
Krakatoa erupted in 2049 as well.

585
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,500
No Kablooie.

586
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,080
God, it's just one damn thing
after another, isn't it?

587
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,330
- Cyclone, famine, volcanoes, floods...
- Got him.

588
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,700
- That's where he is.
- <font color="#138ce9">MOBIUS:</font> Alabama, 2050.

589
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,830
You're gonna take my job
if I'm not careful.

590
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,830
You want me to approve deployment
of a fully-armed task force to...

591
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,950
- Yeah.
- ...the Variant's potential hiding spot?

592
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,830
Haven Hills, Alabama,
corporate town

593
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,200
owned by Roxxcart until
it's wiped out by a hurricane.

594
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,790
All the food and supplies you need.

595
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,450
If he likes it, there's no reason

596
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,330
he can't keep going back
and just camping out, over and over.

597
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,620
And this is all based
on a theory from the Variant

598
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,660
- who just blew your previous mission?
- Yeah, he's doing great.

599
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,410
Mobius, as your friend,

600
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,620
I have to tell you that trusting
this man is not a good idea.

601
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,620
No. I know.
But maybe he's worth the trouble.

602
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,660
He just uncovered
a huge hole in our security.

603
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,290
That's what concerns me!

604
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,120
I can handle him. Trust me.

605
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,750
This is where we get our guy.

606
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,410
You, I trust, but him.

607
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Listen, Ravonna,
every instinct is telling me

608
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,410
this is where we nail the Variant.

609
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,330
Come on. You don't see me
usually this worked up, right?

610
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm excited.

611
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,080
I'm chomping at the bit.

612
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,540
- Okay.
- Yes. Okay.

613
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,830
- But, Mobius?
- Yeah?

614
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,410
There's not much I can do
if it doesn't work out.

615
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,870
For all time.

616
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,410
Always.

617
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,580
Okay.

618
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,830
We're on.

619
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,450
We are doing some good work today.

620
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,660
I thought so too.

621
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,330
I'm tellin' you.
You actually help us catch this Variant,

622
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,950
and who knows, my friend.

623
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,750
What, good enough for a face-to-face
with the Time-Keepers?

624
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,830
I didn't say that.

625
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,330
- One step at a time.
- All right. One step at a time.

626
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,580
- Just in case.
- Yeah, don't those feel...

627
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,200
Absolutely not.

628
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,660
Gather around for a briefing.

629
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,750
Roxxcart is a vast superstore
common to the era.

630
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,330
It consists of a series
of sprawling sections,

631
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,580
including a large warehouse.

632
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,830
This warehouse is being used by civilians
as a shelter tryin' to ride out the storm.

633
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,750
Remember, this is a class ten apocalypse.

634
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,830
While the Variant
shouldn't know we're coming,

635
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,830
he could be hiding anywhere
and should be considered hostile.

636
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,410
So stay alert.

637
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,620
Every time there is an attack,
the Variant steals a reset charge.

638
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,120
He's planning something.

639
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,540
We just don't know what.

640
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,000
So keep an eye out
for the missing charges,

641
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,660
and if you see a Loki, prune it.

642
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
The bad Loki, preferably.

That was me using magic to dry my clothes.

- Remember the Time Theater?
- Mobius...

- I want him with me.
- You are welcome to go back
