that tactical advantage to kill me

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,708
Worried, are you?

532
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:43,875
I just need to know if I can trust you.

533
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:49,375
Okay, fine.

534
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,500
You want to know how enchantment works.

535
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:57,291
I have to make physical contact
and then grab hold of their mind.

536
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,291
How?

537
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,791
It depends on the mind.

538
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:03,916
Most are easy
and I can overtake them instantly.

539
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,541
Others, the stronger ones, it gets tricky.

540
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,500
I'm in control, but they're there, too.

541
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,416
In order to preserve the connection,

542
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,250
I have to create a fantasy
from their memories.

543
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,583
And you call me a magician.

544
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,875
That young soldier from the TVA,
her mind was messed up.

545
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,500
Everything clouded.

546
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,333
I had to pull a memory
from hundreds of years prior,

547
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,541
before she even fought for them.

548
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:34,041
What? What'd you just say?

549
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,583
Before she joined the TVA?

550
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,625
Yeah. She was just
a regular person on Earth.

551
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,875
A regular person?
