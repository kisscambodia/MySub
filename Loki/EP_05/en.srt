but blades are worthless
in the face of a Loki sorcery.

197

200

Away from Thor, away from everything.

204
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,495
Thought about the universe
and my place in it,

205
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,293
and it occurred to me
that everywhere I went,

206
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,875
only pain followed.

207
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,496
So I removed myself from the equation,

208
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:53,753
landed on a remote planet
and stayed there in isolation, in solitude

209
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,750
for a long, long time.

213
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,785
To tell you the truth,
I missed my brother,

214
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,625
and I wondered if he missed me,
if anybody else did.

215
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,828
But as soon as I took
my first steps to getting off the planet,

216
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,376
the TVA arrived.

217
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,083
Because we, my friends,
have but one part to play,

218
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,213

219
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,041
Nothing more.

221
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,035
-I'm going.
-Going where?

222
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,920
Out of this place,
out of The Void, back to the TVA.

223
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,210
We're as good at escaping
as we are at surviving.

224
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,001
That gives me a decent chance.

-Well, so be it.

-You're different.

-No, I'm not, you see?

I'm the same, really.
I'm the same as all of you.

she's trying to take it down.

00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,421
(PANTING) Okay.

343
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,166
Maybe we, uh...

344
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,418
think a bit more about this, huh?

345
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,876
Car.

346
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,128
-What?
-Along the horizon.

347
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,208
LOKI: Is that bad?

348
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,831
KID LOKI: Well, usually means
cannibalistic marauders

349
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,416
or cannibalistic pirates.

350
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,750
Delightful.

351
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,131
Now they're slowing down.

352
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,291
-What are they doing?
-Just stay on guard.

353
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Sylvie.

354
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,041
I don't understand.
Is he a coward or was he being brave?

355
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,125
-I'm not too sure.
-Come on.

356
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,166
You're alive.

357
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,920
What happened? You okay?

358
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,333
Mobius!

359
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:19,461
-How did you...
-We thought you could do with some backup.

360
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,415
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait,
these are my friends.

361
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,580
Well, they're, um... How best to put this?

362
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,285
Us as a child, us in the future,

363
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:36,995
and us as an alligator.

364
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,498
It's best not to question it.

365
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,633
You throw a rock out here, you hit a Loki.

366
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,828
So you're all after
the giant cloud monster, too, then?

367
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,786
Well, we haven't decided
how we're going to kill it, but...

368
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,665
-Come again? Kill it?
-Yes, we're gonna kill Alioth.

369
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,380
Oh, my God. That was your plan.

370
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,208
-Yeah.
-And you went along with it?

371
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,001
-KID LOKI: I had my doubts.
-Probably unsafe.

372
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,423
All right, well, what's your plan, then?

373
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,630
I think the person we're after
is beyond The Void at the end of time.

374
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,708
And if they are,

375
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:08,131
that thing is just their guard dog
protecting the only way in.

376
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:11,378
Okay, so, um, how do we get past
the guard dog?

377
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:12,458
I'm gonna enchant it.

378
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,628
(LAUGHING)

379
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,208
-That's insane, right?
-As insane as what?

380
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,081
-Paper-cutting a cloud to death?
-Listen,

381
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,576
-I've been down here longer than you...
-I'm going to enchant it.

382
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,833
She's pretty confident.

383
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,456
Leave us.

384
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,668
Why am I locked in here?

385
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,955
You freed the Variant.

386
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:17,881
-You were disloyal to the TVA.
-Disloyal?

387
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:21,288
-Did you think you'd escape punishment?
-Disloyal to who?

388
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,751
You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers.
They weren't real.

389
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,423
And why does that change anything?

390
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,000
That changes everything!

391
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,331
The people need to know the truth.

392
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,326
No, the TVA needs stability.

393
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:36,206
And until we figure out what's going on,
that is what it will get.

394
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:41,503
So you need to tell me everything.

395
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,125
What exactly do you want from me?

396
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,166
You had a link with the Variant.

397
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,001
I want you to tell me what drives her.

398
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,793
Revenge drives her.

399
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,286
Killing the Time-Keepers.

400
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:00,633
But they turned out to be fake,
in case you forgot.

401
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,995
So she'll be searching
for whomever created them.

(SCOFFS)

403
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,785
This isn't about protecting
the TVA at all, is it?

404
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:23,165
You just want to find
whoever is behind all of this, too.

405
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,210
(CHUCKLES)

406
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,245
You'll never find them.

407
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,213
Not before she does.

408
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,291
And why is that?

409
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,381
You only want it.

410
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,173
She needs it.

Hey, y'all.

413
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,326
I need all the files
on the founding of the TVA.

414
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,286
Everything from the beginning of time.

415
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,075
Well, that's a mighty tall order.

416
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,876
Whoever created this place is in danger.

417
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,078
I need to find them.

418
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,673
Okay. Right away, ma'am.

CLASSIC LOKI:
You really don't remember him?

420

MOBIUS: I mean,
the TVA arrested a lot of Lokis,

421
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:28,381
but, no, I don't remember an alligator.

422
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:31,038
I mean, who's to say
he's even a Loki Variant?

423
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,501
He is green, isn't he?

424
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,043
I don't know, he could be lying.

425
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:39,495
The long con. Of course, that just
makes him more likely to be a Loki.

with you guys, which I respect.

428
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,785
assuming you do get back to the TVA,

429
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,035
what exactly are you
getting yourself into?

430
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,670
I don't know.

431
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,915
I'd like to let people know the truth.

432
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,250
So just like that,
you're turning on the very thing

you devoted your life to.

434
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,333
Well, it's never too late to change.

435
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,166
I hope they know what they're doing.

436

Mobius isn't so bad.

437
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,750
Or so good.

438
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,210

He cares about you.

440
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,133
-It's cold.
-Mmm-hmm.

441
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,543
I could conjure one for you, if you like.

442
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:59,171
You could conjure me a new outfit.

443
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,670
You have no idea how uncomfortable
something like this is.

444
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:11,666
So...

445
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:17,131
Mobius and his theory about...

446
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,288
Right, right. About our nexus event.

447
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,035
-Total rubbish, right?
-Absolutely. Of course. I mean...

448

I don't mean that it wasn't a nice moment.

No, it was great. It was really nice.

450
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,463
It just sounds like another TVA lie.

451
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:32,581
A hundred percent.
I mean, totally. Yeah.

452
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,043
I don't know how to do this.

Well...

00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,538
there are more important things, right?

459
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,380
Right? Yeah.
Like bringing down the TVA.

close enough to it, I can enchant it,
