Take them away!

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,360
Yes.

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,040
Start walking!

18
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,320
Get up! Now!

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,880
Get up!

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,040
Keep walking!

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,040
No!

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,120
Keep walking.

23
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,680
No!

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,600
Keep moving.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,160
Move.

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,720
Where is the Military Advisor?

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,880
Where is the Military Advisor?

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,080
He's...

29
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,240
- Where is the Military Advisor?
-  He's...

30
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,160
at the Yuzhen Hall.

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,240
He's long gone.

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Tell me.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,480
Where is he now?

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,120
I don't know

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,160
where he is now.

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,400
All I know is that

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,760
he wants to marry

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,400
Princess Misha to His Majesty.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,920
Other than that,

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
I know nothing.

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,560
Princess Liu Misha, isn't it?

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
So, you want to be our next Empress.

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,560
Report!

44
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,680
The three Princes and the six Pieces

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,400
are in Donglin.

46
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,320
I invite you to a game

47
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,840
at Sunny Rain Pavilion.

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
By the Morning Dew Stranger.

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,720
This is interesting.

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,600
Tell me,

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
did your Military Advisor

52
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,240
join the forces of Zhenwu
eight years ago?

53
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,120
Yes.

54
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,320
He came to us eight years ago.

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,240
Great.

56
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,680
It seems like Zheng Wu
wasn't the only remnant

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,080
from the Morning Dew Rebellion.

58
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,840
Sir, are you going?

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,160
He's no one.

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,280
He's not worth my time.

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,040
It doesn't matter
if the others go there.

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,000
But Yanzhi...

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,440
If she fails

64
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,800
to break free from this predicament,

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,320
she is not worthy

66
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,240
of becoming our Chess Overseer.

67
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,560
No.

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,120
You must stop His Majesty.

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,400
Why?

70
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,200
Maybe it would work.

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
But what about the future?

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,320
Qiu Ziliang is a bloodthirsty hyena.

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,160
But Zheng Lu and Li Xu

74
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,760
are far from being virtuous.

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,600
Don't forget,

76
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,960
They got rid of three Chancellors.

77
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,280
That created a power vacancy,

78
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,120
sending the Imperial Court
into disarray.

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,600
If the Morning Dew rebellion
comes to fruition,

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,720
who do you think will control the army

81
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,760
after Qiu Ziliang's death?

82
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,560
Qiu Ziliang is an eunuch.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,400
He got his power from the Emperor.

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,480
Zheng Lu and Li Xu's greed

85
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,840
wants more than just power.

86
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,600
If their rebellion is successful,

87
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,360
His Majesty will definitely

88
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,080
become those villains' puppet.

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,520
If they fail,

90
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,200
Qiu Ziliang will want

91
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
his payback.

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,040
It's a time of turmoils.

93
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,120
We can't stay our hands out of this.

94
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,080
Master,

95
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,920
I'll head for the palace
and stop my brother.

96
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,000
Go!

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,240
Prince Yi.

98
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,560
It's late into the night.

99
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,880
Where are you going?

100
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,680
Grand Empress Dowager's birthday
is around the corner.

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,440
I wish to discuss the celebration

102
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,920
with my brother.

103
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
His Majesty is asleep.

104
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,800
I could

105
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,520
pass the message for you.

106
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
I'll tell His Majesty.

107
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
It's not very urgent.

108
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,960
I'll tell him when I meet him.

109
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,360
Wait.

110
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,480
Prince Yi.

111
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,280
The Grand Empress Dowager
loves a good play.

112
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,320
Let's put up a play.

113
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
Wouldn't that be a sound plan?

114
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,840
Sure.

115
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,200
No.

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,320
The plan was leaked.

117
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920
I bet Qiu Ziliang

118
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
has started suspecting.

119
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,920
But who leaked it?

120
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,880
We have no time

121
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,520
to find out who leaked it.

122
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
We must prevent the situation
from getting worse.

123
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,280
But I'm afraid it's already too late.

124
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,080
Master,

125
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,560
you could tell me anything.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
The only person who can save His Majesty

127
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,480
and the nation of Daxing

128
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,520
is you.

129
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,080
Your path ahead

130
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,320
is that of a sinner's.

131
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,200
(No one will understand your reasons.)

132
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,880
(Everyone will loathe you.)

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,520
Even those closest to you

134
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,320
will look at you with disappointment.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
(However,)

136
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,400
(you have been bestowed
with a great responsibility.)

137
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,200
(Without experiencing)

138
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,480
(the immense pain,)

139
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,320
(you will never reach your goal.)

140
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,520
Sir.

141
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,720
Wang Yang got away.

142
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,280
I'll get him.

143
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,320
(Your path ahead)

144
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,800
(is that of a sinner's.)

145
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,600
(Without experiencing)

146
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,840
(the immense pain,)

147
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,600
(you will never reach your goal.)

148
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,799
(The part behind the heart,)

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,679
(is protected by the rib cage
and the spine.)

150
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,080
(Aim at that point.)

151
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,320
(With enough projectile speed)

152
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,560
(and the right force, the arrow)

153
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,760
(will be stuck between the bones.)

154
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,280
(The person might survive the wound.)

155
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,880
Master.

156
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,880
Master.

157
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,440
Your Majesty.

158
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,440
What's the matter?

159
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,040
Was it a nightmare?

160
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,040
Yu'er.

161
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,840
You once told me

162
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,120
that my past...

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,480
has brought me great suffering.

164
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,320
So I should move on.

165
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,360
Even though Han Yue

166
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,960
might have been wronged...

167
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,400
and that I

168
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,600
deserved the worst form of death,

169
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
would you still...

170
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,960
be by my side?

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,880
I will.

172
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,400
Do you mean it?

173
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,360
Han Yue might have been wronged,

174
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,680
but the way he exacts his revenge

175
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
was too cruel and gruesome.

176
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,040
It was unspeakable.

177
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,360
Your Majesty had done terrible things,

178
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,080
but Your Majesty regret it

179
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,480
is now trying to make amends.

180
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,080
So...

181
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,040
when I told you

182
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,000
to have a different life,

183
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,360
I'd be there for you.

184
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,360
Cheng Ruoyu.

185
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,480
I'll hold you

186
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
to your words.

187
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,680
Yu'er.

188
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,200
What's wrong?

189
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:02,880
Yu'er.

190
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
I'm fine.

191
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,480
I'm only a little hungry.

192
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,600
You're hungry.

193
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
Then you should sleep.

194
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,480
Close your eyes.

195
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,240
Come.

196
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,640
Imagine...

197
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,120
Imagine

198
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,920
we were at the West Market

199
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,040
for the osmanthus cake.

200
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,880
They just came out of the oven.

201
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,600
The topping...

202
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,720
is a layer of fudge.

203
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,720
The osmanthus petals

204
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,520
are sprinkled on the fudge.

205
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,560
The whole West Market

206
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,080
is full of osmanthus petals' fragrances.

207
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,640
I'd buy you

208
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,760
your favorite

209
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,440
braised trotters.

210
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,320
It's juicy but not too greasy.

211
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,520
Just one bite

212
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,120
will cover your mouth in grease.

213
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,440
By the way,

214
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,880
I'd buy you

215
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,360
your favorite wontons.

216
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,840
You got the big wontons.

217
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,440
You could have

218
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,400
as many as you like.

219
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,280
Okay?

220
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,000
Your Majesty.

221
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm starving.

222
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,080
Do you have an escape plan?

223
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,640
Does it matter

224
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,400
if I have one?

225
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,000
If you have a plan,

226
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,560
you must leave this place.

227
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,600
We'll stall Han Yue for you.

228
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,400
Get us backup.

229
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,760
If you don't have a plan,

230
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,320
I hope

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,120
you could lend us a hand in ending this.

232
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,760
Your Highness.

233
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,640
Is there a way

234
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,960
to get out of here?

235
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,680
On the way here,

236
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
I left some markings.

237
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,320
I believe Yuan Du

238
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,760
will be here very soon.

239
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,520
But the catch is that

240
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,040
even if we leave this place,

241
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,640
Lucong and Zhenwu

242
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,880
are already caught up in this.

243
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,160
The slightest conflict

244
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,000
will result in disorder
in the prefectures.

245
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,080
So what do we do now?

246
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,960
Yu'er.

247
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,640
Leave with Yuan Do when he's arrived.

248
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,800
Send the letters to Lucong and Zhenwu.

249
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,920
Tell them the whole story.

250
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,760
Yanzhi.

251
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,840
You know the layout

252
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,760
of the contraptions.

253
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,440
We need you to stall Han Yue.

254
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,640
Your Majesty.

255
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,880
It's time to recall Li Deyun.

256
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,000
Li Deyun?

257
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,360
Who's that?

258
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,160
Qiu Ziliang was very wary of him.

259
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,040
I doubt he would let Li Deyun
step into the city.

260
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,160
Now is the chance of a lifetime.

261
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,960
While Qiu Ziliang and Han Yue
are too busy with the power struggle,

262
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,280
Li Deyun could solve the conflicts

263
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,640
that involves the Imperial Court,

264
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,120
Lucong and Zhenwu

265
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,960
at the moment.

266
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,360
The assassin from Lucong

267
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,480
tried to take out
His Majesty and Princess Misha.

268
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
The Military Advisor of Zhenwu
imprisoned His Majesty.

269
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,000
But Princess Misha
wants to marry His Majesty.

270
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,520
This is a three-way conflict.

271
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
We need

272
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,520
a capable mediator.

273
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,760
Indeed.

274
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,920
Qiu Ziliang can't handle
the official operations

275
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,320
of the Imperial Court.

276
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,960
As the one who triggered this conflict,

277
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,840
he can't show himself in public.

278
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,240
Li Deyun was born into a noble family.

279
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,720
He was reputable.

280
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,960
The prefectures' officials knew him.

281
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,920
He is the best man we have
for a mediator.

282
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,720
How so?

283
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,600
Through marriage.

284
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,760
I will never marry her.

285
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,560
We could marry off a princess

286
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,640
to Zhenwu.

287
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
This crisis might also be

288
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,600
a great opportunity.

289
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,000
If we could resolve it properly,

290
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,600
this could be our chance

291
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,960
to reclaim control over the army.

292
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,800
A bunch of fools!

293
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,480
Before Qiu Ziliang is dead,

294
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,960
no one will leave this building.

295
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,600
This is not the end.

296
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,200
Do you have any plans?

297
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,840
I'm waiting for my father to
come to my rescue.

298
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,880
(As I expected.)

299
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,640
(Li Deyun is now caught up in this.)

300
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,359
Sir.

301
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,280
Open it.

302
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,440
Sir.

303
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,080
Imprison the Princess
in solitary confinement.

304
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,520
We can deal with her later.

305
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,920
As for...

306
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,120
Yes.

307
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,160
What do you want?

308
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,760
Where are you taking him?

309
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,880
- Princess!
- Sun Lie!

310
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,840
- Princess!
- Sun Lie!

311
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,520
- Princess!
- Sun Lie!

312
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,040
Don't you dare forget this.

313
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,440
As long as I live,

314
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,440
I will have my revenge on you!

315
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,800
Sir.

316
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,680
She is a loose end.

317
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,880
Sir, are you planning

318
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,840
to seize control of Zhenwu's
80,000 soldiers?

319
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,880
Right Minister, a nice suggestion.

320
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,680
With the Shencai Army
of 120,000 men strong,

321
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,560
we'll have enough leverage

322
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,040
to negotiate with those rebellious

323
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
military commissioners.

324
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,160
You have the power over thousands.

325
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
Why bother threatening the princes?

326
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,000
No one would give up on
having greater power.

327
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
With those people waiting
to strike us down,

328
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,200
this game

329
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,080
will be even more intriguing.

330
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,720
Master.

331
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,480
Qiu Ziliang

332
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
never went to the Sunny Rain Pavilion.

333
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,400
Ruoqing was right.

334
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,520
We must resort

335
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,640
to our second plan.

336
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,760
A second plan?

337
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,120
What is it?

338
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,720
General Han, you want

339
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,360
the Zhenwu Army so you could

340
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,960
go against Qiu Ziliang.

341
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,000
After the Morning Dew Rebellion failed

342
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,840
because Qiu Ziliang was on high alert

343
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,560
and we lack the military might.

344
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,480
I took advantage of Ninghe's return
to Heng'an

345
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,960
to involve Zhenwu in my plot.

346
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,240
What I seek

347
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,960
are the 80,000 elite soldiers they have

348
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,320
to keep the Shencai Army in check.

349
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,000
Then you used the three Princess
and six Pieces

350
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,280
to lure him into meeting you alone.

351
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,320
Yes.

352
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,280
But I never expected

353
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,320
that the Chess Overseer

354
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,560
would be you.

355
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,280
General Han,

356
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,520
you don't know Qiu Ziliang well enough.

357
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,240
All of us are merely pawns

358
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,280
for his bidding.

359
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,400
And he can replace any pawns
he deems useless.

360
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,920
What do you propose?

361
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
We could learn from
the Morning Dew Rebellion.

362
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,320
Qiu Ziliang knew

363
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,840
Zheng Lu and the rebels

364
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,560
were waiting in the Left Barrack.

365
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,600
But they went in anyway.

366
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,760
Why?

367
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,800
Because he was furious.

368
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,200
He was furious over
the Late Emperor's betrayal.

369
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,040
So he insisted on killing

370
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,800
those who once humiliated him

371
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,800
to prove

372
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,560
the Late Emperor had made
a grave mistake.

373
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,080
You mean...

374
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,320
Tell him my real identity.

375
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,240
I want him to know

376
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,120
the girl he raised with care

377
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,840
was actually Wang Yang's granddaughter.

378
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
I want him to know

379
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,080
I've been planning my revenge on him
all this time.

380
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,280
What Qiu Ziliang hates the most

381
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,280
is contempt and betrayal.

382
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,280
So he will surely punish me

383
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,040
with his own hands.

384
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,800
The plan is too risky.

385
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,160
To rebuild Daxing,

386
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,920
this is a small price to pay.

387
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,200
It's been eight years.

388
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,000
I had been fighting this battle alone

389
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,680
before I met you, General Han.

390
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,480
It's Heaven's will
that we rebuild this nation.

391
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Tell Qiu Ziliang

392
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,720
Qiu Yanzhi's real identity

393
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,000
is Wang Ruoqing.

394
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,280
Yes.

395
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,360
Consider it done.

396
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,320
Wait.

397
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,640
Leave it to the Left Knight.

398
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,280
A sound plan.

399
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,040
Qiu Ziliang doesn't know

400
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,960
the Left Knight is our man.

401
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,680
No.

402
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,880
I want to find out whether

403
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,240
he would obey this order.

404
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
So your plan is...

405
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,880
He spent eight years in
the Chess of Generals Camp.

406
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,280
Power has blinded his heart and soul.

407
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,040
Had he not lost

408
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,520
to Qiu Yanzhi while competing

409
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,880
for the title of Chess Overseer,

410
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,240
he would have betrayed me.

411
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,040
It can't be.

412
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,200
I hope so.

413
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,760
But we shall find out

414
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,000
very soon.

415
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,560
Master.

416
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,240
Qiu Ziliang doesn't know

417
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,400
Yanzhi's real identity.

418
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
If he knew,

419
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,280
he wouldn't let Wang Ruoqing

420
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,080
live to this day

421
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,000
and to let her

422
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,760
live as his own daughter.

423
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,160
Who's there?

424
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,920
Yu'er.

425
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,040
Yu'er.

426
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,640
Have some food.

427
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,720
Yu'er.

428
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Your Majesty.

429
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,880
Your hand is so cold.

430
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,120
Your Majesty.

431
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm fine.

432
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,040
I only need a nap.

433
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,160
Come, Yu'er.

434
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,400
Save the nap for later.

435
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,920
Come closer.

436
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,800
Every time I had a fever,

437
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,920
my mother do it for me.

438
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,360
Uncle.

439
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,000
Yu'er is burning up.

440
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,040
Her breathing is getting slower.

441
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,600
Your Majesty.

442
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,320
Yu'er is...

443
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,160
Prince Guang.

444
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,240
I'm fine.

445
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,520
Let me sleep for a little while.

446
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,520
- Just a little while.
- Yu'er.

447
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,520
Be honest.

448
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,800
Your injury got worse.

449
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,840
You need medical attention.

450
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,720
Uncle.

451
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,400
What is going on?

452
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,840
Yu'er has been lying

453
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,880
so you wouldn't be worried.

454
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,760
Han Yue

455
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,640
hit her back during the fight.

456
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,560
Her heart meridian is damaged.

457
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,760
She needs immediate treatment,

458
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,360
or she might lose her life.

459
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,840
Guards.

460
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,720
Guards!

461
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,600
Your Majesty.

462
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,440
Guards!

463
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,800
Guards!

464
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
What is it?

465
00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:05,240
Yu'er needs medical attention.

466
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,760
Medical attention.

467
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,840
No.

468
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,520
Why not?

469
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,480
- Yu'er.
- With that injury,

470
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,920
you're not fit to be in charge
of the Yuzhen Hall.

471
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,320
I can't believe

472
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,520
you actually hate me so deeply.

473
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,600
Indeed.

474
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,120
You are just the same as Cheng Xi.

475
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,880
You can't tell right from wrong,

476
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,840
and served the evildoers.

477
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,320
You pledged your loyalty
to this puppet ruler.

478
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,720
Do you have any idea
how many innocent lives

479
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,120
he helped killed for Qiu Ziliang

480
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,560
during the morning dew rebellion?

481
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,400
But fortunately,

482
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,920
I'll take you

483
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,640
to my master.

484
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,320
You may ask him

485
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,120
if he has a way to save
your precious bodyguard.

486
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,760
Come with me.

487
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,120
No.

488
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,200
Yu'er.

489
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,160
Wait here.

490
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,200
I'll get you the medicine.

491
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,960
Don't go.

492
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
It's too risky.

493
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,360
It's too risky.

494
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,880
I don't need the medicine.

495
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,240
Fear not.

496
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,240
They won't take my life.

497
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,320
Don't go.

498
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,600
Yu'er.

499
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,040
Yu'er!

500
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,800
A beautiful bow.

501
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,640
During the Late Emperor's coronation,

502
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,600
he held a banquet at the Hanyuan Hall.

503
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,760
He gave you this now.

504
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,680
Its name

505
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,040
is Sanchun.

506
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,280
Prior to the Late Emperor's passing,

507
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,280
he gave up on luxuries,

508
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,840
he never neglected his duty.

509
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,880
He hoped to be a wise ruler.

510
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,080
But fate had other plans for him.

511
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,160
First,

512
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,920
Qiu Ziliang, the officer
he trusted the most, betrayed him.

513
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,920
Then, the bother he loved the most
stabbed him in the back.

514
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,480
He died with a grudge in his heart.

515
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,880
His dream of

516
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,680
"Gradual approach into Summer,

517
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,040
and rise in the Springtime"

518
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,800
had never come to fruition.

519
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,000
Before his passing,

520
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,440
he gave me a posthumous edict.

521
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,440
He ordered me to
send it to Official Wang.

522
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,960
He wanted Prince Guang
to have the throne.

523
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,600
But due to a battle,

524
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,440
the edict was lost.

525
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,000
You treacherous fool

526
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,880
who served that tyrant

527
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,800
took advantage of the opportunity.

528
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,800
Now,

529
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,240
write another edict.

530
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,520
Return the power you seized

531
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,680
via those despicable means

532
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,880
back to Prince Guang.

533
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,680
Don't have a conscience?

534
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,640
Noble Consort Wei died young,

535
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,520
Empress Xiao

536
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,000
took you in and raised you
as her own son!

537
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,200
The Late Emperor gave you
shelter and food,

538
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,400
he shared everything with you!

539
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,440
In the end,

540
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,280
you stabbed him in his back!

541
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,200
You worthless scoundrel!

542
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,600
You're a disgrace to the Qi family!

543
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,440
I'll say this again.

544
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,760
Are you writing the edict

545
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,040
or not?

546
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,560
Only in your dreams.

547
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,200
Only in my dreams?

548
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
Write it,

549
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,400
or I'll kill Cheng Ruoyu now!

550
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,160
You said so yourself.

551
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,040
I had the resolve to take

552
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,120
my brother's life.

553
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,600
She is but a mere woman

554
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,040
who means nothing to me.

555
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,240
Kill her if you want.

556
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,880
You can have the edict

557
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,400
over my dead body.

558
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,120
You...

559
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,840
A kind reminder for you.

560
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,320
It took Prince Guang

561
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,360
a tremendous amount of effort

562
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,800
to save Cheng Ruoyu from dying.

563
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,880
If you wanted to humiliate me,

564
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,320
make sure you know

565
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,920
what your future Emperor

566
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,520
would think of you.

567
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,120
However,

568
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,880
don't bother killing her

569
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,000
with your own hands.

570
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,800
Cheng Ruoyu suffered

571
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,400
great injury from her fight against you.

572
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,080
Without the medicine,

573
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,160
she will surely die.

574
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,800
What do you think

575
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,840
my uncle will think of you?

576
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,720
Get him out of my sight.

577
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,880
Yes.

578
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,480
Your Majesty.

579
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,160
Look closer.

580
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,960
Is it really her?

581
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,920
She looks like her.

582
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,040
The similarity is remarkable.

583
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,520
Are you sure?

584
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,280
Is she really Wang Ruoqing?

585
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,080
I'm not sure if she was Ms. Wang,

586
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,080
but she looks exactly the same

587
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,880
as Madam Wang in her younger days.

588
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,920
There is no doubt about it now.

589
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,400
The Feimang Arrows

590
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,160
are as agile as the Feifu Arrows.

591
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,040
But they have more range.

592
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,320
The Trident Arrows deal
the greatest damage,

593
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,000
but it requires a heavier draw weight.

594
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,280
Miss.

595
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,600
Madam Cheng wishes to see you.

596
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,560
Madam Cheng?

597
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,160
It's so cold.

598
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,840
Do not fall asleep.

599
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Do not fall asleep.

600
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,680
Yu'er.

601
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,160
Hang in there.

602
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Do not fall asleep.

603
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,880
Yes.

604
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,440
His Majesty is hurt!

605
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,720
Your Majesty.

606
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,360
How did you get injured?

607
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,040
Your Majesty.

608
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,040
How did it go?

609
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,679
How is Yu'er?

610
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,440
You're hurt.

611
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,159
Sorry.

612
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,719
I'm fine.

613
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,120
It's just a scratch.

614
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,040
Don't apologize.

615
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,600
I'm fine.

616
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,400
Yu'er.

617
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,920
I'm sorry for this.

618
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,080
Don't feel sorry.

619
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,120
Your Majesty.

620
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,720
Everyone is destined to die.

621
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,040
I shall have no regret.

622
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,400
However,

623
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,000
Your Majesty was in danger
because of me,

624
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,960
yet I have no way to get us out.

625
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,800
I'm worried.

626
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,800
I have only been the Sword Bearer

627
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,880
for a short amount of time.

628
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,040
But Your Majesty had
chased me away so many times.

629
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,080
It's strong, though.

630
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,280
I used to

631
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,200
long for a life outside the palace.

632
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,240
But then,

633
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,480
I couldn't stop thinking
about coming back

634
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,880
to your side.

635
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,960
Although...

636
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,440
people have said

637
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,000
you were a villain,

638
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,000
but I know for certain

639
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,320
you're a good person.

640
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,800
In the past,

641
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,560
I always watched behind you.

642
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,440
You were so lonely.

643
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,320
I wished I could walk over there
and tell you...

644
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,720
that I'd be there for you.

645
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,160
I don't care

646
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,320
which side of you the people see,

647
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,840
in my heart,

648
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
you're the best.

649
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,280
In the past,

650
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,320
you frowned a lot.

651
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,520
I wish I could

652
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,160
flatten the frowns for you.

653
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,080
And now,

654
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,560
I finally did it.

655
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,200
This is the brooch you wanted

656
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,200
when we were at the West Market

657
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,880
for biángbiáng noodles.

658
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,320
It's beautiful.

659
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,640
I carry it with me everywhere.

660
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,200
I wanted to give it to you.

661
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,880
Yu'er.

662
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,080
When we walked on the streets

663
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,960
and enjoyed the food,

664
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,600
it was the happiest time

665
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,960
of my entire life.

666
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,640
You don't belong in the palace.

667
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,280
I want you to be free.

668
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,160
I need you to witness

669
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
the marvelous mountains
and rivers for me.

670
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,360
Enjoy all the delicacies in this world.

671
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,920
Be a happy person.

672
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,240
Your Majesty!

673
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,320
Your Majesty!

674
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,960
Your Majesty!

675
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,480
Yu'er.

676
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,720
Live on.

677
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,720
No!

678
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,120
Help!

679
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,960
It's been years,

680
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,600
but your beauty never changes.

681
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,200
Ms. Li, your beauty can
easily outshine me.

682
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,400
You look better than ever.

683
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,880
Compliments lift the spirit.

684
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,720
But you have come here

685
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,920
for urgent matters.

686
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
Indeed.

687
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,760
Is His Majesty in trouble?

688
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,040
You knew?

689
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,800
His Majesty is in trouble?

690
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,520
His Majesty

691
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,920
was captured by the Military Advisor
of Zhenwu.

692
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,920
My father has a silk pouch.

693
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:52,121
He said I could open it

694
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,160
if the Capital needs aid.

695
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,400
I'll go get it.

696
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,160
Madam.

697
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
How is your niece

698
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,000
Cheng Ruoyu lately?

699
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,480
Qi Yan.

700
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,400
You are out of your mind.

701
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,680
If I die now,

702
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,960
Qiu Ziliang will immediately

703
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,360
put Prince An on the throne.

704
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,400
I captured him a long time ago.

705
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,200
Is that so?

706
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,040
He's not my only younger brother.

707
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,880
Anyone of them will do just fine.

708
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,560
Do you want to save my life?

709
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,360
Let Prince Guang treat him.

710
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,560
Bring him here.

711
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,400
Wait.

712
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,640
If you want me to live,

713
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,280
then release her.

714
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,640
I'm not going anywhere.

715
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,920
I want to be with you.

716
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,680
I'm not going anywhere.

717
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,400
No deal.

718
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,280
Then you shall bear witness

719
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,440
as my other younger brother

720
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,840
rises to the throne.

721
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,120
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

722
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,200
Your Majesty!

723
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,360
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

724
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,320
Your Majesty!

725
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,680
If you want me to live,

726
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,120
then follow my instructions.

727
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,520
Do what he said.

728
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:30,840
Yes.

729
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,840
I'm not leaving you.

730
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,720
I'm not leaving you.

731
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,240
I'm not leaving you.

732
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,720
Your Majesty!

733
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,520
Let go of me!

734
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,240
I'm not leaving you.

735
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,280
Your Majesty!

736
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,960
Your Majesty!

737
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,400
Your Majesty!
