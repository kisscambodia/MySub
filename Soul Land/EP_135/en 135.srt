Its skill, Bloodthirst,

76
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,690
allows me to enter
the Berserker state immediately.

But in the Berserker state,

81
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,790
you will lose your consciousness.

87
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,730

in the Berserker state.

122
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,330
Why are you apologizing?

123
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,160
This isn't your fault at all.

124
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,860
It's all because I'm too weak

125
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,190

Even though it doesn't cause me pain,

167
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,490
the four soul bones are getting warmer

168
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,590

194

They're fresh!

197
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,330
Hello there!

198
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,790
Wow, the colors of these pearls are so special!

199
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:25,730
Pink,

200
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,390

and black!

204
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,590
What is that smell?

205
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,530
It's strange.

206
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,260
This is your first time in Hanhai City, right?

207
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,490
That's the smell of the ocean.

208
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,230
The beautiful ocean

209
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,630
is to the west of Hanhai City.

210
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,790
When the wind blows,

211
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,890
you can smell the salty air.

212
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,190
May I ask

213
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,330
where the city's Soul Arena is?

214
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,990
In the center of the city.

215
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:51,690
It's very easy to find.

216
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:52,590
San.

217
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,360
You're going to compete in the Soul Arena?

218
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,490
Before we left,

219
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,090
Teacher told me

220
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,460
that the way ocean soul masters fight

221
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,060
is so different from which of normal soul masters.

222
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,690
If I can compete with some of them

223
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,660
in the Soul Arena,

224
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,960
it'll help a lot

225
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,590
when we're on the island.

226
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,330
No problem!

227
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,760
We'll take a look at the Soul Arena first tomorrow.

228
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,360
We've been traveling all this way

229
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,090
and haven't exercised in a long time.

230
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,830
Fatty.

231
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,890
You are indispensable in the fight to come.

232
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:47,630
Hurry!

233
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,430
