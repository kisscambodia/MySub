[Previous episode]

32
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,299
Do you think you could offend me

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,332
just because
you finished transforming into a dragon,?

34
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,865
I will let you live one last time

35
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:22,665
for the sake of your cultivation.

36
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,732
I hope that this time,

37
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:27,299
I won't be disappointed again.

38
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:28,465
Thank you for saving me.

39
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:29,865
I owe you my life.

40
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,132
It's done.

41
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:32,465
My soul power

42
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,265
is at level 67 now.

43
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:35,499
Your method requires soul power

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,999
but I was born with none.

45
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:37,732
What if

46
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,632
I can increase your soul power?

47
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:40,832
You...

48
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:42,232
What did you say?

00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:53,432
What did you say?

52
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:56,365
I can teach you a cultivation method

53
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,065
that might help you become a soul master.

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,032
But I can't impart it to just anyone.

55
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,065
Are you willing to take me as your teacher?

56
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:07,499
I am!

57
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:08,465
Good.

58
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:10,765
Teacher.

59
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,832
From now on,
you are a part of Tang's Clan.

60
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,132
Tang's Clan?

61
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:23,699
Here.

62
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:25,798
Eat it.

63
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:28,599
Ten Thousand Year Ginseng?

64
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:30,798
This is a priceless treasure!

65
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:32,999
It can help build your foundation.

66
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,298
This Ten Thousand Year Ginseng
we gathered from the Ice Fire Mouth Spring

67
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,732
is less valuable

68
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,399
than the Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng

69
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,865
and the Decade Millennium Grade Nine Ginseng King,

70
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,599
but it's perfect

71
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,165
for Ji Xiang.

72
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,099
Sit down.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,932
Concentrate on your core

74
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,665
and feel the soul power
I'm transferring into your body.

75
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,899
Remember where it passes through.

76
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:10,465
Teacher.

77
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:11,565
Look!

78
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:12,999
Very good.

79
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,165
You are very talented.

80
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,565
But

81
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:18,665
you must practice hard
if you want to be successful.

82
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:19,155
Yes,

83
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:20,232
I will.

84
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,232
Thank you.

85
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:23,532
Ji Xiang.

86
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,699
What kind of a person is the head
of the Purple Pearl Pirates?

87
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,432
I'm familiar with her.

88
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:30,732
She's a good person.

89
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,599
She often gives money
to the poor fishing villages.

90
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,132
Do you know who Haider is?

91
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,765
What is his relationship
with the Purple Pearl Pirates?

92
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:40,332
I do.

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,832
Back then, he brought a bunch of
soul masters to join the Purple Pearl

94
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:46,099
so he was quite arrogant to other members.

95
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,599
Really...?

96
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,199
If I want to hire them

97
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,032
to find my friends,

98
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,499
can you connect us up?

99
00:04:58,133 --> 00:04:58,265
Sure.

100
00:04:58,633 --> 00:04:59,065
No problem.

101
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,632
I'll take you over tomorrow morning.

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,165
Teacher.

103
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:13,932
There are roughly 3,000 people
in the Purple Pearl Pirates,

104
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,099
200 of which are soul masters.

105
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:18,765
The strongest is the leader, Purple Pearl.

106
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,499
She is a level 68 soul emperor.

107
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,432
She has about 40 ships,

108
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,365
and is very well known in the waters nearby.

109
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:31,365
Doctor Ji Xiang.

110
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,265
Hello, Doctor Ji Xiang.

111
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,765
Doctor Ji Xiang.

112
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,232
Let's drink tonight!

113
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,532
Okay.

114
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,299
That is where the leader lives.

115
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:51,732
Teacher,

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,165

Thank goodness, you're alright.

121
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,165
We were worried about you.

122
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,165
Where is Wu?

123
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,399
Who tied you up here?

124
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,365
Teacher!

125
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,832
Ex...excuse me.

126
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,299

Don't...don't misunderstand it!

00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,065
Die!

131
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:34,499
Who is it?

132
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,232
A woman?

133
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,832
You're brave to be making trouble

134
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,332
in the turf of Purple Pearl Pirates!

135
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:45,099
Let go of Wu,

136
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,465
or you die today.

137
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,299
I'd like to see

138
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:50,899
how you're going to kill me.

141
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:09,865
I can't let Wu get hurt.

142
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,365
I need to get rid of her quickly.

143
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,732

How did he suddenly get over here?

147
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,598
Teacher, don't kill her!

148
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,598
If you dare to attack our leader,

149
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:51,999
we will fight you to our last breath!

150
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:54,499
She hurt my friends.

151
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,199
She deserves to die!

152
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:57,932
Brother San.

153
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:02,465
Leader Pearl didn't hurt us.

154
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,399
Fatty.

155
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:08,432
What happened to them?

156
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,265
We are suffering from the Chill Poison.

157
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,199
She tied us outside

158
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,299
to use the sunlight to detoxify the poison.

159
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,499
She was trying to save us.

160
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,232
Nonsense!

161
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,299
I wasn't.

162
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,999
I just wanted to torture you!

163
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:21,832
Let's keep fighting!

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,832
I'm not scared of you!

165
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:25,932
What actually happened?

166
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,598
After we were separated,

167
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,632
we floated in the ocean for long.

168
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,299

Don't come over here!

We fought a hard fight to kill it

186
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,732
but we were all intoxicated
by its Chill Poison.

187
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,799
Even my Phoenix Flames couldn't melt it.

188
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:40,632

00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,799
Ocean Viper.

193
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,799
But even our leader
couldn't treat the poison directly.

194
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,632
We had to...

195
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:11,765
You're using the sun

196
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,799
to treat this petty Chill Poison?

197
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,132
The Ten-headed Burning Sun Serpent
is the king of all snakes

198
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:18,999
and its core is pure heat.

199
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,599
Its neidan

200
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:24,532
can heal the Ocean Viper's Chill Poison
in an instant.

201
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,332
Since it was a misunderstanding,

202
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,599
can you let our leader go now?

203
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:50,832
Since you rescued them,

204
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:52,132
I won't kill you

205
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:53,199
if you give me Wu.

206
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,699
Why should I give you Wu?

207
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,699
What is her relationship with you?

208
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,299
She is my fiance.

209
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,265
What?

210
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,432
So what if she's your fiance?

211
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,132
Judging from her state right now,

212
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,232
you definitely didn't protect her well.

213
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,532
How about this? Let's make a bet.

214
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,132
Let's fight again.

215
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,299
If you win,

216
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,665
I'll give Wu back to you.

217
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,732
If I win,

218
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,732
Wu stays with us.

219
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,132
I would never bet on Wu.

220
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:26,732
How about this?

221
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,732
I'll take a step back.

222
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,199
I'm letting you go now

223
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:30,465
and

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,365
I won't use my soul skills

225
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:33,232
while you can use whichever skill of yours.

226
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,032
If I catch you again

227
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,699
within half an hour,

228
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,165
then I win

229
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,265
and you have to recognize me
as your leader.

230
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,499
Otherwise,

231
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:43,899
you can punish me however you want.

232
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,932
How about that?

233
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:46,099
In your dreams.

234
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,465
You think you can catch me
without using soul skills?

235
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:49,432
Fine.

236
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:50,665
I'll take that bet.

237
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,332
Let's start.

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,832
Leader!

239
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:00,465
We will protect you!

240
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,532
Brothers,

241
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:02,332
good job!

242
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,732
If I win, I'll treat you all
to drinks and meat!

243
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,965
Tang's Clan 100 Hidden Weapons,

244
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,432
Heavenly Flower Rain!

245
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:25,565
Heavenly Flower Rain

246
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,932
is one of the basic hidden weapons of Tang's Clan.

247
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,465
It's not very strong

248
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:31,599
but is easy to control

249
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:33,965
and just enough to hit your numbing acupoint.

250
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,599
I don't believe I can't hide from you

251
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,732
on my own island.

252
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:51,899
Spiritual Cohesion Wisdom Skull.

253
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,532
The Blue Silver Domain
has already located you.

254
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,399
You won't be able to escape.

255
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:01,265
Soul sects?

256
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:10,365
Want to catch me?

257
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:11,965
You're too naive.

258
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:19,765
Really?

259
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:22,799
Let me see

260
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,565
where you can go now.

261
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,165
Here's the ocean.

262
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:35,499
He's a land soul master.

263
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:36,599
As long as I hide in the ocean,

264
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,132
he definitely won't find me.

265
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,565
It seems like

266
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:47,032
you caught something extra.

267
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,732
As you wish.

268
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,932
How did he know the route I planned?

269
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,265
Purple God Light!

270
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,299
You cheater!

271
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,598
I didn't say I wouldn't use soul bone skills.

272
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:08,965
Surrender.

273
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:11,299
Go to hell!

274
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,199

275
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,599
