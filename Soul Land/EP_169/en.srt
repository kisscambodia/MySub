203
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,460
We successfully entered Haishen Island,

204
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,160
but this is just the beginning.

205
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,990
This is the forbidden area?

206
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,630
The surroundings feel very serious and solemn.

207
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,590

208
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,530
