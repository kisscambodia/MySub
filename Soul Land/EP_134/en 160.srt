[Previous episode]

32
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,890
From today onward, Tang San will be recognized
as the crown prince's teacher,

33
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,930
with the title Lan Hao.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,090
Greetings, King of Lan Hao!

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,460
From now on, this is the symbol of your status.

36
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,230
If the Peerless Flexible Armor is a magical item,

37
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,110
then this Vast Sea and Universe Shield

38
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,790
is the most magical of them all.

39
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,060
After this departure,

40
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,060
who knows when we'll see them again?

41
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,490
They will go towards the west

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,890
to Tian Dou Empire's western-most sea,

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,160
then switch into boats

44
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,330

Chief Tang.

47
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,530
We are five li away from the next village.

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,590
Shall we crash in this village tonight?

49
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:14,960
Something's wrong.

50
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,390
There's no one in the field at all.

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,590
Maybe they all went home?

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,490
They even left their farming tools in the field.

53
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,090
That is strange.

54
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,030
Brother San.

55
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:41,890
I'll go take a look.

56
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,430
Be careful.

57
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,730
It was brightly lit the entire way

58
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,160

62
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,730
Don't worry, I will protect you.

63
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:57,990
Stop!

Wolf thieves.

77
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,330
It's surprising there should be wolf thieves

78
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,160
in Tian Dou Empire too!

79
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,260
Wolf thieves?

80
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,660
Are they human?

81
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,090
They are a mix of humans
and the soul beast Gale Devil Wolf,

82
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,790
a kind of monster that is half wolf and half human.

83
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,290
Feng Xiao Tian's martial soul,
Double-headed Gale Devil Wolf,

84
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,330
is the mutant and stronger version of the Gale Devil Wolf.

85
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,090
That means

86
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,530
wolf thieves have
both the physique and talent of Gale Devil Wolf

87
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,060
and part of the intelligence of humans.

88
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,230
That's right.

89
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,360
They are born blood-thirsty

90
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,430
and enjoy hunting humans as food.

91
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,560
Once attacked, they'll be relentless till death,

92
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,630
making them extremely hard to deal with.

93
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,030
500 wolf thieves

94
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,030
can defeat an army of over ten thousand soldiers.

95
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,930
It's difficult for us to confront
this many wolf thieves.

96
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,530
What should we do?

97
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,190
Do it!

You take the villagers and escape.

We will take care of the rest.

108
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,830
Everyone, follow me!

109
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,060
These wolf thieves are only some followers.

110
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,990
There has to be a leader in this group.

111
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,660
As long as we catch the leader,

112
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,160
the rest of them will disperse.

113
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,860
The wolf leader isn't here.

114
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,090

122
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,860
Is it gonna stop or what?!

123
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,230
We're surrounded.

124
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,630
What should we do, San?

125
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:23,680

126
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,490
You go first.

127
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,460
I will stall them!

128
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,390
Do you still not gonna stop?

129
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,170

131
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,360
He is the leader of the wolf thieves.

132
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,290
We need to take care of him first.

133
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,590
No way.

134
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,330
He still has Xiang.

135
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,760
If you want this woman to live,

136
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,660
come get her with your lives.

137
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,290
No!

139
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,230

143
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,930

I will protect you!

151
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,260
You're asking for your death!

152
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,130
This state is...

153
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,790
Fanatic!

154
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,190
What should we do?

155
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,090
Leave it to me.

156
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,230
You guys step back now.

157
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,030
You destroyed them all in an instant.

158

Brother San, you're so powerful!

159
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:08,590
San.

160
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,490
What move did you use?

161
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,190
Brother San.

162
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,830
Look. What is that?

163
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,160
It's a soul bone.

164
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,890
Brother Dai.

165
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,790
This soul bone is yours.

166
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,690
Amongst us Seven Devils,

167
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,330
you're the only one without one.

168
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:34,490
But

169
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,130
Wu doesn't have one either.

170
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,760
Wu doesn't need one right now.

171

172
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,290
Don't reject it.

173
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,730
If I guessed correctly,

174
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,160
the skill that this soul bone gives

175
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,390
is possibly Berserker.

176
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,830
It will be very useful for you.

177
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,460
Brother San.

178
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,430
I should check on the villagers.

179
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,290
I'll go with you.

180
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,660
Go ahead.

181
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,460
I'll stay here.

182
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,490
This way.

183
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,860
What are you doing?

184
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,130
Please help us here.

185
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,030
I'm coming.

186
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,290
Xiang.

187
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,290
Anything else?

188
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,290
Goodbye.

189
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,830
Thank you! Have a safe trip!
