of Haishen Island.

How come Brother San has nearly
three times as many steps as we do?

81

is to climb the steps,

93

What happened?

150
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,610
Seems like we hit a wall full of elasticity.

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,810
As much my impact force is

152
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,410

153
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,410
The same happened to me.

154
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,280
It seems that

155
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,910
starting from the position of the stairs,

156
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,810

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,110
try firing a White Tiger Intense Light Wave

159
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,480
upwards at a squint angle
with a small amount of soul power.

162
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,810
It seems that I guessed right.

163
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,410
The Light of the God of the Ocean is an
overbearing protective shield,

164
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,010
capable of reflecting any attack.

165
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,210
And it only bounces back to the person
who launched the attack.

166
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,380
San is right.

167
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,980
Otherwise,

168
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,680
the White Tiger Intense Light Wave
that I shot with squint angle

169
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,980
should have bounced into the diagonally above.

170
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,780
In this case,

00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,580

constantly squeezed)

186
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,310
(and about to be popped out.)

187
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,450
(Moreover,)

188
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,180
(the soul power is being consumed quickly.)

189
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,880
(The pressure is increasing.)

190
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,580
(The pressure is surging like a tide.)

191
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,380
(At this fifth step,)

192
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,580
(I'm afraid that the soul power)

193
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,710
(of the 30th level soul master has been exhausted.)

194
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,280
San.

195
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,810
Let's compete.

196
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,810
The first soul skill, White Tiger Shield.

197
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,380
San.

198
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,510
Go on!

199
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,680
San.

200
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,480
You don't have a single soul skill,

201
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,450
so how did you make it?

202
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,310
I have three more soul bones than you.

203
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,550
Fifth soul skill,
Tiger Monstrous Transformation.

204
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,780
Thirty-four. Thirty-five.

205
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,150
Thirty-six. Thirty-seven. Thirty-eight.

206
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,380
Boss Dai!

207
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,110
Mu Bai!

208
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,810
(Can't even struggle anymore.)

209
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,350
He's so impressive.

210
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,850
I can't stop.

211
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,350
You should take a rest.

212
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,450
It's okay.

213
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,750
I want to see how far San can go.

214
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,210
Forty.

215
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,810
Be careful!

216
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,480
Don't force yourself when you are exhausted.

217
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,650
(Thank god)

218
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,050
(my bones can take the pressure.)

219
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,110
(This familiar crackling sound.)

220
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,810
(Do it all at once,)

221
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,880
(second time tired,)

222
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,110
(third time exhausted.)

223
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,210
San's Blue Silver Domain has increased.

224
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,950
Surprisingly, he can accelerate his pace.

225
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,310
(Forty-nine. Fifty...)

226
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,950
(The recovery of soul power
can't keep up with the consumption.)

227
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,950
Brother San. Watch out!

Turns out that this is to be
in an extremely difficult situation.

264
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,550
I must become stronger as soon as possible.

265
