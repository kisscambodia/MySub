Wu.

33
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,360
Will you marry me?

34
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,660
Since you made a choice,

35
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,730
then...

36
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,360
I will gift this comb to you.

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,330
I will.

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,360
How could I miss out

39
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,830
on Grand Sword Master's tutoring?

40
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,760
This sword is called

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,960
Hepta Kill.

42
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:38,890
Brothers.

43
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,530
Show your martial souls!

[Episode 159]

45
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,530
Qian Dao Liu.

46
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
There is one more person of the Martial Soul Hall

47
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,330
that can intimidate the entire Hao Tian.

48
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,490
The person my father mentioned

49
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,930
is not Bibi Dong,

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,260
but Qian Dao Liu.

51
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,790
Senior Chen Xin's father's

52
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,490
soul power was already at level 97,

53
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,860
but he still couldn't defeat
Qian Dao Liu, who was at level 99.

54
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,360
There should be

55
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,330
such a big difference between the two levels.

56
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,590
Unless the two people have soul skills
that are fundamentally different,

57
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,490
a level 96 Grand Soul Land Master

58
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,830
can suppress all other Grand Soul Land Master
at level 95 or lower.

59
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,330
In terms of the gap between level 100 and 99,

60
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,780
there is a 100% increase in soul power alone.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,330
This is the difference between top masters.

62
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,060
All of the little freaks are geniuses.

63
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,690
As their skills get stronger,

64
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,790
they've gotten more confident as well.

65
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,190
They must understand

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,430
how big of a difference there is
between themselves and the true masters.

67
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,430
How big is the gap

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,860
between me and them?

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
The younger generation is indeed strong.

70
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,590
I was only able to defeat them

71
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,890
after using my Ninth Soul Skill.

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,860
Xiang.

73
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,490
I'm at level 59 now.

74
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,490
What are you gloating about?

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,890
Aren't you still the weakest
among the Seven Devils?

76
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,030
With my talent,

77
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,590
I definitely won't end up the weakest.

78
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,460
If you don't believe me,

79
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,290
let's make a bet

80
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,160
and see who improves more quickly

81
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,160
during our trip on the Haishen Island.

82
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,090
Fine.

83
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,990
I'm not scared of that.

84
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,130
If I win,

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,460
I get to kiss you.

86
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,190
If you win,

87
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,130
I'll let you kiss me.

88
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,830
You pervert!

89
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,560
Fatty.

90
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,430
Why do you keep making Xiang mad?

91
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,860
Maybe this is what it means
to be a quarrelsome couple.

92
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,790
Are you done with the sealed-off training?

93
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,660
Everyone seems to be in a good state.

94
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,990
It seems as if you've all learned something new

95
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,630
after fighting with Grand Sword Master.

96
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,530
Very good.

97
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,360
Remember this feeling.

98
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,060
Pressure is motivation.

99
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,830
But remember.

100
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,360
Never overdo it.

101
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,690
Thank you for your guidance, Teacher.

102
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,260
San.

103
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,190
Teacher.

104
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,790
Chief Ning sent someone to bring you to the palace.

105
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,590
His Majesty's breathing is rapid

106
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,860
and unstable.

107
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,490
Chief Tang.

108
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,590
Xue Beng has something to tell you.

109
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,090
Your Highness.

110
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,990
What are you doing?

111
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,530
Chief Tang.

112
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,730
Back then, I angered you multiple times

113
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,460
in order to save myself,

114
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,290
but you rescued my father from danger.

115
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,630
Please accept my appreciation,

116
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,960
or else I will never feel at peace.

117
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,730
Your Majesty.

118
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,990
Chief Tang.

119
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,260
I hope that you will agree to be Xue Beng's master

120
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,860
and take care of him in the future.

121
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,890
Teacher.

122
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,690
Tang San, Chief of Tang's clan, at attention.

123
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,630
I am here.

124
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,130
You are now appointed as Crown Prince's teacher.

125
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,130
You don't need to bow when you see the royal family.

126
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,060
Within the realm of the empire,

127
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,030
you will be ranked three levels higher
than all other officials.

128
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,160
You are granted to be duke with an alien surname,

129
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,930
titled Lan Hao.

130
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,090
Greetings, King of Lan Hao!

131
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,560
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your reward.

132
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,490
King of Lan Hao.

133
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,660
Open it and take a look.

134
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,890
From now on, this is the symbol of your status.

135
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,560
This item is called
the Vast Sea and Universe Shield.

136
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,660
It is kind of a soul guiding tool

137
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,030
with many magical uses.

138
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,860
You will see when you go back

139
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,560
and infuse your soul power into it.

140
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:07,960
This...

141
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,790
His Majesty should award you

142
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,630
such a precious treasure.

143
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,630
This shows how much he values you and Tang's clan.

144
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,030
Just accept it.

145
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

146
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,890
This item is projecting glistening light

147
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,630
and water-like ripples,

148
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,730
dizzying those who see it.

149
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,690
What kind of a treasure is this?

150
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,860
If I use my spirit power to explore it...

151
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,660
What is this vast and powerful surge

152
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,030
of energy?

153
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,160
After all these years,

154
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,630
I've finally found someone
capable of handling this immense power.

155
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:20,910
[Soul Land]

156
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,250
Wu.

157
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,930
Don't worry.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,890
Mu Bai just tried to inject his soul power.

159
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,690
Yet this thing didn't change a bit.

160
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,590
It probably won't hurt Brother San.

161
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,030
Even the Jiubao Amber Pagoda

162
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,860
is in awe of this treasure.

163
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,060
You will see when you go back

164
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,530
and infuse your soul power into it.

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,160
Infuse the soul power?

166
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:04,990
Brother San.

167
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,460
You're finally awake!

168
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,530
A whole night has passed.

169
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:08,760
San.

170
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,090
How are you feeling?

171
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,190
I'm fine.

172
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,360
This gift from Tian Dou Empire

173
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,760
is too precious.

174
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,420
Let's go.

175
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,560
Let me show you.

176
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,730
If the Peerless Flexible Armor is a magical item,

177
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,290
then this Vast Sea and Universe Shield

178
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,960
is the most magical of them all.

179
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
This is its first skill,

180
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,130
called Vast Sea Protection.

181
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,390
It can protect us and make us invisible.

182
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,430
Not only can it hide our physical bodies

183
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,090
but also our breathing,

184
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,930
which is its biggest use.

185
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,290
Its second skill is called
Universal Freezing Protection.

186
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,630
It can freeze anyone with spirit power
three times weaker than mine.

187
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,390
Even though it can't hurt the opponent,
