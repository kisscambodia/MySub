Right. I must've dozed off.

182
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,090
-The others?
-They already left for work.

183
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,300
How's Ryoc doing?

184
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,340
The doctor says he's fine,

185
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,790
so we'll have to wait and see.

186
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,860
I'm glad.

187
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,670
-We should go too.
-Sure.

188
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,680
Dae-gwon, we're leaving too.

189
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,740
I'm sorry, Ryoc.

190
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,110
I shouldn't have
sent you to the countryside.

191
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,660
I shouldn't have pushed this movie on you.

192
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,010
That was a rash decision on my end.

193
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,250
You wanted some time to think,

194
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,290
but I forced it upon you.

195
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,890
I caused this accident.

196
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,460
I'll do anything you ask of me now,

197
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,390
so please wake up.

198
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,460
You promised.

199
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,790
Yes, I'll do anything for you.

200
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,030
Promise?

201
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,750
What?

202
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,910
You promised to let me do anything.

203
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,360
What?

204
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,740
I slept like a log.

205
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,450
Making up for lost sleep

206
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,170
made me a new man.

207
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,880
Hold on.

208
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,930
-Were you crying?
-As if.

209
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,830
I could've picked you up.

210
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,070
Why? Is something up?

211
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,140
-No.
-Of course not.

212
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,210
We're here to wish her luck
on the new sitcom.

213
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,540
Ma-ha, good luck on your first day.

214
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,210
Good luck.

215
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,500
You look...

216
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,790
Didn't you get much sleep?

217
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,900
I got nervous
about the first day of filming today.

218
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,100
You need to watch your health.

219
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,790
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,030
Get some shut-eye on the way there.

221
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,700
Sure.

222
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,630
[KBC]

223
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,300
All right. Ma-ha will dance,

224
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,380
and you'll look at her as if she's a joke.

225
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,710
Let's try that.

226
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,250
No, not like that. Make it look funny.

227
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,270
How else can they react to it?

228
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,720
Okay. Good, right?

229
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,300
That's the end of rehearsal.

230
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,500
Filming will start at 2 p.m. after lunch.

231
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,010
I can't believe
they just changed up the scene.

232
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,120
Whatever. Let's go.

233
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,810
Wait.

234
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,620
Is he all right?

235
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,410
Yes, I'm always good. No problem.

236
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,520
I think she's asking about Ryoc.

237
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,350
Is it bad? How is he doing?

238
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,200
You don't need to worry.

239
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,870
Read the articles later.

240
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,850
How can I not worry?

241
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,880
How can I not worry when he's injured?

242
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,940
Okay, okay.

243
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,780
Dae-gwon? Why are you here?

244
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:48,730
-How's Ryoc?
-He's awake.

245
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,270
What a relief.

246
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,510
Wait. Are you looking for someone?

247
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,050
Is Lee Ma-ha done for the day?

248
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,070
Ma-ha? Why are you asking?

249
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,230
Get out of the way. Ji-hak!

250
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,820
Hey, Dae-gwon.

251
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,620
Oh, hi.

252
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,010
I'm sorry to ask, but I need two hours.

253
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,240
What do you mean?

254
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,000
The articles say
that he's still unconscious,

255
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,980
but his teammates say he's fine.

256
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,470
I want to see if he's all right
with my own eyes.

257
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,530
We just found Person A, right?

258
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,740
Uh-huh.

259
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,200

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,270
Dae-gwon, what's the plan?

262
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,600
-What are you doing here?
-Off we go to the hospital.

263
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,030
-They're here.
-Over there!

264
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,390
-There.
-They're here.

00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,660
-Look.
-Over there!

267
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,600
Over here!

268
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,450
-Any news?
-How's Ryoc?

269
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,430
-Wait!
-Do you have any news?

270
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,230
-Seriously?
-Come on!

271
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,370
You have ten minutes
to check on his well-being.

272
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,540
How should I be when she gets here?

273
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,520
I'll lie in bed,

274
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,070
look like I'm in pain,

275
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,710
and get up slowly.

276
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,620
She'll then ask if I'm all right.

277
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,530
"My injuries are minor
despite the severity of the accident."

279
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,030
Thank you for being here.

280
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,970
Ryoc...

281
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,380
You said you weren't badly hurt!

282
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,280
Why are you lying on the bed like this?

283
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,910
I didn't even get to say what I want.

284
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,410
Actually, I've been your fan
for a long time.

285
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,210
When my manager ditched me,

286
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,080
I wasn't cold at all
because you walked with me!

287
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,720
When you asked me
if the only thing I could do

288
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,480
is copying La Ri-ma,

289
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,590
I didn't feel resentful.

290
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,860
You were the one who held my hand.

291
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,630
You danced with me.

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,720
So please get up soon.

293
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,540
You need to give me my gift pack.

294
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,620
I wanted to see you again,

295
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,300
so I hoped our kissing scene

296
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,020
would be picked as the best scene.

297
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,630
I like you.

298
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,930
I really like you.

299
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,280

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,710
-Do you mean it?
-Ryoc.

302
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,030
I meant...

Take a deep breath.

304
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,070
You just need to hold your breath
and block your ears.

305
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,690
Just as you wanted to
return my padded jacket yourself,

306
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,170
I wanted to return
the gift package myself.

307
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,770
I like you too, Lee Ma-ha.

308
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,680
I also wanted this scene
to be picked as the best one.

309
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,710
During the shoot,
he got into a car accident.

310
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,040
He was sent to the emergency room
and proper care was given.

We, the SHAX members,
will be with him as he recovers.

speculative articles

313
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,330
so that he can rest and fully recover.

How is his condition?

315
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,110
-Did he wake up?
-Is he conscious?

00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,360
fine.

541
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,380
I'm okay.

542
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,460
So... Let's do this!

543
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,090
Let's do this, everyone.

544
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,210
Let's do this.

545
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,560
Let's do this.

546
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,070
-What was that?
-Was he badly hurt in the head?

547
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,350
What about his head?

548
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,430
Darn it. What's this unsettling feeling?

549
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,120
Let's do this?

550
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,150
Say that for yourself.
You look like a crazy man.

551
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,470
I told you to keep a poker face.

552
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,890
Okay, I'm sorry. Please stop nagging.

553
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,480
-It's driving me crazy.
-Fine.

554
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,800
Are you feeling better?

555
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,910
Yes, I'm fine.

556
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,650
Hey, congrats!

557
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,170
I don't think you can do as you wish
just because you're our senior.

558
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,350
Hold on, Dae-gwon.

559
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,050
Wait.

560
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,880
Do you like Ma-ha?

561
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,740
No, I used to like her.

562
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,630
Ma-ha and I are old friends.

563
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,870
Friends?

564
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,420
I've also known her for a long time.

565
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,090
I'm just a friend to her.

566
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,080
Although that wasn't the case for me.

567
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,840
That's why I'm trying to forget her.

568
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,500
But

569
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,540
I'm planning to stay next to her
as a friend for a long time.

570
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,900
What?

571
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,880
I'm saying
you shouldn't let your guard down.

572
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,700
You looked too relaxed, so...

573
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,210
Wow, it's great.

574
00:38:59,010 --> 00:38:59,980
Hey.

575
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,840
Did you think about what I said last time?

576
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,600
-No.
-Why not?

577
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,080
I thought I wouldn't need to.

578
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,840
So what's the reason?

579
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,210
I thought I already said
I don't want to get involved with SHAX.

580
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,530
Let's call it a day.

581
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,030
Okay, sure.

582
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,410
Wait.

583
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,220
Then think of it

584
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,190
as doing it with me alone, not SHAX.

585
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:56,780
What?

586
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,320
Just give it some thought.

587
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,220
She won't let her guard down.

588
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,680
Ha-seok.

589
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,760
Something that feels like this moment.

590
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,180
You know, it's...

591
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,200
You have no idea.

592
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,240
Careful, Ryoc.

593
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,050
You must be tired. Get some sleep.

594
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,150
-Dae-gwon.
-What now?

595
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,130
Fine.

596
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,190
I'd rather let you borrow my wife
before I let you drive my car.

597
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,550
You aren't married.

598
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,220
Ryoc, be gentle.

599
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,890
Don't let it get scratched, okay?

600
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,340
Be gentle.

601
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,720
Buckle up.

602
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,620
Okay.

603
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,080
Let's go.

604
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,280
It's our first date.

605
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,100
This is it. An unoccupied and quiet place.

606
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,440
Yes, it's quiet.

607
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,330
But

608
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,540
they take photos from across the river.

609
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,600
The river?

610
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,880
From across the river?

611
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,520
Crow-tit.

612
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,010
It's time for us to kiss.

613
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,820
Goodness.

614
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,820
I'd love to.

615
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,240
What?

616
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,520
No.

617
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:13,940
This is it.

618
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,450
This is supposed to be
the most popular dating spot.

619
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,530
Yes, it does look quite popular.

620
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,470
Isn't it great to drive around?

621
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,300
Yes, but the view is the same.

622
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,380
[-Aren't I a great driver?
-You're great at turning corners.]

623
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,970
[Ryoc, do you have any medicine
for motion sickness?]

624
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,920
You jumped out in excitement,
so why did you return depressed?

625
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,370
You're so unpredictable.

626
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,390
You have an ad shooting, so get rested.

627
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,580
I'll be back at 6 a.m.

628
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,210
Okay.

629
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,410
Be on time. Make yourself presentable.

630
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,610
I won't let you off twice for being sick.

631
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,700
Bye.

632
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:25,970
Gosh.

633
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,130
It's not easy, is it?

634
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,670
No, it can't be that easy.

635
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,610
Dae-gwon has his eyes on you,
and you got nowhere to go and no time.

636
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,470
You get all excited,
then your bubble gets popped.

637
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,650
We had nowhere to go,
so I drove for two hours.

638
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,930
Did you go to the Han River?

639
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,470
Don't ever go there. No way.

640
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,110
You know that people wait there
around the clock, right?

641
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,310
I do, so I didn't go there.

642
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,300
How about an arboretum?

643
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,590
-It's quiet and...
-No.

644
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,880
An actor couple was
filmed there last week.

645
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,460
People know about it already.

646
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:04,990
Wait, so you just went round and round
on your first date?

647
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,230
Round and round?

648
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,630
-Want some tips?
-Want some?

649
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,050
Do you want help from the experts?

650
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,060
March forward, my man.

651
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,330
-March forward.
-Yes.

652
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,530
-What are you so happy about?
-My gosh.

653
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,460
What's going on?

654
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,480
-What?
-Is something troubling you?

655
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,660
Tell me. I'm ready to hear you out.

656
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,540
Well, the thing is this.
There are A and B.

657
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:44,950
-One second.
-What?

658
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,570
-Go with C and D.
-Why?

659
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,640
A and B already had a happy ending.

660
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:49,830
Go with C and D.

661
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,720
Okay, fine.

662
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,520
Now, there are C and D.

663
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:56,430
But C keeps getting angry
and annoyed at D.

664
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,060
But D doesn't hate it.

665
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,680
Things don't work out, right?

666
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,180
D gets concerned.

667
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:03,200
Yes. You're right.

668
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,180
So what now?

669
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,080
Hey, Dae-gwon.
Can you pick me up at 5 a.m. tomorrow?

670
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,140
Be here on time.

671
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,650
[What? Why 5 a.m.?]

672
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,770
No, never mind. Make it 4.
See you at 4 a.m.

673
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,140
[Is this some kind of show?]

674
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,120
You have to come. Be here on time!

675
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,350
[You crazy punk!]

676
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:51,650
[Star Is Born]

677
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,520
Hello?

678
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,870
Why did you
suddenly call me out at this hour?

679
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,820
What if someone sees us?

680
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:06,970
Like who?

681
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,710
Did you put makeup on?

682
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,080
I thought someone might see us.

683
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,630
Gosh, you might start rolling
once I tap on you.

684
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,090
Right?

685
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,730
I'm glad I got to see you.
I need to go now.

686
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,930
-What?
-I have a shoot.

687
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,660
We have to go. We'll be late.

688
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:48,820
Bye, then.

689
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,800
I get it.

690
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,330
Hurry up and go. Just go.

691
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,830
We're late. Just go.

692
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,340
We have to go. We're late. Go.

693
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:26,310
Gosh, one second, please.
I can't seem to get excited.

-He's not here yet?
-No, not yet.

00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,910
I thought I was in this with Ryoc.

698
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,340
Hello.

699
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,500
Hello.

700
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,290
I know you were hospitalized,

701
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,140
but you should still be on time.

702
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,600
What should I say?

703
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,210
Miss you. I miss you.

-What's going on?
-What is?

Who changed you like this?

Are you dating someone?

707
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,330
Silence means yes, right?

708
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,630
-You're right.
-Who is she?

709
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,740
I couldn't tell you that.

Ryoc. Goodness.

711
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,540
Since when has he been dating Ma-ha?

712
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,640
Sorry?

713
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,760
Hey, I told you not to tell her.

-Bingo.

Well, please keep this a secret. Please.

This is pretty shocking.

If I wait, will you come to me?

720
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,610
-I'm not just playing.
-I'm not playing either.

721
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:37,950
Please keep this a secret.
Please don't tell anybody.

722
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,140
Okay.

723
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,580
Ryoc.

724
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,780
Erase that smile.

725
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,070
You obviously seem like you're dating.

726
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,540
-Hey, that was my fault, right?
-No, I think it was mine.

727
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,260
Was it that obvious?

728
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:20,370
What's wrong?

729
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,250
I don't want to be in a shoot today.

730
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,300
Let's get started.

731
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,490
[Tea Party]

732
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,050
If I act more like Ma-ha,

733
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,430
will he show me a smile too?

734
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,020
[Star Is Born]

735
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,890
[What time do you get off?
I'm still on set.]

736
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,600
[I guess we can't meet today.]

737
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,110
-Ma-ha, they're ready for the next scene.
-Okay.

738
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,490
Now, eat up.

739
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,040
You should eat.

740
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:45,730
You're on a diet anyway,
so just eat and continue.

741
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,220
Use this as a motivation.

742
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:49,990
-Take a seat.
-Ri-ma.

743
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,110
Thank you for the thought,

744
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:54,350
but what if the agency finds out?

745
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,680
It's fine as long as I bought these.

746
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:59,150
They aren't going to get mad. Take a seat.

747
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,690
Then I'll sit.

748
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,500
I've been starving all day.

749
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,200
Ri-ma, aren't you going to eat?

750
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:12,700
I'm not in your position.

751
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:17,410
-Then thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

752
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:34,390
Ma-ha!

753
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,080
It's way too late.

754
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,830
I miss him.

755
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,010
Then you can see me.

756
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,200
How did you know...

757
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:16,410
Hyuk said you were done shooting,
so I knew you'd come home.

758
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,470
This time, don't run away.
What do you think?

759
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:27,230
Wait, you aren't
taking a big breath anymore.

760
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:29,830
You sounded very shy on the phone.

761
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:40,040
You'll have to take many big breaths
in the days to come.

762
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,670
Where are we?

763
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,990
Just follow me.

764
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,060
Mask up.

765
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:02,270
Really?

766
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:05,610
That's Kim Ji-min.

767
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,970
Ignore everyone you see.

768
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:30,120
It smells good and tastes good.

769
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,240
I'm having coffee
with Kwon Ryoc of SHAX this late at night.

770
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:48,560
[The star that shined brightly
far off in the darkness]

771
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:53,310

772
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,430

[Epilogue]

774
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,290
Gosh, it's so hot.

775
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,470
Where did he hide it?

776
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,540
Goodness, it's so dirty.

777
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,560
["Nangrangbihwa"]

778
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,910
Found it. It's your heart, Crow-tit.

780
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,250
