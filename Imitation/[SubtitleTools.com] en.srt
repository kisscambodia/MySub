You're the goddess of Tea Party.
What's wrong?

359
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,780
Our goddess needs to show
how one can pull off a style.

360
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,060

Gosh, why are you going overboard
early in the morning?

362
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm just upbeat

363
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,660
What is this unsettling feeling
I'm having since yesterday?

364
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,120
I'll do it.

365
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,190

Okay.

367
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,700
Oh, right.
Ha-seok wanted to see you, Ri-a.

368
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,920
I mean,

369
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,310
you want me to read all these
within this week?

370
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,690
You should read them fast
and decide already.

371
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,670
Isn't this too much?

372
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,040
I don't like forcing you either.

373
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,110
Mr. Park wants you to
start the next work fast.

374

You must've loved it.

Thank you for contributing
to the number of viewers.

385
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,300
I haven't seen it. I didn't want to
watch it after seeing the stills.

386
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,890
That's why I turned down the OST offer.

387
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,100
Did you think it was me
while shooting the scene?

388
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,850
Didn't you think of me
while shooting the scene with my copycat?

389
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,740
Stop it already.

390
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,940
This isn't any fun.

391
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,740
You keep calling her copycat.

392
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,000
Will you stop calling her that?

393
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,090
She's totally different.

this is your first photo shoot?

414
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,370
You were really good for a first-timer.

415
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,970
You're being too nice.

416
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,610
I like pretty girls, that's why.

417
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,960
It's Yu-jin's first time too,
and he's really good.

He's nice and well-mannered.

He has a nice personality too.

420

He takes good care of his friends.

Are you disappointed
that I called you to sing a guide?

431
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,990
It's not like that.

432

-Sorry?

-Just now.

00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,030
"So I guess SHAX is making
a girls' song too."

451
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,500
How dare he make a pass at me.

452
