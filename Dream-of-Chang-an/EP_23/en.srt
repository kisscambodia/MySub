(Yu'er.)

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,960
Your Majesty.

17
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,600
Chen Yintai couldn't convince people,

18
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,120
and his troops are disunited.

19
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,560
General of the Standard Zhang Jiang
already killed him.

20
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,720
Wait.

21
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,600
(Memorial to the Throne)
Official Qiu.

22
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,380
(Memorial to the Throne)

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,320
It seems like Official Li

24
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,960
knows Heshuo's situation

25
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,240
very well.

26
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Indeed.

27
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,040
No post was given.

28
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,680
He'd surely bring chaos upon himself.

29
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,840
I got it.

30
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,480
Official Li is right indeed.

31
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,680
This is because Your Majesty is lucky.

32
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,240
Those who want to turn this luck around

33
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,120
won't have a good ending.

34
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
May the heavens protect Your Majesty.

35
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,000
May the heavens protect Xing.

36
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,680
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

37
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,320
Rise.

38
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,440
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

39
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
Of course,

40
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,000
we must thank

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,560
Duke Chu for his assistance.

42
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,760
I am

43
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,760
so grateful.

44
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,560
Please accept my bow.

45
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,040
Yu'er.

46
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,560
Are you injured?

47
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm fine.

48
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,280
But in order to save me,

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,520
Ziyuan is stuck in Chess
of Generals Camp.

50
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm not sure if she's dead or alive.

51
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,680
I'll delay them.

52
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,320
Go.

53
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,960
But...

54
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,680
Cut the crap.

55
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,800
They're waiting for news from you.

56
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,000
Ziyuan.

57
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,320
I'm not doing this
for the lousy emperor.

58
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,800
I'm doing it for the citizens.

59
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,520
Don't worry.

60
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,320
Yanzhi will keep her alive.

61
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,440
We'll think of a way to save her

62
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,880
when the time comes.

63
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Since Official Li

64
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,160
can recognize
Lucong's situation clearly,

65
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,600
he must have a plan.

66
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,880
And he accomplished
a great thing this time.

67
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,680
He must be rewarded.

68
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
I announce

69
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,800
that Official Li is now given the title
of Vice Director of the Chancellery,

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,200
serving as the Grand Councilor.

71
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,960
and assist me in my rule.

72
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

73
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,760
Congratulations, Official Li.

74
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,280
Same to you.

75
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,680
Indeed.

76
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,520
I have good news

77
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,360
to report to His Majesty.

78
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,520
During this period of time,

79
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,040
these are the people Official Qiu met.

80
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,360
Did you miss anyone?

81
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,560
I don't think so.

82
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,960
He is obstinate.

83
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,400
He thinks that no one would dare
to monitor him.

84
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,380
(A woman in plain clothes visited
during tea time)

85
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
Who is this woman

86
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,400
in plain clothes?

87
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,640
Among the people he met,

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,400
she's the only one whose identity
is unclear.

89
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,680
We only know

90
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,600
that a woman wearing a veiled hat

91
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,800
visited him ten days ago.

92
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,400
Right Advisor arranged a place
for her to stay.

93
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,840
In the past few days,

94
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,720
he also went
to where she's staying twice.

95
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
He also went there last night.

96
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,080
Last night?

97
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,120
Are you sure?

98
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,800
Yes.

99
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,680
I found out where she's staying.

100
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,240
I even found a cricket.

101
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,000
Prince An.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,880
Duke Chu.

103
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,280
What good news do you want to report?

104
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,920
His Highness Prince An.

105
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,960
Godfather.

106
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,880
Good boy.

107
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,000
Come,

108
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,280
and greet your brother.

109
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,480
Greetings, Brother.

110
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Rise.

111
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,600
Your Majesty.

112
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,480
His Highness Prince An

113
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,760
suffered a lot.

114
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,320
But I think

115
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,480
that it's worth it.

116
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,520
Because His Majesty

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,600
wants to give you the title
of Crown Prince.

118
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,400
Are you happy?

119
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,280
Thank you, Brother.

120
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,160
This is ridiculous!

121
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,160
His Majesty is in his prime.

122
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,080
Why does he need to appoint
a Crown Prince?

123
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,520
Official Li.

124
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,600
You don't agree?

125
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,880
Official Qiu is pulling the same trick.

126
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
Duke Chu.

127
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,520
What are you doing?

128
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
You don't agree

129
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,440
because you think

130
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,440
that this isn't formal enough?

131
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,320
That's fine.

132
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,160
Appointing a Crown Prince

133
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,480
is a major matter.

134
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,560
It must be more formal indeed.

135
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
Official Li.

136
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,600
Do you think

137
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,480
the preparation outside the hall
is enough?

138
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,160
You...

139
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,920
Your Majesty.

140
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,920
Rumors have been arising
in Heng'an City,

141
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,960
making the citizens feel panicked.

142
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,600
Appointing a Crown Prince

143
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,920
can help bring the nation
and citizens peace.

144
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,520
Your Majesty.

145
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,800
What do you think?

146
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,160
I second the motion!

147
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,360
- I second the motion.
- I second the motion.

148
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,560
Your Majesty.

149
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,160
An hour ago,

150
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,200
Wang Lin brought

151
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
3,000 Shencai Army of the Left
into the palace.

152
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,800
They're waiting outside
the Silver Platform Gate.

153
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,800
They don't seem to harbor
good intentions.

154
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,560
Today is the last day

155
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,440
of the deadline in February.

156
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,680
Qiu Ziliang is mobilizing troops

157
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,680
because he wants

158
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,480
to pressure Li Deyun to resign
during the imperial court meeting.

159
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,080
Are you ready?

160
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,520
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

161
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,880
As usual,

162
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
once you light the flare,

163
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,080
the Left Jinwu Guards outside

164
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,720
on the right
of Silver Platform Gate

165
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,800
will immediately come
and surround the place.

166
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,000
Then you can see

167
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,200
that my men

168
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,080
are definitely not useless

169
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,120
like the Shencai Army.

170
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,580
(Eighth brother Prince An has been smart
and kind since he was little)

171
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,380
(He'll be appointed as Crown Prince
and stay in the East Palace)

172
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,720
Your Majesty.

173
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,160
Put a seal on it.

174
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,280
What's the matter?

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,520
Are you trying to force His Majesty?

176
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,160
Violet Bureau, where are you?

177
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,040
Little Fish has improved.

178
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,160
She knows that she can use

179
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,280
the Violet Bureau
to protect His Majesty.

180
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,880
She's finally not foolhardy anymore.

181
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,960
Your Majesty.

182
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,400
What are you still thinking about?

183
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,480
His Majesty said

184
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,000
that he doesn't agree.

185
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,840
Duke Chu.

186
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,920
Is there anything else
you want to report?

187
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,040
His Majesty doesn't agree.

188
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,640
Forget it then.

189
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,920
Are you leaving or not?

190
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,040
Brother.

191
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,880
I agree.

192
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,680
I am

193
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,520
appointing Prince An

194
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,680
as the Crown Prince.

195
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,800
Your Highness Prince An.

196
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,240
Thank your brother.

197
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,080
Thank you, Brother.

198
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,720
We still can't find out

199
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,840
who exactly that woman is.

200
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,640
However,

201
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,720
she must be the one

202
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,800
who brought Prince An back.

203
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,360
No wonder.

204
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,120
I was wondering

205
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,920
why Official Qiu was concerned
about Zhaoyi,

206
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,600
and not Lucong.

207
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,480
It turns out

208
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,160
that he intentionally let Li Deyun
won once.

209
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,920
Later on,

210
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,960
he still has Prince An
as his trump card.

211
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,400
Is Liu Misha

212
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,280
in Qiu Ziliang's hands as well?

213
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,200
Since Prince An was captured,

214
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,040
I think Liu Misha
didn't get away as well.

215
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,680
Find out where Liu Misha is hiding.

216
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,920
If she can still go back there,

217
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,760
this might still stand a chance.

218
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,360
Yes.

219
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,280
By the way,

220
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
what should we do with Ziyuan?

221
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,119
Your Majesty.

222
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,440
What's the matter?

223
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,880
You don't have an appetite?

224
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,560
When I acknowledged Qiu Ziliang
as my godfather back then,

225
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,920
I went against the late emperor
in everything.

226
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,520
The officials

227
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,400
all suggested for him

228
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,920
to revoke my title as Prince Yi

229
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,640
and exile me to a desolate place.

230
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,720
But he never agreed.

231
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,000
It was just like

232
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,160
the situation with His Highness
Prince An now.

233
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
Before he died,

234
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,600
he only requested one thing.

235
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,520
He begged me

236
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,080
to take good care

237
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,240
of our siblings.

238
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,160
Even if His Highness Prince An

239
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,280
keeps betraying you,

240
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,200
you still want to save him?

241
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,560
But Qiu Ziliang

242
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,120
knows my weak spot too well.

243
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,120
Your Majesty.

244
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,160
Now, the situation is much better.

245
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,600
Official Li is back.

246
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,040
The Violet Bureau is also strong.

247
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,200
If we can save His Highness
Prince An once,

248
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,960
we can save him again.

249
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,960
Grandfather.

250
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,560
Grandfather.

251
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,560
Grandfather.

252
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,520
I think

253
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,880
that you're still

254
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,560
the brilliant one.

255
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,800
Even if those women in the Violet Bureau

256
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,400
made a fool of us today,

257
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,960
in the end, His Majesty still...

258
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,040
That's enough.

259
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,320
Shut up.

260
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,600
Not only is Little Fish back,

261
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,840
she even picked

262
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,240
cowardly and useless people
to pressure us.

263
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,440
You're brilliant.

264
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,960
I didn't do my job well.

265
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,200
Sir.

266
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,560
What should we do next?

267
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,800
Come here.

268
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,200
Choose

269
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,320
an auspicious day

270
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
for the official appointment

271
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,880
of Prince An.

272
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,440
Yes.

273
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,800
Only with a title

274
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,600
can we proceed with our plans.

275
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,440
Understand?

276
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

277
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

278
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,920
I originally wanted
to suppress Qiu Ziliang

279
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
through Zhenwu

280
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,400
after we settle things in Lucong.

281
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,040
But now,

282
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,560
Qi Rong is in Qiu Ziliang's hands.

283
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,000
And we're not sure if Misha
is dead or alive.

284
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,280
I'm afraid

285
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,200
that the chaos in Lucong
will still go on for a long time.

286
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,160
Your Majesty.

287
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,360
What if I go

288
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,760
and save Princess Misha now?

289
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,440
Do you know

290
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,120
where Princess Misha is locked up?

291
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
I don't have much clues indeed.

292
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,760
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

293
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,040
How did Misha

294
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,000
and Qi Rong's whereabouts

295
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,280
leak out?

296
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,080
I kept wondering about that.

297
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
And how did they fall

298
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,840
into Qiu Ziliang's hands?

299
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,720
The only ones who know
about this matter are me,

300
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,680
you,

301
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,440
Prince Guang and Aunt.

302
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,480
But it's impossible

303
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,080
for us to leak out the news.

304
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,760
Uncle won't harm

305
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,760
me and Qi Rong.

306
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,640
And I trust you.

307
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,160
Then you mean...

308
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,760
You're suspecting Aunt.

309
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,840
Your Majesty.

310
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,200
It definitely can't be Aunt.

311
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
It must be because Princess Misha

312
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,480
and His Highness Prince An

313
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,800
accidentally revealed their tracks.

314
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,040
Or perhaps Qiu Ziliang

315
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,840
figured it out.

316
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,280
Anyway, it can't be Aunt.

317
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,960
Your Majesty, you know...

318
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
I know.

319
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080
Calm down.

320
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,120
Your Majesty.

321
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,560
Even if Aunt

322
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,480
hid Yuzhen Hall

323
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,520
from you,

324
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,720
she definitely

325
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,440
won't betray you.

326
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,160
If she has ulterior motives,

327
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,960
how can she let me become
the Sword Bearer

328
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,240
and serve by your side

329
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
to protect you?

330
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
You're right.

331
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,560
Now

332
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,360
is not the time to think about this.

333
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,080
We must find a way to save her first.

334
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,320
Let's go to Qi Rong now?

335
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,360
Okay.

336
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,440
Your Majesty.

337
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,680
Let's ask Yanzhi first

338
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,960
where His Highness Prince An is staying.

339
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,040
All right.

340
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,080
This way.

341
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,360
She's not around.

342
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Based on these incense,

343
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,800
she must have been gone
for less than half an hour.

344
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,640
That's strange.

345
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,200
Where would she go

346
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,240
at this hour?

347
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,080
Leave a secret sign for her.

348
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,640
Let's check somewhere else.

349
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,840
This painting...

350
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,720
The person in the painting
looks so familiar.

351
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,320
This is the Chess Ancestor Shennong.

352
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,160
Cheng Ruoyu.

353
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,680
Cheng Ruoyu.

354
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,440
Cheng Ruoyu.

355
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,480
I'm fine.

356
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,480
I'm having a headache again.

357
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,800
I feel much better.

358
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,920
Time is running out.

359
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,920
Let's go.

360
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,720
Are you really fine?

361
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,080
Your Majesty.

362
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,680
It seems like Prince An is inside.

363
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,800
I'll think of a way

364
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,200
to distract the guards.

365
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,560
Take the opportunity to go inside,

366
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,400
find Qi Rong,

367
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:19,920
and ask him

368
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,960
how he returned.

369
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,200
I'll distract the guards instead.

370
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,920
You go inside.

371
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
If I do it,

372
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,640
Qi Rong might not tell the truth.

373
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,600
All right.

374
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,320
I'll do it.

375
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,360
Be careful.

376
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,160
Who's there?

377
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,440
Chess Overseer.

378
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,040
Here's the long-horned grasshopper
you want.

379
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,240
- You may go.
- Yes.

380
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,280
(Yanzhi?)

381
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,160
Prince An.

382
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,200
I wasn't expecting you.

383
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,120
There's something

384
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,400
I can't figure out.

385
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,200
I want to ask you about it.

386
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,160
What is it?

387
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,720
Your Highness.

388
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,000
How did you return?

389
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,360
Eunuch Qiu doesn't want me

390
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,400
to tell this to outsiders.

391
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,640
My Ever Victorious General.

392
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,320
You want it?

393
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,560
Exchange this with your secret.

394
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,000
You dare to trick me too?

395
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,200
You're young indeed.

396
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,080
Father personally gave me the title
of Chess Overseer.

397
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,400
In that case,

398
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,800
do you consider Chess of Generals Camp

399
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
as an outsider?

400
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,400
Do you want me

401
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,920
to ask Father about such a minor thing?

402
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,280
Madam Cheng was the one
who brought me back.

403
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,360
That's ridiculous!

404
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,760
Guards!

405
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,000
Wait.

406
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,560
Let's listen to what she has
to say first

407
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,760
before we call the guards.

408
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,840
It's impossible for Aunt to do that.

409
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,640
That's nonsense.

410
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,520
You're lying.

411
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,800
Why would I lie?

412
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,400
Not only did Madam Cheng bring me back,

413
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,760
she even told Eunuch Qiu

414
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,680
about using Liu Misha

415
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,920
in exchange for something.

416
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,400
In exchange for what?

417
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,320
I don't know.

418
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,800
Eunuch Qiu

419
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,360
even instructed Madam Cheng

420
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,680
to lead Violet Bureau well.

421
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,800
I don't believe

422
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,280
anything you said.

423
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,760
That's impossible.

424
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,880
Aunt couldn't possibly do that.

425
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,520
Yu'er.

426
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,920
Instead of speaking

427
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,760
useless things here,

428
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,720
go back

429
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,960
and ask your aunt

430
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,000
why she did that.

431
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,000
But before getting
to the bottom of things,

432
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,280
don't tell anyone first.

433
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,680
Otherwise,

434
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,320
you know what will happen.

435
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,080
Yanzhi.

436
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
In order to save me,

437
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,600
Ziyuan got trapped here.

438
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,120
Can you release her?

439
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:57,960
Sure.

440
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,720
Exchange her with the reason
for Cheng Xi's betrayal.

441
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,400
Aunt didn't betray His Majesty.

442
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,000
I'll prove it to you.

443
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,680
Is she going to cut out
my brother's heart?

444
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,240
What did you say?

445
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,160
Madam Cheng said

446
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,480
that she especially

447
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,960
prepared Cheng Ruoyu

448
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,960
to cut out my brother's heart.

449
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,200
Your Majesty.

450
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,280
What happened?

451
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,760
Did you see Qi Rong?

452
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,880
What did he say?

453
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,960
Your Majesty.

454
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,560
I need to confirm something.

455
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,520
Afterwards,

456
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,360
I'll return to the palace

457
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,480
and inform you about everything.

458
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,920
Yu'er.

459
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,840
Yu'er.

460
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,120
(Right Advisor.)

461
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,240
(They know each other.)

462
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,600
Right Minister is very angry.

463
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,680
I was doing it for his sake.

464
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,240
You ruined his entire plan

465
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,080
and brought Prince An
into Qiu Ziliang's hands.

466
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,440
And you're saying that it was
for his sake?

467
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,600
I'm helping him make a decision.

468
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
All these years,

469
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,280
he's been working for Qiu Ziliang.

470
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,360
He helped him build Chess
of Generals Camp

471
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,960
and train warriors of sacrifice.

472
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,520
He wants to use Qiu Ziliang's power

473
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,040
to build his own power.

474
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,160
You know his intentions?

475
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,920
Not only do I know it,

476
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,520
I've been helping him with it.

477
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,200
I tried so hard to get Violet Bureau

478
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,400
from the late emperor

479
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,200
and moved Yuzhen Hall's
warriors of sacrifice

480
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,880
out of the palace.

481
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,120
I even sowed discord among Qi Yan

482
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,360
and Qiu Ziliang many times

483
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,240
to make them become
at odds with each other.

484
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,680
But I don't understand

485
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
when he changed

486
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,440
his mind

487
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,600
and started sincerely

488
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,880
assisting Qi Yan.

489
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

490
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,960
You know very well

491
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,480
if that's nonsense or not.

492
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,360
What happened with Li Deyun?

493
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,360
Even if Qi Yan was the one
who summoned him back,

494
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,400
without his help,

495
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,520
could he have returned?

496
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,040
Don't think that I'm not aware

497
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
of your plans.

498
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,040
First, you used Lucong's chaos

499
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,000
to let Li Deyun return to the capital.

500
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,240
Then using Zhenwu's 80,000
elite warriors,

501
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,440
you want to suppress Qiu Ziliang.

502
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,640
Qiu Ziliang may have great
martial arts skills,

503
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,760
but he's not a talented
military commander.

504
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,320
And all these years,

505
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,840
you made the Shencai Army wallow
in luxury

506
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,480
and pleasures.

507
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,720
They're utterly corrupted.

508
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,360
At this rate,

509
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,640
Li Deyun can take the opportunity

510
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,680
to control military power

511
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,760
and kill the eunuch's faction.

512
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,920
(Aunt is exactly right.)

513
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,320
(That's what His Majesty)

514
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,160
(is planning as well.)

515
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,720
(But what does that have to do)

516
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,200
(with Right Minister?)

517
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,600
Isn't that our objective?

518
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,640
And then what will happen?

519
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,520
Li Deyun will replace Qiu Ziliang

520
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,080
and become the second
most powerful man in Xing.

521
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,640
How can he have a way

522
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,360
to control him then

523
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,880
and dethrone Qi Yan?

524
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,960
How do you know that he doesn't
have a way?

525
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,040
I only know

526
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,760
that Qi Yan wants to marry
Li Deyun's daughter,

527
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,880
Li Zening.

528
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,800
When the time comes,

529
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,360
Li Deyun will only be loyal
to one person,

530
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,400
and that is Qi Yan,

531
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,120
and not him.

532
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,000
Who's there?

533
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,960
Yu'er?

534
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,680
I can't argue against you.

535
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,320
I'll tell him to personally come
to talk to you.

536
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,240
The Violet Bureau is your home.

537
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,560
Why are you sneaking around?

538
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,240
Come inside.

539
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,640
Have a seat.

540
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,520
Why?

541
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
You heard us?

542
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,120
I won't keep it from you then.

543
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,640
To be honest,

544
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,400
all these years,

545
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,800
it's been hard hiding it as well.

546
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,920
You're working for the Right Minister
of Chess of Generals Camp?

547
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,720
Yes.

548
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,520
Then you're also part
of the Chess of Generals Camp?

549
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,400
No.

550
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,680
I don't understand.

551
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,280
Who is Right Minister?

552
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,800
Why are you working for him?

553
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,000
He's my younger brother.

554
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,840
Cheng Ruoyu.

555
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,200
Come out.

556
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,840
Your Majesty.

557
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,080
I'm here.

558
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Well...

559
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,760
Go and make tea for me.

560
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,400
Yes.

561
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,240
I have another uncle?

562
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Does Uncle know?

563
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,560
No.

564
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,960
We have the same mother
but different fathers.

565
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,600
It's a long story.

566
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,120
I came to the capital

567
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,120
and entered the palace

568
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,120
to look for him.

569
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,280
After finding him,

570
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,320
the reason I stayed in the palace

571
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,440
is to help him.

572
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,719
What is his objective?

573
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,639
The nation.

574
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,960
You want to rebel?

575
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,360
The Xing Dynasty should perish.

576
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,040
With the nation in chaos,

577
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,719
only the competent can rule.

578
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,320
Instead of letting eunuchs

579
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,040
repeatedly support puppets
to ascend to the throne,

580
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,800
we should rule ourselves.

581
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,080
But the Right Advisor said

582
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,560
that's not what the Right Minister
wants to do.

583
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,080
He's kind

584
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,080
and indecisive.

585
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,480
That's why I'm helping him
make a decision.

586
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,800
Yu'er.

587
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Come and help me

588
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,520
and your uncle.

589
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,760
- No.
- Together...

590
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,880
Qi Yan isn't a wise emperor.

591
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,120
He's not worth doing your best for.

592
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,920
No.

593
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,640
Cheng Ruoyu.

594
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,440
You dare to disobey me?

595
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,040
Aunt.

596
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,160
The nation is in chaos indeed.

597
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,760
But the competent shouldn't rule.

598
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,760
The virtuous should rule instead.

599
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,800
Is Qi Yan virtuous?

600
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,240
I won't help you.

601
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,000
You must help me.

602
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,400
Otherwise, you'll die.

603
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,120
Kill me then.

604
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,120
Back then, His Highness Prince Guang
saved me.

605
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,280
Then you brought me back to the palace

606
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,880
and took care of me daily.

607
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,520
You worked so hard

608
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,120
for half a year

609
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,280
before I was healed.

610
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,560
You gave me this life.

611
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,080
If you want to kill me today,

612
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,880
I won't defend myself.

613
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,200
But Aunt,

614
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,800
it's impossible for me

615
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,840
to rebel with you.

616
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,920
Perhaps you've forgotten

617
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,080
the Violet Bureau's oath,

618
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,760
but I haven't.

619
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,560
I'll surely protect His Majesty

620
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,240
until I die.

621
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,360
You just want to be a loyal subject,

622
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,000
but not be a filial niece?

623
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,720
It's hard to fulfill both.

624
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,520
Scram!

625
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,920
Go back to that lousy emperor!

626
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,960
When you find out

627
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
what kind of person he really is,

628
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,400
you'll regret

629
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,560
this day!

630
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,360
This is also good.

631
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,600
The closer you are to Qi Yan,

632
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,040
the more hurt and devastated you'll be

633
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,080
when you find out

634
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,480
the truth.

635
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,920
You two can die together.

636
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,600
(What should I do?)

637
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,320
(Even if I won't help Aunt rebel,)

638
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,400
(should I just watch His Majesty)

639
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,960
(punish Aunt?)

640
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,640
(How should I tell His Majesty)

641
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,400
(that Aunt has betrayed him?)

642
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,560
(I can't face His Majesty anymore.)

643
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,440
(And I can't continue)

644
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
(staying by his side.)

645
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,960
Uncle.

646
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,040
Yu'er.

647
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,520
What's the matter?

648
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,240
Yu'er.

649
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,640
Are you

650
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,000
not feeling well, Your Majesty?

651
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,760
Eunuch Qiu

652
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,800
sends a pill every three months.

653
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,360
You feel unwell

654
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,400
every time you take it.

655
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,960
I...

656
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,920
I'm fine.

657
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,120
I'm just a bit tired.

658
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,720
Your Majesty.

659
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,520
Did Yu'er

660
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,680
infuriate you again?

661
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,480
I apologize on her behalf.

662
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,920
She didn't do anything.

663
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
No? That's good.

664
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,440
I saw Yu'er

665
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,640
standing by the door earlier.

666
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,680
She didn't dare to come in.

667
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,200
Yu'er is back?

668
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,640
Let her in then.

669
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,240
She left.

670
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,000
You may go.

671
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,040
Yes.

672
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,240
Tell me.

673
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,720
What is the reason
for Cheng Xi's betrayal?

674
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,920
Is it that hard to say?

675
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,840
You'll help His Majesty,

676
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,840
right?

677
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,840
Not necessarily.

678
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,280
However,

679
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,840
at this point,

680
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,680
I don't want anything to happen
to Qi Yan.

681
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,800
Aunt and Right Minister are siblings.

682
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,080
Really?

683
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,240
Right Minister is in Chess
of Generals Camp

684
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,240
to use its power

685
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,080
to get the authority
to command the Shencai Army

686
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,120
and usurp the throne.

687
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,600
But currently,

688
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,080
they have a disagreement.

689
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,920
Aunt wants His Majesty dead,

690
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,360
but Right Minister is hesitant.

691
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,160
That was why Aunt betrayed His Majesty

692
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,360
and Right Minister

693
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,600
and brought Prince An

694
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,360
to Qiu Ziliang.

695
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,280
She's trying to pressure Right Minister?

696
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,080
That was what she told Right Advisor.

697
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,720
That's strange.

698
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,800
If they want the nation,

699
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,040
now is not the time yet.

700
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,520
They better wait until both sides
have suffered great losses.

701
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,440
I don't know about that.

702
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,760
But I can feel

703
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,920
that Aunt really hates His Majesty.

704
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,480
That's even stranger.

705
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,600
Since Qi Yan ascended to the throne,

706
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,560
he valued her and Cheng Huaizhi a lot.

707
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,600
I'm really confused now.

708
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,120
Unless

709
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,000
this is the reason.

710
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,240
Like Zheng Wu and Han Yue,

711
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,040
she has a feud with the imperial family.

712
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,880
That's why she'd rather

713
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,640
help Qiu Ziliang fight against Qi Yan.

714
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,040
Did I ever tell you

715
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,880
that I entered the palace
eight years ago?

716
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,840
I know.

717
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,400
I read

718
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,120
everyone's resume in the Violet Bureau,

719
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,600
especially yours.

720
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,120
Did the resume mention

721
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,320
that I was sick when I entered
the palace?

722
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,000
I don't remember

723
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,440
any of my childhood memories.

724
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,600
You mean

725
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,600
Cheng Xi's betrayal

726
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,440
is related to your identity?

727
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,920
Perhaps.

728
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,920
I didn't want to investigate before

729
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,400
because I thought

730
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,440
that it must be

731
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,480
a terrible experience.

732
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,240
But now,

733
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,160
I want you to help me
investigate myself,

734
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,120
Aunt,

735
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,760
and Right Minister's identities.

736
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,960
I won't let you help me for nothing.

737
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,040
What can you repay me with?

738
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,000
Three things.

739
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,880
After you find out the truth,

740
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,600
I'll do three things for you.

741
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,320
And

742
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,720
you're already investigating
Right Minister anyway,

743
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,640
aren't you?

744
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,040
How do you know?

745
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,640
How can

746
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,280
someone like you tolerate

747
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,960
another person in Chess of Generals Camp

748
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,840
having the same level as you

749
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,040
and even

750
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,520
above you?

751
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,320
Very good.

752
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,880
You're already starting

753
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,000
to understand me a bit.

754
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,280
Then

755
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,720
are we working together or not?

756
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,120
It's a deal.

757
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:33,741
♪Life is a dream,
how long do happy times last♪

758
00:44:37,581 --> 00:44:45,021
♪In the windy rain,
