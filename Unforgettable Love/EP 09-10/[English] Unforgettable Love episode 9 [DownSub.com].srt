Unforgettable Love

2
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,440
Shenghuai is sick,

3
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,400
not me.

4
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,480
It's your mistake.

5
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,310
Be careful.

6
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,190
Qin Yiyue

7
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,000
Don't touch me.

8
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,190
My legs...

9
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,880
I have checked.

10
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,750
It's a ligament strain.

11
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,710
There is no fracture.

12
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,229
If you want to recover,

13
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,400
it's better to rest a bit more

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,190
after the bandage is applied.

15
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,270
Xiaoyue, how do you get hurt like this?

16
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,440
Change the doctor.

17
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,360
If you think I'm not good enough,

18
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,039
can you?

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,480
If you want to help,

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,360
please go out.

21
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,840
Zhou Ziyang is an orthopedic doctor.

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,110
You should trust

23
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,360
our expertise as doctors,

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,150
okay?

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,270
Is there a fracture?

26
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,630
No.

27
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,840
It's a ligament strain

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
and sprained ankle.

29
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,230
Stick with the medication for two to three weeks

30
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,920
and you'll recover.

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,560
Take your time.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,440
All right, Dr. Zhou.

33
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,520
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,790
It seems that I owe you an explanation.

35
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,670
It's all over.

36
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,000
Is he good to you?

37
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,360
Zhou Ziyang

38
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,400
It's over

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
between the two of us.

40
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,960
You don't have to pretend

41
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,360
to care about me.

42
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,840
I don't need it.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,040
Yes.

44
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,560
You're right.

45
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,630
Well.

46
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,590
I can do it myself.

47
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,310
Please

48
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,270
bring the crutches over.

49
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,079
I'm coming.

50
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,590
No need.

51
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,960
Let's go home.

52
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,110
I can do it myself.

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
If you really could,

54
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,790
you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

55
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,710
Wait for me.

56
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,710
You'd better put me down.

57
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,440
If you don't want to fall again,

58
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,230
just hold me tight.

59
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,230
What has happened to

60
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,110
Mr. and Mrs. He?

61
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,000
But it doesn't seem

62
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,480
to be a good thing this time.

63
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,270
Really? Let's hear it.

64
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,880
A netizen named Sheng Huai Ma Ma

65
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,880
posted a Weibo accusing Dr. Qin of misdiagnosis.

66
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,310
She said she spent her days

67
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,520
indulging in being Mrs. He.

68
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,310
And she said she was addicted to being on the hot search.

69
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
She said that she

70
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,710
had no ethics as a doctor.

71
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,920
Said she neglected her duties.

72
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,190
There were also

73
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,670
personal attacks on the patient's family.

74
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,000
Leaving patients

75
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,270
without

76
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,230
reasonable access to care.

77
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,880
shirking her responsibility

78
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,080
and saying the patient's family was mentally unhealthy.

79
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
I knew about it.

80
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,960
Qin Yiyue did well.

81
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,360
It was the family that overreacted.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,670
If it is an ordinary doctor-patient conflict,

83
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,560
so be it.

84
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,310
But sister-in-law's status

85
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,480
is too special now.

86
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,310
So the matter

87
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,560
is instantly brought into the spotlight.

88
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,000
Is it serious?

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,880
I will inform the PR and legal team.

90
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,750
It's bad.

91
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Someone live-streams

92
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,590
that the hospital is now surrounded

93
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,270
by people at the entrance.

94
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,840
Where is my sister-in-law now?

95
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,230
She's at home with a leg injury.

96
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,960
Can you tell me

97
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,670
what happened at that time?

98
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,880
She scribbled medical records.

99
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,230
What medical records?

100
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,750
You see, I'm normal, right?

101
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,750
Right?

102
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,310
I, Qin Yiyue,

103
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,040
am so strong.

104
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,440
I can!

105
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,520
When did it happen?

106
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,360
Just a few days ago.

107
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,630
Anyway, this doctor is particularly bad.

108
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,840
The hospital is still protecting her.

109
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,560
We can only rely on postings and videos.

110
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
That's Shenghuai's mother.

111
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,110
Why is she here?

112
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,880
Qin Yiyue.

113
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,110
Here she is.

114
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,840
Go go go.

115
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
C'mon. It's me.

116
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,920
Ning Fang, what's wrong?

117
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,440
You

118
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,670
end up as a cat's paw for others again.

119
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,590
Get in the car quickly.

120
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,480
Come on.

121
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,190
I'm not quite sure of

122
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,440
the details.

123
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,560
It's hard to say.

124
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,750
This case

125
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,360
had previously been

126
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,790
the responsibility of Dr. Qin.

127
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,150
The patient is a child

128
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,110
with a severe psychological disorder.

129
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,790
Dr. Qin previously treated the patient for six months,

130
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,080
but the patient did not recover.

131
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,960
Of course this cannot exactly be said to be

132
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,710
a problem of Dr. Qin's ability.

133
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,360
As you know,

134
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,190
she has a lot of personal life.

135
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,630
That distracts her a lot.

136
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,400
It will inevitably affect the quality of work.

137
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,150
As her colleague and schoolmate,

138
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,590
I've known her for so many years.

139
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,590
I believe in her.

140
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,560
Oh, my God.

141
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,080
Can she shut up?

142
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,480
It's just adding fuel to the fire.

143
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,040
Don't look.

144
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,790
Forget it. Don't be angry.

145
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,670
Let her go.

146
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,840
Anyway, I have a clear conscience.

147
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,080
I hear from Xiaoan.

148
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,710
Did she call a group of We Media

149
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,590
to the hospital to block you?

150
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,710
Fortunately,

151
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,520
Ning Fang appeared.

152
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,230
Or

153
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,440
I'd be getting gangbanged right now.

154
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,230
Is that so?

155
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,710
Don't go out alone

156
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,360
these days.

157
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,080
Wherever you go,

158
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,590
I'll be with you, okay?

159
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,840
You'll be with me?

160
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,750
Are you the pendant on my bag?

161
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,440
Yes.

162
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,630
You can use me

163
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,920
as your amulet,

164
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,750
pepper spray and the bear pendant.

165
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,840
Anyway, everything is fine.

166
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,710
As long as you're safe.

167
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,670
You're right.

168
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
I think it should be...

169
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,880
Are you angry that others slander me?

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,920
I'll make you a pot of tea.

171
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,790
Take your time.

172
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,520
I'd like jasmine tea.

173
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,230
OK.

174
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,150
Many products

175
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,440
are quite expensive

176
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,560
due to R&D costs.

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,110
In addition, the promotion of infrastructure cannot be mass-produced.

178
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,630
The result is that the willingness to use is not strong.

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,710
The company still has to be able to

180
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,880
prove to consumers

181
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,510
that these devices

182
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,920
are worth their money.

183
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,550
So do you have any questions?

184
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,550
I'm sorry.

185
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,920
Let's end it for today.

186
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,600
Sorry.

187
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,470
Sorry.

188
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,000
Inform the PR team

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,720
to think of

190
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,840
a response immediately.

191
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,679
Stop all the other work.

192
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:37,960
Stop all the other work.

193
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,309
Well.

194
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,799
They are already in a meeting.

195
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,760
I don't want a meeting.

196
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,000
I want results.

197
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,549
Well.

198
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,150
In addition, notify the legal department

199
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,350
to have all of them prepare

200
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,550
materials to sue.

201
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,600
Yang Shenghuai's mother

202
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,680
for malicious defamation

203
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,390
and all the We Media accounts

204
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,270
that spread false statements.

205
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,840
In addition,

206
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,110
in my name,

207
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,960
draw up a statement.

208
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,720
Well.

209
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,430
Mr. He.

210
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,720
The Emmonds Group Jackson team

211
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
came over from the United States.

212
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,880
Will our meeting continue?

213
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,470
Delay.

214
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,960
But this meeting

215
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,110
was already scheduled last month.

216
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,000
It is crucial.

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,390
It is related to

218
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,390
the third quarter of our group...

219
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,760
I've already said it.

220
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,150
I don't want to say it a third time.

221
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,110
I've been with you for so many years.

222
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,080
You never postpone

223
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,350
a meeting that has already been planned.

224
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,960
Ten minutes have passed.

225
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,430
Where is my wife?

226
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,000
She was photographed

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,510
being driven away by a man in front of the hospital.

228
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,840
By now she should

229
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,150
have been safely returned to her home.

230
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,960
Mr. He

231
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,880
You must have misunderstood me.

232
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,150
Why sue me?

233
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,550
It's all interpreted out of context by the media.

234
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,190
I.

235
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,190
I didn't know that would happen.

236
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,110
I don't come here

237
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,190
to hear you say that.

238
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,550
I'm just relaying

239
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,510
the hospital's decision to you.

240
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,720
Your remarks

241
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,920
are the source of the slander

242
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,390
of Yang Shenghuai's mother.

243
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,430
We have filed a lawsuit.

244
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,040
The next thing she will face

245
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,550
will also be the punishment of the law.

246
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,800
He Qiaoyan

247
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
You've got the wrong person.

248
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,230
What does this matter

249
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,390
have to do with Ye Qing?

250
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,680
You make her quit.

251
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,040
You even fire her.

252
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,270
You're going to sue her now.

253
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,190
You are too overbearing, aren't you?

254
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,390
There is no you talk of.

255
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,310
You...

256
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,840
First,

257
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,680
all of the hospital's decisions about Ye Qing

258
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,310
are not caused by me.

259
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,550
Second,

260
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,080
Dr. Ye's inappropriate comments

261
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,000
have caused

262
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,110
great negative impact and damage to the hospital.

263
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,230
The hospital could have punished her.

264
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,960
It has nothing to do with me.

265
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,880
Third,

266
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,190
Yang Shenghuai is Dr. Qin's patient.

267
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,510
Dr. Ye did not follow up.

268
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,640
What qualification does she have to judge

269
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,960
Dr. Qin's practice?

270
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,080
Do you think punishing Ye Qing

271
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,720
can save Qin Yiyue?

272
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,080
It's already happened.

273
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,600
No matter what the result is.

274
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
It is

275
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,920
a fatal blow

276
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
to the career of any doctor.

277
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,880
No matter

278
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,960
what it is,

279
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,390
I will solve it for her.

280
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,720
In addition,

281
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,080
my wife cannot

282
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,800
get even with you.

283
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,270
But I can't

284
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,960
let you guys bully her.

285
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,510
I'm coming.

286
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,880
Mr. He, are you here again?

287
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,000
I've been miserable enough these days.

288
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,390
Go out and let me have a rest.

289
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,880
This wouldn't have happened

290
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,040
if you had just stayed home

291
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,640
and let the driver pick you up.

292
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,720
I don't go back.

293
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,600
What about Xiaobao?

294
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,190
It's okay if you don't go back.

295
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,720
I'll bring Xiaobao.

296
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,150
But why haven't you

297
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,600
changed your water purification system

298
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,600
here?

299
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,350
No fire protection.

300
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,190
The electrical appliances are right next to the sink.

301
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,310
There is a risk of electric shock.

302
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,920
Why are vegetables not sealed?

303
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,880
Why aren't these bottles and jars

304
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,000
covered?

305
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,150
What's this?

306
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,550
Homemade substandard product.

307
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,510
Substandard product?

308
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,040
This is the pickle made by my mom.

309
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,430
Do you understand pickles?

310
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,550
What's that?

311
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,350
Do you just put cockroach medicine

312
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,960
on the windowsill like that?

313
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,110
How do you make sure

314
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,920
that when you open the window for ventilation,

315
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,390
the powder will not be blown down into the food

316
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,720
because it is dispersed?

317
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,000
So don't breathe when you go to the bathroom.

318
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,390
If you breathe,

319
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,840
those volatile molecules of excrement

320
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,350
floating in the air

321
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,230
are all sucked in by you.

322
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,510
You're right.

323
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,680
Just to remind you.

324
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,840
So install a fresh air system

325
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,680
in the bathroom, right?

326
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,720
In summary,

327
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,230
this place

328
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,080
is a serious safety hazard.

329
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,430
As the guardian of Xiaobao,

330
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,270
I can't let him stay here.

331
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,390
If you have to let him

332
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,640
stay here by force,

333
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
I can sue you.

334
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,350
You threaten me?

335
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,680
Not really.

336
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,920
I just don't want you

337
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,350
to double your debt.

338
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,080
Don't you love to reason?

339
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,510
Contract

340
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,270
is the most powerful reasoning.

341
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,350
OK.

342
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,600
In that case, Mr. He, goodbye.

343
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,640
You need to go back with me, too.

344
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,150
Xiaobao needs

345
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,600
your care as a psychiatrist.

346
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,550
Also

347
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,470
if any accident happens to him

348
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,230
because of your negligence,

349
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,000
you need to

350
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,190
bear all the consequences caused.

351
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,880
Please

352
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,150
look at my legs.

353
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,550
I'm hurt.

354
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,000
I need to rest.

355
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,390
I advise you to be kind.

356
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,960
You're right. You need to rest.

357
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,760
It just so happens

358
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,470
that your job doesn't require you to go out.

359
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,880
The Mrs Liu and I

360
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,960
can take care of you 24/7.

361
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,230
Five times the salary for sick work.

362
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,350
By the way,

363
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,190
shorten the contract period.

364
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,920
Deal.

365
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,150
You're pushing my foot.

366
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,880
I'm sorry.

367
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,040
Really five times, Mr. He?

368
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,470
Mr. He

369
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,350
Please

370
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,600
You have only one leg injured.

371
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,640
It's such a short walk,

372
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,800
you can just jump over

373
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,190
with your other leg.

374
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,390
Come here.

375
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,840
What can I do for you?

376
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,310
Use one leg, right?

377
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,960
OK.

378
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,350
Then you carry me.

379
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,310
Impossible.

380
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,960
Didn't you say

381
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,110
to use one leg?

382
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,110
Carry me up.

383
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,760
Have you

384
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,430
been eating a lot lately?

385
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,430
Care your head.

386
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,390
And shoes.

387
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,190
I've done so much,

388
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,470
should that be enough?

389
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,920
I have prepared a supplementary agreement

390
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,760
specifically for special cases.

391
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,550
It is mainly for

392
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,080
this situation today.

393
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
No more unauthorized runaways

394
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,880
will be allowed.

395
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,390
Otherwise, it will be regarded as a breach of contract.

396
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,040
You will be required

397
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,150
to pay thirty percent of your salary

398
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,310
as liquidated damages.

399
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:11,880
In addition,

400
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,270
You are also required to pay liquidated damages

401
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,550
if you terminate your contract

402
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,310
without permission before it expires.

403
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,920
I won't sign this contract.

404
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,470
This homecoming is temporary.

405
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,080
I didn't really intend to stay.

406
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,430
I'm also considering

407
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,000
other job opportunities.

408
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,840
And

409
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,960
I already have a new intention.

410
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,920
Which company

411
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,310
would pay and treat you

412
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,390
so well?

413
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,310
I have already made an agreement with Ning Fang.

414
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,920
When my foot recovers,

415
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,470
I'll go to him for part-time work.

416
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,470
As for you.

417
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,880
Whether I can stay or not

418
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,000
depends on your performance.

419
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,000
Depend on my performance?

420
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,230
I'm going back to my room to sleep.

421
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,760
Sure.

422
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,270
What's the matter?

423
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,310
My hands are shaky

424
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,599
after pushing the wheelchair all day.

425
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
I can't pick up a storybook

426
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,720
to tell Xiaobao a story.

427
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,310
Do you think

428
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,680
Xiaobao will worry about me?

429
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,470
Do you think someone

430
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,800
will want to take care of me?

431
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,760
I think so.

432
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,190
Well.

433
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,550
I'll buy you

434
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,760
an electric wheelchair tomorrow.

435
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,680
That's no safe.

436
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,640
If I have

437
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,680
another accident,

438
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,000
what will Xiaobao do?

439
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,310
Let's go.

440
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,080
Well.

441
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,190
You did it?

442
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,800
Your love skills

443
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,470
have finally made epic progress.

444
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,920
But she

445
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,880
still wants to quit.

446
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
She said the final decision

447
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,150
depends on my performance.

448
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,550
Remember, no matter what she says,

449
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,800
you must obey absolutely.

450
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,110
How can cooperation

451
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,960
be absolute obedience?

452
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,190
But you two

453
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,880
are so unusual.

454
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,680
You can't do things by common sense.

455
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,920
All in all, remember.

456
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,040
A woman who says no means yes.

457
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,310
A woman said nothing is something big happened.

458
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,270
Women speak one way

459
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,800
and think another.

460
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,150
Come on

461
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,350
for a new day.

462
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,800
Come on.

463
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,800
This is a small difficulty.

464
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,230
It would be nice

465
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,840
to have Ruowei around at this time.

466
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,040
It's all He Qiaoyan's fault

467
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,640
for having to let me come back.

468
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,920
I just can't believe I can't do it.

469
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm changing.

470
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,840
What are you doing?

471
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,000
Don't you need help?

472
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,800
I don't need it.

473
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,760
Well.

474
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,150
All in all, remember.

475
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,230
A woman who says no means yes.

476
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,680
I'm not trying to help.

477
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,270
I'm just heartbroken

478
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,720
about this custom crystal glass.

479
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,640
Luckily it's not broken.

480
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,550
Here you are.

481
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,960
Get out.

482
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,430
Well.

483
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,110
Are you sure you don't want me

484
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,350
to help you change your clothes?

485
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,600
Wait.

486
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,470
After I finish changing my clothes later,

487
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,840
please

488
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,720
help me into the wheelchair.

489
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:04,840
Well.

490
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,470
I haven't changed it yet.

491
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,430
Take your time.

492
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,390
A woman who says no means yes.

493
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,470
A woman said nothing is something big happened.

494
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
Women speak one way

495
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,230
and think another.

496
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,110
It turns out

497
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,390
that women's logic is really like this.

498
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,270
Why should we be blamed?

499
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,680
What's going on?

500
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,150
Mr. Wen

501
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,000
Wen is inexplicable.

502
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,680
What's going on?

503
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,350
Aren't they Mr. Wen's four attractive ladies?

504
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,640
Secretary Yang

505
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,760
these ladies

506
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,600
were fired.

507
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,800
Again?

508
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,390
You'll never guess

509
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,230
who fired them off this time.

510
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,040
Director Wen?

511
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,040
It's Mr. Wen.

512
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,110
Mr. Wen?

513
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,600
Why?

514
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,640
Who knows?

515
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,960
Maybe he got tired of them.

516
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,800
Maybe

517
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000
there will be four more tomorrow.

518
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,550
No, eight attractive ladies.

519
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,800
It's none of our business anyway.

520
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,720
Work hard.

521
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,640
Mr. He

522
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,350
The car is ready.

523
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,430
Today's dinner

524
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,800
is at Director Lin's clubhouse.

525
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,840
Okay, just a minute.

526
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,800
We meet

527
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,150
at the supermarket near our home after work.

528
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,640
Let's buy some food

529
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,920
and cook for dinner at home.

530
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:30,880
Later you go to the supermarket

531
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,350
to buy some food.

532
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,680
My wife is going to cook at home.

533
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,270
Well.

534
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,550
It's a family activity.

535
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,800
Don't throw it to others.

536
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,190
Be sure to be there in person.

537
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,510
Let's change the plan.

538
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,150
Cancel the dinner with Director Lin.

539
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,040
Take me home, I will stay with my wife.

540
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,640
Well.

541
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,640
Xiaobao

542
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,550
Stop.

543
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,230
Wait.

544
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:06,960
That's it.

545
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,880
Tonight I'm going to buy some food

546
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,110
and make something delicious.

547
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,230
I want to prove to Xiaobao

548
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,640
that I can not only make

549
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,960
stinky snails rice noodles,

550
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,840
but also aromatic

551
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,760
and exquisite meals.

552
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,600
This is what Xiaobao likes to eat.

553
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,110
Xiaobao, here you are.

554
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Stop.

555
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,390
This one.

556
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,000
Snacks contain

557
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,470
a lot of additives.

558
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,640
I said before

559
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,550
that you can't eat.

560
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Snacks are okay

561
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,040
to eat once in a while.

562
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,080
We'll pick up

563
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,350
some

564
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,000
children's food later.

565
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,600
Snacks are junk food.

566
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
You gain nothing...

567
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,800
Look at this.

568
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,880
This is

569
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,960
a very tasty

570
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,920
cookie.

571
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,720
Right?

572
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,190
And this can also be used to fill toys

573
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,350
after eating.

574
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,190
Right?

575
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,350
Crayfish.

576
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,230
Look.

577
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,310
This is delicious, too.

578
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,840
Do you want to eat this?

579
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,080
I'll pay.

580
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,430
Mr. He

581
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,040
I know what you think.

582
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,600
Snack is not eaten every day

583
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,550
and every meal.

584
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,600
It's okay to have a little snack

585
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,310
once in a while to have fun.

586
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,470
Think about Ultraman.

587
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,230
You can't deprive children

588
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,510
of the joy they deserve.

589
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,080
Right?

590
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,230
Xiaobao

591
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,800
Let me know what else you want to eat.

592
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,080
Here you are.

593
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,680
This is my favorite.

594
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,390
Today only.

595
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,000
Xiaobao, do you hear that?

596
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,720
Your dad says

597
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,640
every Friday

598
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
will be a snack party.

599
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,080
Let's

600
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,920
thank him.

601
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:52,960
Let's go, Mr. He.

602
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,000
Let's go over there and have a look.

603
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,640
Hot Pot?

604
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,430
Didn't you say you were going to cook yourself today

605
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,550
in proving your ability?

606
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,960
Mr. He

607
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,000
Just eat what you can.

608
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,840
I'm just

609
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,550
too tired today.

610
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,920
I'm tired of washing.

611
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,190
This is family hotpot.

612
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,190
It's self-help.

613
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,430
Did you

614
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,720
wash it clean?

615
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,000
Is it absolutely safe to put raw ones in the pot

616
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,270
together with cooked ones?

617
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:28,960
And

618
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,230
after eating,

619
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,550
how to remove the smell of this room?

620
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,430
Xiaobao, let's eat.

621
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,190
Is it hot?

622
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,040
You can't eat spicy today.

623
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,920
Eat this.

624
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,640
Put it down.

625
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,390
You can only drink hot water today.

626
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,080
Thank you.

627
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,720
Have a good meal.

628
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,800
My God.

629
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,720
How come

630
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
there are so many girls' backs?

631
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,150
They are not the same person.

632
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,720
He Qiaoyan is not a pervert,

633
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,150
right?

634
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,430
Mommy

635
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:09,840
Mommy

636
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,550
I found it. I'm coming.

637
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,880
Shall we draw a planet here?

638
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,080
Great.

639
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,270
Draw.

640
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,760
Color it.

641
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,000
You need to color it.

642
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,600
This one.

643
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:41,640
And this one.

644
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,310
What are you drawing?

645
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,880
You are back.

646
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,720
Work. Look.

647
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,550
The ones behind this

648
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,680
are all the works

649
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,510
we finished today.

650
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,390
And this one.

651
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,600
Look what it looks like?

652
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,000
Colorful ham.

653
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,310
You're a ham.

654
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,880
This is the space world.

655
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,230
All these colorful ones

656
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,510
are large and small planets.

657
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,960
Xiaobao said he would take me

658
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,150
on a trip to the solar system

659
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,680
and to Mars.

660
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Look if the Martians

661
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,720
look exactly

662
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,800
like us.

663
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,190
Mars is good.

664
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
But do you know that

665
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,150
with the current technology

666
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,960
it needs cost $10 billion

667
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,720
to build a Mars vehicle?

668
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,720
If it is too expensive to go to Mars,

669
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,760
we can also

670
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,150
go to the moon.

671
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,960
See what Wu Gang and Chang'e's home

672
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,350
actually looks like.

673
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,110
A trip to the moon is also good.

674
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,550
But

675
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,110
do you know

676
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,600
that a ticket for a spaceship

677
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,190
needs cost

678
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
$75 million?

679
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
Also the sun we see on Earth

680
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,680
is yellow.

681
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,310
But it should be white.

682
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,000
The colors we see

683
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,190
are just

684
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,230
the colors filtered by the sunlight

685
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,470
passing through the atmosphere.

686
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,150
Xiaobao

687
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,720
We don't have to listen to your dad.

688
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,310
Some one

689
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,080
is just talk anyway.

690
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,720
If he were to do it himself,

691
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,800
he wouldn't be able to do anything.

692
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,920
There should be no one else in this family.

693
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,270
Someone is definitely not talking about me.

694
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,800
Mr. He, do you know

695
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,390
there is a saying.

696
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,550
What you hear about may be false; what you see is true.

697
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,430
Done.

698
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,310
Xiaobao, does this look good?

699
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,150
Let's give dad applause,

700
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:51,960
shall we?

701
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,190
Xiaobao

702
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,080
You're interested in the solar system.

703
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,720
In the future,

704
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,760
if you have any questions

705
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,510
about the solar system,

706
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,760
you can ask your dad.

707
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,040
Your dad is excellent.

708
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,230
Tell me which one you would like to know about?

709
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,720
This one?

710
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,310
This is called Jupiter.

711
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,000
It is the largest

712
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,840
of the eight planets in the solar system

713
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,190
and has the fastest rotation speed.

714
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,390
It ranks fifth

715
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,600
in distance from the sun.

716
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,920
Although it is the largest in size

717
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,720
in the solar system,

718
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,640
the masses of the other seven planets

719
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,430
are added together

720
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,550
and multiplied by two and a half

721
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,800
to make the mass of Jupiter.

722
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,040
Do you get it?

723
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,080
Do you get it?

724
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,430
This

725
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,430
You have to let your mother tell you this.

726
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,310
Why is the hair so dirty?

727
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,270
Is it running out?

728
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,000
Why can't I press it out?

729
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,040
Dr. Qin, wait a minute.

730
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,190
That should be prickly heat powder.

731
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,720
Do you have rash in your hair?

732
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,760
I didn't wash my hair.

733
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,310
The wash free spray is also running out.

734
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,720
I can only use prickly heat powder.

735
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,350
It can barely work.

736
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,680
I haven't washed my hair for three days.

737
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,230
No one can help me.

738
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,640
Do you need help?

739
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,270
Who can I ask for help, Xiaobao?

740
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,350
Whatever.

741
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,000
I can tolerate it.

742
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,270
Well.

743
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,880
Women speak one way and think another.

744
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,430
Come with me.

745
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,470
Go.

746
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,720
I don't expect him to do well.

747
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,429
Don't leave.

748
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:49,040
Come on.

749
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,960
Let's say goodbye to dad together.

750
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
I'm going to work.

751
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,760
You should kiss mommy before going out.

752
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,080
Who said that?

753
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,600
This is a sweet habit

754
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,000
of my older brother and sister-in-law.

755
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,000
Well.

756
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,550
Don't be serious.

757
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,600
You can relax.

758
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,640
I'm not interested in

759
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,720
the fried leek dumplings you've eaten.

760
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,190
You don't understand its deliciousness.

761
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,800
By the way

762
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,680
today Ma Fada will bring the lawyer

763
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,350
to the home.

764
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,350
He will ask you some questions.

765
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,510
I tell you first.

766
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,190
Then I'll go to work.

767
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,350
I'm leaving.

768
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,470
Take care of yourself.

769
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,550
Say goodbye to dad.

770
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,960
What's the meaning of this?

771
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,080
Mrs. He

772
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,470
This is the evidence

773
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,640
we have gathered so far.

774
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,640
We also need your complements.

775
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,350
We can file the lawsuit

776
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,230
against Yang Shenghuai's mother this week.

777
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,390
Lawsuit?

778
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,150
Yes.

779
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,640
Why do you sue Shenghuai's mom?

780
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,920
This is also what Mr. He wants.

781
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,040
Her

782
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,190
slander

783
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,040
and attacks on you

784
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,390
have done you harm.

785
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,430
Also the injury to your leg

786
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:45,960
is caused

787
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,390
by her intentional injury.

788
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,510
Is this what He Qiaoyan thinks?

789
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,680
Yes, Mr. He wants to protect you.

790
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,470
He called the company's legal department

791
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,960
to respond to the matter

792
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,470
on the very day it happened.

793
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,510
Mr. Ma, Mr. lawyer

794
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,760
Please go back.

795
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,720
I personally don't plan to

796
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,040
sue Shenghuai's mother.

797
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,680
Mrs. He

798
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,080
This is what Mr. He means.

799
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,640
We also...

800
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,800
I'll talk to him.

801
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,230
I am the person concerned.

802
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,150
I have the decision.

803
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,720
Please go back.

804
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,510
All right, Mrs. He.

805
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,430
We go first.

806
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,600
Goodbye.

807
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,230
Why did you sue Shenghuai's mother?

808
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,880
Her false accusations of disinformation against you

809
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,470
have caused damage to your reputation.

810
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,190
Shouldn't she be sued?

811
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,080
What's more, you are my employee.

812
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,110
Her malicious injury

813
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,880
caused your leg to be injured,

814
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,430
thus affecting the progress of work.

815
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
This has indirectly resulted in

816
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,800
my interests as an employer

817
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,840
being affected.

818
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,840
Shouldn't I

819
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,680
ask her to compensate?

820
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,600
Things about her

821
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,720
have passed.

822
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,920
I don't blame her.

823
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,230
It's not an easy life for her.

824
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,960
And

825
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,430
are you aware of

826
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,110
the impact your prosecution

827
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,510
will have on her life?

828
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,760
Sit down.

829
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,470
Why should I listen to you?

830
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,800
That's the price she should pay.

831
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,430
Everyone should

832
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,840
be responsible for what he/she says or does.
