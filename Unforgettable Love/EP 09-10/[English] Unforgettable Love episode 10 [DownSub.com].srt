Unforgettable Love
EP10

2
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,150
Sheng Huai's parents are divorced.

3
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,560
His mother is raising the child by herself.

4
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,960
It's very stressful.

5
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,440
She was defensive and prejudiced against me.

6
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,960
As a psychologist,

7
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,230
I can understand.

8
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,400
And these things

9
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,440
are within my range.

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,110
And,

11
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,400
every patient and their relatives

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,360
are my friends and family.

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,190
The child's psychology is fragile,

14
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,750
but parents' are more fragile than they are.

15
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,560
It's my duty to protect them.

16
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,789
So please drop the case.

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,840
Feelings and principles

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,920
are separate.

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,229
If you frame someone up, you should apologize,

20
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,039
and if you hurt someone, you should pay for it.

21
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,039
This is a natural truth.

22
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,190
How can you

23
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,479
be so inflexible

24
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,840
and unreasonable?

25
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,789
Dr. Qin,

26
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,310
I think you're

27
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,360
being sentimental.

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,479
I have started to

29
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,479
implement it.

30
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,920
If nothing happens,

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,670
please come back.

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
You should know that

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,560
it is your duty to

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,110
take care of Xiaobao

35
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,400
and not to leave without permission.

36
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,880
I don't want to stay any longer

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,480
in your cold office.

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,520
Take care.

39
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,190
Good-bye.

40
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,750
Hold on to your crutch.

41
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,440
Leave me alone.

42
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,710
Didn't you just say

43
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,480
you didn't want to stay here any longer?

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,790
It's been a minute

45
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,079
and you still haven't left.

46
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,400
You shut up!

47
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,310
Stop talking.

48
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,150
I'm at my wit's end.

49
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,750
Sit down in this chair.

50
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,400
I told you to

51
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,750
leave me alone.

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,880
It's not up to you.

53
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,560
You, I, I...

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,080
Hello, Mr. Wen.

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,360
Yang Ruowei,

56
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,000
Compensation for my emotional loss.

57
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,920
I don't know what you mean.

58
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,920
It's because of you that

59
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,110
I'm getting misogyny.

60
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,840
Does this matter concern me?

61
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,710
I've completed

62
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,310
all the tasks you gave me perfectly.

63
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,630
Don't forget

64
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,310
that I still have

65
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,630
someone's secret in my mind.

66
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,960
You're endless, aren't you?

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,590
Do you think I'm really afraid of you?

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,400
You can talk about it to others.

69
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,560
Let's go.

70
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,080
Say it, or you are coward.

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,880
You're a girl.

72
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,670
Why don't you care about

73
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,880
your reputation?

74
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,840
Say it or not?

75
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,190
Don't say it, do you?

76
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,670
All right, I say.

77
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:16,790
I...

78
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,920
No, no, no, no.

79
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,630
Go, go, go.

80
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,790
Xiaobao,

81
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,150
it's time to read.

82
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,670
Last week, we have read

83
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,880
Einstein Papers.

84
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
This week we'll read

85
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Galileo's

86
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,790
dialogue on the two world systems

87
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,400
of Ptolemy and Copernicus.

88
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
What's that?

89
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,590
Whose dialogue?

90
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,230
Ptolemy and Copernicus.

91
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,230
They are the father of physics.

92
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,960
Galileo's classic works

93
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
popularized the

94
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,270
heliocentric theory in the form of dialogue.

95
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,080
This is a basic physics reading.

96
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,920
After my selection,

97
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,710
I selected the most suitable one for Xiaobao's

98
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,880
advanced reading.

99
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,920
Xiaobao, can you understand it?

100
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,520
Xiaobao, look at my books.

101
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,230
I've got some good books.

102
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,040
I bought a whole series at once.

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,040
There are not only picture books,

104
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,750
but also picture guessing.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
And,

106
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,190
there is also a game to develop intelligence.

107
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,440
These readings are too young for him.

108
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,190
His reading lists

109
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,150
were carefully chosen by me.

110
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,310
That's why he has

111
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,440
more knowledge than peers.

112
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,440
That you imposed on him.

113
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,840
Children should read books

114
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,080
appropriate to their age.

115
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,480
These books,

116
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
both on illustration design

117
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,440
and the plot sense,

118
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,040
are the work of

119
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,560
countless child psychologists

120
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
and education experts.

121
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,150
I've done

122
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,150
research before.

123
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,630
Don't use your IQ

124
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,190
to measure

125
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,630
the child of mine.

126
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,360
Xiaobao,

127
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,080
let's play a game together.

128
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,310
Let's see who finds it first.

129
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,750
Book.

130
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
Boring.

131
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,630
Book...

132
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,190
Book...

133
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,270
Where is it in this book?

134
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,400
Have you found it?

135
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,750
Not this one. This one is a calendar.

136
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,400
Here it is.

137
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,840
How does it hide here?

138
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,630
Xiaobao,

139
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,960
let's look for the snail.

140
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,920
Where is the snail?

141
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,670
It's here.

142
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,750
Then you can find where the love is.

143
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,560
Where is love?

144
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,360
Here.

145
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,710
Did you see it before?

146
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,270
We should look for the hardest things.

147
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,590
Can you find

148
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,520
where the hat is?

149
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,360
Wrist watch.

150
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,150
These books are not interesting.

151
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,920
Xiaobao, let's take a look at this one.

152
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,960
Drawing.

153
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,560
You guys have fun.

154
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,630
Xiaobao, draw it by yourself.

155
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,560
Why is he so intelligent?

156
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,630
I get angry when I see him.

157
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,150
I'll go out

158
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,110
after he gets into the bathroom.

159
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,710
She has trouble with her legs.

160
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,790
I should let her go to the bathroom first.

161
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,640
So as not to make her angry again.

162
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,390
Why is he still in bed?

163
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,430
It's been a long time.

164
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,000
You'd better go.

165
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Don't care,

166
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,880
I'll pretend I didn't see him.

167
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,880
I've gave you

168
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,430
a night to think it over.

169
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,920
Can you drop the case?

170
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,840
No.

171
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,230
I've thought it through.

172
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,150
I'm going to stick to the end.

173
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,230
Drop the case.

174
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Drop the case.

175
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,040
Put me down!

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,640
I told you that

177
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,430
if you don't put me down,

178
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,470
I'll be angry.

179
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,230
If you

180
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,150
don't put me down,

181
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,550
I'll

182
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,760
get you in trouble.

183
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,150
He Qiaoyan, give my stick back!

184
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,080
He Qiaoyan!

185
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,080
Xiaobao, take care of your mommy.

186
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,430
He Qiaoyan!

187
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
Don't let her get away.

188
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,600
What are you doing?

189
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,390
Mr. He's sexy picture.

190
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,270
The desire of thousands of girls.

191
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,920
I'm here to do good today

192
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,390
to help the girls realize their dreams.

193
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,430
Give the cell phone back to me.

194
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,960
Give me back.

195
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,550
He Qiaoyan!

196
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,080
My sexy pictures have been deleted.

197
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,760
Please do more meaningful things.

198
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,080
Take it.

199
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,800
I'll keep shooting.

200
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:50,920
Miss Qin,

201
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,310
do you know how heavy you are?

202
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,720
You have to lose weight.

203
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,880
Get up.

204
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,350
I dropped my crutch so I couldn't get up.

205
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,640
Get up.

206
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,510
I won't get up.

207
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,230
Get up.

208
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,430
I won't get up.

209
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:11,960
You are going to

210
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,470
lie here till dark, aren't you?

211
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,190
Anyway, if you

212
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,310
don't drop the case today,

213
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,640
I won't get up.

214
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,510
I tell you

215
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,040
if you touch me again,

216
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,270
I'll yell.

217
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,000
Mr. He. Mr...

218
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:32,960
Mr. He

219
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,080
Sheng Huai's mother is anxious to find you.

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,470
I... I can hardly stop her.

221
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,430
Got it.

222
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,920
Sorry!

223
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,720
Wait for me!

224
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,430
If you want to sue me.

225
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,600
I'm not wrong.

226
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
I can also sue

227
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,150
the Dr. Qin's misdiagnosis.

228
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,720
Whether Dr. Qin's diagnosis of you

229
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,880
is a misdiagnosis

230
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,390
will be

231
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,680
determined by

232
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,190
a professional organization.

233
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,760
I think you

234
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,080
know better than anyone else

235
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,270
whether Dr. Qin is misdiagnosed or not.

236
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,040
Do you know why

237
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,270
I haven't sued you yet?

238
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,470
It's because of Dr. Qin

239
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,110
always insisted that

240
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,600
you were

241
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,110
just acting on impulse.

242
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,310
She refused to

243
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,470
hold you responsible.

244
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,150
Though because of you,

245
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,080
she was injured

246
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,150
and on crutches,

247
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,310
she asked me not to sue you.

248
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,550
Heshi's charity foundation

249
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,350
will pay for Sheng Huai's

250
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,640
treatment and education

251
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,510
for the next 10 years.

252
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,760
In addition,

253
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,510
I'll arrange

254
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,640
a psychologist for you.

255
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,080
Sheng Huai's mother,

256
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,720
you should face up to

257
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,880
your own psychological problems.

258
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,760
At the same time, admit your mistakes.

259
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,230
Please set an example to your child.

260
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,720
Good boy.

261
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
You are reading.

262
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,150
Do you have any question?

263
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,760
Reward you with a box of yogurt.

264
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,230
Try not to eat

265
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,470
after eight p.m.

266
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,270
It's not just any yogurt,

267
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,310
but He Qiaoyan's

268
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,880
reward for helping others.

269
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,040
I'm just afraid that

270
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,920
you might run after me

271
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,000
and mess around all day.

272
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,880
It will affect your feet.

273
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,470
In addition,

274
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,350
If the injury gets more serious,

275
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,270
who will take care of Xiaobao?

276
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Never say uncle.

277
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,230
Is it that hard

278
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,310
to admit you are kind?

279
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,040
I do this

280
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,150
not because I'm kind,

281
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,350
but think what you're saying is right.

282
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,550
I should trust you.

283
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,430
I have tried

284
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,390
to do it

285
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,040
according to your principles.

286
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Not bad, it turns out.

287
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,800
I said it's okay to trust me.

288
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,680
I think

289
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,310
you are

290
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,800
getting cute now.

291
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,040
Please take a close look at

292
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,310
this month's performance appraisal.

293
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,600
Performance appraisal.

294
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,150
He Qiaoyan,

295
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,000
Did you put a

296
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
surveillance device on me?

297
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,350
Sleeping late and staying up late

298
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,080
are counted in my performance.

299
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,150
Do I have to

300
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,680
report all the meals

301
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,040
I eat at your house?

302
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,110
Fortunately, he didn't see it.

303
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,600
Or else I'll be charged again.

304
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,270
Ex-girlfriend?

305
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,080
The gossip is on me.

306
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,640
Why is my head so dizzy?

307
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,430
Are you finished?

308
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,550
I just saw that you didn't look very well.

309
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,680
Do you feel uncomfortable?

310
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,110
I'm done.

311
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,230
What's the matter with you?

312
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,430
Haven't you finished?

313
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,190
Why are you still sitting here?

314
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,080
Get up, I need to use the bathroom.

315
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,390
Qin Yiyue.

316
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,840
Qin Yiyue.

317
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,800
You are a liar.

318
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,760
I...

319
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,510
Why is my mask missing one piece?

320
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,150
Did you use it secretly?

321
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,600
You're such...

322
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,349
Are you okay?

323
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,960
Is your cold still?

324
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,109
five, four, three, two, One.

325
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,310
Time is up.

326
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,960
It's only 38 degrees Celsius.

327
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,720
Your reaction just now

328
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,390
made me think you have a fever of 40 degrees Celsius.

329
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,230
What is only 38 degrees Celsius?

330
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:35,760
Do you know

331
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,470
that a person's normal body temperature

332
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,880
should be

333
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,680
between 36.3

334
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,150
to 37.2 degrees Celsius.

335
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,110
It's relatively constant

336
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,430
and fluctuates

337
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,080
within a normal range.

338
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,550
I'm obviously not normal.

339
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,270
You are sick and still here to lecture me.

340
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,230
Set by set.

341
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,680
It doesn't matter. You'll be better after a sleep.

342
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,270
Where are you going?

343
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,000
Go to the hospital for a drip.

344
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,680
You only have a fever of 38 degrees Celsius.

345
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
Calm down, not so serious.

346
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,920
People who are sick have to see a doctor

347
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,430
and get a drip.

348
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,510
And some serious diseases

349
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,680
begin with

350
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,960
a persistent low fever.

351
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,760
I have a very important

352
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,800
meeting tomorrow.

353
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,960
I can't afford it.

354
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,000
I am here to

355
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,230
teach you the science for free.

356
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,000
Fever is

357
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,110
one of the body's

358
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,960
defenses against disease.

359
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,430
Use your own defense system

360
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,920
to keep the germs out.

361
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,430
If the body temperature does not exceed

362
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,390
38.5 degrees Celsius,

363
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,110
just use physical cooling.

364
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,840
Don't be in a hurry to

365
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,190
take antibiotics and antipyretics.

366
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,800
If the body temperature

367
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,510
persists above 38.5 degrees Celsius

368
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,880
and other complications

369
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,920
develop,

370
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,110
you can consider antibiotics

371
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,840
and hormone therapy, get it?

372
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,040
Methods of physical cooling...

373
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,880
Let me see...

374
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,840
Wait for me.

375
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Do you know how cold it is!

376
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,720
Not cold.

377
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,920
when I was a kid, I had a fever

378
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,270
and my mom put ice on my forehead.

379
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:06,840
Come on.

380
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,470
Take it away.

381
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,430
You are so effeminate; let me change another way.

382
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,430
Sweating. Sweating!

383
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,230
Really good.

384
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,800
Did you come to my house

385
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
to murder me?

386
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,510
Take it away!

387
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,920
I forgot to wring it out.

388
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,600
Have a bowl of ginger soup.

389
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,150
Is ginger soup made with cubes of ginger?

390
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,110
Shouldn't it be made of shredded ginger?

391
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,550
It doesn't matter whether it is cubes

392
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,430
or shredded ginger.

393
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,920
The soup is no difference.

394
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,800
Come and have a drink.

395
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,640
I will drink it by myself.

396
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,880
You can't drink it by yourself.

397
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,640
I'll help you.

398
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,600
You are so stupid.

399
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,720
The soup is finished.

400
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,600
All right, I'll go.

401
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,270
Wait a minute.

402
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,510
Take the bowl to the kitchen.

403
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,150
Items should be returned in time.

404
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,270
If you need service, please tap the head of the bed.

405
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,720
But I can't guarantee that

406
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,960
I can hear when I'm asleep.

407
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,720
Without you,

408
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
I would have lived a few more years.

409
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,960
Sleep!

410
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,430
Who have I offended?

411
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,430
Come on, look at this. Is this one?

412
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,230
It's just similar.

413
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,430
But not her.

414
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,600
All right.

415
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,800
It's up to you.

416
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,350
I'll keep an eye on it for you.

417
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,270
I told you,

418
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,680
in recent years

419
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,880
whenever I have encountered

420
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,350
a similar girl

421
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,680
in the street,

422
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,880
I hurriedly took out my cell phone

423
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,920
and took secretly shots.

424
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,550
Thanks to my good looks,

425
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,550
Otherwise, I would have

426
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,430
beaten up

427
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,680
as a hooligan.

428
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,800
The car you saw last time

429
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,880
is for you.

430
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm willing to take pictures for another five years.

431
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,680
No, ten years.

432
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,960
But who would have thought

433
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,430
Mr. He's first love

434
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,230
is turned out to be a

435
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,430
a girl he had never met.

436
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,470
First love? What first love?

437
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Yes,

438
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,040
you've been looking for her for five years,

439
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,000
and you can't forget her.

440
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,350
It's not only your first love,

441
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,680
but also, a strange love.

442
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,350
I just think

443
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
I should have found her.

444
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,550
But...

445
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,600
Are you really sure

446
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,550
this person exists?

447
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,470
You just

448
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,600
saw her in your dream.

449
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,230
What's more, it's just her back.

450
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,230
Are you finished?

451
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,190
You can leave.

452
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,190
I have to work.

453
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,110
When will the car you just mentioned

454
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,110
belong to me?

455
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,110
It's depends on my mood.

456
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,800
How are you feeling today?

457
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,720
Not so good. Please go.

458
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,430
Bye.

459
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,720
Good morning, Dr. Qin.

460
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,350
Good morning.

461
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,880
The fever should be gone.

462
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,800
I'll make breakfast.

463
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,880
Come back.

464
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,040
Come back.

465
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,430
Don't go.

466
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,640
Don't leave me.

467
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,350
Don't go. Don't go.

468
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,270
Don't go.

469
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,150
Don't leave me.

470
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,110
Don't go.

471
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,310
He Qiaoyan said it

472
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,190
refers to the girl in silhouette

473
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,080
or the girl in the picture.

474
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,310
How's it going? Dr. Qin

475
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,390
Are you ready?

476
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,920
Good morning, Mr. Ning

477
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,760
Everything is ready.

478
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,680
First of all, welcome

479
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,080
to join our clinic.

480
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,190
To have a

481
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,080
Child psychologist like you

482
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,110
volunteer to help us

483
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,270
is our pleasure.

484
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,880
Who says I'm voluntary?

485
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,840
I need you

486
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,110
to treat me hot pot to make it up.

487
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,150
OK, I'll

488
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,040
take all your hot pot in the future.

489
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,760
I'll take you to meet new colleagues.

490
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,230
Let's go.

491
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,640
Don't forget to meet

492
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,270
the staff of UNIFON

493
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,960
at ten a.m.

494
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,550
I've arranged assistant Yang Ruowei

495
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,680
pick you up at 9:30 a.m.

496
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,270
Yang Ruowei

497
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,110
was in partnership with my father

498
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,190
to spy on me.

499
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
Mr. Wen

500
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,960
I'm your new assistant.

501
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,110
It's only half an hour left

502
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,230
before the 10 o'clock meeting

503
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,470
with UNIFON.

504
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,230
I Know.

505
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,600
Chairman Wen specially ordered that

506
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,430
this cooperation is imperative.

507
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,110
As the VIP special product

508
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,390
of Wenshi Hotel suite.

509
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,430
The brand book has been given to you in advance.

510
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,680
UNIFON.

511
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,230
The brand of UNIFON

512
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,920
combined with the modern science and technology

513
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,000
to reproduce the culture and skills of the prosperous Tang Dynasty.

514
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,390
and create the skin care art

515
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,110
suitable for Oriental women.

516
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,040
I know that.

517
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,960
The mask in your hand

518
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,040
is the flagship product of their brand.

519
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,390
It focuses on the whitening effect of plants

520
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,720
and extracts the essence of Glycyrrhiza glabra,

521
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,960
which is as valuable as gold.

522
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,680
It's milder and gentler, right?

523
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,230
Not bad.

524
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,040
Of course.

525
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,230
The project of cross-border cooperation

526
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,390
is my idea.

527
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,680
Find ordinary people or internet celebrity

528
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,880
to take V-logs.

529
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,350
On the one hand,

530
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,760
it can record the feelings of using the mask.

531
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,270
On the other side,

532
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,390
we can give them Jinli awards to publicize the hotel.

533
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,110
Isn't that great?

534
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,840
By the way,

535
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,270
what are you doing here?

536
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,760
I'm your new assistant.

537
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,230
I beg your pardon?

538
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,720
You mean that

539
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,390
let me be Mr. Wen's assistant.

540
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,190
You can make a request.

541
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,760
Why me?

542
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,430
Because I noticed that

543
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,230
Wen Gu listens to you.

544
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,640
Eh...Chairman Wen

545
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,720
I think you may have misunderstood.

546
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,430
Mr. Wen and I

547
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,470
are not familiar.

548
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
Take it easy.

549
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,350
I don't need your explanation.

550
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,760
I don't care of the process, but the result.

551
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,110
Chairman Wen

552
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,000
what kind of results do you want?

553
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,960
Assist Wen Gu

554
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,720
and do this project well.

555
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,600
You can ask for

556
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,920
position and bonus.

557
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,470
Are you being

558
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,470
pushed to get married?

559
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,640
I'm telling you to be sober.

560
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm not interested in you.

561
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,640
What are you running for?

562
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,190
Are you afraid that you will fall in love with me?

563
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,230
I'm afraid you'll fall in love with me.

564
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,110
I'm afraid I can't get rid of you.

565
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,880
Now that we have reached a consensus.

566
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,760
It will be easy.

567
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,110
Clearing in the past.

568
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,720
From now on,

569
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,000
we will only have working relationship.

570
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:33,880
Let's go.

571
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,920
I'll attend the meeting of UNIFON by myself.

572
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,840
You don't have to follow me.

573
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,680
Isn't he just a playboy

574
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,880
with a weak hand?

575
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,110
I'm sure I can handle him.

576
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,680
Cheers

577
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,640
Mr. Wen

578
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,110
Take us

579
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,350
to your yacht in a while.

580
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,640
Have you played games recently?

581
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,550
Let me tell you that

582
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,720
I've just reached the top of the national service list.

583
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,550
Yeah, I'm great, right?

584
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,600
Miss, this way, please.

585
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,470
Come on, let's celebrate.

586
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,310
Cheers, cheers!

587
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,510
Leave her alone.

588
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,510
Keep drinking.

589
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,190
See you tomorrow, Mr. Wen

590
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,840
Are you finished?

591
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,110
Can you continue to eat with me?

592
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,430
This girl

593
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,230
is really good at picking the time.

594
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,800
Come on, celebrate me

595
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,550
to settle the big trouble.

596
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,550
I have successfully joined the new hospital.

597
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,270
By the way, and my broken leg

598
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,680
is finally healed. Cheers!

599
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,510
Cheers!

600
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,310
Sir, five more roast lamb legs please.

601
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,920
OK.

602
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,270
Five...

603
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,470
Can we finish it?

604
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,350
My leg has just healed.

605
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,510
And I firmly believe what my mother said.

606
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,720
Eat what you lack,

607
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,270
and you are what you eat.

608
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,470
Fine.

609
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,230
Sir, here

610
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,040
five more baked brains.

611
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,080
Here's a woman

612
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
who needs a brain tonic here.

613
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,880
You're the one who needs a brain tonic.

614
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,920
I'm brilliant.

615
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,720
By the way, let me show you something.

616
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,880
You see, this is his brother.

617
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,840
This is his sister-in-law.

618
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,470
Who do you think this woman is?

619
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,510
You see where she stands

620
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,000
and how close they are.

621
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,960
It should be his girlfriend

622
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,230
at the time.

623
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,080
Sure enough, this is a woman's intuition.

624
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,270
I think so, too.

625
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,310
But I haven't heard of

626
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,080
him having any intimate

627
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,110
heterosexual friends.

628
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,430
And,

629
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,230
he's never been in a relationship.

630
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,430
Do you think this person will be his

631
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,640
sister who has been anonymous for many years.

632
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,390
Are you jealous?

633
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,640
No.

634
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,000
Are you sure you don't want to know

635
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,150
anything about his past relationships?

636
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,680
Not interested.

637
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,230
That's ok.

638
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,040
Do you think

639
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,350
this woman

640
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,920
could be his classmate in primary school?

641
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,680
Impossible, impossible.

642
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,040
Absolutely impossible.

643
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,000
Primary school classmate?

644
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,510
High school classmate!

645
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,080
Oh, no way, no way.

646
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,080
It could only be his ex-girlfriend.

647
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,600
It's definitely

648
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,000
not his high school classmate.

649
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,840
Maybe he just got dumped

650
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,310
and had no face to talk the past.

651
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,040
He's unforgettable in his mind.

652
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,760
Sister,

653
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,680
You've guessed they were separated brother and sister

654
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,550
to their hidden marriage.

655
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,230
Aren't you curious?

656
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,960
Don't you want to know?

657
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,430
No,

658
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,270
I don't want to know.

659
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,150
I just want to take a taxi and go home now.

660
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,760
Boring.

661
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,080
It must be his ex-girlfriend.

662
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,350
Watch your head, ok.

663
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,880
You go back to wash and sleep.

664
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,110
Driver, be careful on the road.

665
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,040
Why does she feign indifference?

666
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,230
Obviously, she cares about him.

667
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,230
Silly girl.

668
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,550
Do you think she could be

669
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,840
the hidden boss of Heshi Group?

670
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,600
Living in overseas for many years

671
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,390
and unwilling to participate in family disputes.

672
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,720
Did you read too many novels?

673
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,230
Can we

674
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,510
change another topic?

675
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,230
I don't want to

676
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,680
discuss this.

677
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,270
You know nothing.

678
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,000
I am

679
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,469
seeking the truth for the masses,

680
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,389
and giving full play to

681
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,679
my network detective skills.

682
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,000
Let's suppose that

683
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,920
she is his ex-girlfriend.

684
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,040
Oh my God, Ruowei.

685
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,469
The imagination of netizens is so rich.

686
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,680
Oh my God, Ruowei.

687
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,080
The imagination of netizens is so rich.

688
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,720
They replenish his lover from celebrity to top.

689
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,110
I'll forward it to you.

690
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,640
Just read it

691
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,430
as a bedtime story.

692
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,040
I think I am

693
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,230
a real gossip genius.

694
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:15,800
Oh, my God.

695
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,960
Wrong. Wrong.

696
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,230
Oh, my God, Ruowei.

697
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,040
The imagination of netizens is too rich.

698
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,230
They replenish his lover from celebrity to top.

699
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,550
I'll forward it to you.

700
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,920
Just read it

701
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,110
as a bedtime story.

702
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,510
I think I am a real

703
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,040
Gossip genius.

704
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,550
Oh, my God, Ruowei.

705
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,270
The imagination of netizens is too rich.

706
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,880
They replenish his lover from celebrity to top.

707
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,880
I'll forward it to you.

708
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,230
Just read it

709
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,430
as a bedtime story.

710
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,880
Couldn't the choice of bedtime stories

711
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,470
be a little more advanced?

712
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,720
Dr. Qin.

713
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,550
Ranking results of search engine

714
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,470
have many kinds,

715
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,080
What you see is not necessarily true.

716
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,310
Does Dr. Qin really want to

717
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,680
know about my affair?

718
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,040
I didn't mean that.

719
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,110
I just...

720
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,310
I just want to know more about

721
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,390
your past.

722
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,390
It can also help Xiaobao

723
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,150
cure his illness.

724
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,510
Now that Dr. Qin

725
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,230
has seen the photos.

726
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,000
Explain it from your

727
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,960
professional point of view.

728
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,800
Photos?

729
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,150
I am not unintentional.

730
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,680
It fell out by itself.

731
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,960
And

732
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,150
didn't you say that

733
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,190
I can borrow the books

734
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,760
in your study room.

735
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,150
Please answer my question directly.

736
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,680
I don't want to know about your personal affairs.

737
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,110
I just think

738
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,760
you, in the photo,

739
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,350
are very happy.

740
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,840
You are happy

741
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,880
when you are with your family.

742
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,310
So, I want to help you

743
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,600
find your warmth.

744
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,680
It's for Xiaobao, and also for you.

745
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,150
Smile.

746
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,430
You look pretty with a smile.

747
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,430
Remember who you are.

748
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,080
Just take care of Xiaobao,

749
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,550
and don't be distracted by other things.

750
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,640
And

751
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,430
it's none of your business.

752
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,880
It doesn't pay to be the good guy.

753
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,960
Don't worry,

754
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,430
I'll only care about

755
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,920
Xiaobao.

756
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,270
It won't waste a little bit

757
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,680
to someone else.

758
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,920
Ruowei, Ruowei!

759
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,960
Did you see it?

760
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,110
I've already said that

761
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,640
don't eat on the sofa.

762
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,270
Forget it.

763
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,110
Aren't you going to think twice

764
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,150
about the Sunshine Primary School?

765
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,190
I know you're worried about

766
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,510
Xiaobao's academic performance.

767
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,720
But what he needs to do now

768
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,350
is not to be a high-achieving student.

769
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,310
Graduation rates

770
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,640
and subject education

771
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,510
are not the first considerations.

772
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,510
It's important to communicate with people

773
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,960
and make friends with others.

774
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,000
You have no idea

775
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,550
how much fun he had

776
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,640
when I took him out

777
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,840
this afternoon.

778
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,350
Ning Fang is trying his best

779
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,390
to help him.

780
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,040
There will be a group activity

781
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,190
in Sunshine Primary School tomorrow.

782
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,310
Ning Fang invited him

783
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,150
to join it.

784
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,310
to join it.

785
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,000
Tomorrow?

786
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,640
Whether you say yes or not,

787
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,080
I'm going to take him to the activity.

788
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,040
I'm not like some people

789
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,270
who break their word.

790
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,920
I've hooked up with Xiaobao

791
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,760
and said that cheating is a puppy.

792
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,390
You go.

793
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,230
Did he agree?

794
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,920
Professor Wu, this is He Qiaoyan.

795
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,270
I sent you an email last night.

796
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,230
Here's the thing.

797
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,310
I want to fund

798
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,720
a school for special children.

799
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,880
Compared with the lack of funds,

800
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,600
I need more

801
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,840
professional teachers

802
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,880
with relevant background experience.

803
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,640
I wonder if you have any

804
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,310
suitable candidates to recommend.

805
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,080
I can hire them at a high salary.

806
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,230
Well, please.
