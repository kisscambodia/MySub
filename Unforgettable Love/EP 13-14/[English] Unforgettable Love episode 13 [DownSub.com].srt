Unforgettable Love
EP13

2
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,840
Xiaowei.

3
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,190
Auntie, long time no see.

4
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,880
More and more beautiful.

5
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,710
Thank you, auntie.

6
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,479
Qiaoyan, look who's here.

7
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,150
Excuse me for a moment.

8
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,039
Long time no see, Qiaoyan.

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,840
Long time no see.

10
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,710
Qiaoyan

11
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,789
you brief Xiaowei to the situation.

12
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,789
Who is she?

13
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,310
She is

14
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,920
Miss Lin.

15
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,520
I heard that she is the founder

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,880
of the niche luxury brand

17
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
emerged two years ago

18
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,270
Vivi Lin.

19
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,080
Many celebrities

20
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,880
have recommended this brand.

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,150
What a good match!

22
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,270
They look like

23
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,590
a perfect couple.

24
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,400
They really are a perfect match.

25
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,230
Finally.

26
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,880
Good to see you, Uncle Wang.

27
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,079
So, she is the bride

28
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,310
arranged to He Qiaoyan?

29
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,960
Lin and He are family friends,

30
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,790
when the He family was in trouble

31
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,630
the Lin family provided their

32
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,000
unwavering supports

33
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,750
and offered much help.

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
They're still a major shareholder of the He family.

35
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,360
Mr. Lin's daughter,

36
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,079
do you remember her?

37
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,040
Of course.

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,840
Much taller.

39
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,360
Thank you, uncle.

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,150
I'll wait for him outside.

41
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,400
OK.

42
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,080
Why are you so careless?

43
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,920
What did I say?

44
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,790
She just can't make it.

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,270
Anniversaries of Heshi Group,

46
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,110
before she showed up,

47
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,630
have never gone wrong.

48
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,520
Please don't be mad, auntie.

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,750
She's just fallen down

50
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,000
by accident.

51
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,230
Other than that, she did well.

52
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,110
It was Lin Wei.

53
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,310
It was not someone else.

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,590
I haven't seen her for years,

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,440
and she barely asks for anything.

56
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,920
You have to be considerate.

57
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,110
I know what you mean.

58
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,590
We owes to the Lin family,

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
but it doesn't mean that

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,710
we have to

61
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,960
make compromises for everything.

62
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,150
Making our share price rise

63
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,270
does good for both He family and Lin family.

64
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,480
I know,

65
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,750
you're still investigating the car accident.

66
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,310
After so many years,

67
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,080
the wound has already healed

68
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,110
why tear it open?

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,520
We're unaware of the truth.

70
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,230
That's not healing.

71
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,960
It's only self-paralysis.

72
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,520
My advice for you,

73
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,150
stop the investigation.

74
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,560
Right now,

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,310
you must put all your energy

76
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,230
into our business.

77
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,520
That's what your brother wants.

78
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,630
It is no longer

79
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,960
your own career,

80
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,310
but the hard work of our whole family.

81
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,080
Don't let us down,

82
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,840
I understand.

83
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,520
Rest early,

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,920
Good night.

85
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,590
A heart-stopping dance.

86
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,270
An exciting night.

87
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,440
heart-stopping?

88
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,880
Palpitation?

89
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,790
What about myocardial infarction?

90
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,230
Excited?

91
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,880
by whom?

92
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,110
He Qiaoyan?

93
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,880
He's my husband.

94
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,110
How dare him?

95
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,110
When I'm with him,

96
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,480
he dare not even move.

97
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,310
It's not that I'm completely unmoved.

98
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,000
Let me have a look.

99
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,630
It's better to be careful.

100
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,710
That fall on the dinner party,

101
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,520
it might cause

102
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,630
a slight sprain.

103
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,040
It's alright.

104
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,880
What did you just say?

105
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,920
I said, it might cause

106
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
a slight sprain.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,670
Not that,

108
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,790
the first sentence.

109
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,920
You said that,

110
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,750
you're not completely unmoved.

111
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,110
I knew it.

112
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,880
After all, you've done so much for me.

113
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,790
Wait, you mean touched?

114
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,080
Don't you mean touched?

115
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,590
I'm going to sleep,

116
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,110
Good night. Goodbye.

117
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,920
You might smother yourself.

118
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,790
It's OK. I'm cold.

119
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,150
Good night.

120
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,230
Hey.

121
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,920
Hello? Are you asleep?

122
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,750
Let's have a chat.

123
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,590
For no reason?

124
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,710
I'm ready to go to sleep.

125
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,750
Wait!

126
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,880
What do you think of Miss Lin?

127
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
What do you mean?

128
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,710
Is she excellent?

129
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,480
She's always been excellent.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,790
The Lin family is very strict

131
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,600
with their children.

132
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,310
Well,

133
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,680
do you two get along well?

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
Back when we were kids,

135
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
we all like math very much,

136
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,350
so we both attended the math club.

137
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,350
So do you think she's pretty?

138
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,000
Well

139
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,510
She's so beautiful

140
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,960
and talented,

141
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
so she must get many admirers .

142
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,080
You two

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,190
were arranged for marriage?

144
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,000
Have an early rest.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,680
Save the power and net flow

146
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,920
for your cellphone.

147
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,550
It's charging

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,430
and there's WiFi.

149
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,430
I wander,

150
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,920
why

151
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,600
you two are arranged for marriage,

152
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
yet you haven't married her?

153
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,760
I'm going to turn off my phone and go to sleep.

154
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,760
Good night.

155
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,470
No!

156
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,550
He hang up on me...

157
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,080
She's rich,

158
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,230
talented,

159
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,600
and beautiful.

160
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,600
I am no worse than her.

161
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,920
It's just first love.

162
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,230
I don't believe it.

163
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,510
Is first love

164
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,720
so important for men?

165
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,390
Qin Yiyue

166
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
What the hell are you doing?

167
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,000
So?

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
What happened last night?

169
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,840
Did Mr. He

170
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,800
got cross-examined?

171
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Cross-examine?

172
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,920
In what capacity

173
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,470
and on which side can I cross-examine him?

174
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,840
So you're going to hold on like this?

175
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,350
Until you fall apart?

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
She's right.

177
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,840
I can't fall apart.

178
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
Why don't you text me back?

179
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,390
Come on, quarrel with me.

180
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,230
Don't you love to pick up quarrels?

181
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,190
Still no response.

182
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,800
I warn you, He Qiaoyan,

183
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,190
On three,

184
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,310
if you still don't text me back,

185
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,190
I'll get angry!

186
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,390
And it's not a good one!

187
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,310
One two three.

188
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,640
Why can't you just text me back?

189
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,080
Didn't you usually text me back immediately.

190
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm so sad.

191
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,840
Sis,

192
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,040
no matter what happens,

193
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,680
you'll always be my goddess.

194
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,270
You are the best match for Mr. He.

195
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,510
What's going on?

196
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,080
Didn't you know?

197
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,600
Check the microblog.

198
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,110
The beautiful fiancée of He Qiaoyan

199
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,550
completely defeated Qin Yiyue.

200
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,040
Lin Wei

201
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,510
I've already said that,

202
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,920
Qin Yiyue and he Qiaoyan

203
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,190
are no match.

204
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,390
To be honest,

205
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,430
Lin Wei is so elegant.

206
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,720
Top designer and overbearing president,

207
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,000
standard configuration of romantic fiction.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,470
Qin Yiyue?

209
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,080
just an unexpected calculating girl.

210
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,720
My god,

211
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,080
they really are good at making stories.

212
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,760
How about becoming an online novel writer?

213
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,960
They are just jealous.

214
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,550
Also,

215
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,270
you spent your spare time here

216
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,040
voluntarily

217
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,230
for a part-time job,

218
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,350
not for gossip.

219
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,600
So you don't care about what they said?

220
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,680
It's just gossips,

221
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,000
Why should I give a rap?

222
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,840
Where are you going?

223
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,550
To pick up Xiaobao.

224
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,080
There're too many online posts,

225
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,150
I'm afraid that

226
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,350
he might hear about this.

227
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,720
Whenever anything comes up,

228
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,600
he's always been

229
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,550
your first concern.

230
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,270
Things like these,

231
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,880
we know black from white,

232
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,190
yet children can't.

233
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,640
Still,

234
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,080
How about yourself?

235
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,960
Don't you worry?

236
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,390
These posts

237
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,350
are generally hostile to you.

238
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,840
Some even slander you.

239
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,150
Think about it for yourself,

240
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,000
ever since I met He Qiaoyan,

241
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,080
my name has become a popular search term.

242
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,760
So I couldn't care less about

243
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,110
the rumors they post.

244
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,920
Alright,

245
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,840
you take care here.

246
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,880
I have to go now.

247
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,270
Where is Dr. Qin going?

248
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,760
Dr. Ning, look.

249
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,430
People all say that Lin Wei and Mr. He

250
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,470
are arranged to get marry.

251
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,310
and Dr. Qin is a mistress.

252
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,040
Right, I see.

253
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,110
You go to work.

254
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,390
Next week's work schedules

255
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,080
are all set.

256
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Please take a look.

257
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,510
Also

258
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,230
about the posts of Dr. Qin on the Internet…

259
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,110
Should we take action?

260
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,350
What kind of posts?

261
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,150
Look.

262
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,270
Inform the legal department,

263
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,350
let them deal with it.

264
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,880
I want to see the solution after work.

265
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,000
Ok.

266
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,800
I've brought Xiaobao home.

267
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,040
Don't worry.

268
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,000
Are you ok?

269
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,270
Why?

270
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,800
About those posts on the Internet.

271
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,680
With you by my side,

272
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,640
Nothing could ever go wrong.

273
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,880
Besides,

274
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,640
You must have told the powerful legal team

275
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,190
of the Heshi group to deal with this.

276
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,800
Xiaobao and I

277
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,270
just need one night off the Internet,

278
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,350
and everything will be alright.

279
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,270
The legal team are already working on it.

280
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,720
Later today

281
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,760
there should be results.

282
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,470
I've got another meeting.

283
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,510
I have to go.

284
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,310
Tonight,

285
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,430
I won't come home for dinner.

286
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,350
OK.

287
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,880
Bye.

288
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
An unknown doctor and the pretty rich girl

289
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,920
Qin is so ugly.

290
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,720
Mr. He is just playing around

291
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,110
Cinderella will be dumped sooner or later.

292
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,880
What a crap!

293
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,430
forget it,

294
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,680
I won't be angry,

295
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,190
that's exactly what they want.

296
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,230
Xiaobao, mommy's here to play with you.

297
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,150
So strange,

298
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,680
Screensaver with sound.

299
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,599
What a mess.

300
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,510
Don't be scared, Ruowei,

301
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,470
I'm coming.

302
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,680
Don't do that.

303
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,470
I'm just kidding.

304
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,600
I just want to play the hero.

305
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,470
It's just a game.

306
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,510
I didn't mean to provoke you guys.

307
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,110
Help!

308
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,800
Help!

309
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,390
Help!

310
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,080
Zhang, Xu

311
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,640
You're wearing trousers and shoes.

312
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,390
The toilet is so bright,

313
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,960
I saw it all at once, okay?

314
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,720
And Zhang,

315
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,600
the hand he put on my shoulder

316
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,430
is wearing the wedding ring.

317
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,310
Director Wen,

318
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,840
your script is such a cliché.

319
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,760
But at least,

320
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,720
costumes and props

321
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,110
should be more careful.

322
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,510
All right, you guys go home.

323
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,800
Boss

324
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,310
our task is finished.

325
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,040
Bye bye.

326
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,880
Go, go, go

327
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,510
Boss, is this overtime working?

328
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,190
Right, does it count?

329
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,390
It was supposed to count.

330
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,080
Now, it doesn't.

331
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,190
Go, go, go.

332
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,510
Hurry.

333
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,550
Having fun?

334
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,470
You're too bold, aren't you?

335
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,880
I'm an extreme fan of horror movies

336
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,800
and have participated in

337
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,640
every popular room escapes game.

338
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,960
For all your

339
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,510
shoddy little tricks.

340
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,680
Just a piece of cake.

341
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,390
Boring.

342
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,000
It's you that's boring, isn't it?

343
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,760
Such an old-fashioned story.

344
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
So boring.

345
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,550
Want to stimulate hormones with horror.

346
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
And play the hero?

347
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,430
You're just boring.

348
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,550
If I show up

349
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,350
when you're in danger

350
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,190
and save your life,

351
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,310
will you be moved?

352
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,390
well

353
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,640
I might

354
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,150
cry.

355
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,310
Really?

356
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,720
Why?

357
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,190
Because the last person I see

358
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,760
before my death

359
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,110
is you.

360
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,350
I will never rest in peace.

361
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,040
All right.

362
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,230
Turn off the lights.

363
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,960
Go home.

364
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:29,960
No, no, no, No.

365
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,840
Don't leave me here alone.

366
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,550
Have you been waiting long?

367
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,640
No I just arrived.

368
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,150
I didn't know that

369
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,350
aunt also invited you.

370
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,640
I didn't know she invited you either.

371
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,880
Xiaowei.

372
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,800
Auntie.

373
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,390
Excuse me,

374
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,470
I need to use the lady's room.

375
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,150
OK.

376
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,760
Congratulations.

377
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:11,880
Your bracelet

378
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,080
got the support of the board of directors.

379
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,550
Did you do it, Aunt?

380
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,800
Do what?

381
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,880
Is it you that

382
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
promote media to

383
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,350
let those posts

384
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,110
emerge in an endless stream?

385
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,270
Yes.

386
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,600
Why?

387
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,190
Those posts

388
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,600
are the best way for Qin Yiyue

389
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,640
to get a clear understanding of herself.

390
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,470
I want her to know clearly that

391
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,880
you two are not a well-matched couple.

392
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,390
Qin Yiyue is my wife

393
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,080
I say we make a good couple.

394
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,270
She's the perfect match for me.

395
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,390
Even if she is,

396
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,720
however,

397
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
she's not suitable to be the daughter-in-law of our family.

398
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
So she has to be gone.

399
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,310
Let me remind you now,

400
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,190
your responsibility

401
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,040
lies on the Heshi group.

402
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,800
It's the work of your father and your brother.

403
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,270
If…

404
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,720
All right, all right.

405
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,680
Eat first.

406
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,640
I have something else to do.

407
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,230
Take your time.

408
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,880
Qiaoyan got busy with company stuffs.

409
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:13,880
He's always like that,

410
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,190
a workaholic

411
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,960
Got nothing but work, work, work.

412
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,470
It's OK, auntie.

413
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,470
I understand.

414
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,800
I'm just like him.

415
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,080
Sometimes when I get busy

416
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,880
I can stay up for two whole days.

417
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,960
You two are the same,

418
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,680
both so sensible

419
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,110
and stick to your own mission.

420
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,270
I Know,

421
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,880
the marriage of Lin family and He family

422
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,510
is a win-win for both of us.

423
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,190
Those posts on the Internet…

424
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,640
I've taken care of them.

425
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,190
Don't worry, auntie.

426
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,110
Of course,

427
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,550
I was right about you.

428
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,680
So…

429
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,880
You don't mind

430
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,040
what's going with Qiaoyan and that girl?

431
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,350
Didn't you just say that

432
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,310
they're just contractual.

433
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,470
It's not real marriage.

434
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,720
However,

435
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,000
Qiaoyan seems to be…

436
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,430
attracted to her.

437
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,800
Well, young people

438
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,510
all like to

439
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,880
dream unrealistically.

440
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,470
People like me and Qiaoyan

441
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
we are bond to go back to

442
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,270
our own tracks.

443
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,190
This is Miss Qin

444
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,680
I believe soon

445
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,920
will leave Qiaoyan.

446
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,230
Here, here.

447
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,550
Don't you have anything to ask me?

448
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,110
Wait a moment.

449
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,760
What did you just say?

450
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,640
Here's your water.

451
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,110
Thank you.

452
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,310
About the posts…

453
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,550
Right, about those.

454
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,080
Why are they keeping emerging?

455
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,390
What's going on?

456
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,230
There're some problems.

457
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,430
Is it because of Auntie?

458
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,640
I guess so.

459
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,680
I'm sorry.

460
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,680
What do you mean you're sorry?

461
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,040
Not sincerely at all.

462
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,430
We have an agreement in the contract,

463
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,600
situations like this,

464
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,510
I need to compensate you for your mental loss.

465
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,080
One hundred thousand is transferred to your account.

466
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,920
Check it.

467
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,880
Come on, this

468
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,550
will get you beaten up.

469
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,510
Ok?

470
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,350
If you do

471
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,470
feel sorry.

472
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,640
How about…

473
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,840
shorten our contract

474
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,390
by one month?

475
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,270
No way.

476
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:16,960
What about half a month?

477
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,430
No way.

478
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:17,760
What about a week?

479
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,720
No way.

480
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,000
You're so stingy!

481
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,000
Bully He.

482
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,150
Are you in such a hurry to leave?

483
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,190
You can't understand

484
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,640
how much I yearn for freedom.

485
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,390
Fine, you['ll have your freedom.

486
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,640
Really?

487
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,000
Wait.

488
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,390
You call this freedom?

489
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,550
From now on,

490
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,110
you have 24 hours.

491
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,150
Enjoy your freedom.

492
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,920
You really are so stingy.

493
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
What's the matter, He Weifei?

494
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,680
Daddy told you,

495
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,350
no way.

496
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,880
Xiaobao, mommy will get it for you.

497
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,270
I'm free today,

498
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,350
nobody can stop me.

499
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,150
Come on.

500
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,960
A marshmallow please.

501
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,390
Thank you.

502
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,190
How much is it?

503
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,110
Twenty-five.

504
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:25,960
My treat.

505
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,640
But don't do this again.

506
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,640
Wait, don't move.

507
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,040
I think someone's taking a photograph.

508
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,430
It must be about me.

509
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,270
Let me teach them a lesson!

510
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,110
What are you doing?

511
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,150
I told them to do so.

512
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,350
Since we can't stop

513
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,680
the villainous posts.

514
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,680
Why don't we create

515
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,600
some sweet and positive posts

516
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,680
to cover them all.

517
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,760
Smart move.

518
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,840
Let's show them

519
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,800
a happy family

520
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,960
of three.

521
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,470
Come on.

522
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,720
let's go.

523
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,080
Let me see your smile.

524
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,640
Let mommy have a look.

525
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,550
Go ahead.

526
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,510
Wave with me.

527
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,350
Start from today,

528
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,390
every morning

529
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,350
I'll come with you

530
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,600
to bring Xiaobao to school,

531
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,110
and then I'll drive you to work.

532
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,110
Actually, Mr. He,

533
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,040
since we went shopping

534
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,230
yesterday,

535
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,550
there have been many positive posts on the Internet.

536
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,470
More than enough.

537
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,110
More than enough?

538
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,430
Far from enough.

539
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,150
I'll drive you to work.

540
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,230
A real gentleman.

541
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,390
Please.

542
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,040
Well,

543
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,470
you do know how to impress women.

544
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,080
A little too obvious,

545
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,760
don't you think?

546
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,110
Sit tight.

547
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,190
Sit tight?

548
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,720
I'm not up yet.

549
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,880
Wait! I'm not ready.

550
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,760
I'm not up yet.

551
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,390
Good morning, Dr. Qin.

552
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:05,840
Morning.

553
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,150
Dr. Qin,

554
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,430
news about your love life

555
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,430
has become a hot search topic.

556
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,800
Mr. He was never

557
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,390
on any SNS.

558
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,110
Now he actually registered microblog.

559
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,190
And all his posts are about you.

560
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,000
What is this?

561
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,110
Your husband's on microblog.

562
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
Key points

563
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,350
His profile

564
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,510
is not the CEO of He['s group

565
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,230
but husband of doctor Qin's.

566
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,000
Oh my God, that's sweet.

567
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,350
Look! Look!

568
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,960
His own microblog,

569
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,800
you're in the profile,

570
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,760
you picture is used as profile photo.

571
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,510
Even the first post

572
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,430
is about you.

573
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,230
So, all those

574
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,640
rumors and gossips can stop.

575
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
That overseas returned designer

576
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,840
and perfect ex-girlfriend?

577
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,040
she can never compare with you,

578
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,190
the official wife.

579
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,760
It was posted at 6:07.

580
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,270
He got up so early.

581
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,190
June 7th

582
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,000
is my birthday.

583
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,110
Oh my God,

584
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,920
save me please.

585
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,840
This is so sweet!

586
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,040
Work hard.

587
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,080
I'm leaving.

588
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:35,800
Auntie.

589
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:36,920
Qiaoyan

590
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,190
The person I told you about is here.

591
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,000
Will you greet her?

592
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,760
She's the best person

593
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,150
to promote our bracelet

594
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,150
in Europe and America.

595
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,230
I see.

596
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,000
Hello, I'm He Qiaoyan.

597
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,840
Hello, I'm Lin Wei.

598
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,640
The person my aunt mentioned

599
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,000
is you.

600
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,190
Was it a surprise?

601
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,150
Don't forget

602
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,920
I studied business in college,

603
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,230
the designer work

604
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,510
is just a hobby.

605
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,960
The smart bracelet project

606
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,800
is very important for He's group.

607
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,960
It's not something for you to practice.

608
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,550
I know how much you rely on data.

609
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,510
I'll use data to convince you that

610
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,880
I am qualified for the job.

611
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,640
For the past few days,

612
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,960
I've been doing my work.

613
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
This is the data of the bracelet user group.

614
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,720
Users from 25 to 30 years old

615
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,800
take up the largest proportion,

616
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,960
30 percent.

617
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,430
And among those

618
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,230
people,

619
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,840
65 percent of them

620
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,350
share a common feature.

621
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,430
All of them have been using

622
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,680
modern science and technology creative products

623
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,720
for over five years.

624
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
What does this mean?

625
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,270
It means the current market demand

626
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,510
for your smart bracelet

627
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,230
is very high.

628
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,040
Each age group

629
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,470
has different amount of market demand.

630
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,110
Users over 35 years old

631
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,270
only take up nine percent.

632
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,350
And user group under 20 years old

633
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,270
is also relatively small,

634
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,040
only takes up 13 percent.

635
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,190
And your smart Bracelet

636
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,350
is getting more and more attention.

637
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,880
From 2014

638
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,720
to 2019,

639
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,310
attention has increased dramatically.

640
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,430
Besides,

641
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,640
people are paying more and more attention to health.

642
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,920
I don't want to go to work.

643
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:52,760
Why?

644
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,470
I am the CEO.

645
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,640
Why do I need to work?

646
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,310
I don't want to go to work.

647
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,640
You do?

648
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,190
Then I'll tell Mr. Wen that

649
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,600
you decide to

650
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,110
choose your bed

651
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,510
over your freedom of

652
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,600
finance and love life

653
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,310
for the rest of your life.

654
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,679
How did you got in?

655
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,550
I've changed the room code.

656
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,389
You change the code from your first girlfriend's birthday

657
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:18,840
to

658
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,310
your second girlfriend's birthday.

659
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,230
Is that a change?

660
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,679
Every thought in your head

661
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,920
is all under my control.

662
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,310
Take a rest, bro.

663
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,639
I have a secret tunnel.

664
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,110
Don't you  know?

665
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,150
What?

666
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,679
It is newly built.

667
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,760
A tunnel to your heart.

668
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,080
The tunnel collapse ahead

669
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,429
please take a detour.

670
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,550
Actually, have a look.

671
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,840
This one is more detailed.

672
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,960
Excuse me. I need to take this call.

673
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,600
Could you whisper to me,

674
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,880
is there any bugs of

675
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,040
your second generation Bracelet?

676
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,230
From chip to system

677
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,310
and then to the sensor,

678
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,720
everything uses cutting edge technology.

679
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,080
There are no bugs.

680
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,720
Well,

681
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,510
is it possible

682
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,150
to deliberately

683
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,390
insert any bugs in it?

684
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,920
Are you going to seek out

685
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,110
some trade secrets?

686
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,510
Of course not.

687
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,720
I took a bet with Yang Ruowei

688
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,550
for my freedom.

689
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,080
I have to make her moved,

690
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,510
but I can't be moved.

691
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,470
Just tell me,

692
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,510
is there any way

693
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,640
to reprogram the bracelet?

694
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,150
Our company don't provide

695
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,680
after-sale services that involve

696
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,550
fraud and falsification.

697
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,310
I'm too busy to play with you.

698
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,190
Technology

699
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,270
maybe it's the ladder of human progress,

700
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,800
but it definitely

701
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,430
is the stumbling block for me.

702
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,080
I knew you didn't eat breakfast.

703
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,470
So I made you a

704
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,800
simple sandwich.

705
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,680
Very tempting.

706
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,230
However,

707
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,080
I'm not hungry.

708
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,920
Nobody can resist such temptation.

709
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,920
Are you stuck?

710
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,430
Show me the bracelet.

711
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,230
The breakfast I made for you

712
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,470
left the cooking smell all over me.

713
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,470
Therefore

714
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,510
I

715
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,960
need to take a bath, too.

716
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,190
Don't do that!

717
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,550
Go to the bathroom!

718
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,390
Goblin.

719
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,720
She's definitely a goblin

720
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,350
It's so sweet

721
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,840
I'm so jealous.

722
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,760
This is the clinic.

723
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,800
What are you gossiping about?

724
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,040
Look at the composition and the angle.

725
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,310
It's full of love.

726
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,880
Look.

727
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,960
I forwarded it with my spare account.

728
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
What's your spare account.

729
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,800
I won't tell you.

730
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,430
Qin Yiyue Global Fans Support Association

731
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,720
Super talk host of  "the captured He"

732
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,390
Shush

733
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,920
Do you want everyone hear you?

734
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,470
"the captured He". How did you get the idea?

735
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,350
You are a real genius.

736
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,680
I almost laugh my ass off.

737
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,110
You're so miserable.

738
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,190
The wife personally advertises her love life

739
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,760
No one else has done it.

740
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,470
It's almost two o'clock,

741
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,600
I'll have patients later.

742
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,390
Have to go now.

743
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,840
Bye,

744
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,110
The captured He.

745
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,920
Mr. He is in a meeting.

746
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,960
You can wait in his office

747
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,680
for a while.

748
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:29,840
There's no need.

749
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,800
I'm here to get the wine for Mr. Wen.

750
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,840
He said you knew where it is.

751
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,920
Right, the bottle given to Mr. He

752
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,390
by the partner last week.

753
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,510
Mr. Gu has been thinking about it.

754
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,230
He told me to give it to you when you're here.

755
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,110
This way.

756
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,230
They are all in English, can you read them?

757
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,720
Why is Miss Lin here?

758
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,550
Miss Lin is the director

759
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,920
of our third marketing department.

760
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,550
She's in full charge of

761
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,960
entering the European and American markets.
