Unforgettable Love
EP14

2
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:23,400
Ruowei.

3
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,270
Why are you here?

4
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,270
It's the time

5
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,360
to pick up Xiaobao with me.

6
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,039
What's happening?

7
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,479
What is it?

8
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,710
Your love rival now is

9
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,150
the director of Heshi promotion department

10
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,920
who takes full responsibility

11
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,360
to promote He Qiaoyan's precious bracelet

12
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,440
to the European and American market.

13
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,520
You mean

14
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,440
Lin Wei went to work at Heshi.

15
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,880
Didn't He Qiaoyan talk to you

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,840
about it?

17
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,920
Does it matter?

18
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,750
Of course it matters.

19
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,880
If he did,

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,520
it means the problem

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,630
is not that serious.

22
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,080
But if he didn't talk about that,

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
it's probably 80 percent that

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,080
he is guilty of it.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,310
Do you think it's important or not?

26
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,750
Why didn't you say it?

27
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,670
Why not?

28
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,040
Sit down.

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,040
Fine.

30
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,790
I see.

31
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,000
You are playing dead, aren't you?

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,920
Since you play dead,

33
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,520
I'll wake you up.

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Hit, hit, hit

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,270
Presumptuous.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,270
You don't say, but I will make you say.

37
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,480
Tell me.

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Tell me.

39
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,230
I tell you

40
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,190
my fist is very hard.

41
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,520
Tell me.

42
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,230
Tell me now.

43
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,310
You haven't been asleep yet?

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,920
Do you think I can be asleep?

45
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,750
You didn't hear anything, did you?

46
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,630
What do you think?

47
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,480
What did you hear?

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,630
I heard about 60 decibels

49
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,110
man-made noises

50
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,110
for 27 minutes.

51
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,590
which seriously affected my cerebral

52
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,310
cortex's nerves to rest.

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,590
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,710
I just shouldn't have been in the room

55
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,150
practicing for the kid

56
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,150
the story I'm going to tell tomorrow.

57
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,590
If that bothers you,

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,960
I'll shut up right now.

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,079
That's good.

60
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,750
Have an early rest.

61
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,590
Good night.

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,480
No.

63
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,310
Don't think blindly.

64
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,190
And don't imagine something strange.

65
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,790
I swear.

66
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,750
I definitely didn't sleep on it

67
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,840
and snore.

68
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,750
I think I get it.

69
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,920
You think

70
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,880
I have your cartoon pillow

71
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,750
whilst you don't have one.

72
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,270
You don't think it's fair,

73
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,080
so you are angry.

74
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,560
Right?

75
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,270
Who wants your cartoon pillow?

76
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,440
I have nightmares with it.

77
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,270
Ok.

78
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,440
I'll make one for you

79
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,000
with the same size as mine.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,590
What do you want me to wear?

81
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,269
I don't want

82
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,230
the same size one as yours.

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,839
No, No

84
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,790
I, I mean

85
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,310
I don't want your pillow.

86
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,630
Got it.

87
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,190
Tomorrow, I'll give you one

88
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,960
cartoon pillow the same size as me.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,790
Rest early.

90
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,560
I'll arrange it.

91
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,750
What a mess!

92
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,150
Qin Yiyue.

93
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,750
You tell me,

94
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,360
why don't you ask him?

95
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,880
Lady,

96
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,520
What should I ask?

97
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,110
Of course you should ask

98
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,790
why Lin Wei

99
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,190
is going to work for Heshi?

100
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,000
So what?

101
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,880
Right!

102
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,190
So what?

103
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,310
So annoying.

104
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,480
I was misunderstood by him

105
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,230
that I'm crazy about his body.

106
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,000
It's weekend today.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,110
You don't have to go to the company,

108
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,630
so I made breakfast

109
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,840
After breakfast,

110
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,590
let's take Xiaobao to the horse-riding yard.

111
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,520
Xiaobao said that

112
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,560
he wants to learn to ride a horse.

113
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,560
I also made for him

114
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,480
his favorite eggs.

115
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,360
Let me wake him up now.

116
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,440
Wait.

117
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,400
I have to work overtime at the company today.

118
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,230
I don't have breakfast today.

119
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,080
See you!

120
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,560
He doesn't have breakfast

121
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,360
for the first time.

122
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,960
Who is he going to eat with?

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,710
Breakfast is gold.

124
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,040
Lunch is silver.

125
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,880
Dinner is copper.

126
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,000
Who allows you cheat?

127
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,590
Why is Mommy unhappy?

128
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,750
Because your Mommy's love rival

129
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,790
went to work at your Dad's company.

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,270
What is love rival?

131
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,000
A love rival is someone who with your Mommy

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,150
snatches your Dad.

133
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,750
Xiaobao.

134
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,310
Xiaobao.

135
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,670
Today is the weekend.

136
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,630
What do you want

137
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,000
to do with Mommy?

138
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,630
What about going to the amusement park?

139
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,960
What about the museum?

140
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,110
Go to Dad's company.

141
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
You miss Dad?

142
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,590
Ok.

143
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,150
Xiaobao misses Dad,

144
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,150
then Mommy takes you to meet Daddy.

145
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,230
OK?

146
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,310
Xiaobao.

147
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,440
Is Mommy beautiful?

148
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,000
Good boy!

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,750
If your Dad is half as sweet as you,

150
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,400
it's wonderful.

151
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,590
Mr. He.

152
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,790
So careful?

153
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,440
Why did you come to the company?

154
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,270
Xiaobao said he missed you,

155
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,150
so I bring him to see you.

156
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,710
I also bring you something to eat by the way.

157
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,110
Didn't you have breakfast?

158
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,510
I forgot to tell you that

159
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,390
today's noon...

160
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,720
I know you're in a hurry at noon

161
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,840
so as to eat something simple.

162
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,720
so I made for you

163
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,040
your favorite...

164
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,960
Qiaoyan,

165
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,640
Let's have sandwiches for lunch.

166
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,080
Mr. He.

167
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,920
Minister Lin.

168
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,680
Designer Lucas

169
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,190
will be here in five minutes.

170
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,760
When they arrive,

171
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,600
bring them directly.

172
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,080
Ok.

173
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,080
You'd better eat this.

174
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,680
I have made your favorite

175
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,920
tuna sandwich.

176
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,430
I added the amount of tuna.

177
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,190
Help yourself.

178
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,350
I remember Lucas

179
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,720
dislikes tuna the most.

180
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,510
You'd better not eat it,

181
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,390
or it will leave a bad smell.

182
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,270
Put things down first.

183
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,880
I'll have a meeting later.

184
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,920
It will take about an hour

185
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,720
to finish.

186
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,470
We should have a good lunch.

187
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,800
When I finish the meeting,

188
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,000
I will bring you and Xiaobao

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,080
to go for a lunch together.

190
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,040
Ok.

191
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,880
You are working,

192
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,720
and finish work first.

193
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,600
I won't disturb you.

194
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,040
I'll wait for you outside with Xiaobao.

195
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:42,920
Ok.

196
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,110
Let's go, Xiaobao.

197
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,600
Pay attention to safety.

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,190
The designer will come here soon.

199
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,040
Let's take a look at

200
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,000
his plan.

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,640
Ok.

202
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,310
Take a seat.

203
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,040
I'm just thinking about it.

204
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,270
Devices of immersive virtual reality

205
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,040
and the matching degree of the bracelet

206
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,310
Mommy is going to the bathroom.

207
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,350
You wait for me here

208
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,150
Don't go away,

209
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,880
okay?

210
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,110
Lucas is disgusted the most with

211
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,470
the smell of tuna.

212
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,510
Why doesn't he dislike the smell of air?

213
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,510
Because now there are a lot of

214
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,390
new features,

215
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,430
so the comfort of wearing

216
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,470
is very important.

217
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,680
Besides, I think

218
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,390
the battery sensor module,

219
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,310
and in the stand-alone module,

220
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,880
the advantage of low power

221
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,390
need to be further strengthened.

222
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,920
If its functionality

223
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,880
makes a breakthrough,

224
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,920
I believe our bracelet

225
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,110
will make a better benefit.

226
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,270
Except for the battery,

227
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:34,760
the...

228
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,390
Xiaobao.

229
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,720
What are you doing here?

230
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,150
Hello!

231
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,960
Xiaobao.

232
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,800
You are coming to play with Dad, right?

233
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,110
Your Dad will play with you after the meeting,

234
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,840
okay?

235
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

236
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,110
He Weifei.

237
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,680
I know why you're here.

238
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,350
Stop pretending.

239
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,150
We are all female.

240
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,310
I know what you're thinking about.

241
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,270
But you

242
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,640
are not  at the same level.

243
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,190
Barely climbing up

244
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,080
while no one supports you,

245
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,000
you will just fall down more seriously.

246
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,390
Mumbo jumbo.

247
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,350
Come down.

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,880
What's wrong?

249
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,150
Calm down.

250
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,080
Xiaobao.

251
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,040
You tell Mommy

252
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,960
why you did that?

253
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,920
You must have a reason for that,

254
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,550
right?

255
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,600
What reason can he have?

256
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,150
What he did

257
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,470
can't be forgiven.

258
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,880
He Weifei, I tell you

259
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,880
you can do whatever you want at home.

260
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,640
But at the company,

261
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,510
this kind of behavior is absolutely not allowed.

262
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,190
Is it your attitude of admitting your mistakes?

263
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,760
Is it?

264
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,270
Now, go home

265
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,230
You are not allowed to have yogurt within three days.

266
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,040
No cartoons.

267
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,150
No games.

268
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,510
Don't worry about him.

269
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,430
Mr. He

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,350
I know you're the boss.

271
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,190
You get used to educating your employees seriously.

272
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,350
But Xiaobao is just a kid.

273
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,640
Can you pay a little attention to

274
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,960
the way you speak.

275
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,510
Whether he's a kid

276
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,430
or an adult,

277
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,800
as long as he did something wrong,

278
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,150
he should have a lesson.

279
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,920
Yes.

280
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,680
You can teach him.

281
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,760
But should you

282
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,310
figure out the reason first?

283
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,390
There's only one reason for it.

284
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,550
He's just too naughty.

285
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,680
Do you know

286
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,880
how to educate children?

287
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,350
Do I know how to teach children?

288
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,680
You think you know it well, right?

289
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,000
It is because

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,350
you have spoiled him too much recently

291
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,920
that he did not behave himself.

292
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,430
Yes.

293
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,080
I don't know.

294
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,430
You know.

295
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,230
You all know.

296
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,720
At least I know that we need to spend more time with the family.

297
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,510
Today is the weekend.

298
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,040
But you come to work early in the morning.

299
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,430
Xiaobao said he missed you,

300
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,880
and let me bring him to meet you.

301
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,640
In the end, you blew him up.

302
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,550
Is that what you should do as a parent?

303
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,190
Do you understand

304
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,760
what I told you?

305
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,000
Understand.

306
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,000
She's coming. She's coming. She's coming.

307
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,110
Come on, everyone!

308
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,040
After work,

309
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,840
I'll treat you to dinner.

310
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,510
Well.

311
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,550
Ruowei.

312
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,230
The activity of last quarter is over.

313
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,470
When are you going to give the report?

314
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,430
But this project,

315
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,550
I'm only responsible for contacting suppliers.

316
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,760
The major planning and implementation

317
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,000
are in the charge of Lin Sheng.

318
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,470
Lin Sheng is your predecessor.

319
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,840
You'd better give him a hand.

320
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,800
Ok.

321
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,680
No problem.

322
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,310
Please pack up the materials for me.

323
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,230
I'll follow up as soon as possible.

324
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,640
And

325
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,110
the

326
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,040
preliminary market research of new products

327
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,960
and data analysis,

328
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,430
I think you can also have a try.

329
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,640
This part I before have

330
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,800
never dealt with.

331
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,190
But I can get to know about it.

332
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,310
Give me some time.

333
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
I'll go off work ahead of time.

334
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,550
For the data,

335
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,680
please check it again.

336
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,510
Data service

337
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,920
is not in my field of expertise.

338
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,510
Asking the project team to take over it

339
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,470
will be more suitable.

340
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,310
Only the confirmed forms

341
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,600
need to be checked again.

342
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,000
Robots are capable of doing this.

343
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,270
You are so smart.

344
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm sure you can be adept at it in five minutes.

345
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,000
Bye!

346
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,600
Are you done?

347
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:20,960
Are you done?

348
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,800
Are you done?

349
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,680
Just tell me if you can't do that.

350
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,350
Don't delay the working progress.

351
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,840
Send me the report as you finish it.

352
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,760
I have to go to the 16th floor at two o'clock in the afternoon

353
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,680
to give a report.

354
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,470
Weiwei.

355
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,040
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,920
Can you give the check

357
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,150
result to me now?

358
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,430
I'm in a hurry.

359
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,510
Stop.

360
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,550
I told you to stop.

361
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,230
Mr. Wen.

362
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,510
What are you doing?

363
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,920
Demonstrate your job responsibilities

364
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,390
and work authority.

365
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,270
Senior administrative assistant

366
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,390
deals with personnel related issues

367
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,640
in daily life,

368
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,270
and coordinates daily schedules.

369
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,079
So checking the report

370
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,190
is your job?

371
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,720
In principle, no.

372
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,880
What about market research and data summary?

373
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,190
And what about business check?

374
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,599
In principle, no.

375
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,800
So who are you responsible for?

376
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,040
The management layer represented by you.

377
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,510
You guys hear it.

378
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,190
Yang Ruowei in here

379
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,720
is only at my service.

380
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,390
Even if you joined the company earlier,

381
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,960
you are equal to her.

382
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,680
Besides,

383
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,110
don't always

384
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,600
shirk your responsibilities to someone else.

385
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,040
Finish your work on your own.

386
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,880
To reiterate,

387
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,920
Yang Ruowei is just for me.

388
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,000
Every word she says,

389
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,310
and everything she does

390
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,550
are guaranteed by me.

391
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,920
Do you remember?

392
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,960
Yes. Yes.

393
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,510
These jobs

394
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,600
are what I am willing to undertake.

395
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,190
And I've already finished them.

396
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,350
I have sent them to

397
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,430
your mailboxes.

398
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,000
As for the technical problems of data,

399
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,110
I have consulted the technical team.

400
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,680
There are indeed some mistakes.

401
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,600
But it's not a big deal.

402
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,510
I've solved it.

403
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,080
My ability is limited,

404
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,350
and I'm a freshman.

405
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,230
Thank all the predecessors for

406
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,600
giving me tasks

407
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,880
to make me know about how each department works,

408
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,840
and to serve you better in the future.

409
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,840
What's so funny?

410
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,760
Go back to your seat.

411
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,080
Ok.

412
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,310
Tell me the truth,

413
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,760
when in front of everyone, I was just

414
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,640
supporting you,

415
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,040
Am I masculine?

416
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,840
A piece of cake.

417
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,150
Totally unnecessary.

418
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,760
The workload when I worked in the hospital

419
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,110
is several times as much as here.

420
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,110
In the first week,

421
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,960
I must keep in mind quickly

422
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,720
with the basic components of 20 departments

423
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,080
and information of more than 100 doctors.

424
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,470
But I was helping you.

425
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,230
You left me embarrassed.

426
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,310
What you did would harm me.

427
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,390
The most important thing about administration

428
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,430
is to get on well with people.

429
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,110
I know those jobs

430
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,880
are not mine.

431
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,080
I can choose not to do them.

432
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,720
I can make mistakes.

433
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,110
They are not my responsibility.

434
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,000
But if I shirk the responsibilities

435
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,960
to let them be scolded by you,

436
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,190
How will I work in the future?

437
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,110
It's not your duty to please others.

438
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,510
I didn't.

439
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,840
I just like learning and challenging.

440
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,430
Fortunately.

441
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,230
I am confident of my ability.

442
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,880
If there's nothing wrong with you,

443
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,680
I got to go now.

444
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,960
This is balloon flower.

445
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,880
And this is morning glory.

446
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,470
Here.

447
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,390
This is little daisy.

448
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,040
Come on, come on.

449
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,430
Watermelon.

450
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,760
Mom.

451
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,310
Here.

452
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,190
Xiaobao.

453
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,600
Open your mouth to have a piece of watermelon.

454
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,510
Don't eat?

455
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,600
Come and sit here.

456
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,000
I'll do it, mom.

457
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,510
You don't eat what Grandma feeds,

458
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,390
do you?

459
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,350
Come and have another one.

460
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,640
What a dirty mouth!

461
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,470
Slowly!

462
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,350
You have one, too.

463
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,800
When she was a child

464
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,720
in kindergarten,

465
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,190
I prepared it for her.

466
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,720
Even though we use paper towels now,

467
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,640
she's always with it.

468
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,040
Does it taste good?

469
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,880
Xiaobao.

470
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,040
Call me Grandma.

471
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,350
Mom.

472
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,350
Don't force him.

473
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,600
Yes, yes.

474
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,510
I forgot again.

475
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,600
Ok.

476
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,680
No need to call me.

477
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,600
Xiaobao must be hungry.

478
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,310
Grandma is going to make delicious food for you.

479
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,430
Let me help you.

480
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,080
All right, come here.

481
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,880
Here.

482
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,470
You eat here by yourself

483
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,600
Mom is going to help Grandma cook.

484
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,350
Ok?

485
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,350
Careless!

486
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,190
Carry it in your pocket.

487
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,270
Is my Dad still sleeping?

488
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,760
He has taken anti-fever medicine,

489
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,960
so he got sleepy.

490
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,080
Why does he still have fever?

491
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,310
It's been almost a week.

492
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,760
Five days.

493
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,000
I'll take Dad to hospital tomorrow.

494
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,190
It's not good to have a fever all the time.

495
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,720
Tell me.

496
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,000
Why did you come back all of a sudden?

497
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,230
I come back to see you.

498
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,190
What's wrong with that?

499
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,270
And it's the weekend.

500
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,840
I bring Xiaobao back

501
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,110
to acquaint himself with his grandparents.

502
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,760
Then why are you two alone?

503
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,600
Where's Qiaoyan?

504
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,350
Nobody cares.

505
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,150
You must have had a quarrel.

506
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,880
No.

507
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,640
You give us a sudden phone call,

508
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,350
saying you would come back for a night,

509
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,270
and show us the kid.

510
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,840
But you didn't bring any luggage.

511
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,390
There's no reason except for quarrel.

512
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,880
If a young married woman quarrels and goes back to her parents' home

513
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,960
without anything,

514
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,800
she's waiting for

515
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,230
her husband to take her back.

516
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,640
Actually,

517
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,510
That's how the couple quarreled

518
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,720
When quarreling, the wife

519
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,430
takes the kid back to her parents' home,

520
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,880
and leaves the husband at home.

521
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,430
When he can't bear that without wife's care,

522
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,430
he will come to his mother-in-law's house

523
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,840
to apologize

524
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,270
and takes his wife back.

525
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,080
Right?

526
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,080
But only bringing the kid back

527
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,510
is not heartless enough.

528
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,150
You should take

529
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,640
all the money with you.

530
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,720
Only in this way,

531
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,150
the husband will realize

532
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,470
the importance of wife.

533
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,920
Do you take his pay card with you?

534
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,640
For a person like him,

535
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
bank cards

536
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,190
are numerous.

537
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,190
Ms. Luo Mingmei,

538
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,430
please go to cook.

539
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,230
I am hungry.

540
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,230
Ok. Wait a moment.

541
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,470
Hi, long time no see.

542
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,190
How are you recently?

543
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,190
Not bad.

544
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,110
Hello.

545
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,510
Are you miss Lin?

546
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,270
I'm Alex's friend, Ning Fang.

547
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,600
Here's your medicine.

548
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,510
Thank you!

549
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,150
I truly appreciate your coming.

550
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,800
My pleasure.

551
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,230
International students don't have medical insurance.

552
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,960
It's not easy to take this medicine.

553
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,000
If you are in need next time,

554
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,230
contact me directly.

555
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,270
I have friends in Switzerland.

556
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,150
Ok.

557
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,800
Thank you.

558
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,190
Can I have your WeChat?

559
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,350
It's more convenient to contact.

560
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,040
But what a coincidence!

561
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,720
In fact,

562
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,190
we are from

563
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,270
the same place.

564
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,190
I didn't expect to be here

565
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,150
meeting a fellow-townswoman.

566
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,110
You are also from Qincheng City?

567
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,230
Right!

568
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,760
Are you still taking medicine?

569
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,310
If you need a doctor specializing in this,

570
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,430
I can recommend one to you.

571
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,000
No, I don't.

572
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,080
Thank you for your concern.

573
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,150
I am good.

574
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:38,960
All right.

575
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The world is so small.

576
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,310
I didn't expect that besides being fellow townsmen,

577
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,390
we can meet here.

578
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,600
How about having a meal next time?

579
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,680
My house is nearby.

580
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,960
No, thanks.

581
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,390
If you don't mind,

582
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,000
I hope you can keep it a secret for me.

583
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,040
What you know in France,

584
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,470
please don't tell anyone.

585
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,800
I got to go.

586
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,600
Bye!

587
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,230
Bye!

588
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,840
The one that you want to see,

589
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,040
I have made an appointment for you.

590
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,880
See you at eight o'clock in the afternoon. I'll send you the address.

591
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,310
Mr. He, you're back.

592
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,390
By the way, Mrs. Liu

593
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,720
Where is Mrs. He?

594
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,800
Mrs. He said that

595
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,390
she would take Xiaobao back to see her parents.

596
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Are Mrs. He's parents

597
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,550
getting in trouble?

598
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,600
It seems not.

599
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,880
Ok.

600
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,510
Well.

601
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,040
Tonight,

602
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,390
I won't  have dinner at home.

603
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,680
You don't need to prepare the dinner.

604
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,510
Go ahead with your stuff.

605
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,640
Ok.

606
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,920
Well, Mr. He.

607
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,190
Mrs. He forgot to take away her luggage.

608
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,310
Miss Qin.

609
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,310
What you are doing

610
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,270
is controlling the baby and commanding Mr. He, right?

611
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,470
What are you talking about?

612
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,880
I just don't want to see

613
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,960
He Qiaoyan.

614
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,470
It must be Qiaoyan.

615
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,510
You open the door first.

616
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,310
I'm going to fetch the clothes.

617
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,600
Then I'll give him a hot meal.

618
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,840
I have to make him a new one.

619
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,550
How can he have leftovers?

620
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,720
Mrs. He.

621
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,680
Mr. He

622
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,800
asked me to send them to you

623
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
What about He Qiaoyan?

624
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,230
Mr. He and Minister Lin have been to meet

625
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,800
a very important partner.

626
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,920
Mr. He said

627
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,430
he allows you stay at home with your parents.

628
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,550
He grants you days off.

629
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,800
All right.

630
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:00,680
Thank you.

631
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,600
Secretary Zhong.

632
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,150
What about staying for dinner?

633
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:04,880
No, thanks.

634
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,150
If there's nothing wrong with Mrs. He,

635
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,080
I got to go.

636
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,390
I'm fine.

637
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,640
I am ok.

638
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,550
Goodbye!

639
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,150
Lao Qin!

640
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,960
Meeting Song Yuan tonight

641
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,150
is a right choice.

642
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,920
Because of Song Yuan's recommendation,

643
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,960
Mr. Jia is so agreeable

644
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,800
to meet us.

645
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,310
By the way,

646
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,840
when we get back tonight,

647
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,110
Let's get ready in details.

648
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,510
At ten o'clock tomorrow morning,

649
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,430
when we meet Mr. Jia,

650
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,840
try to get the deal done.

651
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,600
Don 't worry.

652
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,000
Doctor,

653
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,150
how's my dad?

654
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,760
Infective endocarditis.

655
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,150
He's in critical condition.

656
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,880
And the patient is old.

657
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,800
All the body functions decline.

658
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,760
Besides,

659
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,390
He also had mitral regurgitation,

660
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,390
and carotid artery occlusion.

661
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,640
So the risk of surgery is relatively high.

662
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,350
Is there another way?

663
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,960
For now,

664
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,680
there is no better way.

665
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,430
There are certain risks in the operation.

666
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,510
But the more you delay, the greater the risk.

667
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,640
I hope the family members can make a decision as soon as possible.

668
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,390
Mom.

669
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:37,920
Doctor.

670
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,510
Go and call someone.

671
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:40,880
Mom.

672
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Lao Qin.

673
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,430
You are breaking your words.

674
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,230
You once said that

675
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,920
no matter what happens,

676
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,040
you're always with me.

677
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,680
Please wake up.

678
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,310
Mom.

679
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,760
Don't do that.

680
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,800
The doctor says your blood pressure is too high.

681
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,000
What about your father?

682
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,840
What do we do?

683
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,550
Yue’er.

684
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,840
Aunt.

685
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,510
Don't be panic.

686
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,760
Uncle will be fine.

687
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,600
Xiaobao.

688
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,150
Let's go.

689
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,350
Xiaobao, everything is ok.

690
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,230
You've been in hospital because of getting a cold before,

691
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,880
haven't you?

692
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,550
Grandpa

693
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,550
didn't eat healthily

694
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,680
and didn't sleep well,

695
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,000
so he had a cold.

696
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,230
But the cold he has this time

697
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,150
is more serious.

698
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,350
He needs to be hospitalized.

699
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,110
Don't worry, Xiaobao.

700
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,000
Ok?

701
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,840
Mom needs to be here

702
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,270
with grandparents.

703
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,640
You go home with Aunt Yang first

704
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,000
to meet Dad, ok?

705
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,190
Xiaobao is so good.

706
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,390
Ruowei.

707
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,190
I'd like to trouble you for another trip.

708
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:32,880
Don 't worry.

709
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,510
I'll be here as soon as I send Xiaobao home.

710
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,430
Come on.

711
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,760
Say goodbye to Mom.

712
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Bye.

713
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,960
Xiaobao.

714
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,230
Mrs. Liu, here.

715
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,600
Xiaobao.

716
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,920
Aunt has something else to do.

717
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,840
I have to go first.

718
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,840
You listen to what Mom has said.

719
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Go to bed,

720
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,680
okay?

721
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:02,880
I got to go.

722
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,430
Mrs. Liu.

723
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,720
Thank you, Miss Yang.

724
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,150
Xiaobao.

725
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,350
Xiaobao.

726
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,230
Isn't there a holiday for you two?

727
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,760
Why did you come back alone?

728
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,680
It was Miss Yang who sent Xiaobao back.

729
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,150
Yang Ruowei?

730
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:17,880
Yes.

731
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,190
Get on with what you are doing.

732
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,080
Ok.

733
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,680
Xiaobao.

734
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,470
Why mommy

735
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,600
didn't come back with you?

736
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,680
Grandpa is sick.

737
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,680
Serious?

738
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,390
He needs to have an operation.

739
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,760
Your father's condition

740
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,550
is developing rapidly.

741
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,040
If it goes on like this,

742
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,110
the risk will be higher.

743
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,040
You need to make a decision quickly.

744
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,840
Mom.

745
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,230
The risk of the operation is very high.

746
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
What did the doctor say?

747
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,470
If not,

748
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,230
it will only continue to deteriorate.

749
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,150
I don't know what to do.

750
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,000
Dad is ill.

751
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,550
Mom's down, too.

752
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
I, alone,

753
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,680
don't know what to do.

754
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,800
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

755
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,390
Because I don't have time

756
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,190
to take care of them.

757
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,390
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

758
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,880
You did a good job.

759
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,640
Believe me.

760
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,880
Everything will be ok.

761
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,680
Yiyue.

762
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,800
You take Xiaobao in first.

763
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,040
Secretary Zhong,

764
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,080
please contact me with

765
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,270
the GMN Medical Center's

766
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,110
Professor Xu.

767
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,389
I just got in touch with

768
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:28,270
the well-known experts and teams in China.

769
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,800
They'll come here as fast as they can

770
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,110
with the best team

771
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,040
to assist the operation.

772
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,880
Will he be fine?

773
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,719
Don't worry.

774
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,760
They've just made

775
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,110
a remote preliminary diagnosis.

776
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,960
Although the condition is serious,

777
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,270
there is still room to recover.

778
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
Hello, Dr. Liu.

779
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,040
I am a family member of the patient.

780
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,350
The thing is,

781
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,270
may I ask you can we

782
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,719
directly transfer the patient to ICU

783
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,719
to do monitoring?

784
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,270
In addition,

785
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,389
I have the best

786
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,270
medical team.

787
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,270
They're on their way

788
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,960
to assist you.

789
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,840
As for this matter,

790
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,150
the Dean has told me.

791
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,040
For your family's condition,

792
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,230
we're also working through the night.

793
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,640
As for your request,

794
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,600
we will try our best to cooperate.

795
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,310
If the operation is confirmed,

796
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,600
please sign it.

797
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,920
And we can arrange

798
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,040
the operating room and medical personnel.

799
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,960
Ok.

800
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,720
Thank you.

801
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,230
Not at all.

802
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,350
Mom.

803
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,550
Trust me.

804
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,190
Thank you a lot.

805
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,310
Qiaoyan.

806
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,350
Thank you.

807
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,470
Without you,

808
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,720
Yueyue and I

809
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,350
wouldn't know what to do.

810
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,510
Mom.

811
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,550
You don't have to say that.

812
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,040
Just let

813
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,000
me and Yiyue do that.

814
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,680
What you need the most now

815
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,680
is to take care of your body,

816
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,640
and have a good rest.

817
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,000
Ruowei,

818
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,390
I have to trouble you

819
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,680
to stay with Yiyue for a while.

820
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,150
I'll send Xiaobao to school first,

821
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,800
and then take mom back to have a rest.

822
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,000
When it's ready,

823
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,840
I'll come back.

824
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,960
No.

825
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,390
I'm not going back.

826
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,550
I want to be with her Dad.

827
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,270
Mom.

828
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,960
Listen to Qiaoyan.

829
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,350
Xiaobao.

830
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,150
Go to school as a good boy.

831
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,000
Ok?

832
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,310
As Mr. He is here,

833
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,760
everything will be fine.

834
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,150
You wake up?

835
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,270
I brought you wonton.

836
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,110
You have ever said

837
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,150
it's unhealthy to have midnight snack, haven't you?

838
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,190
You remember it so clearly.

839
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,040
Today is an exception.

840
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,000
Your strength and energy

841
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,880
are both draining.

842
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,550
You need a nutritional supplement.

843
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,390
Thank you for today.

844
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,840
Why did you help me so much?

845
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,600
Because you are my wife.

846
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,080
Actually, you don't have to

847
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,080
help me so much.

848
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,600
We're just hiring partners.

849
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,550
It's unnecessary for you to fulfill any obligation.

850
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,080
Have it when it's still hot.

851
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,430
Or the wonton will be cold in a moment.

852
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,430
He Qiaoyan.

853
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,190
You haven't been at the company all day.

854
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,510
I heard about that

855
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,680
You and Miss Lin Wei

856
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,510
have ever been engaged.

857
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,600
Been engaged?

858
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,390
I just heard about it.

859
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,760
Lin family and He family have been friends for generations.

860
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,390
More than 20 years ago,

861
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,390
it did say that.

862
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
But it was just a joke.

863
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,600
I didn't take it seriously.

864
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,040
To be exact,

865
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,150
We've only known each other since childhood.

866
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,550
Why do you suddenly want to ask this?

867
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,000
This wonton is really delicious.

868
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,960
Would you like one, too?

869
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:45,840
It's too hot.

870
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,550
It's not hot anymore.

871
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,350
Is it delicious?

872
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,390
Not bad.

873
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,600
You eat more.
