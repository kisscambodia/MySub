(Life is unexpected and
what I wanted is not what I get)

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,639
Speak.

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,519
Well,

23
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,519
my childhood friends,

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,160
Cheng and Ying are getting married.

25
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,400
My family

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,839
wants to return to Yuyangli Village.

27
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,720
My mother...

28
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,000
My mother thinks that

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,039
since we're already married,

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,559
the relatives back at
Yuyangli Village

31
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:23,160
would like to meet you.

32
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:26,039
That's why she would like you
to return with me.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,160
I'm not going.

34
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,880
Why not?

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,279
Why should I?

36
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,199
Well,

37
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,039
I heard you haven't been
in a good mood lately.

38
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:39,000
Why not you just treat it as a getaway?

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
A getaway?

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,160
Your village is filthy and squalid.

41
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:44,679
Do you intend to comfort me
with this trip

42
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,080
or show me off

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,119
as a trophy back at your village?

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,800
Zhao Xiaoqian.

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,520
What's wrong?

46
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:51,600
Fine.

47
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,479
I understand.

48
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,759
You don't have to go.

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,160
I'm going home to inform my mother.

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,039
Is that good enough?

51
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,320
What's going on between
the both of you?

52
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,440
What do you mean?

53
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,399
I just embarrassed my family.

54
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,440
I'm just throwing a tantrum.

55
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,759
Why did you say that?

56
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,080
What exactly happened?

57
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:27,199
Did you know

58
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,039
what was written

59
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,039
on the lantern she brought home?

60
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,839
To cut all ties.

61
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,880
Is that what Xiaoman feels?

62
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,000
What else

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,919
could it mean?

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,720
She invited me to return to
Yuyangli Village with them

65
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,520
to attend a wedding ceremony.

66
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,240
This family

67
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,960
doesn't treat me with respect.

68
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Have you asked her about it?

69
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,119
Could there be any
misunderstanding in between?

70
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,639
Xiaoman doesn't seem like...

71
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,839
It doesn't matter.

72
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,440
She intends to cut all ties with me.

73
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,479
I should quit bothering her.

74
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,039
If it's truly a misunderstanding,

75
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,600
you should stop it before it's too late.

76
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,479
I'm playing chess.

77
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,039
It's just a wedding ceremony.

78
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,600
He wouldn't attend despite
how much I begged him.

79
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,039
He insulted weddings of our village...

80
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,639
Maoya.

81
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,119
Maoya.

82
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,880
Look.

83
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,919
Look.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,759
It's a huge rooster.

85
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,039
This is tonic meant for
Commandery Prince.

86
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,060
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

87
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:27,880
Trim the flowers well.

88
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:28,839
Hongsu,

89
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,359
is everything ready?

90
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:29,839
Yes.

91
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,440
Why is there a rooster in the mansion?

92
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,079
Lady Xie.

93
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,359
How atrocious.

94
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,799
Duke of Yongguo's death
anniversary is coming up.

95
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,839
The whole of the mansion

96
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,279
is solemnly prepping for the ceremony.

97
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,399
All you've done is fooling around.

98
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,440
How dare you bring in

99
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
such filthy creature?

100
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,640
The death anniversary
of Duke of Yongguo?

101
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,519
Hurry up.

102
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,359
Hurry up and throw

103
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:56,320
this filthy creature out.

104
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,359
Your Highness.

105
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:02,959
Your Highness.

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,399
What's going on?

107
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,519
Can't you see I'm reading?

108
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,320
Zhu Momo is picking on Lady Xie again

109
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:11,119
because she brought a rooster home.

110
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,920
A rooster?

111
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,480
Zhu Momo is in charge of
the household affairs.

112
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,559
There's nothing wrong
in disciplining Lady Xie.

113
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,640
You shouldn't hurt her

114
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:18,519
because of a misunderstanding again.

115
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,640
I don't like your tone of voice.

116
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,399
I'm hurt as well.

117
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,600
Am I that heartless?

118
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,399
You did not clarify the situation.

119
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,239
Lady Xie violated the rules

120
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,239
and brought filthy creatures
into the mansion.

121
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,799
According to the rules,

122
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,239
she should be punished severely.

123
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,239
Zhu Momo!

124
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,600
Your Highness,

125
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:08,519
Lady Xie brought such a vile creature

126
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,839
into the front yard.

127
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,519
I'm afraid such an act will collide

128
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,200
with the spirit of late Duke of Yongguo.

129
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:19,839
My mother acquired this rooster
from the Temple of Confucius.

130
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,359
I was told to boil soup
from it for you and Xingzhou

131
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,160
as replenishment.

132
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:23,959
Besides,

133
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,239
a rooster is believed to bring luck.

134
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,279
All right.

135
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,640
I understand.

136
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,079
I'll punish her on your behalf.

137
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,200
I shall cook you up.

138
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,760
Wait a minute.

139
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,079
I need to ask you something.

140
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,640
What's it that you wanted to ask?

141
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,359
What's it called?

142
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,720
Who?

143
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:16,640
The rooster.

144
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:20,119
Why would you name a rooster?

145
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,559
What are you trying to ask?

146
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,000
Is this about its name?

147
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,080
(Lotus Garden)

148
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,040
Forget it.

149
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,160
It shall be named

150
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,720
Zhao Shengwu.

151
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,880
We had a horse named
Shengwu in the past.

152
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,279
It was a horse.

153
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,119
This is a rooster.

154
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,839
Why would you grant the rooster a name?

155
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,880
What's wrong?

156
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,079
Can't roosters have names, too?

157
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,920
Besides, this rooster
belongs to Xingzhou.

158
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,040
Xingzhou is my learning partner.

159
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,320
The rooster would be my partner, too.

160
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,359
It has to bear my last name.

161
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,079
What in the world is wrong with you?

162
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,040
That lantern...

163
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,480
What do you mean?

164
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,000
Does your mother really

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,079
want me to head to Yiyangli Village?

166
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,480
You're acting really strange recently.

167
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,559
You're really fickle.

168
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,839
I'm terrified.

169
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,519
Is it because

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,480
of Duke of Yongguo?

171
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:28,760
If you're upset,

172
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,320
you don't have to go.

173
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,320
I told my mother...

174
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,440
You sure are noisy.

175
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,140
(Lotus Garden)

176
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:45,239
Forget it.

177
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:46,919
I'll go.

178
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,119
I'll ask you after the trip.

179
00:08:59,239 --> 00:08:59,799
Watch the rooster.

180
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,559
Do not look at me.

181
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,559
Zhao Shengwu, come here.

182
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,000
Mr. Liangji.

183
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,039
Besides serving His Highness,

184
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,679
I have to serve the horse.

185
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,559
Now, I'll have to serve
a rooster as well.

186
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,159
Life is hard.

187
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,599
What a pity.

188
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,080
Look at how plump the rooster is.

189
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:33,880
Bite it.

190
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,039
Bite its side.

191
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:37,799
Go on. Bite on it.

192
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,640
Bite it.

193
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,239
Bite it.

194
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:42,239
Bite it.

195
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,119
Awesome!

196
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,119
Fetch the money.

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,559
Here, Overlord Yan.

198
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,520
Apparently, Xu Shu from
the academy next door

199
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,159
organised a cricket competition.

200
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,359
All nobilities of the academy

201
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,640
received an invitation.

202
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,080
A cricket competition?

203
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,400
Didn't you receive it?

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,840
That can't be.

205
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,080
You're a son of a bureaucrat.

206
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,440
That can't be.

207
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,479
I'm not surprised.

208
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:18,239
A son of bureaucrat

209
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,719
has been following Commandery Prince
around like a lapdog.

210
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:22,479
Do you know what it means?

211
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,359
He was given great opportunities,

212
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,799
but he'd rather behave like a lapdog.

213
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,320
Eventually,

214
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,840
he'd be belittled and berated.

215
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,640
You're spewing nonsense.

216
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:34,039
I shall attend the event
with Zhao Xiaoqian tomorrow.

217
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,039
I'll show you

218
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,840
what true brotherhood means.

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,320
Prepare the cash.

220
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,200
I'd empty your pockets then.

221
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,440
Let's go, Overlord Yan.

222
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:32,799
Mother.

223
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,080
Why are you bringing
along roosters and ducks?

224
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,479
There are plenty at Yuyangli Village.

225
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,039
It's fine.

226
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,239
I can handle it.

227
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,760
They are here.

228
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,440
They are here.

229
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,200
Madam Xie.

230
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,359
They are here, Madam Xie.

231
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,000
We are here.

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,679
We are here.

233
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Madam Liu.

234
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,440
Madam Xie.

235
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:12,640
Greetings, chief.

236
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,359
Greetings.

237
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:16,960
You're finally here.

238
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,119
How are you doing?

239
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,239
We're doing great.

240
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,960
That's good.

241
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,119
What do you think?

242
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,239
What a perfect pair.

243
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,080
We're at the presence
of the great Commandery Prince.

244
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:28,440
Pardon our failure to welcome
Your Highness appropriately.

245
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,919
Please rise, chief.

246
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,359
I'm here

247
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,760
at Yuyangli Village as a son-in-law.

248
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,239
Spare the formalities.

249
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,200
Yes, Your Highness.

250
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,559
Maoya did marry a man of prominence.

251
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,119
You're right.

252
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,400
Men from the city

253
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
are different indeed.

254
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,159
Chief.

255
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:44,760
Chief.

256
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,559
The banquet is starting.

257
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,799
Let's enter the courtyard.

258
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,479
Sure.

259
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,200
The banquet begins.

260
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,880
Your Highness.

261
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,159
This way, please.

262
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,119
Let's go.

263
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,640
Please, Your Highness.

264
00:12:58,599 --> 00:12:59,960
It looks comfortable.

265
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,239
You're all grown up.

266
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,640
Your Highness,

267
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,320
have some food.

268
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,080
Thank you.

269
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,640
Enjoy yourselves.

270
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:06,440
Here.

271
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,960
Thank you.

272
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,919
There's no good food
here in the village.

273
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,039
Your Highness.

274
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,679
These are fowls of the village.

275
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,440
Thank you.

276
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,159
Thank you.

277
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,039
Enjoy.

278
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,200
Here's a toast to you.

279
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,640
Cheng, is it time for a toast?

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,280
His Highness

281
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,119
is greatly concerned about Xiaoman.

282
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,039
Finishing this cup of wine
should be fine, right?

283
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,119
Quit standing around.
Hurry up and offer a toast.

284
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,479
May you be blessed with sons.

285
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,520
They are nobilities of the city.

286
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,080
They aren't used to our crude wine.

287
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,039
Isn't that right?

288
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,080
It's fine. Cheers.

289
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,719
Here's a toast to you.

290
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,280
May you be blessed with a son.

291
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,479
Thank you, Your Highness.

292
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,679
Your Highness,

293
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,559
please enjoy.

294
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:02,840
Feel free

295
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,159
to eat to your heart's content.

296
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,359
Go ahead.

297
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,840
Cheng.

298
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:09,359
Fellow guests.

299
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:09,919
Cheng.

300
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:11,679
Cheng,

301
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,359
can you request His Highness

302
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,400
to act as the host

303
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,719
to receive the bride?

304
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,520
Father,

305
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,320
what are you thinking?

306
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,640
He's the Commandery Prince.

307
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,840
His Highness can't possibly
act as our wedding host.

308
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,000
How would you know that
if you never tried?

309
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,599
On behalf of Maoya,

310
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,479
His Highness came all the way here.

311
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:26,599
Hurry up.

312
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,280
Father, you...

313
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,520
Listen to me.

314
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:28,960
Well...

315
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,000
You...

316
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,559
Your Highness,

317
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,400
my father would like Your Highness

318
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,840
to act as the host of our wedding.

319
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,320
That way, the harvest
will increase by the year.

320
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,400
That's right.

321
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,280
Is Your Highness willing to

322
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,760
receive my bride from the residence?

323
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,239
Sure.

324
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,200
I'm eternally grateful.

325
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,599
Thank you, Your Highness.

326
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:50,679
Your Highness,

327
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,520
please come with me.

328
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:53,840
Go on.

329
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,719
Enjoy yourselves.

330
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,679
Go along.

331
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,280
All right.

332
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,599
Look at my son-in-law.

333
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:58,520
He sure is great.

334
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,119
Thank you, Your Highness.

335
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:01,119
Let's drink up.

336
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,359
Cheers.

337
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:02,919
Cheers.

338
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,880
Drink up.

339
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,479
Chief, let's drink.

340
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:05,960
Here.

341
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,359
All right.

342
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:06,880
Cheers.

343
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,799
Xiaoman,

344
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,000
we haven't seen each
other in a long time.

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,799
Isn't that right?

346
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,320
If it wasn't for sister's marriage,

347
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,479
we wouldn't be able to meet you.

348
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,479
That's right.

349
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,440
Well, here I am.

350
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,599
Just now,

351
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,119
I sneaked a peek at Commandery Prince.

352
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,919
His Highness is
charming and attractive.

353
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,520
He's hundred times better than Cheng.

354
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,400
I can't wait for the harvest

355
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,280
during spring next year.

356
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,000
Cheng should get a change of face, too.

357
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,919
Don't say that.

358
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,119
I envy you on the contrary.

359
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,119
You may get married to Cheng

360
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,119
openly.

361
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,440
Although the village

362
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,919
isn't as wealthy as Wujiang Prefecture,

363
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,119
I know that Cheng

364
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:45,119
will only love you for
the rest of his life.

365
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,400
I genuinely desire to be with him.

366
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,799
He doesn't have the guts to mistreat me.

367
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,599
Look at you.

368
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,479
Xiaoman,

369
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,760
you're great at hairdressing.

370
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,000
I want you

371
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,039
to dress my hair for me today.

372
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,080
All right.

373
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,280
Let's see.

374
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:10,919
Your Highness,

375
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,880
please give me a moment.

376
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,440
I'll call for Your Highness
once it's ready.

377
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:17,599
Cheng.

378
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:18,880
Cheng.

379
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,000
Xiaoman,

380
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,960
are you and His Highness

381
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,679
in love?

382
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,919
Don't be ridiculous.

383
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,200
I...

384
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,599
I...

385
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,520
I don't know.

386
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,400
Actually,

387
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,640
we signed a contract of two years.

388
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,559
We agreed

389
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,640
to part ways after two years.

390
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:48,919
In the end,

391
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,280
we aren't a real couple.

392
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:52,719
I beg of you

393
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:54,440
not to make fun of me.

394
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,320
That's enough. Forget it.

395
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,719
You asked me to host
the wedding previously.

396
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,080
Now that
the Commandery Prince is here,

397
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,280
you're fawning over His Highness.

398
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,280
Cheng,

399
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,479
well done.

400
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:05,280
Come on.

401
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,239
Don't say that.

402
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,359
It's my big day today.

403
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,840
Don't ruin the mood.

404
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,239
Was I wrong?

405
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,439
Maoya doesn't even
have feelings for His Highness.

406
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,359
She must be coveting
after his power and wealth.

407
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,479
I overheard Xiaoman telling Qiao that

408
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,560
the both of them

409
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,160
live separated lives.

410
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,920
I bet you didn't know.

411
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,400
Previously,

412
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,239
Maoya was caught in a

413
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,359
frivolous scandal.

414
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,199
Nobody would be able to
accept a woman like that.

415
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,560
Like I said,

416
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,439
a woman will turn foul
once she enters the city.

417
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,920
Who could have thought
that Xie Xiaoman

418
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,560
who grew up prude in the village

419
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,239
would end up behaving
promiscuously at the city?

420
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,800
Besides,

421
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,760
he only holds a mere title.

422
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,920
According to the tutor,

423
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:43,199
by the hands of the late Emperor,
his brother was...

424
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,359
Your Highness.

425
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,439
Your Highness.

426
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,479
Right now, we are

427
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,160
considered...

428
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,439
What's it?

429
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,640
Our feelings could be considered

430
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,319
mutual.

431
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,599
His Highness is beating someone up.

432
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,640
His Highness is beating someone up.

433
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,119
His Highness is beating someone up.

434
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,000
Let's go check it out.

435
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,680
Let's go.

436
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,319
Stay right there!

437
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,239
Your Highness, please stop!

438
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,079
Please stop!

439
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,439
Please stop!

440
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,400
He...

441
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,640
Please stop hitting him!

442
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,120
- Please...
- Get over here.

443
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:23,839
Come here!

444
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,520
Stop hitting him!

445
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,319
What are you doing?

446
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,680
Zhao Xiaoqian!

447
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,520
Your Highness!

448
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,479
Zhao Xiaoqian!

449
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,079
Zhao Xiaoqian, are you out of your mind?

450
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,319
Ask him what he said!

451
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Repeat your words if you dare!

452
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,560
What are you going to do about it?

453
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,319
Xie Xiaoman,

454
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,319
what's wrong with your husband?

455
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,800
I did not say anything.

456
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,839
He came up and hit me right away.

457
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,040
I'm being accused.

458
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,560
How dare you?

459
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,040
Zhao Xiaoqian, what are you doing?

460
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,560
Why did you hit him?

461
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,640
I went easy on you.

462
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,040
It's someone else's wedding.

463
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,400
This wedding is

464
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,239
once in a life time for Ying.

465
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,400
How could you mess it up?

466
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,839
What did he say? Tell me!

467
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,800
Why did you hit him?

468
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,160
The wedding means nothing.

469
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
You still do not admit

470
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,880
we're husband and wife anyway.

471
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,560
You still insisted on
cutting ties with me!

472
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,640
Zhao Xiaoqian,

473
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,239
let's talk it out.

474
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:07,800
Do not touch me!

475
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,760
My brother's death anniversary
is coming up.

476
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,160
I'm in a bad mood.

477
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
I've caused a commotion.

478
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,800
My apologies.

479
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,079
Zhao Xiaoqian.

480
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,560
Xiaoman.

481
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,040
Son-in-law.

482
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,520
Why did the fight break out?

483
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,400
When I was fixing the garland
on His Highness,

484
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,760
I noticed he was clothed

485
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,680
in white garments.

486
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:41,760
I suppose

487
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,800
he's mourning as the death
anniversary of his family

488
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:45,920
is coming up.

489
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,920
His Highness came

490
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,239
to the village to attend my wedding.

491
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,680
I'm more than grateful.

492
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,880
I do not want this incident

493
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,800
to affect your relationship.

494
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,560
Mourning?

495
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,359
Did you say something
about Duke of Yongguo?

496
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,839
Yes, what's wrong with that?

497
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,760
Shut your pile hole.

498
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,520
How dare you?

499
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,400
Maoya!

500
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,479
What do you think you're doing?

501
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,599
I told you to squat by the walls!

502
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,040
It hurts!

503
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,280
You ran your mouth!

504
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,880
You're a man yet

505
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,680
you can barely keep your mouth shut!

506
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,160
You deserve to squat by the wall
for the rest of your life

507
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,119
for gossiping!

508
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,400
Chief,

509
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,160
give him a good beating later.

510
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,079
I am

511
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,239
conveying this message on behalf
of the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

512
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,119
The Commandery Prince's Mansion
will pay for the damages.

513
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,599
Well...

514
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:29,920
You may go on.

515
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,359
Excuse me.

516
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,560
I'm going after him.

517
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,560
Xiaoman,

518
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
wait for your mother

519
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,880
and take the carriage.

520
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,319
After passing by Xiongjie Camp,

521
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,079
there's a passage on your left.

522
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,680
Xiongjie Camp?

523
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,040
Xiongjie Camp under
the command of Xu Zi?

524
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,920
My mother will remain at the banquet.

525
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,319
She should take the carriage.

526
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,319
I would like to drop by Xiongjie Camp.

527
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Do you have a cart?

528
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,479
Yes.

529
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,119
Your Highness.

530
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:00,920
Your Highness.

531
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,920
The carriage was left behind
for Lady Xie and her family.

532
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,359
It's a long journey.

533
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,599
Is Your Highness planning
to return by foot?

534
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,359
I'll walk.

535
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,359
Anyway,

536
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,920
Master Yan's servant, Douzi,
delivered a letter.

537
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,880
He would like you to join him

538
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,040
in the cricket fight
at the brothel tonight.

539
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,560
He insists that you attend.

540
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,640
All right.

541
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,000
I'll meet him at the brothel tonight.

542
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,760
By the way,

543
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,479
how far is the next relay station?

544
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:30,920
It's up ahead.

545
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,680
Is this the Xiongjie Camp?

546
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:01,880
Hold it right there.

547
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,160
Who are you?

548
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:12,880
I...

549
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm the concubine of
Commandery Prince of Julu.

550
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,359
I would like to meet
Grand Commandant Xu Zi.

551
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:23,560
One!

552
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:26,640
Two!

553
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,880
Three!

554
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,160
Is there any reconnaissance
on the route

555
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,000
to the city in the last couple of days?

556
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,000
One!

557
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,160
General,

558
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,359
the bandits are cunning and ruthless.

559
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,920
They robbed multiple households.

560
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,839
However,
among the soldiers we dispatched,

561
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,359
none of them was able
to track them down.

562
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,800
Two days ago, I made the soldiers
disguised as students.

563
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,160
They managed to figure it out.

564
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,680
They did not expose themselves at all.

565
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,839
One!

566
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:54,640
General,

567
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:55,920
a visitor seeks an audience.

568
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,160
Three!

569
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
I'm Xie Xiaoman.

570
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,160
I'm the concubine of
Commandery Prince of Julu.

571
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Greetings, general.

572
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,319
One!

573
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,680
Concubine?

574
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:19,319
A concubine has the guts to question me?

575
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,119
The Commandery Prince's Mansion

576
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,000
sure is lenient.

577
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,640
I'm here for a reason.

578
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,760
Punish me as you see fit, general.

579
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,239
All I want to find out

580
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:35,719
is what happened between

581
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:36,959
Duke of Yongguo and
Commandery Prince of Julu.

582
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,359
Why would His Highness...

583
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,040
Silence.

584
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,839
How dare you question about
the matters of Duke of Yongguo?

585
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,119
You're a mere lady,

586
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,000
but you sure are bold.

587
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,319
You intruded an army camp on your own

588
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,760
and came directly to question me.

589
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:54,599
Are you aware

590
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,439
that if I keep you imprisoned here,

591
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,560
Zhao Xiaoqian would not
be able to get you out?

592
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,800
I'm well aware.

593
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,959
You're His Highness' master.

594
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:06,560
He'd never rebel against your will.

595
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,839
However, I came

596
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,760
for this purpose.

597
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,319
If I do not obtain an answer,

598
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
I'm not going anywhere.

599
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:14,839
Fine.

600
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,920
I would like to find out

601
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,239
on what rights do you
have to question me.

602
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,479
General, you intend

603
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,880
to capture the bandits
along this area.

604
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,079
I'm willing to offer myself as bait

605
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,560
to aid the capture.

606
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,073
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

607
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,160
Douzi came by and said

608
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,800
Master Yan

609
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,079
is already waiting for
Your Highness at the brothel.

610
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,560
Fetch me my cricket.

611
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,719
I shall depart now.

612
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,599
Has Lady Xie returned to the city?

613
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,800
Yes.

614
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,760
The coachman said that

615
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,119
Lady Xie came back,

616
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,640
but she went to

617
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,439
Xiongjie Camp.

618
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:58,959
Xiongjie Camp?

619
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,319
What is she doing there?

620
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:02,760
Your Highness.

621
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:03,839
It's ready.

622
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,479
Bandits?

623
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,560
It's impossible for Wujiang Prefecture
to be infiltrated by bandits.

624
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,959
General Xu is guarding the city.

625
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,239
What are you talking about?

626
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,079
Your Highness.

627
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
What are you talking about?

628
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,959
(Notice)
This was issued by the magistrate.

629
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,359
It requests

630
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,199
Your Highness to minimise travelling

631
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:26,000
out of the city.

632
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,520
Prepare my horse!

633
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,079
Prepare the horse!

634
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:29,920
Hurry up!

635
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,940
(Brothel)

636
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,920
Why isn't Zhao Xiaoqian here yet?

637
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:42,280
Master,

638
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,560
you brought the cricket

639
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
to the academy

640
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,359
and had your share of fun.

641
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:48,800
Should we

642
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,560
return home right now?

643
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,520
I...

644
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,439
Old Master Yan will be
enraged if he finds out.

645
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:54,800
You're such a coward.

646
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,400
Xu Shu

647
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,119
is clearly underestimating me.

648
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,079
Regardless, today is the day

649
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,000
I must stand up for myself.

650
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:02,680
What...

651
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,199
What if we lost?

652
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,079
Do not jinx it.

653
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,520
Cut the crap.

654
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,079
Zhao Xiaoqian

655
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,280
would be bringing Zhao Jinguo over.

656
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,160
It's impossible to lose.

657
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:11,800
Give it to me.

658
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:13,040
I'm going to place my bets.

659
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,439
Master.

660
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,119
Hurry up.

661
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,160
All right.

662
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,959
Implore him to hurry up.

663
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:25,640
Go on.

664
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,800
Seriously.

665
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,560
Attack!

666
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:33,880
- Attack.
- Yours is weak.

667
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,520
Look at it.

668
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:36,920
Get out of the way.

669
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Let me.

670
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,040
Another round.

671
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,199
Come on.

672
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:41,880
What is it called?

673
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,839
What a cricket.

674
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:43,959
It's strong.

675
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:47,280
My cricket is called Jin Pipa.

676
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,800
That rascal

677
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,239
really showed up.

678
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,280
Come on.

679
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,239
Come on.

680
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,920
I'm going to show you

681
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,359
who calls the shot around
Wujiang Prefecture.

682
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,760
Attack.

683
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,800
No one can mess with me.

684
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,000
Attack.

685
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,160
Attack its side.

686
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,800
Attack.

687
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,199
What are you doing?

688
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:11,160
It wasn't over.

689
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,880
The table is reserved.

690
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,680
Move aside.

691
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,119
Isn't this Yan Boyang?

692
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,119
Why are you here instead of keeping

693
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,160
Commandery Prince company tonight?

694
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,560
I was wondering who reserved the table.

695
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,800
It was you.

696
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:25,760
What's the matter?

697
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,880
You haven't gotten your
back kicked enough?

698
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,160
That's another matter on its own.

699
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,560
Yan Boyang,

700
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,160
should we

701
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,959
play a special round?

702
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,760
I'll add on 50 strings of 1000 cash.

703
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:39,079
If I lost, I'd call you my grandfather.

704
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,280
What do you think? Are you up for it?

705
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,560
Place your bets.

706
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,640
Agree to his offer.
What are you afraid of?

707
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,040
You're a man.

708
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,560
Hurry up and make your decision.

709
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:48,359
Hurry up.

710
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:48,959
Are you afraid of him?

711
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:49,719
Hurry up.

712
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:50,160
Hurry up.

713
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,839
Yan Boyang is used to acting as

714
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,439
Commandery Prince's lapdog.

715
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,520
He doesn't even have the guts
to bet on a cricket fight.

716
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,319
Forget it.

717
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,000
Get out of here.

718
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,880
What are you talking about?

719
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,760
Watch your mouth.

720
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,319
I'll join you.

721
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:02,479
Come on.

722
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,599
Come on.

723
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,880
Place your bets.

724
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:05,560
Come on.

725
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,239
Place your bets.

726
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:33,520
Lady,

727
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,439
you're beautiful.

728
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,439
Take her!

729
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,199
Yes!

730
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,359
Who's there?

731
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Show yourselves!

732
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:55,839
Are you all right?

733
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,920
I'm fine.

734
00:28:58,479 --> 00:28:59,599
Who are you?

735
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,239
Why are you sticking
your nose in my affairs?

736
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,319
Hanchen of the Zhao Family.

737
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:03,719
It's a pleasure to meet you.

738
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:05,839
Fine.

739
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:06,760
Charge!

740
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:09,719
Watch out.

741
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,199
Watch out.

742
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,839
Apprehend them all.

743
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,959
Do not move!

744
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:39,880
Move it.

745
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:40,760
Get up.

746
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,319
Master.

747
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,599
Capture them all.

748
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:53,719
Do you know how dangerous this is?

749
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,359
How long will you remain hiding
in Wujiang Prefecture?

750
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,959
Master, what you did

751
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,319
brought me shame.

752
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:34,959
I did not force her into this.

753
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,560
She volunteered herself.

754
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,959
Do you know

755
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,719
her reason for doing so?

756
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:47,359
She came to Xiongjie Camp alone today

757
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,239
just to ask me a question.

758
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,239
You suffered from the death
of Duke of Yongguo.

759
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:55,079
You're tormented by
the trauma day and night.

760
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,239
She asked me

761
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,400
what she can do for you.

762
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,359
Forget it.

763
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,000
Mere bandits

764
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,800
can't hurt the young lady.

765
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,319
Go home.

766
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,199
Sorry for the trouble.

767
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,880
Let's go.

768
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,599
Nobody knows what life holds.

769
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,079
A futile attempt to oppose fate

770
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,359
will only leave one in dismay.

771
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,079
Are you hungry?

772
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,079
Let's get some noodles.

773
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,160
Noodles are served.

774
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,560
Please enjoy.

775
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,560
Thank you.

776
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,400
Here.

777
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,119
When I was young,

778
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,160
I remember being hungry at night.

779
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,280
My brother was able to get me food

780
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,439
anywhere.

781
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
One particular night,

782
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,920
he got me a bowl of
noodles just like this one.

783
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,040
It was really delicious

784
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,400
just like this one.

785
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:06,560
Can you tell me

786
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,599
the stories of your childhood?

787
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,199
After this,

788
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,119
I'll take you somewhere.

789
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,719
Attack.

790
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:29,560
Attack.

791
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,119
Attack.

792
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:30,800
Bite it.

793
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,199
Attack.

794
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,079
Bite its side.

795
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,560
Attack.

796
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,719
Bite it.

797
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:36,719
Attack.

798
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,959
Attack.

799
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:38,280
Attack.

800
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,479
Attack.

801
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,000
Attack.

802
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,439
I'm telling you.

803
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,160
My cricket, Jin Pipa,

804
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,719
will win no matter what it takes.

805
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,280
Mingguan.

806
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:49,839
Bite it.

807
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,640
Bite it.

808
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:51,640
Attack.

809
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,839
Attack its side.

810
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:54,560
Bite it.

811
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,920
Bite it.

812
00:33:59,319 --> 00:33:59,719
Come on.

813
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:00,640
Jin Pipa?

814
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,439
I had high expectations.

815
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,239
That's right.

816
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,079
Yan Boyang,

817
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,239
it's your unlucky day today.

818
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:08,280
Pay up.

819
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:10,560
It's too early to get excited.

820
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,959
Zhao Xiaoqian will be here soon.

821
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:15,000
He shall defeat everyone

822
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,600
with his cricket, Zhao Jinguo.

823
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,439
You're bluffing.

824
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:19,399
You're bluffing.

825
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,280
Yan Boyang,

826
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,000
you should focus on paying the bet.

827
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,439
In my opinion,

828
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,800
to Commandery Prince,

829
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,120
you're but a mere dog.

830
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,959
Let's see if he'd show up tonight.

831
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,439
To His Highness, you're probably

832
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,239
less than a dog.

833
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,560
Jerk!

834
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,600
I'll kill you!

835
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,399
How could you hit him?

836
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,520
Stay put.

837
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,000
Let me go.

838
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,879
You wanted to hit me, didn't you?

839
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,399
Fetch the pledge.

840
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
You...

841
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,399
I'm warning you.

842
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,080
I'm giving you three days.

843
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,040
If you do not pay me,

844
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,399
I'll submit this pledge
to the magistrate.

845
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:13,719
You should know that

846
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,520
His Majesty is eliminating
corrupted officials now.

847
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,679
Your entire household
will be implicated then.

848
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,719
Get out of here!

849
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,399
Get out of here!

850
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,239
Get lost!

851
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,239
Move it.

852
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,000
Leave.

853
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:25,040
Leave.

854
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,679
Get lost.

855
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:28,199
Quit embarrassing yourself.

856
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:28,919
Get out of here.

857
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,919
Get lost.

858
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,239
When I was young,

859
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,000
whenever Shengwu was upset,

860
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,639
he would hide himself.

861
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,560
The attendants of the mansion
would panic.

862
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,199
They can't find him anywhere.

863
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,959
Shengwu's brother is the only
one that could find him.

864
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,159
He'd bring Shengwu to the rooftop.

865
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:53,239
He said,

866
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,239
whenever you're upset,

867
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,959
look up to the stars.

868
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,239
Afterward, both of them
entered the palace.

869
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:04,360
His father was no longer his father.

870
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,239
His father is now his royal uncle.

871
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,439
He could no longer climb up the rooftop

872
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,399
due to his distinguished identity.

873
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,520
There are many things
he can no longer do.

874
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,199
Back then, before they left,

875
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,159
their parents bid them farewell

876
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,919
and told them solemnly.

877
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,199
"From now on,

878
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,239
you and your brother are now
the sons of the Emperor.

879
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:27,000
In public,

880
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,159
do not ever bring up
the prince's mansion.

881
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:31,560
You're forbidden to
even think about it."

882
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,360
Back then, he was a young child.

883
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,159
He was reluctant to
part with his parents.

884
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:38,760
He had so much to say to them.

885
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,879
However, he was not allowed to.

886
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,239
He's forbidden from even bringing it up.

887
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,919
He can only write his words
down on the kite.

888
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:47,239
What happened after
they entered the palace?

889
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,479
After that,

890
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,000
the Empress suffered a miscarriage.

891
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,639
Brother fell ill for a long time.

892
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,959
That year, it was constantly

893
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
snowing at the capital.

894
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,239
It was really cold.

895
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,120
The Empress wanted to

896
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,560
perform a ritual for the late prince.

897
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:07,000
Her Highness employed budget
cuts through the palace.

898
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,600
We don't even have charcoal to
run the heater at our dwelling.

899
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:13,760
I sneaked into the Emperor's palace

900
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,760
and stole some charcoal
to warm brother up.

901
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,760
A small amount of fire

902
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,080
didn't make a difference.

903
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,639
Winter is agonising in the capital.

904
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,479
I vividly remember that day,

905
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,040
the entire palace was bustling.

906
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,919
Nobody cared about us.

907
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,239
I was the only one

908
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,199
who stayed by my brother's side.

909
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,879
I stayed by his side
all day and night.

910
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,000
I could never forget that day

911
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,239
at Wude Palace.

912
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:49,959
I would never forget

913
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,280
when my brother died,

914
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,679
he was barely 20 years old.

915
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,159
Your brother wouldn't
want to see you this way.

916
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,600
He wants you to live on

917
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:03,679
and move forward.

918
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,639
Stop dwelling in the past.

919
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,399
All right?

920
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:15,120
What about you?

921
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,360
Why did you go to Xiongjie Camp?

922
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,760
Was it for my sake?

923
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,719
I noticed how gloomy you were recently.

924
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,280
You're easily irritable, too.

925
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,760
I supposed it was because of
Duke of Yongguo's death anniversary.

926
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:29,879
I wanted to find out

927
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,159
what happened.

928
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,679
I wanted to help you.

929
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:34,639
Help me?

930
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,280
What can you help me with?

931
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,639
I'll help you to move on.

932
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,879
What's so funny?

933
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,479
You said you had
something to ask me then.

934
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,479
You said you were going to ask after
we return from Yuyangli Village.

935
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,120
What's that all about?

936
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:56,280
Well,

937
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:00,000
what do you mean by the lantern?

938
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,639
The lantern?

939
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,479
Congwen promised to return my lantern.

940
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:06,360
Congwen?

941
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,280
Yes.

942
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,919
Back then, Congwen was
bidding Courtesan Zhu farewell.

943
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,120
I couldn't stop
Courtesan Zhu as her

944
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,320
carriage rode away.

945
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,639
I handed the lantern to Congwen

946
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:17,800
so he could give it to Courtesan Zhu.

947
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,320
It was really urgent then.

948
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,239
I didn't give it out on purpose.

949
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,239
Do you believe me?

950
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,000
Believe me.

951
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,959
I was worried of upsetting you,

952
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,479
so I bought another one.

953
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,479
Are you mad?

954
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Where did you buy it from?

955
00:39:36,439 --> 00:39:37,479
At a stall by the streets.

956
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,600
There weren't many left.

957
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,120
I recall the store owner asking me

958
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:43,919
if I was certain about my purchase.

959
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,840
Did you check your purchase?

960
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,280
What are you laughing at?

961
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,840
I'm laughing at how silly you are.

962
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,959
What do you mean?

963
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:57,120
You're silly all over.

964
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:58,159
Zhao Xiaoqian.

965
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,479
Hanchen.

966
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:04,959
Hanchen.

967
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,280
You're still as mischievous as
you were back when we were kids.

968
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:10,120
Lingniang?

969
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,639
She just arrived tonight.

970
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,199
She insisted on meeting you

971
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,159
before leaving with us.

972
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,154
(Lotus Garden)

973
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,600
Lingniang

974
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,399
is the daughter of the officer
back at the capital.

975
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:35,840
What was his name?

976
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,360
His name is...

977
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:39,120
Shen Zunfu.

978
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,840
Yes, Shen Zunfu.

979
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,879
His daughter, Shen Zhaowen,

980
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,479
is Lingniang we speak of.

981
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,479
According to Mr. Liangji,

982
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:50,000
she grew up with His Highness.

983
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:52,159
Back at the palace...

984
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:53,919
Back at the palace...

985
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:55,879
Make yourself clear.

986
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:00,639
She's the goddaughter of the Empress.

987
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,399
She's granted the title of
Commandery Princess Rong'an.

988
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,479
She grew up with His Highness.

989
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,120
Previously, they even...

990
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,000
What did they do?

991
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:10,479
Mr. Liangji didn't continue.

992
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,639
Go on.

993
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:12,760
Get back to work.

994
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,199
What could that possibly mean?

995
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,800
They must have been
in love with each other then.

996
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,919
That can't happen.

997
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:25,120
You just got to sustain
your position at the mansion.

998
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:28,479
Commandery Princess Rong'an
appeared out of nowhere.

999
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,719
Why do you think

1000
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,000
a lady would

1001
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:33,280
travel all the way here?

1002
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,000
Zhao Xiaoqian must be the reason.

1003
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:37,120
I can't allow this.

1004
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,959
I must think of something

1005
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:40,800
for you to secure your position.

1006
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,479
Lady Xie.

1007
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,479
The garments for the Dance of Nuo

1008
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:45,639
are prepared for you.

1009
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,320
My hands are all red.

1010
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:48,879
What's that?

1011
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,840
Don't you know that?

1012
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,760
Before the civil examinations,
the academy

1013
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,919
has a tradition.

1014
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,760
The Dance of Nuo will be
performed to invite blessings.

1015
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,479
Then, we shall head to
Mount Kunyan Temple

1016
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,959
to pray for the success

1017
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:00,879
of the fellow candidates.

1018
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,199
We're supposed to dance?

1019
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:02,919
That's right.

1020
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:05,520
Apparently, we are to

1021
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,639
perform for the deceased
principal graduates.

1022
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:11,479
My mom told me

1023
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,399
the Dance of Nuo is a sacred ritual.

1024
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:15,760
We shall wear a mask
and hold a sword,

1025
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,959
and perform the dance as
a form of worship to the sages.

1026
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,479
The prayers of the goddesses

1027
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:22,239
are meant for the dead souls.

1028
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,800
Can the dead souls hear us?

1029
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,639
I'm not sure about that.

1030
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,280
However, I believe in such.

1031
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:33,879
Look. Besides prayers, rites

1032
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,000
are meant to commemorate
our family members

1033
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:37,639
and converse with

1034
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,439
the dead.

1035
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,000
The dance isn't something
we should focus on.

1036
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,479
Take it seriously.

1037
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:47,120
If we dwindle on like this,

1038
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,639
Zhao Xiaoqian

1039
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,639
might be charmed by Lingniang.

1040
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:51,959
I don't care about that.

1041
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:53,639
I have matters to attend to.

1042
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,600
Where are you going?

1043
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,479
Were you waiting for me?

1044
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,239
I need to talk to you.

1045
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,199
What's it?

1046
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,000
Minggu told me the academy is
hosting the ritual, Dance of Nuo.

1047
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:25,120
