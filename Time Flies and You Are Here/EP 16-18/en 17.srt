=Episode 17=

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
(Playing with my sword while drinking,
hearing the sound war wakes me up)

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,120
Don't be upset.

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,160
I dispatched all the employees

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,919
of Su Chang Ji to search for the Helu.

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,120
Look.

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,599
We're of noble households.

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,720
With so many employees,

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,800
I'll search the entire
Wujiang Prefecture.

28
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,519
I refuse to believe

29
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,080
that

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,239
we'll not get the sword back.

31
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,199
If it was that easy,

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,279
Zhao Xiaoqian wouldn't have

33
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:09,279
been enraged.

34
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,960
It's all my fault.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,919
If I was more cautious,

36
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,800
just a little more,

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,199
this wouldn't have happened.

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,759
Today is the day of the selection

39
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,919
to pick the main dancer.

40
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:25,520
Do not worry.

41
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,080
Let's remain positive.

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,759
We need to hurry to the brothel.

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,399
Yan Boyang

44
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,759
is gambling with Xu Shu

45
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
over a sword.

46
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,199
He is about to lose everything.

47
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,639
Is that true?

48
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,520
Let's hurry.

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,160
I'll check out the brothel.

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,440
Inform Zhao Xiaoqian.

51
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,279
Don't you have to head to the academy?

52
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,440
The sword

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,000
might not be the one you're looking for.

54
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,479
If you do not participate
in the selection,

55
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,880
you're going to lose
against Shen Zhaowen.

56
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,520
My goal

57
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,880
was never to defeat her.

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,960
Hurry up.

59
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,000
Xiaoman.

60
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,240
Let's go.

61
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,919
Xu Shu!

62
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,119
Big!

63
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:03,960
Open up!

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,160
Mr. Yan,

65
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,039
what's wrong?

66
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,960
You haven't had your
fair share of losses?

67
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,479
After Commandery Prince fed you,

68
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,639
you've returned to bark at me.

69
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,839
Cut the crap.

70
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:19,639
Let's play on the bet.

71
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,039
Before I could retrieve the Helu,

72
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,600
none of you are allowed to leave.

73
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,240
Bet?

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,160
What are you talking about?

75
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,600
You even lost your trousers to me.

76
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,559
Do you still want more?

77
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,720
Dream on.

78
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,399
Forget it.

79
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:28,960
Let's go.

80
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,520
Hold up.

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,919
Xiaoman?

82
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,759
This hairpin is made of Hetian Jade.

83
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,559
It's an valuable item of
the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

84
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,000
What do you say?

85
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,639
I'd place this as leverage.

86
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,880
Lady Xie,

87
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,039
we're rolling dice.

88
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,199
A mere lady like you

89
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,440
have no rights

90
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,279
to bet with me.

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,880
I'm a member
of Commandery Prince's Mansion.

92
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,119
It doesn't matter.

93
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,360
Even if the Commandery Prince
himself was here,

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,720
I cannot bend the rules.

95
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,960
Men,

96
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,360
bring up some good wine.

97
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,960
A person's tolerance for alcohol
depicts one's capabilities.

98
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,000
If you're able to finish
this jar of Meishou Wine,

99
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,559
I'll play the bet with you.

100
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,360
Fine.

101
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,480
I'll do it.

102
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,160
Sure.

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,679
However, it's up to me
if I'd place the Helu

104
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:19,480
as leverage.

105
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,480
Fine.

106
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:23,399
I'll drink.

107
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,640
Xiaoman.

108
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,160
How impressive.

109
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:43,079
You...

110
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,320
You rascal.

111
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,000
You tricked Yan Boyang to frame me.

112
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,079
I am not done with you.

113
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,000
Come on.

114
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,760
Hanchen,

115
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,559
she didn't mean it.

116
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,359
No one would wish for

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,040
something like that to happen.

118
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,359
We shouldn't harm the living

119
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,480
for a lifeless object.

120
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,359
A lifeless object?

121
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,239
Why do all of you think of

122
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,239
my brother's possession
as a lifeless object?

123
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,279
Your Highness.

124
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,799
Your Highness.

125
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,679
Lady Su insisted on
barging into the mansion.

126
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,760
Nobody could stop her.

127
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,920
Hold it right there.

128
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,480
What are you doing?

129
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,640
You are being rude!

130
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,040
This is the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

131
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,279
It's not a place for

132
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,679
a meagre peasant like you
to enter as you please.

133
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,079
I do not care even if you kill me.

134
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,399
I need to see Zhao Xiaoqian today.

135
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,119
You...

136
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:56,359
I...

137
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:56,799
Stop it!

138
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,600
What are you doing here?

139
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:03,679
Xiaoman and Boyang are caught
in trouble at the brothel.

140
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:04,920
You should head over immediately.

141
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,519
Brothel?

142
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,480
What are they doing there?

143
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,519
It's an emergency.

144
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,519
Quit asking unnecessary questions.

145
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,799
Don't you feel bad enough
for casting Xiaoman out?

146
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,799
She cried all night because of you.

147
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,519
In order to recover the Helu,

148
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,640
she headed straight to the brothel

149
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,519
to confront Xu Shu alone.

150
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,839
She's forsaking even her reputation.

151
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,160
What else do you want from her?

152
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,959
Your Highness,

153
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,839
do not believe this wench.

154
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,720
Xie Xiaoman lost the remnant
of the late Duke of Yongguo

155
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
and challenged Your Highness.

156
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,799
This peasant is Lady Xie's cousin.

157
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,920
You mustn't buy her lies.

158
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,399
Zhu Momo,

159
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,519
His Highness will have the say here.

160
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,040
She cried?

161
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,160
She did.

162
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,279
She was heart-broken.

163
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,119
Are you satisfied?

164
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,399
Prepare the horse.

165
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,600
Depart for the brothel.

166
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,279
Your Highness!

167
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
There are rules!

168
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:56,839
Xu Shu!

169
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,640
I'm extending the challenge.

170
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,760
If I win,

171
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,839
not only do I want the Helu back,

172
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,799
you

173
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:06,839
are going to offer three kowtows

174
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,959
as an apology to Zhao Xiaoqian.

175
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,079
What happens if you lose?

176
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,880
If I lose,

177
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,559
I'll kowtow three times before you.

178
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,279
All right.

179
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,640
Bet with her.

180
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
Accept her bet.

181
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,760
Accept her bet.

182
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,799
Accept it.

183
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:35,519
Xu Shu!

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,480
Open it.

185
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,440
Small.

186
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,119
Open up.

187
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:41,799
Three fours and a six.

188
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,600
It's the Xiaojinzhang.

189
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,040
That's four points.

190
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,679
That's awesome.

191
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,679
I have a good feeling about this.

192
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,600
I have a good feeling about this.

193
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,000
He'd win this round.

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,799
It's his win.

195
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,079
Come on.

196
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,200
Reveal it.

197
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,719
Open up.

198
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,200
Open.

199
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,840
It's the Hunjianglong!
It's a win by five points!

200
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,840
No way.

201
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,400
We won!

202
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,799
That's amazing.

203
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,599
That's right.

204
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,119
What do you think, Mr. Xu?

205
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,679
You didn't expect

206
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,239
a village girl like me

207
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:06,679
could roll the dice well.

208
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,119
You're a respectable man.

209
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,479
You should concede defeat.

210
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,359
Not only am I retrieving the Helu,

211
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,400
you are going to kowtow
three times before my husband

212
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,239
as an apology.

213
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:15,880
That's right.

214
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,200
You cheated.

215
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,679
They cheated.

216
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,679
Seize them!

217
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,760
We did not!

218
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,960
We did not cheat.

219
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,080
Clearly, it was you instead.

220
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,159
You went against your words.

221
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,880
You're shameless.

222
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,479
I'm going to beat you to pulp.

223
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,400
Commander Prince of Julu has arrived.

224
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,119
His Highness is here.

225
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,799
Your Highness.

226
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,320
My husband is here.

227
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,359
He bullied me.

228
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:44,840
What?

229
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,359
Are you trying to accuse my wife?

230
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:49,359
Are you even worthy?

231
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,159
Your Highness.

232
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,159
It's

233
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,719
Mr. Yan who lost the bet.

234
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:54,200
I can't embarrass myself

235
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,359
and give everything up.

236
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,320
Do you want it?

237
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:04,135
No, not at all.

238
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:04,960
Put it down.

239
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,080
Xiaoman.

240
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,039
You said, objects remain lifeless

241
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,640
while men were given life.

242
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,359
What do you mean?

243
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,599
Men cannot live forever in the past.

244
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,479
Everyone has to move on.

245
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:36,840
Here, Xiaoman.

246
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,080
Your Highness,

247
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:43,479
I beg your pardon.

248
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,919
Return home and inform your master

249
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,919
to meet me tonight.

250
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
If he doesn't show up, he's a loser.

251
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,599
Watch out.

252
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,039
How is she doing?

253
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,080
Your Highness.

254
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,799
Fortunately, it was Meishou Wine.

255
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:30,479
If she was given
other types of liquor,

256
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,320
she would have

257
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,440
caught a bad fever.

258
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:34,799
She was fed some hangover soup.

259
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:37,119
I'm afraid the alcohol is kicking in.

260
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,200
Just attend to her accordingly.

261
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,840
She will be fine once
the alcohol subsides.

262
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,359
All right.

263
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,559
Thank you.

264
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,239
I shall excuse myself.

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,559
Hanchen.

266
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,039
I...

267
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,599
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,359
Why are you sorry?

269
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,359
I...

270
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,239
I shouldn't have taken the Helu.

271
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,559
I shouldn't have

272
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,039
taken the Helu

273
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,960
from Xiaoman knowing
that it was with her.

274
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,760
I'm sorry.

275
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,039
Zhao Xiaoqian!

276
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,760
You deserve this!

277
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:35,880
Boyang.

278
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,280
After this blow,

279
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,960
this is over.

280
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,359
Do not bring this up again.

281
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,119
Boyang, are you all right?

282
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,559
I'm fine.

283
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,080
This peasant is treated like a princess.

284
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,599
I even have to take care of you.

285
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,640
Rascal.

286
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,679
Rascal.

287
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,640
Rascal.

288
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,000
Rascal.

289
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,919
You're so mean.

290
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,599
It's the day of the selection
for the main dancer.

291
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,479
You might miss it.

292
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,359
Will you be unhappy?

293
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,840
It's all right if you're upset.

294
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
The others perform

295
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,880
for Xingzhou and the rest.

296
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,239
You may perform it for me.

297
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,799
Isn't that right?

298
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,080
Lady Shen.

299
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,400
Young Master Shen...

300
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,359
Young Master Shen is here.

301
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,640
I interrogated Xu Shu.

302
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,239
He said you asked him to steal the Helu.

303
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,799
Why?

304
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:18,960
Spill it!

305
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,400
I just wanted to teach

306
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,640
Xie Xiaoman a lesson.

307
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,599
Shen Zhaowen,

308
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,000
I can't believe you resorted

309
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
to such lowly methods.

310
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,919
Do not forget who you are.

311
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,719
You and I both know why

312
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,280
Zhao Xiaoqian wouldn't
bring out the Helu.

313
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,719
The incident caused big troubles
back then.

314
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,080
Hanchen

315
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,719
hasn't been able to get over it!

316
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,640
Look at you.

317
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,239
For your own sake,

318
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,919
in order to sabotage Xiaoman,

319
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,799
you even had your eyes on the Helu.

320
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,239
Shen Zhaowen,

321
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,320
I haven't been away from the capital
for long,

322
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,080
yet you employed

323
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,520
such detestable means!

324
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,280
What do you know?

325
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,320
You left home when you were young.

326
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,000
You cared only about yourself.

327
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,960
You left without saying anything.

328
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,919
What about me?

329
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:01,880
What about me?

330
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
If Zhao Xiaoqian doesn't marry me,

331
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,200
I'll be sent to the palace.

332
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,880
All you do is chastise me.

333
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,559
You showed no concern for me.

334
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:11,919
Everyone

335
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,119
is only concerned about your future.

336
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,320
For the sake of your future,

337
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,840
I'm forced to enter the palace.

338
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,640
Why?

339
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,840
I'm still young!

340
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:29,840
Enter...

341
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,359
Enter the palace?

342
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,080
The Empress did not bear a son.

343
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,679
All Her Highness has is
an adopted Crown Prince.

344
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,559
The Crown Prince's
influence is deteriorating.

345
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,039
Noble Consort Zhang is in favour.

346
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,679
Guess what?

347
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,400
The Empress wants me to earn
His Majesty's favour on her behalf.

348
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,919
Father dare not disobey.

349
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,479
It's all for the sake of your future.

350
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,840
Young Master Shen,

351
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,039
Lady Shen suffered a lot at home.

352
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,160
I'm you're aware.

353
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,880
The issue of
Commandery Prince's concubine

354
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,719
has evoked commotion in the capital.

355
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,680
Your words

356
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,359
will only hurt Lady Shen more.

357
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,760
Besides, Xie Xiaoman has
to be eliminated anyway.

358
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:19,000
It's a good thing to sow discord between

359
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,839
Commandery Prince and her.

360
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,680
A family of aristocrats?

361
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,439
Wealth and honour?

362
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,000
Life of affluence and extravagance?

363
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,640
These can only be exchanged
with a woman's dignity.

364
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,319
At the capital,

365
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,599
the date of my wedding with

366
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,040
Hanchen has been decided.

367
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,160
If Xie Xiaoman isn't out of the picture,

368
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,560
are you going to

369
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,160
allow your sister to bear the shame of

370
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,199
losing against a concubine
for the rest of her life?

371
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:53,920
That's enough!

372
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,319
Do you think

373
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,160
what I did was despicable?

374
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,400
Lady Shen, do not say that.

375
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,119
We can't possibly enter the palace.

376
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,400
His Majesty is already in his fifties.

377
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,000
Your entire life would be gone.

378
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,719
Besides, Xie Xiaoman was the one

379
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:25,160
who crawled into
His Highness' bed first.

380
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:26,640
We...

381
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,520
We should...

382
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,160
We should fight for ourselves.

383
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,719
We should fight

384
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,880
for ourselves.

385
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,760
I'm running out of time.

386
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,119
I received news from the capital.

387
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,880
Princess Consort Pu has
entered the palace many times.

388
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:47,040
The Empress started to given in.

389
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:48,880
The marriage

390
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,239
would be final.

391
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,640
Do not give up.

392
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,040
You're right.

393
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,280
I cannot give up.

394
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,280
Fetch me the costume
for the Dance of Nuo.

395
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,760
I'm going to show Xie Xiaoman

396
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,839
that I, Shen Zhaowen,

397
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
am the Commandery Princess Rong'an,
granted by His Majesty.

398
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,839
I can't admit defeat.

399
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,359
Yes, Lady Shen.

400
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,780
(Bailu Academy)

401
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,599
Hit whoever you like.

402
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,800
Why must you come to me?

403
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,800
If I spar with others,

404
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,640
it will be an insult to the Helu.

405
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,640
I have anger built up in me.

406
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,040
It's suffocating.

407
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,040
That's why I asked for you.

408
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,839
I haven't sparred with you for a while.

409
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:02,880
Come on.

410
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,359
You haven't used
the sword in many years.

411
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,160
What makes today different?

412
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,520
Someone told me,

413
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,520
if you do not treat a wound,

414
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,319
it'd remain there forever.

415
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
That's why, I would like to see

416
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,839
what happens

417
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
when I tear it.

418
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,239
Enlighten me.

419
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,280
Please go easy on me.

420
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,760
One loses by pride

421
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,160
and gains by modesty.

422
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,599
The capable will find their place

423
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,319
for the sake of the nation's peace.

424
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,040
Back when we wielded
the sword for the first time,

425
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,880
I lost to you once.

426
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,079
His Majesty said my heart was disturbed.

427
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,800
After my brother's death,

428
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,040
I abandoned the sword and bow.

429
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,880
You once asked me why.

430
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,640
Today, I'll tell you.

431
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,479
Once I wield the Helu again,

432
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,160
nobody will be able to
take it away from me.

433
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,000
The capital has its eyes on us.

434
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,760
Both of us cannot run
away from our destinies.

435
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,880
Lingniang came

436
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,119
bearing

437
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,400
the promise of marriage
between you and her.

438
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,920
Are Your Highness going to
deny the promise as well?

439
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,400
It's not going to be easy.

440
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,040
I'll never marry Lingniang.

441
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,079
You know that well.

442
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,599
I will not

443
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,599
accept the marriage.

444
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,400
Please go easy on me.

445
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,280
Same for me.

446
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,319
You left for the examination,
drape in white during early fall.

447
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,760
Your focus harmonizes with
the gushing of branches.

448
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,560
You obtained excellence with
your future laid before you.

449
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:15,599
As the peach blossom blooms,
the doors of your future opened up.

450
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,920
As vast as the sea stretches,
as far as the phoenix could soar,

451
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:22,000
you took your books
and left as far as it took.

452
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,920
By the same day next year,
you've attained success.

453
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,439
You'd sigh at the endeavour of others.

454
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,479
Although I'm a lady,

455
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,520
through prayers,

456
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:35,680
I hope all fellow scholars will
live up to your conscience,

457
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,319
live up to the promise for the people,

458
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,560
live up to the teachings of the sage,

459
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:42,880
and live up to sustain
the peace of the nation.

460
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,359
Live up to your conscience.

461
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,959
Live up to the promise for the people.

462
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:51,800
Live up to the teachings of the sage.

463
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:54,880
Live up to sustain
the peace of the nation.

464
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,400
Are you doing fine, my brother-in-law?

465
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,560
As the concubine of
Commandery Prince,

466
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,359
I came to pay you respect.

467
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,640
Commandery Prince granted
the Hulu to me for a ceremonial dance,

468
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,959
so I came to inform you.

469
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,199
Commandery Prince is filial and loyal,

470
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,400
abiding by religious teachings

471
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,400
is part of his nature.

472
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,079
The brotherhood you shared,

473
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,479
not even a single meal
together could be forgone.

474
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,520
The yearning and grievance

475
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,359
are expressed through emotions.

476
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,599
Fervency and ardor

477
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,079
are displayed through actions.

478
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,800
Your wish

479
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:34,599
is known to Commandery Prince.

480
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You wished to devote yourself
to the people and the state.

481
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,199
It's the conviction of a virtuous man

482
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,920
and the principle of an ambitious man.

483
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,640
Commandery Prince has
the most admiration for you.

484
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,400
Of lowly origins,

485
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,760
I met His Highness

486
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,239
in marriage.

487
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,000
I share His Highness'
pain and happiness.

488
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,319
I'll accumulate virtues with gratitude
towards you.

489
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,599
Please guard over your brother.

490
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,959
Today is a great day.

491
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,959
May your spirit

492
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,280
rest in peace.

493
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,280
I offer my respects to you,
my brother-in-law.

494
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:15,760
Maoya.

495
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,599
I made three wishes today.

496
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,319
Would you like to know?

497
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,439
Firstly, may all things
go well for Xiaoman.

498
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,800
Secondly, bless Hanchen
with a long life.

499
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,479
Thirdly, may Xiaoman
fall in love with me.

500
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,959
We shall stay by each other forever.

501
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:43,520
There are some things

502
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,560
I haven't told you.

503
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,199
I'll confess them all today.

504
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
I love you.

505
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,079
I want to be with you
for the rest of my life.

506
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,959
I want to practise calligraphy with you

507
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,000
and watch the clouds

508
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,880
as they drift and flutter.

509
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,340
♪Approach you slowly♪

510
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,680
I want to eat the cakes you make

511
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,560
and wear the garments you sew.

512
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,900
♪Your shadow under the moonlight♪

513
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,119
I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

514
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:14,959
Do you understand?

515
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,999
♪As detailed as the poem♪

516
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,240

Fool,

518
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,439
it's time for you to shut your eyes.

519
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:28,500
♪When you smile,
you fill up all my view♪

520
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,220

♪We grow old together slowly♪

523
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,800
According to the disciples,

524
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:00,839
Mr. Li, you burnt the midnight oil

525
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,640
to compose poetry

526
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,599
and articles.

527
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,760
You also sneaked in
three jars of Lihuabai Wine.

528
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:09,880
That article

529
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,959
consists of the unspeakable.

530
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,319
As for the wine,

531
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,479
since you

532
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:16,000
have yet to clear them out for me,

533
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,119
I shall wallow deeper in

534
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,359
and finish them before
I leave the monastery.

535
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,280
I'm just curious.

536
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,640
Over the days spent here at the temple,

537
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,319
did you gain anything, Mr. Li?

538
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:31,560
Not yet,

539
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,239
but my tolerance for
alcohol has increased.

540
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,040
I guess you could consider that a gain.

541
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,640
Before coming up the mountain,

542
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,079
I told myself,

543
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,160
I'll only do two things once I'm here,

544
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,640
composing and drinking.

545
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,800
I've written everything I could.

546
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,079
My wine almost runs out.

547
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,520
It's time for me to depart.

548
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:52,199
Where will you go?

549
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:55,520
I'll go back to the capital

550
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,319
to take the civil examination.

551
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,439
What about the works you composed?

552
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,760
They do not worth a dime.

553
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,760
Instead of piling up the trash,

554
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,400
I shall burn them all to ashes

555
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,319
to get rid of them.

556
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,280
Mr. Li, you've yet

557
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,319
attained clarity in your heart.

558
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,319
Of secularity,

559
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,359
release the obsession.

560
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,800
Go with the flow.

561
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,359
Remain aware of the self

562
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,479
and stay true to yourself.

563
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,199
What I currently want

564
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,160
is to give up

565
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,239
and leave.

566
00:30:59,319 --> 00:30:59,800
Mr. Li,

567
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,319
this is bad.

568
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,680
Your compositions were blown away.

569
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,199
I...

570
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,560
I shall clean it up.

571
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,040
Forget it.

572
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,000
It's the heaven's will.

573
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,740
(Jingnv Pavilion)

574
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:14,719
Fellow ladies,

575
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,079
you're exempt from classes tomorrow.

576
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,760
Since the civil examination
is approaching,

577
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,239
Principal Yang is taking fellow
scholars to Mount Kunyan Temple

578
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,280
to pray for divine blessings.

579
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,520
Those who are interested

580
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,199
may sign up with Supervisor Xu

581
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:27,439
at the Teachers' Office later.

582
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
That's all for today.

583
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,640
Class is dismissed.

584
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,640
Thank you, teacher.

585
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:45,800
Xiaoman.

586
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,160
Are you going to

587
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,359
Mount Kunyan Temple?

588
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,239
Yes.

589
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,680
I heard

590
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:58,680
Congwen is undergoing cultivation
up in Mount Kunyan Temple.

591
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:02,000
What's going on?

592
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:03,319
You're acting weird.

593
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:08,119
Zhao Xiaoqian told me...

594
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:09,800
What did he say?

595
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:12,479
He said that he wants to

596
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,160
spend the rest of his life with me.

597
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,119
Everyone knows this.

598
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,479
You're the only one
who's ignorant about that.

599
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,920
When he said that to you,

600
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,239
what were you thinking?

601
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,040
It's decided then.

602
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,680
Tomorrow, we shall head to

603
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,880
Mount Kunyan Temple together.

604
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,040
It's my pleasure

605
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,280
to befriend Lingniang.

606
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,160
A daughter of nobility

607
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,199
will not mingle with
the peasant households.

608
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,359
What's going on?

609
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,479
Don't you think

610
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:50,199
Shen Zhaowen has been
acting weird lately?

611
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,280
What do you mean?

612
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:56,959
I'm not sure.

613
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,920
It's a gut feeling.

614
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,640
Really?

615
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,839
In a monastery deep in the forest,

616
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,160
listening to the pointless
debates of philosophers.

617
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:09,959
In the freezing winter, at the halls,

618
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,239
entertained by the woodcutter.

619
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,160
You've changed.

620
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:14,959
You're

621
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,359
always saying things
I do not understand.

622
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,079
What has she become?

623
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,119
You resemble a rooster.

624
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,560
You're the rooster.

625
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,199
What do you say

626
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:38,560
about what I told you a few days agi?

627
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,839
What do you mean?

628
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
I need to study.

629
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,160
Go away.

630
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,479
I'm talking about my feelings for you.

631
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,400
What's in your mind?

632
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,439
Lecher.

633
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,839
Zhu Momo told me

634
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,119
that Lady Xie

635
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,920
refuses to consummate with
Commandery Prince.

636
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,640
How unruly

637
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,920
and absurd.

638
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,639
You're constantly

639
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,800
tormented by Zhu Momo.

640
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,919
Let me give you a hand.

641
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,360
I'll spend the night here
to shut Zhu Momo up.

642
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,560
What do you think?

643
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:17,320
Lecher.

644
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,560
You thug.

645
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,280
Tell me.

646
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,719
Tell me.

647
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,280
What do you want?

648
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,159
Do you like me?

649
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,159
I like...

650
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,120
I like flowers, not you.

651
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,360
Xie Xiaoman.

652
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,560
Fine.

653
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:43,520
When...

654
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:47,560
When we arrived at
Mount Kunyan Temple,

655
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,800
Lake Nanming,

656
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,479
I'll give you my answer.

657
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,600
All right.

658
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,280
Tomorrow, at Mount Kunyan Temple,

659
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,439
Lake Nanming,

660
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,439
I'll be waiting for you.

661
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,439
Lecher.

662
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:51,120
You told me that

663
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:52,439
the capital is reconsidering

664
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:54,159
your marriage with
the daughter of Shen Family.

665
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:55,760
You haven't

666
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,479
told Xiaoman about this, have you?

667
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,199
I'll never marry Lingniang.

668
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,800
But no matter how hard

669
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
you try to resist,

670
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:10,399
it's pointless.

671
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,959
Do not

672
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,479
tell Xiaoman about this.

673
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,000
After I resolve everything,

674
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:18,399
I'll tell her.

675
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,239
Amitabha.

676
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,399
It's an urgent matter.

677
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,639
The Supreme Venerable Sovereign.

678
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,000
Gautama Buddha.

679
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,879
Lord of the Soil and the Ground.

680
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:33,879
Goddess of the Moon.

681
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,239
Please manifest the answer.

682
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,639
What's the answer in Xiaoman's heart?

683
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,919
Please give me an answer.

684
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,120
What does this mean?

685
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,000
Two suns and a moon.

686
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,439
Possessed by love.

687
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:54,399
This girl is in love.

688
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,000
You're ridiculous.

689
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:57,479
I do not believe you.

690
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,639
You're lying to yourself.

691
00:36:59,159 --> 00:36:59,679
Recently,

692
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,439
you were occupied with
the affairs of Zhao Xiaoqian.

693
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,439
Everyone could tell.

694
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:05,199
You're the only one
who remains ignorant.

695
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:07,840
If you do not have feelings
for Zhao Xiaoqian,

696
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,600
list out his flaws.

697
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:11,000
Hu Momo said,

698
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,000
when a person is in love,

699
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:15,919
they believe their lovers to be perfect.

700
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,320
Since you do not love Zhao Xiaoqian,

701
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,399
tell me

702
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,239
his flaws.

703
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,800
He's fierce.

704
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,600
He screams at me all the time.

705
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,679
However, it seems like
he's doing it for my own good.

706
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,760
He's a lecher.

707
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,919
All of a sudden, he'd...

708
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,919
What would he do?

709
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,280
Hanchen.

710
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:50,439
Hanchen.

711
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,479
Hanchen.

712
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,760
I'm talking to you.

713
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:02,159
Everyone is heading for
Mount Kunyan Temple

714
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,479
to pray for good results.

715
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,840
On the other hand,

716
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,280
you insist to see the stupid lake.

717
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,159
What are you up to?

718
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I have a feeling

719
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,280
Xie Xiaoman is really going to
be your sister-in-law today.

720
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,479
Really?

721
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,199
Not bad at all.

722
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,879
However, we're on the holy ground.

723
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,000
Don't go too far.

724
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,239
Return to your seat.

725
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,239
Look at you.

726
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,679
You're still in denial.

727
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:43,000
I suggest you accept his love.

728
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,959
Otherwise,

729
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:46,639
his childhood friend, Lady Shen would

730
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:48,000
come before you to get him.

731
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,360
Is Shen Zhaowen's feelings

732
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,760
that obvious?

733
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,639
It's more than obvious

734
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,600
to everyone.

735
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,959
Even the woman

736
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,959
who sells baked bread
outside my house could tell.

737
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,840
You're the only ignorant one.

738
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:03,879
There's one thing I find weird.

739
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,399
I can't figure it out.

740
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,000
On the day of the Dance of Nuo,

741
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,399
only the members of the mansion

742
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:10,159
knew I took the Helu to the academy.

743
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,639
In the academy,

744
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,679
you're the only one I told.

745
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,280
Look.

746
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,000
In Jingnv Pavilion,

747
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,399
who else would recognise the Helu?

748
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,600
Are you saying...

749
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,800
The one who ordered Xu Shu
to steal the Helu

750
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,280
was Shen Yan's men.

751
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,919
Shen Yan is her brother.

752
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,199
Without a reason,

753
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,320
Why did Xu Shu want the Helu?

754
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,919
Shen Zhaowen?

755
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,000
Shen Zhaowen tried to frame you up.

756
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:41,919
She must know

757
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,600
how important the Helu is
to Zhao Xiaoqian.

758
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,000
She took the Helu

759
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,439
in order to provoke Zhao Xiaoqian

760
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:47,959
and cast you out.

761
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But we don't have any proof.

762
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Once we arrive at
Mount Kunyan Temple,

763
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:54,959
I'll question her.

764
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,000
That's right.

765
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:59,199
She employed such detestable
measures to harm you.

766
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:00,639
We can't sit by and do nothing.

767
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,239
Once we arrive at the temple,

768
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:03,479
I'll confront her with you.

769
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,380
(Namo Amitabha)

770
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,320
Abbot,

771
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,280
this is the director of our academy.

772
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,280
Amitabha.

773
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,760
For prayers regarding
the civil examination,

774
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,600
over the century,

775
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,360
Mount Kunyan Temple
proves to be most efficient.

776
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,719
The principal sends us
to offer our prayers

777
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,000
until the civil examination
comes to an end.

778
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,679
We apologize for interrupting

779
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,639
serenity of the monastery.

780
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,639
Principal Yang has
informed me beforehand.

781
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:37,439
Prayers and worships

782
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,280
are things to rejoice over.

783
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,479
I'm eternally grateful

784
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,639
for the donation for the temple.

785
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,919
The chambers are cleaned.

786
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:48,320
The fellow scholars may
enjoy a meal first.

787
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,479
After the meal,

788
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,879
they may head to the main hall
to offer their prayers.

789
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,239
Thank you, abbot.

790
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,199
As a man,

791
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,239
you should just do it.

792
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,959
As usual, wooden plaques

793
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:14,199
will be distributed to all tonight.

794
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,959
After settling down at

795
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:17,159
your rooms,

796
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:18,800
you may head to the back halls for food.

797
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,239
After the meal,

798
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,840
we shall offer prayers together.

799
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,959
Do you understand?

800
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,639
Yes.

801
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:26,959
Wang Weicheng.

802
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:27,639
Supervisor Xu.

803
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,639
Can you pass it to me first?

804
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:35,840
I share a room with Lady Xie.

805
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:38,760
Thank you.

806
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,879
Wang Weicheng.

807
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,820
(Room number one)

808
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:49,159
What are you doing?

809
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:50,760
I've got the plaque.

810
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
We're husband and wife.

811
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,280
We should share a room.

812
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,159
I do not want to sleep with you.

813
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,120
Are you expecting us
to sleep separately?

814
00:41:58,479 --> 00:41:59,120
Let's go.

815
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,399
Return to the room
to pack up with me.

816
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:01,000
No.

817
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,000
We have matters to attend to.

818
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,120
Quit pinching me.

819
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,919
How about this?

820
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:06,760
Go ahead first.

821
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,719
I'll meet you later.

822
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:09,000
I'll force an answer out of her.

823
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,639
Dear, I can't wait any longer.

824
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:13,679
Why are you not moving?

825
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:15,479
Lang Mengzi.

826
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,479
Present.

827
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,120
Let go.

828
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,360
Minggu and I are up to something.

829
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,840
Let me go.

830
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:34,879
You...

831
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:37,479
We're on the holy ground.

832
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,719
