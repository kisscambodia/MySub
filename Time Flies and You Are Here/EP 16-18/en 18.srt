20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
(Once the happening temple
is now covered in dazzling rain)

21
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,639
Let go!

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,120
Minggu and I are up to something.

23
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:48,599
Let me go.

24
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,360
You...

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,239
We're on the holy ground.

26
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:55,480
Such insolence.

27
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,639
Stand right there.

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,600
Don't move.

29
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,240
Each time you move,

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,520
I'll remove one Su Chang Ji branch.

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,080
You...

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,919
Aren't you silly?

33
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,119
I just want to bring you to
take a look at Lake Nanming.

34
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,639
There were too many people just now.

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,679
I brought you here to speak to you.

36
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,440
What do you think?

37
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,320
Are you going?

38
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,360
You bully.

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,759
Let's go.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,720
I don't believe it.

41
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,000
You keep bullying Xiaoman.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,240
Minggu.

43
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,360
Why do you keep following me?

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,160
Do I?

45
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,600
I thought today's weather is quite good.

46
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,000
Why don't we go to the back mountain

47
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,000
to pluck cassia twigs?

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,880
I don't know if the weather's good,

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,320
but I'm not in a good mood.

50
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,039
Leave me alone.

51
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,440
You're wearing pearls.

52
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,399
It's beautiful.

53
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:28,639
Each of them is plump

54
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,759
and shiny.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,060
I can tell right away
it's Naga Pearls of

56
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:31,759
the Eastern Sea right away.

57
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,039
What's that saying again?

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,600
Good pearls match good people.

59
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,559
It's nice.

60
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,279
I don't know what kind of pearl this is.

61
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,240
Anyway,

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,639
it's a family heirloom
my mother gave to me..

63
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,399
Where are you going?

64
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,440
Bring me along.

65
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,559
No way.

66
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,199
It involves resentment between women.

67
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,279
Go elsewhere.

68
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,160
No.

69
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,180
(Puguangming Hall)

70
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,960
Little monk,

71
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,559
is Li Su

72
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,119
staying at your temple?

73
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,760
Then,

74
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,359
where is he now?

75
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,160
He won't tell.

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,880
Your believer, Shen Zhaowen,

77
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,519
is willing to become a
vegetarian for three years

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,519
in exchange for a happy marriage

79
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,359
and harmony between me and my husband.

80
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,440
Since you are so sincere,

81
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:39,239
Buddha will definitely grant
you and His Highness

82
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,440
a lovely marriage

83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,600
and happiness as a couple.

84
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,320
Lady Shen,

85
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,519
if you want Buddha to bless you,

86
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,320
should you also ask yourself

87
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,519
if you did something
against your conscience?

88
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,480
Watch your tone, Lady Su.

89
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,880
What do you mean by that?

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
What do I mean?

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Lady Shen

92
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,880
should know what I'm talking about.

93
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,279
Lady Su,

94
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,040
be careful with what you say.

95
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,119
I've always been careful,

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
but someone

97
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,279
isn't so careful in her ways.

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,279
Tell me.

99
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,600
Why did you instruct someone
to steal the Helu?

100
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,720
Watch what you say, Lady Su.

101
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,160
Lady Su, you're so vulgar

102
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,559
to be blaming others

103
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,239
in a Buddhist temple.

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,760
What evidence do you have
to make you say so?

105
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,519
Evidence?

106
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,279
Across the entire Wujiang Prefecture,
who doesn't know

107
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,279
Xu Shu is acting on
Shen Family's orders?

108
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,519
What other evidence is needed?

109
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,640
Say it!

110
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,160
Why did you frame Xieman?

111
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,200
I didn't.

112
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,160
Frame her?

113
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,160
She doesn't deserve it.

114
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,320
Lady Su is willful and impulsive.

115
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,799
Is that your family teaching?

116
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,040
Our family teaching

117
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,880
isn't up to you,
a servant, to judge!

118
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,279
Today, I'm asking you.

119
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,640
Why did you get someone to
take away the Helu?

120
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,040
Ridiculous.

121
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,119
My lady is from a noble family.

122
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:00,839
She doesn't need to

123
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,399
argue with you vulgar people.

124
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,839
Lady Su,

125
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,040
your sisters

126
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,399
are so vulgar,

127
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,399
dirty losers who cannot
amount to anything.

128
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,600
Even if Lady Xie gets divorced,

129
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,399
it isn't our lady's fault.

130
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:13,839
Fine.

131
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,600
Yan Boyang,

132
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:16,320
come in!

133
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,359
Go!

134
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,119
What are you trying to do?

135
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,279
Coward.

136
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,839
Move aside!

137
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,480
You...

138
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,720
Let go of me!

139
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,040
You evil woman.

140
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,720
Let go!

141
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,519
How dare you bully my cousin.

142
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,480
I didn't.

143
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,040
Go away!

144
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,079
Who told you to bully my cousin?

145
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,720
I didn't!

146
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,640
Do you think I'll go easy on you?

147
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,239
Let go!

148
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:37,920
Let me tell you!

149
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,720
You can bully anyone!

150
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,600
Oh no, the jade bottle's broken.

151
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,679
It's Principal Yang's offering.

152
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,839
Master says

153
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,239
women are fierce like tigers.

154
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,399
What are you all doing in our temple?

155
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,399
You even broke

156
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,799
Principal Yang's jade bottle.

157
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:51,480
Evil woman!

158
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,399
Go away!

159
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,040
Su Wei!

160
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,320
Evil woman!

161
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,760
I'm going to teach you a lesson today!

162
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,920
Lady!

163
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,079
Go look for His Highness.

164
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,320
I'll donate money if you found him.

165
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,920
Go now!

166
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,079
Wake up, my lady.

167
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,119
My lady!

168
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,399
My lady!

169
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,959
What are you trying to tell me?

170
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,119
What do I want to tell you?

171
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,359
Don't you know that very well?

172
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,799
Why did I fall in love

173
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,519
with you,

174
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,799
a heartless person who says
one thing and means another?

175
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,519
I know.

176
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,200
Do you know

177
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,000
this place is where we first...

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,799
Stop there.

179
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,239
In fact, when I was little,

180
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,359
I never thought that

181
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,480
I would fall in love with someone.

182
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,440
Never.

183
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,279
Back then,

184
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,880
I didn't have time to
think about all these.

185
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,000
Yet, this young lady

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,320
came into my life.

187
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,720
She and I are totally different.

188
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,519
She grew up in the countryside

189
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,040
and led a carefree life.

190
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,640
However, this young lady

191
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,159
doesn't know.

192
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,640
It's as if she has supernatural powers.

193
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,559
Before I knew her,

194
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,760
my heart

195
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,799
had never felt

196
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,000
so alive before.

197
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:47,640
I mean it.

198
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,000
You can say I'm selfish if you want,

199
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,799
or overbearing,

200
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
but I'm thinking

201
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:00,200
if she could forever

202
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
stay by my side,

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,119
then does it mean

204
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,679
my life doesn't have to

205
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,840
be so lifeless anymore?

206
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,159
I...

207
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,280
Your Highness,

208
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,200
it's bad!

209
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,440
They're fighting in the hall!

210
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,880
Lady Shen is injured!

211
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,240
(Buddha's Light Shining)

212
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,359
Lady!

213
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,239
Lady, wake up!

214
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,440
His Highness is here.

215
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,520
Your Highness.

216
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,239
Your Highness.

217
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,039
Please save her, Your Highness.

218
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:42,280
Are you all right?

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,679
Lady.

220
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,559
Go get a physician!

221
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,559
Sure. Hurry up!

222
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,479
Let's go and get a physician.

223
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,440
It wasn't me.

224
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,719
It really wasn't me.

225
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,200
She fell on her own.

226
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,559
Minggu,

227
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,359
you'll be fine.

228
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,919
She fell on her own.

229
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,679
It wasn't me.

230
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,200
Outrageous!

231
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,719
Outrageous!

232
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,359
It isn't severe.

233
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,479
Just a wound on the skin surface.

234
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,799
However, don't let the wound come
into contact with water for few days,

235
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,119
and apply medicated ointment.

236
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,239
When the scab forms,

237
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,359
don't touch with your hand.

238
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,239
Otherwise, there will be a scar.

239
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,880
I don't want a scar.

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,719
I get that.

241
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:34,320
Thank you.

242
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:39,320
I don't want a scar.

243
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:42,960
Don't worry.

244
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,679
There won't be one.

245
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
The physician said

246
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,000
there won't be a scar if you're careful.

247
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,440
Don't look anymore.

248
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,840
How's Lady Shen?

249
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,679
The temple's in the mountains,
with no physicians or medicine near us.

250
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,440
Why don't we send her to
the clinic for treatment?

251
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,919
She'll be fine.

252
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,599
She only needs to rest for a few days.

253
00:10:58,599 --> 00:10:59,119
Okay.

254
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,760
It's lucky that she is fine.

255
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,679
Thank God.

256
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,359
Hanchen,

257
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,719
can you keep me company for a while?

258
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,359
I'm a little scared.

259
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,440
What do you mean she'll be fine?

260
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,320
Su Wei's the one who
challenged her first

261
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,479
and hit her.

262
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,440
I saw it with my own eyes.

263
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,719
Director,

264
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:25,119
you have to

265
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,000
seek justice for Lady Shen.

266
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:26,880
Or else...

267
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,559
Or else, is the reputation of

268
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,760
all the ladies in Jingnv Pavilion

269
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,679
going to be affected by them as well?

270
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,479
Shut up!

271
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,039
I need to check how Xiaoman's doing.

272
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,359
I'll ask Zipei to keep you company.

273
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:39,960
Hanchen,

274
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:41,359
I don't want Zipei.

275
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,559
I only want you.

276
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,760
Just like when we were young,

277
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,119
you stayed by my side
to keep me company.

278
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,799
Director Xu, how do you
plan to handle this matter?

279
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,359
Since Lady Shen's all right,

280
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,080
and she also realized she did wrong...

281
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,599
Director, that's easy for you to say.

282
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,799
You should see what kind
of barbaric thing

283
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,000
your student did.

284
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,479
My lady

285
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,559
is the Commandery Princess Rong'an
coronated by His Majesty.

286
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,239
If anything happens,

287
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,239
is Su Family going to be responsible

288
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,359
or you?

289
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,159
Well...

290
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,599
I'll be responsible for my own actions.

291
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,239
I started the fight,

292
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:29,359
but Lady Shen

293
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:30,880
incidentally stepped on the pearls,

294
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,000
fell on the floor and got hurt.

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,080
Am I also responsible for that?

296
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,520
At most,

297
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,039
I'll let you hit me back.

298
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,880
Su Wei,

299
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,280
all you need to do is apologize.

300
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:41,159
Shut up.

301
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,520
Minggu is my sister.

302
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:46,960
My sister did wrong,

303
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,520
so I'll apologize to you on her behalf.

304
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,200
Xiaoman.

305
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,440
All the medicine and
nourishment from now on

306
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,000
will be borne by Su Family.

307
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,559
Xiaoman.

308
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,880
Lady Shen.

309
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,280
Xiaoman,

310
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,119
we...

311
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Go out for a while.

312
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,080
What are you trying to do?

313
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,960
I have something to say to her.

314
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,280
Go out for a while.

315
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,320
Hanchen,

316
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,799
it's all right.

317
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,799
Are you responsible for

318
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,960
stealing the Helu?

319
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,200
What?

320
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,880
The Helu was lost once?

321
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,039
Why would Xu Shu take the Helu

322
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,000
for no reason?

323
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,559
Only people from

324
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,960
the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

325
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,919
knew it's with me.

326
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:01,919
In there,

327
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,359
doesn't everyone

328
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,039
hope you and Zhao Xiaoqian
will get married?

329
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:05,640
Yes,

330
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,000
so what?

331
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:11,799
It's too bad.

332
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:13,919
Those from
the Commandery Prince's Mansion

333
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,719
want you and Zhao Xiaoqian
to get married,

334
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,880
but Zhao Xiaoqian
himself doesn't want to.

335
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,559
Xie Xiaoman!

336
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,799
You're trying to blame the matter on me

337
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,280
because you want him to dislike me.

338
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,559
You want to marry him, am I right?

339
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,400
Whether I'm marrying him or not

340
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
has nothing to do with you, a concubine.

341
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
You're so full of yourself.

342
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,119
Xie Xiaoman,

343
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,960
do you think my feelings for Hanchen

344
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,359
are only one-sided?

345
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,200
What do you mean?

346
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,000
Right now,

347
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,080
a memorial about my marriage
with Hanchen

348
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,280
is being prepared in the capital.

349
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
Hanchen knew about it long ago

350
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,760
yet he didn't tell you.

351
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,080
I'm afraid

352
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,280
you don't matter much to him.

353
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,640
Am I right?

354
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,479
After I get married to him,

355
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,119
it'll be easy to get rid of you.

356
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,080
I am in no rush to
get rid of you for now.

357
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,840
Why don't you

358
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,320
leave Hanchen right now?

359
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,080
You seem to be a studious one.

360
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:23,960
If you leave now,

361
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,840
at least it's better than entering
the ancestral temple later on

362
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:27,479
as a nun.

363
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:28,840
Don't you think so?

364
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,400
Lady,

365
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,799
you sure take your time to apologize

366
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,200
and disturb my lady's rest.

367
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,679
My sister accidentally injured you.

368
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,039
I'm sorry.

369
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,359
It's fine.

370
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,119
Just tell her to be more
careful from now on.

371
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,080
These few days,

372
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,679
do a background check on Xie Xiaoman.

373
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,039
While you're at it,

374
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,599
prompt Princess Consort Pu again

375
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,919
who's in the capital

376
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,400
to quickly get the decree.

377
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,760
Yes.

378
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,159
Two ladies got into a fight

379
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,919
and one of them suffered
a serious head injury.

380
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,080
Both the jade bottle and temple block
were smashed into pieces.

381
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,840
Everything's fine now.

382
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:44,440
Director Xu,

383
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,880
what happened earlier was all our fault.

384
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,799
Now that Lady Shen's forgiven Minggu,

385
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,880
we also seek your understanding.

386
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,440
Xiaoman!

387
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:11,839
Xiaoman!

388
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,359
Xiaoman!

389
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,239
What's wrong?

390
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,920
You and Shen Zhaowen are engaged.

391
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,160
Is it true?

392
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,920
She told you that?

393
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,000
Answer me.

394
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:42,959
Yes,

395
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:44,560
but I definitely won't

396
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,400
agree to it.

397
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,560
Believe me, okay?

398
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,920
I can solve this.

399
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,000
- You have to...
- How are you going to solve it?

400
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,199
An imperial order from the capital

401
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,680
cannot be defied.

402
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,760
Tell me. How are you going to solve it?

403
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,599
Why won't you

404
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,680
believe me?

405
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,199
Why did you keep it from me then?

406
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,040
Why did you lie to me?

407
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,160
Why did you lie to me?

408
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,239
You want to know why?

409
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,079
You want to know ever since

410
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,599
the moment I married you,

411
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,920
I've been worried that
this day will come.

412
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,680
You want to know,
as the Commandery Prince of Julu

413
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,479
why I could only think about you

414
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,040
and even defy an imperial order?

415
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,760
You want to know why I lied to you,

416
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,599
but at this moment

417
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,839
I'm pleading with you?

418
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,920
It's because I don't want you to worry.

419
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,400
I don't want you to overthink

420
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,839
or leave me.

421
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,880
I really like you, Xiaoman.

422
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,239
You like me?

423
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,040
Imperial order...

424
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,119
None of us could defy
the imperial order.

425
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,479
You have to marry Shen Zhaowen.

426
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,079
And me?

427
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,479
I'm just a small object

428
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,680
in your relationship.

429
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
When you like me, you'll coax me.

430
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,680
When you don't,

431
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,239
I'll be discarded right away.

432
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,160
That's not the case, Xiaoman.

433
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,000
Zhao Xiaoqian,

434
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,920
that's not how you like someone.

435
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,479
That's just possession.

436
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,119
Tell me. How am I
supposed to believe you?

437
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:39,680
Xiaoman!

438
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,280
Xiaoman.

439
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,400
Human beings are insignificant.

440
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,839
In Buddhism context,

441
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,719
to the universe,

442
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,640
a person is so small in comparison.

443
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,880
However, mankind is also noble.

444
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,760
A single thought forms
within a person's mind.

445
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,079
And that thought

446
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,719
is the most precious thing

447
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,199
in the universe.

448
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,400
Everyone has someone they
miss throughout their life.

449
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:17,920
During one's life in this world,

450
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,640
it always has to do with entanglement.

451
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,760
Master.

452
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:27,760
Amitabha.

453
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,439
What if this feeling

454
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,280
is wrong?

455
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,199
Feeling itself isn't wrong,

456
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,400
but you asked the wrong question.

457
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,920
No matter what our feelings are,

458
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,000
we shouldn't be obsessed with returns.

459
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:46,479
What we should seek

460
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,760
is when the feeling matures,

461
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,280
demand nothing, and without pain.

462
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,400
Let it be when the time comes.

463
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,680
Whether you let it go or not

464
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,199
is up to you.

465
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,719
Don't panic, everyone! Calm down!

466
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:04,760
Are you okay?

467
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,359
I'm fine.

468
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,520
Let me do a head count.

469
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:07,920
Wang Weicheng!

470
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,959
Is Wang Weicheng around?

471
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:09,640
I'm here.

472
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,760
I'm still alive.

473
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:11,839
Ying!

474
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,000
Where are Zhao Xiaoqian and Yan Boyang?

475
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,520
Director Xu,

476
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
His Highness hasn't returned.

477
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
I'll send people to look
for him right away.

478
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:18,439
I'll do that right now.

479
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:19,280
I'll go look for him myself.

480
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,119
No way.

481
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,000
We have guards.

482
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,520
How can we let a lady go?

483
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,280
No, you can't go.

484
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,280
Director Xu,

485
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,160
I'm the Commandery Princess Rong'an

486
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,000
on His Majesty's order.

487
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,839
If I say that

488
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm going,

489
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,599
who dare stop me?

490
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
Hurry up!

491
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,119
Go after her!

492
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,680
Hurry!

493
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,520
Make sure you'll protect her!

494
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,479
You go look for Yan Boyang.

495
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,439
I sneak outside with them
to look for Zhao Xiaoqian.

496
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:39,680
Don't go, Xiaoman.

497
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,400
You can't go outside.

498
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,280
Director,

499
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,680
she also wants to go outside.

500
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,359
Director Xu,

501
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,079
Zhao Xiaoqian is my husband.

502
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:47,920
I must go and look for him.

503
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,599
A Commandery Princess is
enough of a headache.

504
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Now, you're also causing trouble.

505
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,079
Don't worry.

506
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,680
If they can't find him,

507
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,880
so can't you.

508
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:55,880
Come back here!

509
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,719
Director Xu!

510
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,599
Come back!

511
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:58,760
Xiaoman.

512
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,959
I'll go with Xiaoman.

513
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:02,839
Don't worry, Director Xu.

514
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,839
We'll be fine.

515
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,839
You...

516
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,040
You...

517
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:07,760
Ridiculous!

518
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,479
You people are too ridiculous!

519
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:12,959
Yan Boyang.

520
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,800
Are you all right?

521
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:18,680
I'm fine.

522
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,680
I'm glad to hear that.

523
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,160
Can you stand up?

524
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,599
Yes.

525
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,199
Yan Boyang!

526
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,000
Yan Boyang, where are you?

527
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,400
- I...
- Yan...

528
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,880
I'm here.

529
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,760
What are you doing, bending over there?

530
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,599
Stop making noise.

531
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,040
If you keep making noise,

532
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,719
there will be another earthquake.

533
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:38,400
There's no more earthquake.

534
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,160
Come out now.

535
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,319
Come out quickly.

536
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:44,880
Come out!

537
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,239
I don't want to.

538
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,239
- No.
- It's fine now.

539
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:47,119
Out! Now!

540
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,880
Where did you go?

541
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,560
I was so worried.

542
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,880
You're worried about me?

543
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,959
Of course.

544
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,839
Xiaoman went to look for Zhao Xiaoqian.

545
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,719
Who's going to worry
about you other than me?

546
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,680
My mother once told me,

547
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,160
when there's an earthquake

548
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,280
hiding under the table is the safest.

549
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,119
That's why I dare not move at all.

550
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,640
Why did you go to the main hall alone?

551
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,160
I went...

552
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,160
Didn't you say that

553
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,000
this is your family heirloom
given by your mother.

554
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,280
Make sure such a precious item

555
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,719
won't go missing again.

556
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:37,000
Who knows in the future,

557
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,640
you may give it to your daughter?

558
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,680
So,

559
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:49,520
you don't blame me for scolding you.

560
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,839
You even went to help me find
the pearls at the main hall?

561
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,359
Did you scold me?

562
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:56,880
When was it?

563
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
I can't remember.

564
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:05,760
No...

565
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,719
Why are you crying?

566
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:09,599
You...

567
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,199
Yan Boyang,

568
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,680
you're an idiot.

569
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,079
Xiaoman,

570
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,079
do you want to take a rest?

571
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:38,479
No need.

572
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:39,199
I'm fine.

573
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,560
What if he's waiting for me somewhere

574
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,680
and couldn't see me?

575
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,040
Congwen, take a rest first

576
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,160
if you're tired.

577
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,439
I'm fine.

578
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,479
Hanchen!

579
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,239
Hanchen!

580
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,000
Hanchen!

581
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:54,640
Lingniang.

582
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:56,839
Are you okay?

583
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,520
What are you doing here?

584
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,680
I was worried about you.

585
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,000
Just now, after the earthquake,

586
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,880
I was worried something might
happen since you're alone.

587
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,319
I'm fine.

588
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,719
Where's Xiaoman?

589
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,479
Seems like she's with the rest of them

590
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,920
in the temple.

591
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:12,880
What's wrong?

592
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:13,640
You sprained your ankle?

593
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Let's go back quickly.

594
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:23,880
I'll carry you on my back.

595
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,479
Come on.

596
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,719
Hanchen,

597
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,400
I've always liked you.

598
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:47,680
I've been thinking every day

599
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,680
when we'll get married.

600
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,400
Who would've thought

601
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,040
he's actually liked by someone?

602
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,839
I was wrong about him.

603
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,239
Let's go back.

604
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:09,079
Xiaoman.

605
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,580
(Lonely Boat At Night, volume three)

606
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:26,359
(I don't understand a word.
It's full of gibberish talk.)

607
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,280
(Look at the name of the author.)

608
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,920
(Lunatic from Wild Dreams Hall.)

609
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,920
(He himself admitted to be a lunatic.)

610
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,640
(All the people mentioned
so far were talking gibberish.)

611
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,199
(As what the author had said,)

612
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,239
(unusual people make other
plans in difficult situations)

613
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,079
(whereas ordinary people are bound
in the sea of tribulations.)

614
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,079
(This kind of article with
higher understanding)

615
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,199
(is not meant for)

616
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,839
(you common people.)

617
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,319
(It's fine if you don't understand,)

618
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,040
(but you shouldn't criticize it either.)

619
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,599
(If you're able to see these messages,)

620
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,800
(I hope, in the next volume,)

621
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:56,400
(you'll talk more about)

622
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,079
(what you've mentioned before)

623
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,160
(the stories of viewing
Queen of the Night at the burial mound.)

624
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,400
(I wonder if there's really)

625
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,880
(such lustrous and magical flower
in this world.)

626
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,359
(I really yearn for it.)

627
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:07,640
Xiaoman.

628
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:09,959
Xiaoman.

629
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:11,479
Xiaoman.

630
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:19,680
Xiaoman.

631
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,560
Let me bring you to a place.

632
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:24,880
Let's go.

633
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,560
Each year, Queen of the Night

634
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,079
only blooms for a few hours

635
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,119
on the nights between
summer and fall.

636
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,119
You're lucky

637
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,199
that I've stayed here for a while

638
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,280
and figured out the entire
mountain's geographical features.

639
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:42,719
Xiaoman,

640
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,479
there are really
Queen of the Night here.

641
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,439
Queen of the Night?

642
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,040
It's blooming.

643
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,800
It's blooming.

644
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:11,839
Isn't it beautiful?

645
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:16,839
Yes.

646
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,959
Xiaoman.

647
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,359
Xiaoman.

648
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,599
Xiaoman.

649
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,260
(Brothel)

650
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,440
Mr. Zhong, you're here.

651
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,640
Is there any new business today?

652
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,000
Yes,

653
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,880
of course there is.

654
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,359
Come on.

655
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,220
(Theory of Punishment)

656
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,719
Go and tell them

657
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,520
I accepted the money.

658
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:33,719
He can come and get it after three days.

659
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,520
Sure.

660
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,280
Mr. Zhong.

661
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,439
Thank you, Mr. Zhong.

662
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,400
Take care.

663
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,959
I suddenly realized that I was wrong.

664
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,520
I suddenly felt that

665
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,079
even if there's only one
person who understands me,

666
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,719
I should probably carry on.

667
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:13,640
Principal,

668
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,920
I'll stay

669
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,239
instead of going for
the imperial examination.

670
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,199
Are you sure?

671
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:21,239
I've made my decision.

672
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,000
I won't be swayed by
others' opinion anymore.

673
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,479
Lunatic of Wild Dreams Hall

674
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,920
is indeed a lunatic.

675
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,719
That's right!

676
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,839
Catch it!

677
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:37,959
That's right!

678
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,199
Okay!

679
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,000
Come on.

680
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,800
All right, you can go and play.

681
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,880
Don't wander off.

682
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,359
Maoya,

683
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:55,239
look.

684
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,400
I prepared a rooster

685
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,439
for His Highness last time,

686
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,680
His Highness really liked it.

687
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,000
This time,

688
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,359
I've prepared a plumpest hen

689
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,959
for His Highness.

690
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:03,599
How is it?

691
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
No need.

692
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:08,160
The Commandery Prince's Mansion
has become a chicken coop.

693
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,359
When are you two

694
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
planning to have a son?

695
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:20,160
Mother, what nonsense
are you talking about?

696
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,040
What about this?

697
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,800
We'll tell His Highness

698
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,920
to give you 1000 strings of 1000 cash

699
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,280
just to be safe.

700
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:31,719
Mother.

701
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,359
You silly girl.

702
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,000
Why don't you understand?

703
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,520
I'm doing this for your own good.

704
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,760
Think about your identity

705
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,040
and the situation you're in.

706
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,719
You're just a concubine.

707
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:49,160
In the entire
Commandery Prince's Mansion,

708
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,359
such a huge and rich family,

709
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,560
the only person we can depend on now

710
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,959
is His Highness.

711
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,079
You're still young in this matter,

712
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,319
so you won't think it through.

713
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,079
As your mother,

714
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,479
I have to consider thoroughly for you.

715
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,079
Are you selling your daughter

716
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,239
or in fact she's married?

717
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,880
It's for your own good.

718
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,040
For my own good?

719
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,439
If it's for my own good,

720
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:08,199
you shouldn't have

721
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,719
brought me to Wujiang Prefecture.

722
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:11,719
Maoya!

723
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,160
Hen.

724
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,760
You forgot the hen.

725
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,000
Look at her.

726
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,420
(Grocery store)

727
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:42,760
Sir,

728
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,800
you've tossed ten times

729
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,640
and didn't hit even once.

730
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,319
That'll be ten cash in total.

731
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,000
Something's wrong with your bottle.

732
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,000
What do you mean by that?

733
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,479
Are you here to cause trouble?

734
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:52,839
Take care.

735
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,199
Did you see that?

736
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,920
A jar full of black beans.

737
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,280
It's nothing but trickery.

738
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,479
How dare you deceive us?

739
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:04,119
Someone's here to cause trouble!

740
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,359
Someone's here to cause trouble!

741
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,319
Who is it?

742
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:11,959
How dare you deny it?

743
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,120
Move aside!

744
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,280
Who is it?

745
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,800
Brother,

746
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:16,560
it's him!

747
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,399
(Hooligan, Zheng Hai)
It's him!

748
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,080
Who are you?

749
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,080
Do you know who I am?

750
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,560
I don't care who you are.

751
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,239
This is my territory.

752
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,239
If you want to set a stall here,

753
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,360
You have to get my permit.

754
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,159
If you want to cause trouble,

755
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:34,600
you have to first go through me.

756
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,919
Well.

757
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,919
Go through you?

758
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm afraid

759
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,879
it won't do you any good.

760
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,080
You've overestimated yourself.

761
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:05,439
Huang Liu.

762
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,560
You...

763
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,159
Brother!

764
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:10,959
Look at you.

765
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,159
How dare you call for backup?

766
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:17,520
You're a deserter.
How dare you cause trouble here.

767
00:35:17,879 --> 00:35:18,600
A deserter?

768
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,320
Do you know who he is?

769
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,000
Stop it!

770
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,800
(Deserter, Huang Liu)

771
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,520
Zheng Hai,

772
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,719
I'm done for.

773
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,800
Pardon me for being late.

774
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,120
Let's go!

775
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,000
Move it!

776
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,679
Why are you here, Arms Instructor Qin?

777
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,719
I entered the city

778
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,080
to report the army supplies
to the magistrate.

779
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,280
That hooligan just now
was from the army camp.

780
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
Bring him to the magistrate office.

781
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:52,600
Yes.

782
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,120
Then I'll take my leave first.

783
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,000
Let's go.

784
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,560
Hanchen,

785
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,360
usually when you fight,

786
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,600
you'd just go easy on them.

787
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,159
Why...

788
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,120
Desertion is a capital offense.

789
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
Ask your father when you go home

790
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:08,000
Yes.

791
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,800
Well, it's for your own good.

792
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,360
Hanchen,

793
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,840
you're acting strangely today.

794
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,679
What exactly is going on?

795
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,800
I agree.

796
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,360
You seem to be in a bad mood today.

797
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,159
Xiaoman found out

798
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,360
about my engagement with Shen Zhaowen.

799
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
What do you plan to do?

800
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,679
After all, when it comes
to your marriage,

801
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,360
those in the capital
will intervene for sure.

802
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,320
I'd better go talk to Yang Chidao.

803
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,679
Let's go.

804
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,600
(Jingnv Pavilion)

805
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,719
Music, good food, literature and words.
The right timing, and joyful events.

806
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,800
Look far up in the sky

807
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,320
and enjoy during holidays.

808
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,840
The sky is high and
the land stretches on,

809
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,800
making one realize
the endlessness of the universe.

810
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,199
After pleasure comes sadness.

811
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,840
Xiaoman,

812
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,520
why are you unhappy today?

813
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,840
The dynamics of matter
and nothingness.

814
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,280
What's there to be happy about?

815
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,639
Looking in the direction of
Chang'an city at dusk

816
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,199
and Wu county while being
surrounded by clouds.

817
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,360
At the end of southern land
is the bottomless ocean.

818
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,360
Heavenly pillars are unreachable while
the Big Dipper hangs far up in the sky.

819
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,840
Border mountains are difficult to cross.

820
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,199
Who'll feel sorry for
those who were lost?

821
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,959
Like the floating plants,
by chance, they all meet.

822
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,280
They're travellers from
far-off places, indeed.

823
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:27,280
I had missed the imperial court
yet I'm not summoned.

824
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,080
When will I serve His Majesty again?

825
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,840
I've received the homework

826
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,159
I assigned to you last time.

827
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,600
Only Lady Xie hasn't handed in.

828
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,719
Is there any problem?

829
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,560
Teacher Liu,

830
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,520
the question is about our
future ambitions,

831
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,159
but I haven't found a direction.

832
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:53,239
Can you give me a few more days?

833
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,360
I'll make sure to think over properly.

834
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,760
Lady Xie, from your words,

835
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,360
you seem to be undecided
as to what you want to do.

836
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,639
However, being cautious for
you writing isn't a bad thing.

837
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,719
It's fine.

838
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,959
There's no hurry.

839
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,360
All right, class dismissed.

840
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,280
Thank you, teacher.

841
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:28,639
Congwen has returned.

842
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,000
Congwen's back.

843
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,800
Congwen.

844
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:32,800
Congwen's back.

845
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:33,959
Congwen.

846
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,600
After I come back this time,

847
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,000
I'll stay for good.

848
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,120
That's good.

849
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,320
Everyone's hoping you'll be around.

850
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,239
I heard that Teacher Liu

851
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,600
is going to compile and
write Admonitions of Women.

852
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,760
She thinks highly of you.

853
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,679
Pay more attention to yourself.

854
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,840
Recently, when I was reading Liezi,

855
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,159
I came across

856
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,000
a story called
Jiufang Gao and the Horse.

857
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,840
Its purpose is to illustrate

858
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,840
how one shouldn't judge
a book by its cover.

859
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:17,199
Similarly,

860
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,320
sometimes,

861
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,320
one shouldn't hear only
one side of the story.

862
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,360
It's better to ask clearly.

863
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,199
Tomorrow afternoon,

864
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,840
will you go with me to the suburbs?

865
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,840
Why?

866
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:33,959
You'll know when we're there.

867
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,000
I need your help, Principal Yang.

868
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,840
Did you cause trouble again?

869
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,159
I'm an old man.

870
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,719
I'm unable to go through such torment.

871
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:53,760
I want to help Xie Xiaoman
get a conferment of title.

872
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,239
Aren't you

873
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,639
engaged with Lady Shen?

874
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,719
Take a look at this.

875
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,719
This was written
by my student in the capital

876
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,800
for my entertainment.

877
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,520
Now, it's known across
the entire capital

878
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:18,360
the Prince Pu's Mansion who
broke off the engagement

879
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,199
is again connecting with Shen Family

880
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:22,080
through marriage.

881
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,520
Moreover, an order has been
issued at the imperial palace.
