19

=Episode 16=

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
(I have no appetite with a bad mood,
neither am I happy playing with a sword)

21
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,519
Were you waiting for me?

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,239
I need to talk to you.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,160
What's the matter?

24
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,959
Minggu told me the academy is
hosting the ritual, Dance of Nuo.

25
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,000
I was wondering...

26
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:02,040
Minggu said the Dance of Nuo requires
us to wear a mask and hold a sword.

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,839
The prayers will be
heard by dead spirits.

28
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,000
I was wondering if I could use the Helu

29
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,080
to speak to brother-in-law.

30
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,399
What?

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,039
Brother-in-law?

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Will you allow me?

33
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,679
Brother-in-law.

34
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,720
Sure.

35
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,479
What's the matter?

36
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,960
Didn't you hear?

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,119
She called my brother

38
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,119
her brother-in-law.

39
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,540
(Jingnv Pavilion)

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,679
The teacher is here.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,679
Teacher Liu is here.

42
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,520
Here comes Teacher Liu.

43
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,559
Greetings, teacher.

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,160
From today onwards, Lady Shen

45
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,399
shall join the Jingnv Pavilion
as a student.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,960
I've heard

47
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,199
Jingnv Pavilion of Bailu Academy
gathers the best female scholars.

48
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,559
I've finally seen it for myself.

49
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,839
It's indeed like they said.

50
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,240
I'm Shen Zhaowen.

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,279
My courtesy name is Lingniang.

52
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,479
You may all call me Lingniang.

53
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
It's my pleasure

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,039
to be able to learn
with you, fellow classmates.

55
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,119
I hope for your help and support

56
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,320
in the days to come.

57
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,279
You may settle down there.

58
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:38,800
Please be seated.

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,759
The civil examinations
are approaching.

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,080
This time,

61
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,039
the ladies of Jingnv Pavilion

62
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,160
are supposed to prepare
for the Dance of Nuo.

63
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
During the last examination,

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,679
the prayers of Dance of Nuo
were prepared by the seniors

65
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,240
of Jingnv Pavilion.

66
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,960
Most of them have left Jingnv Pavilion.

67
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
For the civil examinations this year,

68
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,800
Director Xu

69
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,600
has yet to hold classes
of etiquette this year.

70
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,919
He intends to request all ladies

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
to master the Dance of Nuo
with the coach

72
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,720
while learning customs and etiquette.

73
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
During the preceding ritual
of Dance of Nuo,

74
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,959
as I recall, a lady

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,239
led the dance in the centre.

76
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,720
Would it be the same this year?

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,160
Yes.

78
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,600
Since we're performing
the Dance of Prince of Lanling,

79
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,440
among fellow ladies,

80
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,559
is there anyone who would like to
volunteer yourself?

81
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,880
Xiaoman, you should do it.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,799
You can do it.

83
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,799
I'd like to volunteer.

84
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,200
Xie Xiaoman.

85
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,200
All right.

86
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,000
Are there any other volunteers?

87
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,119
I would like to volunteer as well.

88
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,239
The goddess can only
be played by one person.

89
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,600
Since two ladies have
volunteered themselves...

90
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,480
She did it on purpose.

91
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,679
You should both
participate in the practice.

92
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,200
Then, we will select the best one

93
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,480
from the both of you.

94
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,640
Lady Shen should be chosen.

95
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,920
Apparently, Lady Shen
grew up in the palace.

96
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,600
It's a given for her to
be good in everything.

97
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,519
How do you know that?

98
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,040
She's the younger sister of Shen Yan.

99
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,600
About her visit to Wujiang Prefecture,

100
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,399
the capital

101
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,799
informed my father beforehand.

102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,519
All right.

103
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Both of you shall
proceed to the practice.

104
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,959
We shall resume class.

105
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,359
If you find a rook in
your game of chess,

106
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,119
you must let it go.

107
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,720
Otherwise,

108
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,399
you will not be able to win.

109
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,880
If I use the chess pieces
of the counterpart

110
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,480
to allow my rook to escape,

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,519
this method is known as a distraction.

112
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,040
After shifting the piece,

113
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,279
it could turn into an opening

114
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,440
as another way to victory.

115
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,160
If you do not let go of your obsession,

116
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,519
in the game of chess,

117
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:59,160
it will be difficult to move forward.

118
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,760
Look.

119
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,640
I won.

120
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,359
Impressive moves.

121
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,040
Let's play a game.

122
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:12,799
Let's go.

123
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,519
You lost.

124
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,239
It's fine to lose a game.

125
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:37,359
I went easy on him.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,519
By the way,

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,959
where has Boyang been?

128
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,880
He comes and goes recently.

129
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,519
He's hardly seen around.

130
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,000
What could he be up to?

131
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,000
Anyway,

132
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,200
before Mr. Liangji was
assigned to work for me,

133
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,480
did he serve the Minister of Rites

134
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,119
previously?

135
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,399
I understand.

136
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,760
I'll have it arranged.

137
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,600
I guarantee you will be able to

138
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,760
perform the Dance of Nuo with Xiaoman.

139
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,519
You made it seem like
I'm desperate to do so.

140
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,519
What did I tell you?

141
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,200
See?

142
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,440
She does not bear kind intentions.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,799
Haven't you heard?

144
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,239
The drunkard bears ulterior motives.

145
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,760
Did you think she truly
seeks to pray for the scholars?

146
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,000
She's just trying to suppress you.

147
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,559
Listen to me.

148
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,079
You need to beware.

149
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,559
She shared a past with Zhao Xiaoqian.

150
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,799
Do not provoke their past feelings.

151
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,119
Do you understand?

152
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,079
The first love is always
passionate and easily rekindled.

153
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:38,959
Mind your words.

154
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,799
Lady Xiaoman.

155
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,000
Lady Xiaoman.

156
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,519
Speak of the devil.

157
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,839
I heard of you back at the capital.

158
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,839
I met Hanchen urgently that night.

159
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,519
I wasn't able to greet you properly.

160
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,679
Where's Hanchen?

161
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,839
Is he not with you?

162
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,880
Classes for the students of

163
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,399
Luming Pavilion have ended.

164
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,720
Are you on your way back to the
Commandery Prince's Mansion?

165
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,559
I came to Wujiang Prefecture

166
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,079
to visit my brother,

167
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,959
but I also came to

168
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,320
get to know the friends

169
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
of Hanchen.

170
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,040
If you do not mind,

171
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,679
may I tag along?

172
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,160
We...

173
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,399
We're performing
the Dance of Prince of Lanling.

174
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,559
Hanchen and I

175
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,600
were playing when we were kids.

176
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,799
I performed this dance before him.

177
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,880
His knowledge in etiquette and customs

178
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,640
surpasses mine.

179
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,359
I would like to consult him.

180
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,039
At the same time,
I could learn it with you.

181
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,320
Nuo Opera

182
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
originated from
the ancient Nuo Sacrifice.

183
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,479
Back then,
it was a religious ceremony to

184
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,440
coronate the Emperor.

185
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,679
There are many types.

186
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,000
There are types to pray for blessings
and types to repel evil spirits.

187
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,119
The most common one at the north

188
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,599
is Fangxiangshi's Dance of Nuo.

189
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,359
In the south, Prince of Lanling
is the most common.

190
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,960
Over the years, Bailu Academy

191
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,320
has been performing
the Dance of Prince of Lanling.

192
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,960
This is it.

193
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,760
Prince of Lanling of the Northern Qi

194
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:09,039
possessed a delicate
and graceful figure.

195
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,520
He fought the enemies wearing a mask

196
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:13,679
and achieved countless victories.

197
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:18,320
Your form is hideous.

198
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,760
Your Highness.

199
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,799
They were meant for ladies.

200
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,280
I'm just demonstrating.

201
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:24,640
Your Highness.

202
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,719
Lady Xie's carriage has arrived.

203
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,320
Your Highness.

204
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,799
The Helu is a remnant
of Duke of Yongguo.

205
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:36,960
Get back to work.

206
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,760
Hanchen.

207
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,359
Hanchen.

208
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,559
Lingniang?

209
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,320
What are you doing here?

210
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:55,799
You're sure cocky.

211
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:57,159
Why can't I be here?

212
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,679
I'm a student of Jingnv Pavilion now.

213
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,799
I'm Xiaoman's classmate.

214
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,320
You knew this.

215
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,400
I've always wanted to be
a student of Teacher Liu.

216
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,239
It's a pity that she refuses
to go to the capital.

217
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,559
Now that I'm here,

218
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,200
I'm going to learn from her.

219
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,280
Were you chosen as Prince of Lanling?

220
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,159
I volunteered,

221
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,640
but practice is required.

222
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,400
The teacher said that
the best would be selected.

223
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,479
I volunteered, too.

224
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,080
Hanchen,

225
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,159
do you remember

226
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,159
that back at the palace,

227
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,679
the Empress taught me the Dance of Nuo.

228
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,840
You guided me a lot then.

229
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,000
That's why

230
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,119
I came to learn from you.

231
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:32,960
You...

232
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,719
I don't care.

233
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,280
You're my brother.

234
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,599
During the shooting ceremony on July,

235
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,919
I was the one who drew your mask.

236
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,159
Besides, we're performing
the Dance of Prince of Lanling.

237
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:42,520
Do you remember

238
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,799
the story of the general

239
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,000
Xiaojie told us?

240
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,280
You weren't like this back then.

241
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,520
You're pulling a long face.

242
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,280
Back then, you said you
wanted to marry...

243
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,080
Isn't this Xiaojie's sword?

244
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,719
This is for Xiaoman.

245
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:05,679
Thank you.

246
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,239
I'll head home and practise alone.

247
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,119
I'll leave you both alone.

248
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,520
Xiaoman.

249
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,359
Xiaoman is rather irascible.

250
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,060
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

251
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,520
Hanchen gave the Helu to that lady.

252
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,239
It seems like their bond

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,159
can't be broken by me easily.

254
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Xie Xiaoman

255
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,039
is more trouble than we expected.

256
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:40,919
The Empress

257
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,359
has never earned the protection

258
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,520
of His Majesty to this extent for years.

259
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,840
What kind of enticement

260
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,799
did Xie Xiaoman pull

261
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,239
in order for

262
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,599
Hanchen to fall heads over heels?

263
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:54,280
I'm sure you've heard, Lady Shen.

264
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,159
The lower one's origins are,

265
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,280
the more licentious they'd behave.

266
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,039
Licentious sounds really crude.

267
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,000
However, no men could resist that.

268
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,599
I was told,
on the day I arrived at the city,

269
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,599
my brother's lackey, Xu Shu

270
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,159
won a hefty sum from

271
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,280
Hanchen's learning partner.

272
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,119
While drinking with my brother,

273
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,080
I overheard their conversation.

274
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,520
Xu Shu?

275
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,180
(Yan's Mansion)

276
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,080
Master,

277
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,640
we spent the day loitering around.

278
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,919
We didn't go to the academy.

279
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,559
If Old Master Yan finds out, he would...

280
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,919
Why would I go?

281
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,840
They are all going to laugh at me.

282
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,039
Unbelievable.

283
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,440
You unfilial son!

284
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,320
Father.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,880
You macaque.

286
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,719
How dare you lie?

287
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:06,159
The teacher from your academy dropped by

288
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,039
and told us

289
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,520
that you haven't been attending
the academy for the past few days.

290
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,719
Your mother said

291
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,000
you've been frequenting filthy places

292
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
like the brothel!

293
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,520
What's wrong?

294
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,280
You can't learn anything
from the academy,

295
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,320
but you could learn from the brothel?

296
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,679
Boyang is aware of his mistake.

297
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,320
He will not repeat that anymore.

298
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,840
Don't be too harsh on the son.

299
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,719
Is he even sorry?

300
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,280
He doesn't look sorry to me!

301
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,320
He's bold enough to frequent
the brothel!

302
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,159
If we leave him be,

303
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,119
he will end up a useless lecher!

304
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,000
He's going to spend

305
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,280
the wealth I accumulated!

306
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,559
Loving mothers spoil their sons!

307
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,719
That's who you are!

308
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,799
Reprimand me as you please.

309
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,039
Do not involve my mother in this.

310
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,559
Shut up!

311
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,799
Reprimand you?

312
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,679
I was going easy on you.

313
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,400
You shouldn't even
step foot in a brothel.

314
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,479
Right now,

315
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:17,640
the Personnel Commissioner has
arrived at Wujiang Prefecture

316
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,000
to eliminate corrupted officials.

317
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,359
Are you treating me

318
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,799
as a joke?

319
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,599
The son of a bureaucrat

320
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,520
frequenting the red-light district.

321
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,679
You may not care,
but I have a reputation to keep!

322
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:33,039
Yes.

323
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,359
I brought dishonour to the family.

324
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,919
I'm nothing like my brother.

325
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,479
When my brother was 20,

326
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:39,479
he passed the civil examination.

327
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,559
Every year on his birthday,

328
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,719
you'd throw him a huge
birthday celebration.

329
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:44,719
As for me,

330
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,400
it's my birthday tomorrow.

331
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,679
Does any of you remember?

332
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,760
I want to eat

333
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,239
my mother's longevity noodles, too.

334
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,080
You called me a failure.

335
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,000
Fine.

336
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,400
That's who I am.

337
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,599
I'm no longer

338
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,760
the second son of Yan Family!

339
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,119
Boyang.

340
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,119
Master.

341
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:00,760
Boyang.

342
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,919
Boyang.

343
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,080
Is tomorrow

344
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,039
Boyang's birthday?

345
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,940
(Yan's Mansion)

346
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,000
Mr. Yan,

347
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:32,679
you're pretty slick.

348
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,919
Are you trying to escape?

349
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,679
What are you talking about?

350
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,320
I'm telling you.

351
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,760
This is my house.

352
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm not afraid of you.

353
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,919
I'm not evil.

354
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:42,760
Isn't that right?

355
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,719
There's no need to fear.

356
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,440
We're not committing a crime.

357
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,239
Let's have a cup of tea.

358
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,400
Come here.

359
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,280
Move it.

360
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:51,960
Get out of the way.

361
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,599
Get out of the way.

362
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,280
Get out of the way.

363
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,880
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

364
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,599
Get out.

365
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,260
(Pledge)

366
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,280
Speak.

367
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,679
What do you want?

368
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,880
Division of Personnel

369
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,320
are inspecting the whole
of Wujiang Prefecture.

370
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,080
You're the son of a bureaucrat.

371
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,239
You gambled and failed
to pay your debts.

372
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,239
Will

373
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,960
your father be implicated?

374
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,599
It's my problem.

375
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,320
It has nothing to do with my father.

376
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,679
If the Personnel Commissioner

377
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,119
happens to find this receipt,

378
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,960
no matter how capable Lord Yan is,

379
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,520
he will not be able to
avoid the complete liquidation.

380
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,719
No matter how honest Lord Yan is,

381
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:41,719
tell me,

382
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,559
which official is completely clean?

383
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,640
If this minor impurity

384
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,320
was discovered by the commissioner,

385
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,359
do you think

386
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,280
Zhao Xiaoqian,

387
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,200
a Commandery Prince
uninvolved in politics,

388
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:53,159
an abandoned prince
exiled from the capital,

389
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,719
would be able to help
resolve this for your father?

390
00:16:58,479 --> 00:16:59,520
Quit threatening me.

391
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,359
What's it that you want?

392
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:04,719
I want the Helu.

393
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,719
Zhao Xiaoqian's Helu?

394
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,640
Good morning.

395
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,079
Xiaoman.

396
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,479
What's this?

397
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Is this your new polo mallet?

398
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,680
Let me take a look.

399
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,199
This is Zhao Xiaoqian's Helu.

400
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,880
I need it for
the Dance of Prince of Lanling.

401
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,719
Does the practice begin today?

402
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,319
Let me have a look.

403
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,359
How petty.

404
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,000
In my opinion,

405
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,479
with your abilities,

406
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:55,640
you'd definitely emerge
as the main dancer.

407
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,400
You're way better than she is.

408
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,239
Don't be ridiculous.

409
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,280
It's true.

410
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:04,880
I heard that

411
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,959
Xie Xiaoman will be bringing
the Helu to the academy tomorrow.

412
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,199
You know what to do.

413
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,079
Boyang.

414
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,599
Where have you been
for the past few days?

415
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,599
You're nowhere to be found.

416
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,359
I...

417
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,160
Hanchen,

418
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,319
do you know what day it is today?

419
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,280
Xiaoman is learning
the Dance of Nuo today.

420
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,000
Should we

421
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,119
watch her in secret?

422
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,239
She came to ask for my help yesterday.

423
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:43,880
I didn't manage to.

424
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,719
Peeping

425
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,719
would make you a lecher.

426
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,040
It doesn't matter.

427
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,439
I have to make sure she gets selected.

428
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,119
Boyang.

429
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:54,439
Boyang.

430
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:56,839
Fine.

431
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,760
Another one who avoids me for no reason.

432
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,920
Your Highness.

433
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:01,920
Mr. Zhong.

434
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,959
My Old Master

435
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,280
has a message for the both of you.

436
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,719
It's Master Boyang's

437
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,400
18th birthday today.

438
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,520
Old Master Yan's slipped his mind.

439
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,959
Master Boyang is rather unhappy.

440
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,400
Hence, he

441
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,319
would like to invite both
of you to the mansion

442
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,599
after class

443
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,359
to celebrate Master Boyang's birthday.

444
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,119
It's Boyang's birthday today.

445
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,119
Raise your hand higher.

446
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,640
How do I do this?

447
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,839
Like this.

448
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,079
Just lift it slightly higher.

449
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,680
That's right.

450
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,199
Since

451
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,640
both of you would like
to play the role of Prince of Lanling,

452
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:50,040
I discussed the situation
with Teacher Liu.

453
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:51,959
The date of performance is near.

454
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,680
I hope that both of you
will practise diligently.

455
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:56,319
Once you master the moves,

456
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:58,800
we shall hold an appraisal
tomorrow afternoon.

457
00:19:59,079 --> 00:19:59,680
What do you say?

458
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,560
- Yes, teacher.
- Yes, teacher.

459
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Lady Shen is holding a sword.

460
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:06,119
You're using a wicker instead.

461
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,640
If you'd like to win,

462
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,719
you should place more effort

463
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,400
and equip yourself with the right prop.

464
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:12,640
Yes, teacher.

465
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,560
After the practice,

466
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,839
I'll retrieve the sword.

467
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,400
After becoming a concubine

468
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
of a distinguished household,

469
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,800
some people have
forgotten their place.

470
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,119
A village peasant

471
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,959
intends to compete with Lingniang.

472
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,359
Yes.

473
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,079
My sister is married to
the Commandery Prince.

474
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,719
She's eligible to compete

475
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:40,599
with Lady Shen.

476
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,400
On the other hand,

477
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,199
you're of no prominence

478
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,400
yet you'd insult others shamelessly.

479
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,560
Everyone knows

480
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,520
you have feelings for Congwen.

481
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,400
What did you say?

482
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,439
What's wrong?

483
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,959
I'm saying, someone
bears ulterior motives

484
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:53,959
towards Congwen.

485
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:54,880
Am I wrong?

486
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:56,920
Repeat it.

487
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,199
Ruying.

488
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:57,880
Did you just push me?

489
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:58,640
Minggu,

490
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,280
don't get in a fight.

491
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,560
We're in a wrong if we do.

492
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,079
Let's retrieve the sword.

493
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,560
I've learned to avoid her.

494
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,680
You shouldn't argue with her.

495
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:13,439
It's a waste of time.

496
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,199
I did it to defend you.

497
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,959
Xie Ruying of your household

498
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,800
has a disgraceful mouth.

499
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,719
If it wasn't for our close ties

500
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:21,839
with Xie Family,

501
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,560
I would have disciplined her
on behalf of Uncle Xie.

502
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:24,599
By the way,

503
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,400
why didn't you bring
the sword with you?

504
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,719
The Helu is Zhao Xiaoqian's
prized possession.

505
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,439
I dare not bring it out casually.

506
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,719
I don't want to damage or lose it.

507
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,560
You're so concerned about him.

508
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,280
His childhood friend

509
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,719
is about to trample on you.

510
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,439
What's wrong, Xiaoman?

511
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:45,839
What happened?

512
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,439
The Helu is gone.

513
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,439
It's gone?

514
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,920
How is that possible?

515
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,599
Maoya.

516
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,400
What are you up to?

517
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,560
If you have time,

518
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,880
let's head to Yan's Mansion
after class today.

519
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,800
We're going to celebrate Yan Boyang...

520
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,520
Forget it.

521
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,719
We need to practise the Dance of Nuo.

522
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,119
There's practice?

523
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,599
You should skip the afternoon classes.

524
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,439
I'll take you home to practise.

525
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:09,719
Mr. Liangji

526
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,719
would be able to teach
you better than the coach.

527
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:11,439
It's fine.

528
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:14,319
The coach is pretty great.

529
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:15,560
There's no need to concern us.

530
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:17,839
Both of you...

531
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,160
Why is everyone avoiding me?

532
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,719
Xiaoman.

533
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,319
How did I lose the Helu?

534
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,719
He cherishes the Helu the most.

535
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,599
Xiaoman.

536
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,560
Do not panic.

537
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,599
I'm not

538
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,560
leaving after class.

539
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,560
I'll look for it with you.

540
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Even if we were to
search all corners

541
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:42,839
of Jingnv Pavilion,

542
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,280
I'll find it, all right?

543
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:46,599
Do not worry.

544
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:55,680
Master Yan,

545
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,719
His Highness and Mr. Zhong
are here to see you.

546
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,520
Forget it.

547
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,680
Master Yan.

548
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,839
I said I'm not seeing anyone today.

549
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,839
Tell them I'm asleep.

550
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,920
Hold it right there.

551
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,079
Boyang,

552
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,560
what a friend you are.

553
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,199
You didn't even invite us
over for your birthday celebration.

554
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,040
Look at you.

555
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:27,680
Look.

556
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,719
Why are you here?

557
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,040
I don't like your tone of voice.

558
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,119
Can't we show up to
celebrate your birthday?

559
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,359
Yan Boyang,

560
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,359
you've gotten really brazen.

561
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,959
You didn't even invite us
over for your birthday.

562
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,119
I...

563
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,400
You forgot about my birthday anyway.

564
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,000
My memory is horrible.

565
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You knew that.

566
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,000
Besides,

567
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,599
both of us are right here.

568
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,479
Listen to me.

569
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:51,800
Close friends are

570
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,280
more likely to miss important dates.

571
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,959
Did you know that?

572
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,280
That's enough.

573
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,719
It's my fault.

574
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,000
I

575
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
offer my sincerest apology.

576
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,079
Here, Boyang.

577
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:02,640
Happy birthday.

578
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,920
Lord Yan.

579
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,640
My son.

580
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,479
Your father realised he was wrong.

581
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,880
He spent all night on this.

582
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:33,640
Let's hear it.

583
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,800
Go on.

584
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,040
My...

585
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,280
My...

586
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:44,319
My son...

587
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,520
Let me do it.

588
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,040
My son, Zhanzhi,

589
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,000
I forgot your birthday.

590
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,119
It's my fault.

591
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:55,719
I've done nothing

592
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,119
to deserve acclamation

593
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,959
yet by the grace of the heavens,

594
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,199
I was blessed with you and your brother.

595
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,199
My son, Zhanzhi,

596
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:04,719
you should understand,

597
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,439
as a member of nobility,

598
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,680
no matter how exceptional

599
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
or virtuous you are,

600
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,199
the public may still doubt you.

601
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,040
However, one minor mistake

602
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,959
will invite the denunciation
of them all.

603
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,599
Besides devoting yourself
into rectification

604
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,599
and studies,

605
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
there's no other way.

606
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,359
A man should bear great ambitions.

607
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,239
Respect your elders,
sever lust and desires,

608
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,359
abandon idleness,

609
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,079
pursue the virtues of the saint,

610
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,319
portray the qualities of a sage,

611
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,479
keep the enlightenment
engraved in your heart,

612
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,839
submit and assert as required,
discard trivial troubles,

613
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:32,839
always ready to learn,
and eliminate immorality.

614
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,160
Your father,

615
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,680
Yan Nengfu.

616
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,719
Here comes the longevity noodles.

617
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:46,959
Master Boyang,

618
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:47,719
enjoy it while it's hot.

619
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,439
Dig in.

620
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,079
Boyang,

621
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,959
I selected this fine stallion

622
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:53,920
from the mansion.

623
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:55,280
It might not be Zhao Mao,

624
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,800
but it came from Dayuan.

625
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,160
You must cherish it.

626
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,079
There you go.

627
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,000
I never said I wanted a horse.

628
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,400
Boyang is shy.

629
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:12,959
Come on.

630
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:13,800
Bottoms up.

631
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,280
Cheers to Boyang's birthday.

632
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:17,839
All right. Happy birthday.

633
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,119
Happy birthday.

634
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:24,160
I'm sorry.

635
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,920
Come on.

636
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,839
Let's eat.

637
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,800
Lord Yan, cheers.

638
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,079
Both of you.

639
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,079
Xiaoman,

640
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
we can't find it anywhere.

641
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
What should we do?

642
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,839
I have to inform him.

643
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:03,959
Xiaoman.

644
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,000
Mr. Liangji.

645
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,319
Has she returned to Lotus Garden?

646
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:33,159
Yes.

647
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,119
Why do you think

648
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,479
Xie Xiaoman is always
giving me an attitude?

649
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,239
I did not offend her in any way,

650
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,719
but she's always mad at me.

651
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
In my humble opinion,

652
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,280
I think Lady Xie is jealous.

653
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,880
Your Highness,

654
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,680
look.

655
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,839
Ever since Lady Shen's
arrival at Wujiang Prefecture,

656
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,880
Lady Xie hasn't been at ease.

657
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,760
Back at the courtyard,

658
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,439
she wanted to practise
the Dance of Nuo.

659
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:57,079
However,
because Lady Shen was around,

660
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,160
Lady Xie was dispirited.

661
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,239
If that's true,

662
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,280
she's mad at me

663
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,920
because she cares for me.

664
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,599
Certainly.

665
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,160
That's what

666
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,439
majority of the ladies think.

667
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,599
I see.

668
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,719
Your Highness.

669
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,980
(Sleeping Room)

670
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:34,040
Xiaoman,

671
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:34,920
what's the matter?

672
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:38,160
I lost the Helu.

673
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,000
Please punish me.

674
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,160
What are you talking about?

675
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,959
Stop kneeling.

676
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:49,760
Get up first.

677
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,160
I lost the Helu.

678
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,439
Please punish me.

679
00:28:58,439 --> 00:28:59,119
I know

680
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,119
the Helu is the most important thing
to you.

681
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,439
I failed to take care of it.

682
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,479
It was my negligence.

683
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,719
Go ahead and punish me.

684
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,000
I would receive them willingly.

685
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,680
I would atone for my mistake.

686
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,119
Atone?

687
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,920
You can't afford to do so.

688
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,800
You lost the remnant
of the late Duke of Yongguo.

689
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,719
How dare you quibble shamelessly?

690
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,640
This is the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

691
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
It's not the residence of a commoner.

692
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,319
Servants.

693
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,520
Seize her.

694
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,199
- Yes.
- Yes.

695
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,839
May I speak to you?

696
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,239
Your Highness,

697
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,520
say something.

698
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:35,760
Zhao Xiaoqian,

699
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,040
can I please talk to you?

700
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,079
Speak.

701
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,800
I...

702
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,479
You begged me for the Helu.

703
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,040
You lost it as well.

704
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,599
Since you do not treasure it,

705
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,319
you shouldn't have asked me
in the first place.

706
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,359
What I'm trying to say is that

707
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,880
I lost the Helu.

708
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:03,040
It's my fault, not yours.

709
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:10,839
I lost the Helu.

710
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,119
I deserve all forms of punishment.

711
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,479
Punish me however you like

712
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,280
because I know

713
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,000
how important the Helu is to you.

714
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,560
I know I've committed

715
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,880
an unforgivable mistake.

716
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,199
However, Zhao Xiaoqian,
you've done nothing wrong.

717
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,920
You cannot be shackled by the sword.

718
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,719
You cannot be shackled

719
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,520
by the ruthless palace.

720
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,959
Liangji said that

721
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,119
ever since your brother passed away,

722
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,680
you never took the Helu out again.

723
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,479
You often jolt awake from your dreams.

724
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,400
Your Highness.

725
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,280
This wench

726
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,000
lost the remnant of
the late Duke of Yongguo.

727
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:50,640
Please leave her to me.

728
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,040
Stay out of this!

729
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,599
Who do

730
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,760
you think you all are?

731
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,920
Quit meddling in my matters.

732
00:30:58,479 --> 00:30:59,319
Take her away.

733
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:00,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

734
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:05,239
Zhao Xiaoqian.

735
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,560
Cast her out.

736
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,160
Did you hear that, Lady Xie?

737
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,119
His Highness wants you to leave.

738
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,980
(Kunning Palace)

739
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:56,959
If Hanchen is able to marry Lingniang,

740
00:31:57,439 --> 00:32:00,119
I'll definitely bring him back
to the capital.

741
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,800
I'll not allow him to
cause any more troubles.

742
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,160
If your son

743
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:11,640
was to live

744
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
completely under the surveillance
of Shen Family,

745
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
will you agree to that?

746
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:23,560
I dare not oppose.

747
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,959
I understand.

748
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,599
Their marriage

749
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,359
will be decided by me.

750
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,260
(Residence of the Su Family)

751
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,079
That can't be.

752
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:41,239
We searched everywhere,

753
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,239
but we cannot find it.

754
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:45,839
Jingnv Pavilion is
the only possible place.

755
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:48,959
This is strange.

756
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,239
Lady Su.

757
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,439
Lady Xie is here to see you.

758
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,160
What's wrong?

759
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:04,479
Why are you here?

760
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,239
Where's Zhao Xiaoqian?

761
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,239
What's wrong?

762
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,839
Stop crying, Xiaoman.

763
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:17,239
Tell me.

764
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,280
What's going on?

765
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,880
Send for Arms Instructor Qin.

766
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,040
Order him to search everywhere.

767
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,599
Even if he has to flip
Wujiang Prefecture around,

768
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,160
find me the Helu.

769
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:38,599
Yes, Your Highness.

770
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:05,839
How did it go?

771
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:07,079
Unfortunately,

772
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,080
it's a little prince.

773
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,959
The figure is already formed.

774
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,000
A kite came out of nowhere

775
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,120
and landed on Her Highness.

776
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,080
Her Highness had a shock

777
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,040
and suffered a miscarriage.

778
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,800
Yes.

779
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,159
Your Highness,

780
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,439
Imperial Household Department

781
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,360
treats us with contempt.

782
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:47,399
They wouldn't provide me with charcoal.

783
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,000
They even cast me out.

784
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:50,879
Apparently, the Empress

785
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,679
intends to hold a religious
ceremony for the late prince.

786
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,360
All palaces are
experiencing budget cuts.

787
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,199
What should we do?

788
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,040
They are clearly tormenting us.

789
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Brother is still ill.

790
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,080
I'm going to reason with them.

791
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,320
Your Highness.

792
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,959
Xiaoqian.

793
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,159
Your Highness.

794
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:14,239
The Empress just suffered
from a traumatic incident.

795
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:17,080
We should avoid troubles at all cost.

796
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,399
Fetch some charcoal from the kitchen.

797
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,280
Boil some water

798
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,679
and fill the heating bags.

799
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,439
We can warm ourselves up the same.

800
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:24,520
Your Highness,

801
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:27,520
the charcoal ran out a few days ago.

802
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,919
If there is any left,

803
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,159
there's no need to
beg them for charcoal.

804
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:34,239
There should be some
firewood left in the backyard.

805
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,159
Let's burn them to warm ourselves up.

806
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,959
Without charcoal,

807
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,399
the nights will still be freezing.

808
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:44,239
I'll cover you up with my

809
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,520
fur mantel.

810
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,919
You don't have to sleep
in the cold at night.

811
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,239
I don't want you to be
exposed to the cold.

812
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm not cold.

813
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,199
I'll head out to find some charcoal.

814
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,479
Your Highness.

815
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,479
Your Highness.

816
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Her Highness has arrived.

817
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,159
Your Highness,

818
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,679
you mustn't enter.

819
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,719
Wasn't Her Highness ill?

820
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,800
Why is she here?

821
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,040
Her Highness is speaking
to His Highness.

822
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,439
You may enter after they are done.

823
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,220
(Wude Palace)

824
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,800
Brother,

825
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,520
are you feeling warmer?

826
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,199
Where did you find the charcoal?

827
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,520
I guessed

828
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,719
they'd never restrict
His Majesty's supply.

829
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,800
I took some from

830
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,399
the side chamber of Ruisi Palace.

831
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,760
Taking without permission is theft.

832
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,439
Did you forget what I've taught you?

833
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,679
Xiaoqian.

834
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
In the future,

835
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,080
I may no longer be able
to keep you company.

836
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,959
Don't say that.

837
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,600
Don't say that.

838
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,159
You're lying.

839
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:02,800
Xiaoqian.

840
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,000
Remember.

841
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,479
No matter what happens,

842
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,040
no matter who asks for your return,

843
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,679
do not listen to them.

844
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:14,280
Do you understand?

845
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,520
No, I don't.

846
00:38:17,919 --> 00:38:18,760
Don't say that.

847
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,679
Stop messing around.

848
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,199
I'm not listening to you anymore.

849
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,360
You do not belong here.

850
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:25,639
Go.

851
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,000
Go to where you belong.

852
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,959
Did you say

853
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:31,679
you wanted to lead an army into war

854
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,080
and eliminate all the enemies?

855
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,199
Go.

856
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,959
Do not come back.

857
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,199
That's where you belong.

858
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,600
You will find freedom there.

859
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,159
It's the winter solstice.

860
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,199
It's the winter solstice.

861
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,080
It's the winter solstice.

862
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:04,959
Brother.

863
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,080
Brother.

864
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:07,280
Wake up, brother.

865
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,560
Brother.

866
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,479
Wake up, brother.

867
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,280
Brother.

868
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,199
Wake up, brother.

869
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,280
Brother.

870
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,760
Brother.

871
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,719
Wake up.

872
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,239
Brother, wake up.

873
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,159
Brother.

874
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,760
Brother, wake up.

875
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,479
Brother.

876
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:27,520
Brother.

877
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,520
Wake up.

878
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,800
Brother.

879
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
Brother.

880
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,439
Brother, wake up.

881
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,439
Wake up, brother.

882
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,639
Brother.

883
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,600
How long will you remain

884
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,679
hiding in Wujiang Prefecture?

885
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,199
Do you really want Xiaojie

886
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,600
to watch as the sheathed sword

887
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:55,919
goes to waste?

888
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,840
In three months,

889
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm leaving this place
for Zhending Prefecture.

890
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,199
Don't worry about the capital.

891
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Chancellor Qin has everything prepared.

892
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,239
He obtained His Majesty's approval.

893
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,439
His Majesty has plans
to conquer Baichuankou.

894
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,239
War is about to break out.

895
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,719
Although Baichuankou

896
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,280
is a fortress difficult to attain,

897
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,080
in order to accumulate merits,

898
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,120
this is your only opportunity.

899
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,520
Hanchen!

900
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,639
Do not forsake the dignity

901
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,840
