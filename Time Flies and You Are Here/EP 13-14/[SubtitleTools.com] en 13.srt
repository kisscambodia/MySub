(Main Hall)

22
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,400
Stop crying.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,959
All you do is cry.

24
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,800
What's the point of crying?

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,440
Crying will not bring Xiaoman back.

26
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:05,519
You're the best.

27
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:06,279
You know what to do

28
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:08,519
yet you couldn't come out
from the prison on your own.

29
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,639
The daughter has to
bear it for your sake.

30
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,199
I...

31
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,639
Xie Li is here.

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Father. Mother.

33
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,639
I've brought sister home.

34
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,000
Father.

35
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,240
Mother.

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,520
Where have you been?

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,160
Why didn't you inform us?

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,839
I'm very worried.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,639
Mother.

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
Don't cry.

41
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,199
I'm doing just fine.

42
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,240
Not at all.

43
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:44,119
You lost weight in a few days.

44
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:45,839
I'm extremely worried about you.

45
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,320
I'm very concerned.

46
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,639
Mother.

47
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,440
Man'er.

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,600
I let you down.

49
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm useless.

50
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,720
Father.

51
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:58,759
Father.

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,520
Father.

53
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,160
That hurts.

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm Li Su.

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,399
It's pointless to hit yourself.

56
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,279
She is home.

57
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:02,960
Look.

58
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,039
I'm Xiaoman's senior from the academy.

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
We met at Yuyangli Village as well.

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,600
Thank you for the cakes and repairs,

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,360
aunty.

62
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,360
Have you forgotten?

63
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:16,479
Mr. Li.

64
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,279
May I speak to you in private?

65
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,279
Man'er.

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,919
Take a break.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,520
Go on.

68
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,919
Mr. Li.

69
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,479
What should we do now?

70
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:46,520
If the Commandery Prince sells her off,

71
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,360
my daughter would suffer.

72
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,479
My daughter doesn't deserve
this mistreatment.

73
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,160
Do not worry, elders.

74
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,479
Although His Highness
and I do not get along,

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,399
the man he selected

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,199
is bonded with my father.

77
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,559
I came to an agreement with them.

78
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,279
If Xiaoman was sold,

79
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,759
they'd redeem her freedom for us.

80
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,000
However,

81
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,360
Xiaoman's reputation
would be tarnished.

82
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,039
It's going to be fine.

83
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,199
My poor child.

84
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,079
Lady Xie, are you feeling better?

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,600
By the way,

86
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:50,839
you asked

87
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,440
what happened at
the Commandery Prince's Mansion today.

88
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,200
Shi Deng'er told me that

89
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,559
Commandery Prince's brother...

90
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
I don't know what he's called.

91
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,920
Duke of Yongguo.

92
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,480
Yes.

93
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,119
Duke of Yongguo's birthday is coming up.

94
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,679
Around this time of the year,
the Commandery Prince's mansion...

95
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:06,959
has to pay memorial to Duke of Yongguo.

96
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:13,359
Did you know?

97
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,959
After the Qixi Festival

98
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,119
comes my brother's birthday.

99
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,920
Principal Yang once said

100
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,920
my brother and I are
completely different.

101
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,000
Both of us entered the palace together.

102
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,279
My brother was reliable,

103
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,920
and I was stubborn.

104
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,519
Everyone thought

105
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,760
my brother would emerge
as the next Emperor.

106
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,359
I've never thought of

107
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,720
competing with my brother anyway.

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,480
All I wanted

109
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,440
was after my brother
becomes the Emperor,

110
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,920
I'll head to the borders

111
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,320
and protect the state for my brother.

112
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,839
Unfortunately,

113
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,640
I was exiled from the capital.

114
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,799
Even worse,

115
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,679
he no longer exists.

116
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:21,959
Lady Xie.

117
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,320
A student from Bailu Academy
is at the main corridor.

118
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,119
The student calls himself
your classmate.

119
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,079
His name is Wang Weicheng.

120
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,359
What's he doing here?

121
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,959
Are you here to collect the goods

122
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,839
after receiving the deed
from Zhao Xiaoqian?

123
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,839
No.

124
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,279
That's not true.

125
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,119
I...

126
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,799
I do not intend to purchase you.

127
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,600
What are you doing here then?

128
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,519
Let me be honest with you.

129
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,359
I grew up with Lang Mengzi of

130
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,279
Jingnv Pavilion.

131
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,519
I promised her I'd never
marry a concubine.

132
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,040
Don't

133
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,519
even dream of entering my household.

134
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,600
Also,

135
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,760
by His Highness' orders,

136
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,000
he wants me to collect your deed

137
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:14,559
after the polo tournament

138
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
and release you.

139
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,440
He also wants me to
pass you a title deed.

140
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,880
I'm still troubled.

141
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,279
Mengzi misunderstood me.

142
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,720
I can't go on with this anymore.

143
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,640
Anyway,

144
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,920
I'll leave everything to you.

145
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,000
Resolve it among yourselves.

146
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,320
I'm leaving.

147
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,559
That fool.

148
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,160
Idiot.

149
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Lady Xie.

150
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,480
Wick.

151
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,600
Head to Minggu

152
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,160
and tell her to join me at the market.

153
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:47,720
Do it now.

154
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,359
He mistreated you.

155
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:07,679
Are you still going
to buy him something?

156
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,320
Besides,

157
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:10,640
the Commandery Prince's Mansion...

158
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,399
has no use for these.

159
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,600
Miss, what do you need?

160
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,519
Shopkeeper,

161
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:16,799
I would like

162
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,040
some cloth and bamboo splint
for kite-making.

163
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,880
Do you sell them here?

164
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,640
Yes.

165
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,079
It costs ten cash in total.

166
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,359
Thank you, miss.

167
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,359
I'm repaying the favour.

168
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,600
Repaying the favour?

169
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,719
Let's go.

170
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,799
Take care.

171
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,880
Your Highness.

172
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,799
Why is Your Highness drenched?

173
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,599
Shi Deng'er, what were you doing?

174
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,320
It has nothing to do with them.

175
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,559
Your Highness.

176
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,200
Do not follow me!

177
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,000
Mr. Liangji.

178
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,080
Where is Mr. Zhong?

179
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,520
Besides Mr. Zhong,

180
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,119
nobody else can persuade His Highness.

181
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,440
Mr. Zhong is at Mount Han Temple.

182
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,880
It's Duke of Yongguo's birthday.

183
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,000
He's off to light the lanterns.

184
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,479
Let's talk to Zhu Momo instead.

185
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,039
I don't want to be reprimanded.
You go instead.

186
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,400
You, come here.

187
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,599
Tell me.

188
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,880
What's going on?

189
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,239
(Xiaoqian.)

190
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:39,679
Brother.

191
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,799
Brother.

192
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,880
A partridge flew by the city gate.

193
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,599
(Zhao Xiaoqian at young age)
I asked Fuweng to catch it with me.

194
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,520
(Zhao Xiaoqian's brother, Zhao Xiaojie)
I'm not allowed to leave Wude Palace.

195
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,559
Otherwise,
the Empress would be upset.

196
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,200
It doesn't matter.

197
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,119
We can have fun here the same.

198
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,799
I want to go out there.

199
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,919
I don't want to drink tea in here.

200
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,640
It's bitter.

201
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,239
We can't do that yet.

202
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,479
Yesterday,

203
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,479
you knocked over Her Highness' tea cup.

204
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,599
Her Highness was enraged.

205
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,799
You should obey and stay put here.

206
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,039
I'll get Fuweng

207
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,479
to have some noodles served.

208
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,799
You should warm yourself up.

209
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:33,799
Tomorrow,

210
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,000
you shall learn " The Great Learning"

211
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
with Her Highness tomorrow

212
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,239
to cheer Her Highness up.

213
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:37,840
Is that all right?

214
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,359
Will Her Highness allow us to leave?

215
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,559
She doesn't like me.

216
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,359
I just want to fly a kite.

217
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,000
I want my kite to fly the highest

218
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:49,200
to show father and mother.

219
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,479
Once they see it,

220
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:51,840
would they come to visit us?

221
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,679
If father and mother saw your kite,

222
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,320
they'd lecture you for fooling around.

223
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:00,880
A few days ago,

224
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,760
did you break a wooden sword again?

225
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,760
I hate them for showing me an attitude.

226
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,599
They call me playful and mischievous.

227
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,320
Everyone thinks badly of me.

228
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,119
No one likes me here.

229
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:12,960
I want to go home.

230
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,080
Hide your treasured belongings well.

231
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:19,559
No matter what happens,
do not break them.

232
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Despite the contempt they show you,

233
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,359
these things will keep you company.

234
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,239
I'm right here, too.

235
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,719
I'll not mistreat you.

236
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,200
The wooden swords and kites

237
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,119
will not mistreat you either.

238
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,119
We will always stay by your side

239
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,039
forever and ever.

240
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,599
We'd watch you grow old

241
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:34,359
as you live a happy life.

242
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,080
Isn't that good enough?

243
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,799
I'll take you there right now.

244
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:43,119
Come on.

245
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,000
Your Highness.

246
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,640
It's cloudy today.

247
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,080
Why would anyone fly a kite?

248
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,359
Brother.

249
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,440
Your Highness.

250
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,239
Xingzhou.

251
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,119
Xiaoman came by just now

252
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,919
and left this to me.

253
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,880
She said

254
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,919
she made this kite herself

255
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,960
in hopes to comfort

256
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,320
your yearning for Xiaojie.

257
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:00,719
It's Xiaojie's birthday today.

258
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,640
I guessed you'd be...

259
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,679
Are you speaking on her behalf?

260
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:04,599
Like I said,

261
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,239
I do not want you to regret anything.

262
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,760
If Xiaoman was truly sold,

263
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,840
would you be happy?

264
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,559
Would you be able to forgive yourself?

265
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,159
Before Xiaoman left, she told me

266
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:16,880
the Zhao Xiaoqian she knows

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,559
never worried about a single thing.

268
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,280
Where is Hanchen?

269
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,080
Why isn't he here yet?

270
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,919
I stopped him from coming.

271
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,280
What?

272
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,200
How will we proceed
with the competition?

273
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,120
(Mulan)

274
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,640
The time for the polo tournament
shall begin soon.

275
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,080
We're going to give
a leeway of 30 minutes.

276
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,799
Absentees will be considered
as voluntary withdrawal.

277
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,159
I'm heading over.

278
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:47,679
Sure.

279
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,039
Ladies of Jingnv Pavilion,

280
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,520
you're all respected opponents.

281
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,119
If I do not show up,

282
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,280
it's a disrespect towards
your effort and ambition.

283
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,119
Xie Xiaoman,

284
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:09,919
this is your test.

285
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,559
You should see it through.

286
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,559
I'll be right here.

287
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,679
I'm not going easy on you.

288
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:37,799
Let's get it started, guys.

289
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,679
All right. Come on.

290
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,520
Move it.

291
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,119
Lady Xie,

292
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,599
quit standing around.

293
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,640
You should head inside.

294
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:37,680
His Highness is waiting for you.

295
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
What are you doing?

296
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,119
What are you trying to do?

297
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,400
I'm about to return as

298
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,359
a daughter of nobility.

299
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,479
You went against your words
and harassed me.

300
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,599
Yes.

301
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,160
I've decided not to let you go.

302
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,319
Why not?

303
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,640
We agreed beforehand.

304
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,079
No means no.

305
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,920
You're quite talkative today.

306
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,839
Xie Xiaoman,

307
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,959
are you pretending to be
dumb or are you blind?

308
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:36,560
Don't you see

309
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,920
everything I've prepared for you?

310
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,479
That's another matter altogether.

311
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,239
My deed is important.

312
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,199
You should be a man of your words.

I shouldn't have said that
I wanted to sell you off.

319
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,280
I found out.

320
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,880
Wang Weicheng told me everything.

321
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,160
You didn't mean to sell me.

322
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,760
You wanted to free me.

323
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,839

I like dogs.

(Prince Pu's Mansion)
About travelling to Wujiang Prefecture,

341
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,400
I already spoke to father and mother.

342
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,920
By the reason of visiting relatives,

343
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,640
I'll depart tomorrow.

344
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,160
As for the matters at the capital,

345
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,599
I'll have to trouble Your Highness.

346
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:43,400
Hanchen has always been headstrong.

347
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,599
If he upsets you

348
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,680
after your arrival at
Wujiang Prefecture,

349
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:48,000
do not worry.

350
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,680
I'm on your side.

351
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,140
(Brothel)

352
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,400
Yanniang.

353
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,079
What are you...

354
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,560
Congwen,

355
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,880
I've decided to marry Squire Wang.

356
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,880
I invited you here

357
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,199
just to bid you farewell.

358
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,560
Do you remember back then
when we first met

359
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:55,800
at Yanliu Forest?

360
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,599
The red peach blossoms flutter gently

361
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,560
as the east wind blows.

362
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,000
The heart aches for whom?

363
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,359
The anguish of a woman, forced
to marry a man she doesn't love.

364
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,520
As passion fades,

365
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:16,400
she was shrouded

366
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,199
by the memories they shared.

367
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,479
It was drizzling that day.

368
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,400
You took shelter under a pavilion.

369
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:51,680
I was playing the song, The Hidden Moon.

370
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,160
I have three wishes.

371
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,880
One, for my lover to live a long life.

372
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,199
Two, for a healthy body.

373
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:17,319
Three, to be like
the birds of the forest.

374
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,079
I'll meet you in my dreams.

375
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,599
Mr. Li.

376
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,800
Your father and I were
officials of the same age.

377
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,000
We could be considered colleagues.

378
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,520
Today,

379
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,359
let's be honest with each other.

380
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,199
Do you know why Courtesan Zhu's
appeals were

381
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,280
constantly deterred?

382
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:54,839
I know.

383
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,239
Since you're aware,

384
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,479
I hope you will not make
things difficult for me.

385
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:02,880
Lord Yan.

386
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:03,959
Is there

387
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,199
any other way?

388
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:08,280
As long as you remain

389
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,520
as the guarantor of Courtesan Zhu,

390
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:13,400
she will not be able to
regain her freedom.

391
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:16,880
She's just a courtesan at the brothel.

392
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,359
Your father would never

393
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,040
allow you to marry a frivolous woman.

394
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,119
Not to mention,

395
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,400
a man would like to act as
Courtesan Zhu's guarantor.

396
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,040
Mr. Li, consider letting her go

397
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,359
so she could find a man to rely on.

398
00:27:25,572 --> 00:27:28,553
(Bailu Academy)

399
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,640
(Jingnv Pavilion)

400
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,119
Stream of Bian flows.
Stream of Si flows.

401
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:35,959
They flow towards
the ancient port of Yangtze River.

402
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,599
Congwen.

403
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,400
Longing and hatred.

404
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,680
There's no end until your return.

405
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,839
Holding each other under the moonlight.

406
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,160
Although the structure
of this piece is short,

407
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,800
with the form of repetition,

408
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:17,520
it expresses the endless longing.

409
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,479
The pain of longing and
the agony of separation

410
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,520
were portrayed vividly.

411
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,359
All right. You may all take a break.

412
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,680
Thank you, Congwen.

413
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,160
Don't you think

414
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,520
Congwen is rather strange today?

415
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,560
(She stands in a daze among
the flowers while swallows fly in pairs.)

416
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,199
You're walking like my father.

417
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,079
Both hands on your back.

418
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,640
I like it.

419
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,319
Right.

420
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,359
The old men are often arrogant.

421
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,199
It's a good thing that
I'm behaving more mature.

422
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:05,880
Sure.

423
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,839
You're always right.

424
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,079
Actually,

425
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,160
it feels pretty good
to put my hands behind.

426
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,800
Xingzhou.

427
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:12,719
Try it out.

428
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,839
We went through the entire street.

429
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,560
We've been looking around.

430
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,040
What exactly are you looking for?

431
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,880
I have a confession to
make to Xie Xiaoman.

432
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:24,359
After contemplation,

433
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,400
I need to buy a gift

434
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,560
and come up with an excuse.

435
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,680
What's the matter?

436
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,959
Are you going to confess your love?

437
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,760
You should consult me in this regard.

438
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,880
I'm the perfect person to ask.

439
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,680
Fine, enlighten me.

440
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:36,880
All right.

441
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,079
Recently,

442
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,239
a trend has been going on
in Wujiang Prefecture.

443
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,560
A poem is hidden in the lantern.

444
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:44,839
It's not visible during the day.

445
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,599
However, once it's lit up at night,

446
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,439
the poem would be displayed.

447
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,880
The Ghost Festival is around the corner.

448
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,760
The stream will be filled with lanterns.

449
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,800
You may express your feelings this way.

450
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:54,719
What do you think?

451
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:56,959
No.

452
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,359
This feels obscure.

453
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,560
It doesn't fit my personality.

454
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,599
As long as it works, am I right?

455
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:02,880
Many gentlemen

456
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
express their love with this approach.

457
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,040
It works for many of them.

458
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:08,000
How did you know that?

459
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,839
I...

460
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,439
I've been writing

461
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:14,680
to an old friend of mine.

462
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:15,640
That's what she told me.

463
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,319
A man like you has a pen pal?

464
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,439
Aren't you worried she
could end up as an old hag?

465
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,199
Don't be ridiculous.

466
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,640
I asked.

467
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,319
She's 16 years old this year.

468
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,680
On the day of Ghost Festival,

469
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,119
take me to the lanterns.

470
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,560
The civil examination is coming up.

471
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,160
I need to prepare for it.

472
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,479
Let's do it some other time.

473
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,599
Don't be mad.

474
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,119
Listen to me.

475
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,079
It wouldn't make a difference
to go next time, right?

476
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,359
What's wrong?

477
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,719
Hanchen.

478
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:50,319
(Lotus Garden)
Stream of Bian and Stream of Si flow.

479
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,319
They flow towards
the ancient port of Yangtze River.

480
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,680
Longing and worries...

481
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,319
What in the world is this?

482
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,439
Read it properly.

483
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,400
I don't understand

484
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,239
a single word.

485
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,800
Congwen always

486
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,959
teaches you difficult materials.

487
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,079
No wonder Courtesan Zhu left him.

488
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What did you say?

489
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:16,040
You heard about what
happened between

490
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,800
Courtesan Zhu and Congwen as well?

491
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,439
Yes.

492
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,479
I was out eating noodles in the morning.

493
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,719
The owner of Da'e Noodle House said

494
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,439
Courtesan Zhu is getting married.

495
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,719
She's going to be married to a squire.

496
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,119
Apparently,
he owns tens of hectares of farmland.

497
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,119
He's wealthy.

498
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:31,319
Could that be true?

499
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,400
Courtesan Zhu is getting married?

500
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,719
Did they mention Congwen?

501
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,199
I'm not sure.

502
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,719
Well, everyone thinks

503
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:42,599
Congwen is just a poor scholar.

504
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,839
It's a good thing Courtesan Zhu

505
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,800
isn't marrying him.

506
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,520
I think so, too.

507
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:48,079
If I get to choose,

508
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,560
I'd marry the squire

509
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,599
and be an owner of land.

510
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,119
Congwen is a poor man
who enjoys poetry.

511
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:54,319
He gives me a headache.

512
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,000
Don't be ridiculous!

513
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,680
Did they mention

514
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,760
the courtesan being
forced into the marriage?

515
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,199
What happens if the squire

516
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
seized her by force?

517
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,239
Congwen is a mere scholar.

518
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,079
He will not be able to win.

519
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,359
I haven't heard of that.

520
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:20,880
Do not enter.

521
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:23,959
Enter.

522
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,400
No.

523
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,160
Shi Deng'er.

524
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,680
Enter.

525
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:34,680
Do I enter or not?

526
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:37,520
Do not enter.

527
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,319
You...

528
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,239
His Highness is here.

529
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,560
Who's here?

530
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,400
- Who is it?
- Shi Deng'er.

531
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,479
Shi Deng'er.

532
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:44,800
His Highness is here.

533
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,239
Why are you pushing me?

534
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,920
His Highness is here.

535
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,660
(Lotus Garden)

536
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,000
What are you doing here?

537
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,359
This is my home.

538
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,239
I can go anywhere I want to.

539
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,880
Your words are hideous.

540
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,319
Zhao Xiaoqian.

541
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,680
I'll teach you Su Calligraphy.

542
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,639
Do you know how to write it?

543
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,080
Of course I do.

544
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,120
Who am I?

545
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,159
The well-rounded Commandery Prince.

546
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,879
You're one lucky girl.

547
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:38,280
Tell me.

548
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,000
What does holding each other
under the moonlight mean?

549
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,080
Under the bright moonlight,

550
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,080
two lovers should enjoy it
by holding each other

551
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,639
to properly appreciate its beauty.

552
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,080
You enjoy writing poetry.

553
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,919
Do you like poetry
hidden in the lanterns?

554
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,320
Oh, right.

555
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:01,239
Let me ask you.

556
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,840
Do you think

557
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,679
a man would forcibly

558
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,320
marry a woman of another man?

559
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,840
Should I stay the night?

560
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,919
Lecher!

561
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,040
Your Highness.

562
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:21,479
What do you intend to buy?

563
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,600
We left abruptly.

564
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,840
I haven't finished my rice cakes.

565
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,800
Sir.

566
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,520
Would you like a lantern?

567
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,600
These two are rather exquisite.

568
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
You have a keen eye, sir.

569
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,360
These two

570
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,719
are different from the rest.

571
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,760
Look at this one.

572
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,760
"Cut all ties" is written on this one.

573
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,959
They are

574
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,560
used by the ladies to reject men.

575
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:45,919
What about this one?

576
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,320
This is great.

577
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,120
Look.

578
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:51,280
"Lover on the other side."

579
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,760
This lantern

580
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,439
is one of our best sellers.

581
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:56,199
This is the last piece left.

582
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,159
Really?

583
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,439
This one it is.

584
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:04,560
How much does it cost?

585
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,199
Ten cash.

586
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:07,719
Your Highness.

587
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,159
Wait up.

588
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,820
(Brothel)

589
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,520
I loved the lady for a long time,

590
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,239
but she had no idea.

591
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:24,760
"Dew becomes frost".

592
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:26,679
"Dew becomes frost".

593
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,239
Tell me.

594
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,760
What exactly is going on

595
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,679
in a woman's head?

596
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,040
"Dew becomes frost".

597
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,000
"Dew becomes frost".

598
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,120
I told you the story of

599
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,239
Minggu and I.

600
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,360
Please advise me.

601
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,940
("Dew becomes frost")

602
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,520
Hold it.

603
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,159
What are you doing?

604
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,719
Let go.

605
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,399
"Dew becomes frost"?

606
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,760
Which lady are you writing to?

607
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,879
Are you thinking about ladies already?

608
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:28,360
Are you fully grown?

609
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,520
Mind your own business.

610
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:30,959
Give it back.

611
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:31,639
You...

612
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,959
A letter written to a lady.

613
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,040
I'm sure the letter

614
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,919
consists of things you don't
want others to find out.

615
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:38,760
How about this?

616
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,000
I'll charge you 20 strings of 1000 cash.

617
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:43,120
and act as your pigeon
to deliver the letter.

618
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,959
20 strings?

619
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:45,239
In your dreams.

620
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
I don't have money for you.

621
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,560
Fine.

622
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,520
I'll order a few servants

623
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,080
and have this letter
duplicated in hundreds.

624
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,479
I'll stick them all over Bailu Academy.

625
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,080
How dare you?

626
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,320
Why not?

627
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,760
I cannot allow Ming...

628
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,679
Ming?

629
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,479
What are you talking about?

630
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,879
Quit yapping.

631
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,239
I have no money for you.

632
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,159
I can't be bothered.

633
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
By noon tomorrow,

634
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,239
at the entrance of Bailu Academy,

635
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,760
if I do not receive the money,

636
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm going to stick your letter

637
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,600
onto the notice board.

638
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,639
Let's go.

639
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:15,760
Xu Shu!

640
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:16,360
You...

641
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,919
You rascal!

642
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:24,560
Qiongqiong.

643
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,239
Burn them all.

644
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,220
(From Congwen)

645
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,439
Sister,

646
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,600
I do not understand.

647
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,719
You clearly have feelings
for Mr. Congwen.

648
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,760
Why would you agree to
Squire Wang's proposal?

649
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:47,919
Burn these letters first.

650
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,479
Sister, I can't burn them.

651
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,199
The letters consist of your poetry

652
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,239
written with Mr. Congwen.

653
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,919
You have yet to pass them to him.

654
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:54,760
You can't burn them.

655
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:55,879
Enough.

656
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:59,000
Congwen and I are over.

657
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,800
Since it's over,

658
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,120
it's pointless to keep these around.

659
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,959
Sister.

660
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
Your heart still yearns for Mr. Congwen.

661
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:15,399
I've made up my mind.

662
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,639
Do not try to convince me.

663
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:20,959
Burn the letters.

664
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,439
Tomorrow,

665
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,239
we're leaving.

666
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,780
(Bailu Academy)

667
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,159
Lady Xie, please hold on.

668
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:11,919
Qiongqiong?

669
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,520
Lady Xie,

670
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,760
I have a favour to ask.

671
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:19,239
Take your time.

672
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,280
I'll take a walk at the Shi Alley.

673
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,159
Is this about Courtesan Zhu?

674
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,280
Is she really getting married?

675
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,000
Was it out of her own will

676
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,040
or was she extorted by the squire?

677
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,800
It was out of her own free will.

678
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:41,639
Lady Xie.

679
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,040
Lady Xie.

680
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,280
Lady Xie.

681
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,040
Lady Xie.

682
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,199
You may not have known.

683
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Since the courtesan told Mr. Congwen

684
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,080
about her marriage,

685
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,399
Mr. Congwen never stepped
foot in the brothel.

686
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm certain

687
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,280
that she still yearns for Mr. Congwen.

688
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,280
I'm sure Mr. Congwen
feels the same as well.

689
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,520
However, we're leaving tonight.

690
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:04,040
I just

691
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:06,040
wanted them to meet for one last time.

692
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,000
Perhaps, things will turn around.

693
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,000
Even if nothing changes,

694
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:11,959
at least they could
have bid each other farewell.

695
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,199
Sister kept everything to herself.

696
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,760
I'm concerned about her.

697
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,679
One last time?

698
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,679
This

699
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,760
was written by her and Mr. Congwen.

700
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,000
It's called the Sapphire Song.

701
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,800
Mr. Congwen wrote the first verse

702
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:26,639
while she wrote the bottom half.

703
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,719
She hasn't shown it to Mr. Congwen yet.

704
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Once he sees this,

705
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,159
he'd definitely come to meet her.

706
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,919
Since Courtesan Zhu has
made the decision on her own,

707
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,439
there's nothing I can do either.

708
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,760
My apologies.

709
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,800
Lady Xie.

710
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,399
It's fine if you wouldn't
pass it to Mr. Congwen.

711
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:43,280
I

712
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,000
said what I needed to say.

713
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,239
I shall return to pack our belongings.

714
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:49,560
Qiongqiong.

715
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,719
At 9.45 p.m. during
the Ghost Festival tonight,

716
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,959
Squire Wang's carriage
to pick Courtesan Zhu up

717
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:57,439
will be passing by the market on Leqiao.

718
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,280
I'll be waiting for your reply.

719
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,719
