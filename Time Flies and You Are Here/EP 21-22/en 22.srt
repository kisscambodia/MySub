Countless of people,

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,160
over the ages,

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,760
worked hard for years

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,919
just for the title of
the principal graduate.

Countless of people

27
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,319

I wish my father

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,800
was never the principal graduate.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,720
I heard

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,759
that you may make a wish
if you see a divine beast.

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,119
If we manage

33
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,240
to encounter Kun,

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,800
let's make a wish together.

35
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:15,600
All right.

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,880

It's Kun!

Look.

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,679
Just like Teacher Liu,

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,080
I want to be a teacher.

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,119
I shall take over Su Chang Ji

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,679
and become an upright shopkeeper
just like my mother.

44
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,360

45
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,360
it's your turn.

46
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:54,000
I want to attain the fourth rank
by the age of 30,

47
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,119
the third rank by the age of 40,

48
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,839
and enter the privy council

49

51

You've yet to...

56
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
This is my wish.

57
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,720
You're going to emerge
as the principal graduate.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,839
I will charge my own fate.

It's getting cold.

62
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,720

A friend of mine is undertaking
the civil examination.

76
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,880
I'm not sure if things are going well.

77
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,720
I'm rather concerned about him.

78
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,720
You're concerned about someone?

79
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:23,720
Are you worried that he might fail?

80
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,440
If you wish for him to score well,

81
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:30,320
you should wish him the best.

82
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,720
In order to do so,

83
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,480
your spirits must remain high.

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,359

89
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,799

you need.

find you a female frog.

All right?

95
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,480
Please keep him blessed.

96

I'm begging you.

97
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,119
I'll provide everything you need.

98

I'm begging you.

99

I'm pleading Mr. Frog

102
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
to bless Ziyan with success.

103

After this,

104
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320

some respectable ladies to you.

at the examination hall.

110
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,239
With the cloak you gave,

111
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:30,920
he will be fine.

112
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,039
Don't worry.

113
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,520

did you come to see me off?

139

Here's a toast to you.

140
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Have a good journey.

141
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,400
I knew what the capital is planning.

142
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,840
However, I'm afraid I'll have
to disappoint you once more.

143
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,280
I'm not going to marry you.

148
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,200
How would you know
you're not the right one?

149
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,719
Because you're Shen Zhaowen.

he'd be here by now.

Since they are doing well,

191
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm relieved.

192
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,919
The Mid-Autumn celebration
sure is merry this year.

193
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:57,000
We're in the company of many guests.

194
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,359
Xingzhou.

195
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,479
There's something
I'd like to say to you.

196
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,039
Honestly,

197
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,520
I've said this before.

198
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:21,840
You just didn't hear it back then.

199
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,640
I don't know

200
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,799
if you did.

201
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,479
However, do you remember

202
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,280
on the night of Qixi Festival
on the bridge?

203
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,640
We were admiring the lanterns
by the river together.

204
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,000
We also watched the fireworks.

205
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,599
The moon that night

206
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,479
was just like the one tonight.

207
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,880
It was really bright.

208
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm saying all these

209
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,719
to tell you that

210
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,039
I've always had a crush on you.

211
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,640
Since the civil examination is over,

212
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,719
you're heading to the capital
to undertake the Spring Exam.

213
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,760
You're going to enter the palace
and meet the Emperor.

214
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,479
You have a bright future ahead.

215
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,000
After becoming the principal graduate,

216
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,799
you'd meet a better girl.

217
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,559
However, it's different for me.

218
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,039
I need to stay at Wujiang Prefecture

219
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,080
and play my role as a regular merchant.

220
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,679
Our futures are completely different.

221
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,000
Perhaps, we might never end up together.

222
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,239
However, I just want you to know that

223
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I like you.

224
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,500
(How I wish you could understand
my feelings for you.)

225
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,200
You know what?

226
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,919
You're great.

227
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,599
You truly are a good man.

228
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,960
You're the best man I've ever met.

229
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,280
However,

230
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,159
loving you is all I can do.

231
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:34,880
It's a blessing to have met you.

232
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,320
You're the best lady
I've ever met as well.

233
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,560
I'm not fortunate enough
to accept your feelings.

234
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,359
You're a great woman.

235
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,719
You'll definitely meet someone better.

236
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,239
Minggu,

237
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,079
haven't you noticed
Zhanzhi's feelings for you?

238
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,520
Zhanzhi is in love with you.

239
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:29,560
Are you aware of that?

240
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:37,680
The imperial edict has arrived.

241
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,959
Poor Xiaoman.

242
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,000
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

243
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,880
I wonder what's wrong.

244
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,560
Why hasn't His Highness return?

245
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,119
He should be here soon.

246
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,199
It's an important moment
yet he hasn't shown up.

247
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,959
I'm not waiting anymore.

248
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,520
Declare the edict.

249
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,959
By great grace,

250
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,599
by the accomplishments of the ancestors,

251
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,959
peace was sustained for 30 years,

252
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,640
The divine responsibility is to great,

253
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,079
exceeding one's capacity.

254
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,880
The boundless mercy of the ancestors

255
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,520
places importance in
succession of the will.

256
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,040
My nephew, Zhao Xiaoqian,

257
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,280
was taken into the palace as a prince.

258
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,560
Due to an ailment,
he was sent to southeast to recuperate.

259
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,560
Unexpectedly,

260
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,800
he was arrogant and imperious.

261
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Commoners were affected.
Great commotion was stirred.

262
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,520
Such dominance

263
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,359
is against the expectations
set before him.

264
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,040
He shall be demoted as Duke of Wuguo.

265
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,479
He shall remain as
the regional governor of Wujiang

266
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,640
and be relieved of political duties.

267
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,040
A declaration to
the public and the family.

268
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:15,239
What happened?

269
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:18,319
He's demoted as a duke.
He's grounded as well.

270
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,079
This is serious.

271
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,880
I have no idea.

272
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:23,520
He's demoted to a duke?

273
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,599
Grounded?

274
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,319
Do not blame me for failing to explain.

275
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,119
The Commandery Prince submitted
an appeal and requested for this.

276
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,280
Zhao Xiaoqian.

277
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,880
Zhao Xiaoqian.

278
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:38,880
Where are you?

279
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,599
Zhao Xiaoqian.

280
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,760
Zhao Xiaoqian.

281
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,439
Zhao Xiaoqian.

282
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,040
Zhao Xiaoqian.

283
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,599
Did you know?

284
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,640
Once this appeal reaches the palace,

285
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,520
you will be demoted to a duke,

286
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,239
and His Majesty will ground you
within Wujiang Prefecture,

287
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,719
there's nothing you can do.

288
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,640
I know.

289
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,359
Why are you doing this then?

290
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
(Zhao Xiaoqian)

291
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,880
Master, you knew all along.

292
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,079
Although I'm the Commandery Prince,

293
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,800
I'm just an abandoned child.

294
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,599
I'm sure you realize

295
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,839
there are a few people that

296
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,119
I care about in this world.

297
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,040
Xingzhou is one of them.

298
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,000
Not to mention, Xiaoman.

299
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,359
What about your ambition?

300
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,640
You wanted to head to the borders!

301
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,800
If I have to leave for
the borders on my own,

302
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,079
and abandon Xingzhou

303
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,319
and Xiaoman,

304
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:24,760
I'm afraid I can't do so.

305
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,640
The politics of the capital

306
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,959
intend to manipulate me once again.

307
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,319
It doesn't help even
if I go to the borders.

308
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,079
I'm just a pawn.

309
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,000
If I don't do this now,

310
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
I can never do it.

311
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:45,000
I beg for your understanding

312
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,239
and submit this appeal to the Emperor.

313
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:53,199
I'm willing to be demoted as a duke

314
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,119
and remain in
Wujiang Prefecture forever.

315
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,800
Let me take you somewhere.

316
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:29,760
Zhao Xiaoqian.

317
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,479
What's going on?

318
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,199
I, Hanchen of Zhao Family,

319
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:36,119
bear the royal blood of Zhao Clan,

320
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,119
the son of Prince Pu, the Regional
Military Governor of Wuchang Region.

321
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,640
I've been granted many titles.

322
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,800
The Regional Military Governor,

323
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,280
the Regional Commander of E'zhou,

324
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,520
Minister of Guanglu,

325
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:50,640
Provincial Governor under
the Supreme Government,

326
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,479
and was even once
Commandery Prince of Julu.

327
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:55,839
Right now,

328
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,760
I'm just the Duke of Wuguo.

329
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,880
Hanchen of Zhao Family

330
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,479
is in love with female scholar of
Wujiang Prefecture, Xie Xiaoman.

331
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:10,119
I would like to take you as my wife.

332
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,040
I'll love you and you only.

333
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,760
For the rest of my life,

334
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,520
I will never leave you.

335
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,239
Here I ask.

336
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,520
Will you marry me?

337
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:24,599
Love each other

338
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:26,959
till death does us apart.

339
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:34,959
I will.

340
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,199
I will!

341
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:47,199
Thank you, Lady Xie.

342
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:14,040
Have a safe journey, Lady Shen.

343
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,040
General, thank you for the escorts.

344
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,079
As for the war at Baichuankou,

345
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,439
I await news of your victory.

346
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,520
General Xu has never lost a battle.

347
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,000
Besides, I shall join him.

348
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,400
You don't have to worry.

349
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,680
I'm worried

350
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,319
exactly because of you.

351
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:43,880
You've been arguing since young.

352
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:45,760
Are you done?

353
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,760
May you return in triumph.

354
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:53,760
Thank you.

355
00:24:58,479 --> 00:24:59,800
Lady Shen is returning to the capital.

356
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:02,040
I've arranged for soldiers
to escort her journey.

357
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,239
Master, thank you.

358
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:07,920
Let's depart.

359
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,400
In the appeal submitted to His Majesty,

360
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,439
I mentioned your predicament as well.

361
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:43,239
Don't worry.

362
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,920
His Majesty has agreed

363
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,239
not to force you into the palace.

364
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,640
You may return to the capital with ease

365
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,359
and reunite with your family.

366
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:54,040
In order to cast me out,

367
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,760
you requested to
be demoted as a duke,

368
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,319
do you really hate me that much?

369
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,239
I didn't do this for you.

370
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:04,680
I know.

371
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,520
It was for the sake of Xiaoman.

372
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,359
Do you really think

373
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:21,040
the capital would
let you go just like that?

374
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,140
(Capital)

375
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,359
If that's the case,

376
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,199
head to Wujiang Prefecture.

377
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,400
Whether he marries

378
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,800
Lingniang or not,

379
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,839
you must bring him back.

380
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,760
I understand.

381
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,780
(Residence of the Su Family)

382
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,359
Zhao Xiaoqian said

383
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,520
he was dropping by.

384
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,880
Why isn't he here yet?

385
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,119
He went to see General Xu off.

386
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,839
He should be here soon.

387
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,000
General Xu is leaving?

388
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,680
If that's the case,

389
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,400
General Xu left and

390
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,560
Shen Zhaowen left as well.

391
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,839
Those who do not belong here have left.

392
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,199
When will you get married?

393
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,400
Around spring next year.

394
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,520
Duke of Wuguo

395
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,239
is irresponsible.

396
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,920
Bed, mattress, blanket,

397
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,920
veil and curtain

398
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,400
are all ordered by me.

399
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:47,920
You're about to

400
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,880
become the Duchess of Wuguo.

401
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,800
You shouldn't be occupied
with trivial matters like these.

402
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,839
If it were me, I would do this.

403
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,000
Watch me.

404
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,040
Liangji.

405
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:00,880
Come here.

406
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,439
Serve me some tea.

407
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,199
Teacher Liu told me that

408
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,040
you're planning to pursue
your studies with her.

409
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,079
You're going to help
prepare the syllabus as well.

410
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:13,280
Is that true?

411
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,280
Minggu,

412
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,920
have you ever imagined

413
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,439
what kind of person you'd be

414
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,400
in the future?

415
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,680
I'm going to be a merchant
and make money.

416
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,160
What about you?

417
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,479
I want to be a teacher in the future,

418
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,280
just like Teacher Liu.

419
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:32,400
However...

420
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,680
What's it?

421
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,599
I'm worried that
Zhao Xiaoqian would disagree.

422
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,719
Duke of Wuguo has arrived.

423
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,560
There he is.

424
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,119
You're late.

425
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:51,560
Miss me?

426
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,599
You're not properly covered.
Aren't you cold?

427
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,239
No,

428
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,359
as long as I look good.

429
00:28:58,959 --> 00:28:59,880
You're the prettiest.

430
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,239
Wick.

431
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,400
Help me back.

432
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,359
It's suffocating here.

433
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,239
How annoying.

434
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,040
I need to discuss something with you.

435
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,239
We're husband and wife.

436
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,479
What's there to discuss?

437
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,599
After getting married,

438
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:19,640
logically speaking,

439
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,239
I don't need to study in
the academy anymore.

440
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,239
However, I talked to Teacher Liu.

441
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,119
She's willing to take me in
as her disciple.

442
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,959
Isn't it great?

443
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:27,959
In the future,

444
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,520
I would like to become a teacher, too.

445
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:31,560
No.

446
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,880
There's no room for discussion.

447
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:33,920
Why not?

448
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,199
In the future,

449
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:39,400
if you become a teacher,

450
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,479
you'd spend all your time
at the academy.

451
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,920
You'll not have time for
the household affairs.

452
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,640
After having children,

453
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,680
you'll not have time for them either.

454
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,599
Not to mention

455
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:48,800
the academy is filled with men.

456
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,199
We're getting married.

457
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,839
Why are you being so petty?

458
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:53,920
Teacher Liu is extremely talented.

459
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,680
Besides, it's going to take years

460
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,280
for me to become a teacher.

461
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,439
Well, I do not agree.

462
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,119
I'm telling you.

463
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:00,280
I'm of the Zhao Family.

464
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,359
If you do not

465
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,439
raise our children well,

466
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,760
the future of the clan will be at stake.

467
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,040
You...

468
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:07,959
You...

469
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,439
You're so unreasonable.

470
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:10,719
Yes, that's who I am.

471
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,520
What can you do about it?

472
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,959
I insist on going.

473
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,119
No way.

474
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,599
You cannot convince me otherwise.

475
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,740
(Residence of the Su Family)

476
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:20,439
Grandmother.

477
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,199
Take it easy.

478
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:25,040
I'm fine.

479
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,760
Have some water.

480
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,439
Take it easy.

481
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,640
I'm getting old.

482
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:35,959
My health is deteriorating.

483
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,359
Don't say that, grandmother.

484
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,199
The weather is cold.

485
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:40,520
That's why you're coughing.

486
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,880
Everything will be fine
once spring comes.

487
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,160
Xiaoman.

488
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,920
You surely know how to cheer me up.

489
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:54,199
I've been working all my life.

490
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,680
I spent the first half of
my life as the shopkeeper.

491
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,479
My brain is exhausted
from managing the accounts.

492
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,439
Things are rather muddled.

493
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,520
I should leave when it's time.

494
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,239
It's exhausting.

495
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:10,000
Grandmother.

496
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,319
Once I'm gone,

497
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,359
I'm leaving Su Chang Ji

498
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:19,920
to your aunt and Minggu.

499
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,280
Xiaoman.

500
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:25,079
Why is Minggu

501
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,160
still so immature?

502
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,680
I'm not sure if

503
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:34,000
she will be able to manage Su Chang Ji.

504
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,560
Mother.

505
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,800
Xiaoman.

506
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
You should check it out.

507
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,640
Your father is chasing Li'er
all over the courtyard.

508
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,719
I'm not sure what happened.

509
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,359
Grandmother,

510
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:46,280
I shall check it out.

511
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,880
Hurry on.

512
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,520
Stand right there!

513
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,319
- No!
- Uncle.

514
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,520
I'm about to get a beating!

515
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:57,680
Stand right there!

516
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,280
You said you're not hitting me here
at Residence of the Su Family!

517
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,719
I'm not going to hit you?

518
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:00,479
You're lying!

519
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,079
I can't let this slide!

520
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,439
You're not taking
your study seriously!

521
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,680
All you do

522
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,359
is pester your brother-in-law
for new toys!

523
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,040
You rascal!

524
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,719
You might injure him!

525
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,520
Father,

526
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,040
Li'er is still young. Go easy on him.

527
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,560
I'm going easy on him!

528
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,359
Father.

529
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,000
I'm warning you!

530
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,599
Father.

531
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,920
Let's just talk things out.

532
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,880
Why do you hit him?

533
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,400
What?

534
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,000
Go ahead and ask him.

535
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,280
What's the matter?

536
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,479
I didn't do well in my exam.

537
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,160
How bad is it?

538
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,839
Third grade.

539
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:28,839
Third grade?

540
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,280
Look at him.

541
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,880
You shouldn't evade father
over such horrible results!

542
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,640
Get back here!

543
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,959
You should deliver the medication
to grandmother.

544
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:33,560
Get back here!

545
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:34,839
Get back here!

546
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:35,920
Xiaoman.

547
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,160
Hurry up and deliver the medication.

548
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,079
I'll check on him.

549
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:40,119
Third grade?

550
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:41,880
How's that possible?

551
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,400
He said

552
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,520
he was doing fine back then.

553
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,239
He understood what was being taught.

554
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
He was lying.

555
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,479
He's full of nonsense.

556
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,160
He doesn't pay attention in class.

557
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,959
All he does is play around all day.

558
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,640
He's not allowed outside anymore.

559
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,199
He needs to return home
after school immediately.

560
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:58,560
Otherwise,

561
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,040
let's employ a tutor

562
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,119
to teach him.

563
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,479
My daughter,

564
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,040
you're right.

565
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,400
I'll think about it.

566
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,839
He's still young.

567
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,239
We can't leave him like this.

568
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,119
You're right.

569
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:09,640
Come on.

570
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:14,760
Why are you laughing?

571
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,280
Stop laughing at one's misfortune.

572
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,400
Do not buy him anything from now on.

573
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,560
Li'er.

574
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,760
Don't be upset.

575
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,199
Let me tell you.

576
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,000
My mother hit me all the time
when I was young

577
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,640
with a wooden stick.

578
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:38,359
But...

579
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,280
But I'm stupid.

580
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,920
I'm unlike brother.

581
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,400
Who called you stupid?

582
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,119
You're still young.

583
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,640
Your brain isn't
completely developed yet.

584
00:33:49,439 --> 00:33:50,560
I'll figure something out for you.

585
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,439
How about this?

586
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,400
If you encounter something that
you don't know,

587
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,280
memorize it.

588
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,000
When you're questioned,

589
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,119
just answer as you memorized.

590
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:02,680
Trust me.

591
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,560
They'd be impressed

592
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,560
by how brilliant you are.

593
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,439
Try it out.

594
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,800
If I memorize all,

595
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,479
they'd find me brilliant?

596
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,280
Of course.

597
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,399
Fenniang would...

598
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,399
Fenniang?

599
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,399
Who is that?

600
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,919
Who is Fenniang?

601
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,800
Sister Minggu, do you have a crush?

602
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,120
Don't be ridiculous.

603
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:26,360
You...

604
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,879
You're still young.

605
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:28,959
Don't be ridiculous.

606
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,399
I'm not married.

607
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,320
Li'er,

608
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,840
do you have a crush on someone?

609
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:44,399
That's a good thing.

610
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,919
You're still young.

611
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:46,959
If you like her,

612
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,399
you must express your feelings.

613
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
Don't end up like me.

614
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,199
After so long,

615
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,520
I thought I had everything.

616
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,959
In the end, I lost everything.

617
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,679
Express my feelings?

618
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,520
Yes, make it clear.

619
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,340
(Yan's Mansion)

620
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:15,520
Boyang,

621
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,639
you're not young anymore.

622
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,439
You're still frisky.

623
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,000
Recently,

624
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,840
I introduced some
respectable ladies to you.

625
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,280
Are you not interested at all?

626
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,800
No.

627
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,040
You rejected every single one of them

628
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,040
without any explanation.

629
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,399
What's not good about them?

630
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:34,959
Mother,

631
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,399
I can't help it.

632
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,479
Who are you interested in then?

633
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,679
List down your requirements then.

634
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,320
The ladies I found

635
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,840
are the daughters of

636
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,360
reputable households
in Wujiang Prefecture.

637
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
If you reject them all,

638
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:51,879
that will upset them.

639
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,040
Besides, your father is an official.

640
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,360
You're putting him in
a difficult position.

641
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:57,520
Mother.

642
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,639
A tortoise and a mung bean

643
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,439
can't possibly fall in love.

644
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,040
What are you talking about?

645
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,159
Anyway, the next lady I will introduce

646
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:09,520
is the daughter of Prefect Xue,
Xue Yanwan.

647
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,239
I do not care about the tortoises.

648
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:12,320
You shall attend this blind date.

649
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,679
Wait.

650
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,280
You even got Xue Yanwan involved?

651
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,639
I'm not going.

652
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,800
Are you sure?

653
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:19,479
Fine.

654
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,280
Forget about the academy as well.

655
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,719
Do not step out of Yan's Mansion.

656
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,679
It's my fault

657
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,280
for giving birth to a brat like you.

658
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:28,239
Mother.

659
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,520
Don't be upset.

660
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,520
If this blind date doesn't work,

661
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,639
it's no longer up to you anymore.

662
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,439
Marriages are decided by one's

663
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:37,360
parents anyway.

664
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:38,919
Take it seriously.

665
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,479
Seriously.

666
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,719
Wait.

667
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,660
(From Zhanzhi)

668
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,900
(To Minggu)

669
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:33,800
My brother wasn't
like this when he was young.

670
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,760
I scored good grades
when I was young, too.

671
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,959
We were raised under
the same circumstances.

672
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:40,840
How could Li'er

673
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,239
even fail to memorize The Analects?

674
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,159
Perhaps, the teachers did not

675
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,199
pay enough attention to him?

676
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,360
Why are you staring at me?

677
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,840
Don't you find it

678
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:53,959
difficult to be a teacher?

679
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:54,959
Look.

680
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,520
When students fail to
memorize The Analects,

681
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,159
the teachers have to take the blame.

682
00:37:58,439 --> 00:37:59,159
If I were his teacher,

683
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:00,760
I would be able to teach him well.

684
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:02,719
Is that so?

685
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,520
Yes.

686
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,399
Let's make a bet.

687
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,399
What's it?

688
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,040
Let's teach Li'er about The Analects.

689
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,479
If you succeed,

690
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,520
I'll reconsider

691
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,000
your decision to become a teacher.

692
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,239
Are you serious?

693
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,360
Yes.

694
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,320
Pick Li'er up from school tomorrow

695
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,520
and drop him off to Lotus Garden
for extra lessons.

696
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:28,919
Yes, Your Highness.

697
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,439
