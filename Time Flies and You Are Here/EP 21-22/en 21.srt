=Episode 21=

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,716
(Youth is short,
waste no time on entertainment)

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,639
As a delicate woman,
Princess Consort Ming

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,400
was forced to marry a foreign
man she has never met,

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,279
and forced to spend the rest
of her life with him.

24
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,959
After she passed away,
she can only be buried in the desert,

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,480
forbidden from returning
to her homeland.

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,279
To Princess Consort Ming,

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,400
isn't it a great sacrifice?

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,599
If what you uphold is true,

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,239
Princess Consort Ming was tired of

30
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,800
living her life as a caged bird,

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,440
so she volunteered to embark up north,

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,720
why were the songs of grievances

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,760
sung through the world?

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,839
From the palace to Xiongnu,

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,720
isn't that just moving from one cage

36
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,080
to another?

37
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,320
Lady Xie,

38
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,000
do you concur?

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,960
Spring is everlasting.

40
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,320
The willows never sleep.

41
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,679
The lonely moon lit up the skies while
the stars kept each other company.

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,960
In the future,

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,639
dreams are far from reach,

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,720
remaining in Yuyangli Village.

45
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,039
Literati of the past often
shaped Zhaojun

46
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,360
into the epitome of bitterness.

47
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,839
Baseless presumptions of her loneliness

48
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,919
and her regrets were formed.

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,919
Everyone presumes that once
she leaves her motherland

50
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,279
and marries off to
the land of the savage,

51
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:55,800
she'd only suffer,

52
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,000
and wallow in pain and grievances.

53
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,399
However, is it likely that

54
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,199
she led a life of happiness?

55
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,039
Do keep in mind, that men of the past

56
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:05,559
scorn upon ladies.

57
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,240
For this reason,
the country came up with excuses,

58
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,520
imagining

59
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,160
how Princess Consort Ming expressed
her sentiment for the country.

60
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,160
During the reign of Han,

61
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:14,399
she was nothing but a mere tool.

62
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,199
Nobody cared about her.

63
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,119
However, after marrying off to Xiongnu,

64
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,759
the sky was vast,

65
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,080
and the land was boundless.

66
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,160
Stars spread out to no end.

67
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,600
She was free of restrictions.

68
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,160
Imagine.

69
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,720
She would be much happier
than she was back in Han.

70
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,800
Am I right?

71
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,960
Bravo!

72
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,759
Bravo!

73
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,679
Xiaoman,

74
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,360
well done.

75
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,759
During the discussion,

76
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,000
both Lady Shen and Lady Xie
made compelling opinions.

77
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,720
Lady Shen's opinions were
true to the materials

78
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,520
while Lady Xie's were
critical and sharp.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,679
She provided a completely new,
unique and unconventional

80
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
point of view.

81
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,080
She expressed the suffering that
women of generations endured.

82
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,600
Therefore,

83
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,160
the best scorer of
this term's examination

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,200
is Lady Xie.

85
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,839
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

86
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,519
Xiaoman.

87
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,160
Since you've accepted the hairpin,

88
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,239
you're now a disciple of mine.

89
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,839
I need to let you know.

90
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,480
History is vast and rich.

91
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,200
To devote ourselves to compiling
the historical books

92
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,799
is like sailing off into the sea.

93
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,160
We will go wherever the boat takes us.

94
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,239
We're recording

95
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,440
true insights of the
respectable women of history.

96
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,839
At the same time, these materials

97
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:11,519
will exceed time and inspire
the ladies of the future.

98
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,119
I'll keep your teaching in mind.

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,480
(Shuntian Gate)

100
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,720
Xiaoman,

101
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,799
why didn't Minggu attend school today?

102
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,239
Zhao Xiaoqian

103
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:47,600
left all of a sudden.

104
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,279
What's going on with both of you?

105
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,359
Lady Xie!

106
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,279
What's the matter?

107
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,760
Bad news, Lady Xie.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,679
I went to visit Old Madam Su
back at Su Mansion.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,880
Lady Su

110
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,679
stole the money
for Madam Su's new store.

111
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,079
It's a total of 500 strings
of 1,000 cash.

112
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,720
Madam Su is panicked right now.

113
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,359
What?

114
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,200
Minggu took 500 strings of 1,000 cash?

115
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,320
Yes.

116
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,799
This was found in her room.

117
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,040
Let me take a look.

118
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,420
(Zhong Ziyan's personal profile )

119
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:18,440
What does it say?

120
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,440
We need to find Minggu.

121
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,140
(Principal Yang)

122
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,679
I received a letter from an old friend
in the capital yesterday.

123
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,839
The letter mentioned that
your father, Li Guangwen,

124
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,679
was alleged of involving in a major
corruption of the imperial court.

125
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,920
He's being investigated.

126
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,000
He's temporarily grounded
in his own residence.

127
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,720
Nothing is concluded yet.

128
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,239
It's Grand Secretariat Qin.

129
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,399
Political strife leads to one's demise.

130
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,760
Your father sided with Chancellor Xu.

131
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:03,440
Due to the corruption within the court,

132
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,440
both parties, Xu and Qin
were in constant strife.

133
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,239
Your father was implicated.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,760
Actually,

135
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,239
the donation sustaining
the academy over the years

136
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,760
came from your father.

137
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,720
We exchanged letters several times.

138
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,200
He always asked about you
at the end of the letters.

139
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,320
I know

140
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:30,519
disparity exists between
you and your father.

141
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,440
However, blood is thicker than water.

142
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,600
The capital is
transitioning to winter now.

143
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,640
You should head home and
pay your father a visit.

144
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
I understand.

145
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:58,959
Minggu.

146
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,559
- Minggu.
- Minggu.

147
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,239
Minggu.

148
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,799
Where is she?

149
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,279
Minggu.

150
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,880
- Master Yan.
- Minggu.

151
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,279
I found her.

152
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:14,920
According to the guards,

153
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,119
she was seen at the brothel

154
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,440
with Xu Shu.

155
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,119
Xu Shu?

156
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:20,920
Hurry up.

157
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,000
Master Yan.

158
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,479
I brought the cash.

159
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,719
Will you come with me

160
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,840
to clarify the situation now?

161
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,320
Go with you?

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,840
If I do,

163
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,400
I will be insane.

164
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,000
If I go with you,

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,679
my father is going to
reprimand me again.

166
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,719
Am I going to testify for Zhong Ziyan

167
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,919
and end up imprisoned?

168
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:05,679
No way.

169
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,080
You have to clarify the situation.

170
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:07,960
Hurry up.

171
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,640
Come with me.

172
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,479
I'm begging you.

173
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,039
I'm begging you.

174
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,679
Zhong Ziyan

175
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,919
devoted his life to the examination.

176
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:16,799
He is innocent.

177
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,760
He had no idea.

178
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,039
He had no idea.

179
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,080
Please help him out.

180
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,760
I'm begging you.

181
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,320
Please...

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,520
Minggu.

183
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,239
You...

184
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:25,760
Minggu.

185
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,640
Yan Boyang.

186
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,799
Let me go.

187
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,799
What are you doing, Yan Boyang?

188
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,119
No one forces her to do this.

189
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,599
It has nothing to do with you.

190
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,039
Su Minggu,

191
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,559
do you know what you're doing?

192
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,440
Do you think this would help Xingzhou?

193
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,440
Come with me.

194
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,679
What can I do?

195
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,320
Tell me. What else can I do?

196
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,799
I can't stand by and do nothing.

197
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,799
He should impress
everyone with excellent results.

198
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,239
He should serve in the
capital as a great official.

199
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,280
He should be given the principal
graduate's residence at Wujiang.

200
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,440
He had no idea.

201
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,599
He was wronged.

202
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,960
I have to help him.

203
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,200
Minggu.

204
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,359
I'm begging you.

205
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,960
Ziyan had no idea what's going on.

206
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,320
Su Minggu,

207
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,679
do you know what you're doing?

208
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:20,719
My father is Yan Nengfu.

209
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,760
Xingzhou's matter can be
easily resolved.

210
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,200
Why are you kneeling down before him?

211
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,799
Xu Shu,

212
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,400
you're threatening the heir
of Su Family.

213
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,119
Aren't you afraid of the laws?

214
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,960
You have a father.

215
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,559
You have a father, too!

216
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,200
You just want me dead!

217
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,840
You just want me imprisoned, right?

218
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,719
Fine.

219
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,599
We're all going to die together.

220
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:55,799
Minggu!

221
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,039
- Yan Boyang.
- Boyang.

222
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,400
Boyang.

223
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,599
Boyang.

224
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Boyang, are you all right?

225
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,960
Boyang.

226
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,280
Am I a fool?

227
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:17,280
Boyang.

228
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,679
Boyang.

229
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,799
Boyang.

230
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:26,039
Do not move.

231
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,359
Boyang, wake up.

232
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:28,599
Seize them.

233
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:29,320
- Yes.
- Boyang.

234
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,960
- Move it.
- Move it.

235
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,520
Boyang.

236
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,520
Boyang.

237
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,799
Are you sure about this?

238
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,599
The battlefield is not a game.

239
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:57,960
Yes.

240
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,479
I don't plan to return.

241
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,400
All I've ever wanted

242
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,039
is to become a warrior.

243
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,479
For any battles to come,

244
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,119
I'm at your disposal.

245
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:09,599
All right.

246
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,919
Here.

247
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,200
Your Highness.

248
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,320
Your Highness.

249
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,359
General Xu.

250
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,520
What's the matter?

251
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,119
Master Yan's attendant sent news

252
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,640
that Mr. Zhong cheated
in the examination.

253
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,200
He's banned from
the examination permanently.

254
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,220
(Bailu Academy)

255
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,460
(Lonely Boat At Night, volume four)

256
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,919
Trash!

257
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm trash.

258
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,919
If it wasn't true,

259
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,799
I wouldn't have been cast out

260
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,000
from the examination hall.

261
00:13:58,719 --> 00:13:59,640
A true man,

262
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,119
even at the brink of death,

263
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,200
would not

264
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,479
grovel on the ground like you!

265
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,599
What can I do?

266
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,359
For this matter,

267
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,960
I can't possibly drag you into this

268
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,880
and do you harm.

269
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,159
What about you then?

270
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,719
Zhao Xiaoqian,

271
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,039
what can you do?

272
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,880
It's the civil examination,

273
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,840
not a kid's game.

274
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,559
This is my business.

275
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,760
Stay out of this.

276
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,110
(Studio of Artlessness)

277
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,200
How is Xingzhou?

278
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,640
You've caused enough trouble.

279
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,320
What's the progress of the exam?

280
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,000
Is there really nothing we can do?

281
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:24,119
It's fine.

282
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,640
I'll talk to Shen Yan.

283
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,479
His uncle is part of
the Division of Personnel.

284
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,640
There must be a way.

285
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,719
You are not on good terms with him.

286
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:31,840
Would he lend us a hand?

287
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,280
We'd never know if we never try.

288
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,159
Liangji,

289
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,039
convey my words to Shen Yan.

290
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,479
I would like to meet him.

291
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
I'll meet him at the prison.

292
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,359
All right.

293
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,640
It's going to be fine.

294
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,640
Don't worry.

295
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:50,960
I'm concerned

296
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,000
about Yan Boyang's injury.

297
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,280
(Yan's Mansion)
Well,

298
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,479
Lady Su.

299
00:15:59,119 --> 00:15:59,960
Master Yan

300
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,640
is not in.

301
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,760
I just want to check on him.

302
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,640
I'm worried about his condition.

303
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:06,599
Please allow me to visit him.

304
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,479
Lady Su,

305
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,280
Master Yan isn't home.

306
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,080
It's true.

307
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,200
He went

308
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,880
to the infirmary out of town.

309
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,159
At night...

310
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:17,760
He will return tomorrow.

311
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,320
I suggest

312
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,479
you should go home.

313
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,039
All right.

314
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:25,840
I understand.

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,919
Tell him

316
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,320
to take care.

317
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,559
Do not worry about Mr. Zhong.

318
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:33,799
We...

319
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,599
We will figure something out.

320
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,559
Also...

321
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,359
Remember to tell him

322
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm sorry.

323
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:06,055
(Yan's Mansion)

324
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,640
This time,

325
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,199
my friend has caused you trouble.

326
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,199
What's your plan?

327
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,319
Get Liangzhe Circuit to
issue an official document.

328
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,000
With the document,

329
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,400
we will be able to acquire the reserved
topic from the examination hall

330
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,800
and allow Xingzhou to retake the exam

331
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,880
alone.

332
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,599
I know Lord Feng of
the Division of Personnel

333
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,560
is your uncle.

334
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,760
If you're willing to write a request

335
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,920
for the appeal,

336
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,760
I believe Lord Feng

337
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,199
will consider this.

338
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,079
Retake the exam?

339
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,280
Easy for you to say.

340
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:54,640
Zhao Xiaoqian!

341
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,880
You're aware of

342
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,000
what Xu Shu did!

343
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,040
I have respect for you so

344
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,000
I did not lay a finger on him.

345
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:03,359
He schemed

346
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,760
and harmed Xingzhou.

347
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,680
A man like this

348
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,079
should be eliminated.

349
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,239
Do you think the capital

350
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,760
would be oblivious about Zhong Ziyan?

351
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,839
Let me be honest with you.

352
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,880
Your mother knew that
you'd ask for my help,

353
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,640
so she informed me beforehand.

354
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,319
If you insist on joining the military

355
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,880
and refuse to marry Lingniang,

356
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,920
Zhong Ziyan will not be able to

357
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,599
participate in
the examination ever again.

358
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,760
What do you mean?

359
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,400
The incident of Zhong Ziyan

360
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,319
was made known to the capital.

361
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:37,560
The capital has replied.

362
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,959
In the whole of Wujiang Prefecture,

363
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,400
whoever that lends a hand to you

364
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,680
is opposing Prince Pu.

365
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,439
Zhao Xiaoqian,

366
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:50,040
you're really naive.

367
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,119
Do you think, with your abilities

368
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,640
and the influence of General Xu,

369
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,079
you'd be able to go against

370
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,560
the imperial power of Prince Pu
and the capital?

371
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,160
You intend to go to war.

372
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,760
His Majesty agreed.

373
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,400
What about the Empress?

374
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,239
Will Her Highness allow you
to attain merits

375
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,959
and threaten the Crown Prince?

376
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,520
How absurd!

377
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:18,719
How absurd.

378
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,800
Hanchen,

379
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm heading to the battlefield soon.

380
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,400
I'll be disembarking to Baichuankou

381
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,160
with General Xu Zi in a few days.

382
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:30,839
I know.

383
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,719
Fighting in the war

384
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,160
has always been your dream.

385
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,239
Shen Yan.

386
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,359
Do you know what's the root
of all my troubles?

387
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,640
The identity as the Emperor's

388
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,640
adopted son, the title of
Commandery Prince of Julu!

389
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,800
I will spare Xu Shu,

390
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,599
but that doesn't mean
I'm letting this slide.

391
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,359
After this,

392
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,239
send him to guard the city gates
at Shanhai Pass.

393
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,479
Master Shen.

394
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,640
Do you know how much
trouble you've caused?

395
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,640
Master Shen.

396
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,880
I let you down.

397
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Let me down?

398
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,479
What do you mean?

399
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,000
Do you know how much

400
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,040
clamour you've evoked

401
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,880
in the capital?

402
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,160
Zhao Xiaoqian would spare your life

403
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,839
if you leave Wujiang Prefecture

404
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,160
and guard the city
gates at Shanhai Pass.

405
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,800
Are you willing to go?

406
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,800
My father

407
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,800
removed my name
from the genealogical records.

408
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,359
I'm no longer Xu Shu.

409
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
I have no rights

410
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,479
to refuse His Highness' order.

411
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:33,880
Don't worry.

412
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,839
At Shanhai Pass,

413
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,800
I'll set everything for you.

414
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,599
Here in Wujiang Prefecture,

415
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,160
I'll take care of your mother

416
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,079
and sister.

417
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,560
Master Shen.

418
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,580
(Studio of Artlessness)

419
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,160
I have a favour to ask.

420
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,640
Go ahead.

421
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,160
Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching.

422
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:59,119
Our family is planning for
a reunion dinner.

423
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,599
They are unaware...

424
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,880
of our relationship.

425
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,800
On the night of the festival,

426
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,719
I hope you'd be able to attend.

427
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,560
Invite the elders over to
the Commandery Prince's Mansion instead.

428
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,119
During the past celebrations,

429
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,000
we have a lot of leftover supplies.

430
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
There are fireworks left, too.

431
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,880
Invite your family over.

432
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,719
I'll get the cooks to
prepare a good meal

433
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,719
for everyone.

434
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:34,959
What...

435
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,079
What about Xingzhou's matter?

436
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,760
There is still no hope.

437
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,620
(Studio of Artlessness)

438
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,239
Let me tell you a ghost story.

439
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,280
Let's go.

440
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,119
Once upon a time,

441
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:30,160
in Tengzhou,
there was a man named Liu Yixian.

442
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,319
He was great at drawing portraits.

443
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,959
His neighbour

444
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,680
was a father and son duo.

445
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,719
The father passed away all of a sudden.

446
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,439
The son went to
purchase the coffin

447
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,800
and requested Liu Yixian for a portrait.

448
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,599
Liu Yixian went over.

449
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
He realized the gate was unlatched.

450
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,439
He opened the door and entered.

451
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,959
There was no one in the house.

452
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,920
He figured,

453
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,000
the body must be upstairs.

454
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,439
He followed the stairs

455
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,680
and went up to the second floor.

456
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,800
He sat by the corpse
and started painting.

457
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,359
Suddenly...

458
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,160
What happened?

459
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,560
Suddenly, the corpse

460
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,119
sat upward!

461
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,000
Liu Yixian thought to himself.

462
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,040
Such bad luck.

463
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,479
He encountered a living corpse.

464
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,760
However, he dare not move.

465
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,560
The corpse did not move either.

466
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:23,959
It just stared at him.

467
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,560
After a while,

468
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,760
the neighbour returned.

469
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,560
The neighbour witnessed the scene

470
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,599
and fainted right on the spot.

471
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,439
Then,

472
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:37,479
the coffin carriers came by.

473
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,160
They fainted on the spot as well.

474
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,079
No.

475
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,920
Liu Yixian suddenly recalled that

476
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,680
living corpses feared brooms.

477
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,920
He shouted to the people.

478
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,040
"Bring me a broom!"

479
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,719
The carriers understood immediately.

480
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:54,400
They found a broom

481
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,439
and waved it in front of the corpse.

482
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,520
The corpse fell down.

483
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,800
Afterward,

484
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:02,160
they woke the son up
with some ginger tea

485
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,199
and moved the old man's corpse

486
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,040
into the coffin.

487
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,680
Is that it?

488
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:12,719
Yes.

489
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,160
What kind of a ghost story is that?

490
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,400
Quit complaining.

491
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,599
Back when I was young,

492
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:24,040
the story frightened me
so much that I couldn't fall asleep.

493
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,640
Silly girl.

494
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,800
I'm going back now.

495
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,400
I'll come by again tomorrow.

496
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,359
Xiaoman.

497
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:51,880
If...

498
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm just asking.

499
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,280
If your friend needs your help,

500
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,439
but it comes with a great price,

501
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,160
would you help your friend out?

502
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,400
I don't know.

503
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,719
I really don't know.

504
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,880
Can I sleep here with you tonight?

505
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,319
I'll take the ground
while you take the bed.

506
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,400
Why are you leaving me?

507
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,839
What's the true reason?

508
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:48,880
It's because

509
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,599
you're going to marry a wife.

510
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,040
Even if it isn't Lady Shen,

511
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,079
it'd be someone else.

512
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,239
I don't want to be stuck
in the back court

513
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,040
and share my husband
with someone else.

514
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,000
I don't want to part with you.

515
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:25,680
Come up here.

516
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,400
Come up here.

517
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,719
Zhao Xiaoqian.

518
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,719
You're the best man

519
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,839
I've ever met.

520
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,000
Thus, I hope all things
will go well for you.

521
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,680
I hope that you'd become

522
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,359
a well-respected general
in the days to come.

523
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,239
I hope you'd attain success

524
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,079
through your hard work.

525
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,479
By your grace,

526
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,599
please help

527
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,680
Zhong Ziyan overcome this hurdle.

528
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,400
Help him. Help him.

529
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,540
(Lotus Garden)

530
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:17,479
Pervert!

531
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:22,839
This is natural.

532
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,839
Where did you learn this?

533
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:29,599
Who taught you that?

534
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,439
I...

535
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,640
Lady Xie!

536
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,599
Lady Xie, you slept with His Highness?

537
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,760
What's the matter?

538
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,239
Lady Su came by just now.

539
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,079
She said...

540
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,400
She said...

541
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,119
What?

542
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,439
Xingzhou is gone?

543
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,880
(Lotus Garden)
What do we do now?

544
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:55,119
Inform His Highness about this.

545
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:56,479
What happened?

546
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Mr. Zhong is gone.

547
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,119
It's daybreak.

548
00:31:59,119 --> 00:31:59,880
We checked the entire mansion.

549
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Nobody knows where he went.

550
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,439
I told Shi Deng'er to ask around.

551
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,599
The captain of the city guards

552
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,400
said he left the city alone last night.

553
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,439
He is not sure where he went.

554
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,959
Your Highness.

555
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:11,680
Your Highness.

556
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:45,800
Sir.

557
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,800
Here's your noodle.

558
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:47,839
Enjoy while it's hot.

559
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:48,959
Your chopsticks.

560
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,479
You're welcome.

561
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,000
Ziyan.

562
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'll leave the noodle here.

563
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,560
All right.

564
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,599
What would you like to have?

565
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,160
A bowl of noodles
with bamboo shoot and pork

566
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:11,239
and a pot of hot tea.

567
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,439
All right.

568
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,800
A bowl of noodles
with bamboo shoot and pork.

569
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,839
Please hold on.

570
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,520
It'll be served soon.

571
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,239
What's the matter?

572
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,199
Hurry up and serve the noodle.

573
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,000
(Noodle stall)
Why are you here?

574
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,400
Xingzhou wanted to visit home.

575
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,359
It's been a long time
since I paid you a visit,

576
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,800
so I dropped by to check on

577
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,599
you and Yun.

578
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,959
Hurry up and greet His Highness.

579
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:47,319
How impolite.

580
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,400
My brother is the principal graduate.

581
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,319
He's going to become
a great official in the future.

582
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,839
I'm not going to greet you.

583
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,079
Little brat.

584
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,359
You can't

585
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,520
say that in public.

586
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:58,760
You're right, Yun.

587
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,800
When your brother emerges
as the principal graduate,

588
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,160
you shall be the sister of a nobleman.

589
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:02,880
By then,

590
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,280
let's see if you'd still
play with rocks.

591
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,000
Pardon the child.

592
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,719
Go and have fun.

593
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:12,679
I'm going to wash the dishes.

594
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,879
Things are

595
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:17,919
great here.

596
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,679
I'm just concerned.

597
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,719
He's out there alone.

598
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,919
There's nothing much I can do.

599
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,360
As his mother,

600
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,399
I'm greatly concerned about him.

601
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,399
Fortunately,

602
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,120
Ziyan has been under your cover
since he was young.

603
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,919
Otherwise,

604
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,000
he'd end up

605
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,879
at somewhere else.

606
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,679
Xingzhou is outstanding.

607
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,080
He'd do well no matter where he goes.

608
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,159
It's good that

609
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,040
the civil examination this year
is finally over.

610
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,120
Xingzhou said he did fine.

611
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,199
Mother.

612
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,639
What if I

613
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,320
quit taking the examination?

614
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,320
Don't be ridiculous.

615
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,719
My son is brilliant and sensible.

616
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,000
In the future,

617
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
he's going to soar in success.

618
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,320
Don't worry about the family.

619
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,520
I'm here.

620
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,199
Who said you're not going
to take the examination?

621
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,719
You're going to emerge
as the best scorer.

622
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:15,639
When you do,

623
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,959
tell them you came from
the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

624
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:18,959
That's right.

625
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,399
Your Highness,

626
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,639
I will

627
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,479
leave my son to your care.

628
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:24,639
Do guide him.

629
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:27,520
Xingzhou!

630
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,520
I'm going to check on him.

631
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
I'll take you somewhere tonight.

632
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,280
We'll enjoy some fruits.

633
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,560
What do you think?

634
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,020
(Tangjiao Village)

635
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:10,879
Here.

636
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:15,719
What's this?

637
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't know.

638
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,719
I ate this fruit with Hanchen
the last time we came.

639
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,919
We even saw Kun.

640
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,840
However, in your heart,

641
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,000
you must yearn to see Kun.

642
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,919
I want to see Kun.

643
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,959
I want to see Kun.

644
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:31,479
Xingzhou,

645
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,679
have you ever wondered?

646
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:34,719
After participating in the examination,

647
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:36,840
how will

648
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,120
your life change?

649
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,159
Of course.

650
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,639
I think about it day

651
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:50,719
and night.

652
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,479
After entering the examination

653
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,639
passing the second round,

654
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:57,439
going through the final screening

655
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,479
and becoming His Majesty's protege,

656
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,639
I'll serve as a local officer
for three years.

657
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,600
Then, I'll return to the capital

658
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,040
and serve under the chancellery.

659
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,959
I'll attain the fourth rank
by the age of 30.

660
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,080
I'll attain the third rank
by the age of 40.

661
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,560
Then I'll enter the privy council.

662
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:16,080
I'll become the grand chancellor by 50.

663
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,719
I'll live up to my conscience.

664
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,959
Live up to the promise to the people

665
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,479
and live up to uphold peace
of the nation.

666
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:28,479
What do you think?

667
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,439
Isn't it dumb?

668
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,040
You've never told me about this.

669
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,239
It no longer matters.

670
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,600
I'm afraid they are all illusions.

671
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,320
Don't say that.

672
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,760
Zhao Xiaoqian said that

673
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,360
nothing is certain yet.

674
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:50,360
Don't give up.

675
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,239
Everyone used to tell me that

676
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:00,520
since my father was
the principal graduate,

677
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:03,919
I'd become one as well.

678
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:06,520
However, things

679
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,719
aren't that simple.

680
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,439
Countless of people,

681
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:11,959
over the ages,

682
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,560
worked hard for years

683
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,679
just for the title of
the principal graduate.

684
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,239
Countless of people

685
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,199
were trapped for life.

686
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,040
I wish my father

687
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,439
was never the principal graduate.

688
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,479
I heard

689
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:33,360
that you may make a wish
if you see a divine beast.

690
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,919
If we manage

691
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:35,959
to encounter Kun,

692
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,479
let's make a wish together.

693
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:39,479
All right.

694
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,600
Kun!

695
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:52,719
Kun!

696
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:53,959
It's Kun!

697
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,239
Look.

698
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:01,399
Just like Teacher Liu,

699
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,719
I want to be a teacher!

700
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,719
I shall take over Su Chang Ji

701
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:09,360
and become an upright
shopkeeper just like my mother!

702
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:11,159
Xingzhou,

703
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:12,159
it's your turn.

704
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:17,719
I want to attain the fourth rank
by the age of 30,

705
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,719
the third rank by the age of 40,

706
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,520
and enter the privy council

707
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,600
as the grand chancellor
by the age of 50.

708
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,879
Live up to my conscience,

709
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,679
to keep the promise for the people

710
00:39:28,919 --> 00:39:32,560
and uphold peace of the state!

711
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:34,199
All right!

712
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,840
Zhao Xiaoqian, look.

713
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,919
