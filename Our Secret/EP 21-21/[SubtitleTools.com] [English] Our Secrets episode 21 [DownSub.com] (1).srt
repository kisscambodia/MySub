Our Secret
EP21

2
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,870
Su,

3
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,120
this original piece by Xianxian

4
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,270
is very good.

5
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,479
We can expand it into 200 episodes.

6
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,440
It won't be a problem.

7
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,870
We can also convert it into an animation,

8
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,080
or a game,

9
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,190
something like that.

10
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
Guaranteed to make a hit!

11
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,870
Director Zhang,

12
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,509
I can't sign the contract.

14
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,000
Director Zhang, Xianxian has never signed a contract before.

15
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,510
I think she needs some time to think.

16
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,190
Young lady,

17
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,550
you've made a promise.

18
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
How can you break it?

19
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,110
I'm really, really sorry.

20
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,000
The artists that I contract with on my comics app

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,240
are all very popular on Weibo.

22
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,190
If you refuse to work with me for your own reasons,

23
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,800
when words get out,

24
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,320
what do people think of you?

25
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,079
Director Zhang...

26
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,440
Young lady,

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,880
you need to learn right from wrong.

28
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,960
Sign it.

29
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,670
What's right and what's wrong?

30
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,670
Party A and party B.

31
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,240
Collaborating upon mutual consent.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
There's no reason for forced signing.

33
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,190
Zhou Siyue.

34
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,470
We're talking about Ding Xian's business here.

35
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm also doing this for Director Zhang's sake.

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,240
Signing a contract hastily before reaching an agreement,

37
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,030
if anything goes wrong with the project one day,

38
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,360
I don't think you'd want

39
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,670
people to talk about how you made a big mistake, right?

40
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,630
For this piece of work,

41
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,600
its greatest value is in Ding Xian herself.

42
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,390
It's what she's always had in her.

43
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,030
So from a business perspective,

44
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,520
Ding Xian

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
is not the best commodity for you, Director Zhang.

46
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,720
Come on.

47
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,000
Change your shoes.

48
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,600
Why did you bring a pair of shoes?

49
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,030
I got them by the road on my way here.

50
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,079
It's okay.

51
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,720
You look so good today.

52
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,670
Let me do it.

53
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,270
How did you know my feet hurt?

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,470
Because my feet hurt, too.

55
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,720
Do they fit?

56
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,950
Xianxian.

57
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,550
Xianxian, I don't quite understand.

58
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't you want other people to look up to you,

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,070
make a better life,

60
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,720
and become someone...

61
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,640
Su,

62
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,440
I just want to be the person I want to be.

63
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,040
I thought we were the same kind of people.

64
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,270
We used to be.

65
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,640
Su.

66
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,160
Director Zhang.

67
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,550
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,600
What happened today...

69
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,070
Don't worry about it.

70
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,790
I've given her the opportunity

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,230
for your sake.

72
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,950
I wonder why you help her so much.

73
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,880
If I'm not mistaken,

74
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,880
you like her?

75
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,640
Director Zhang, let me see you to the car.

76
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,390
Su,

77
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,480
women like this

78
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,110
love guys like you,

79
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,390
talented and rich.

80
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,440
Director Zhang,

81
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,640
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,720
I can't agree with what you said.

83
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,670
About the project this time,

84
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,760
I opt out.

85
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,510
I think

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,070
I dreamed of a scene like this.

87
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,600
You dreamed of me?

88
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,790
You were holding my hand like this in my dream.

89
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,920
At that time, I thought,

90
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,550
I'd never be with you.

91
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,390
So I had a lot of dreams about you.

92
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,270
I'm sorry, Ding Xian.

93
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,790
I promise you,

94
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,110
I won't ever hurt you again.

95
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,390
So,

96
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,600
how are you gonna explain to Xing Lufei?

97
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,720
It's none of her business.

98
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,670
She likes you.

99
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,480
It's none of my business.

100
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,270
Then should I talk to her...

101
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,320
It's none of your business.

102
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,350
Zhou Siyue,

103
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,070
you are avoiding my question.

104
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,390
I never thought,

105
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,920
that you would be nervous,

106
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,000
about people like Xing Lufei.

107
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,720
I never thought,

108
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,110
that you would be nervous about people like Su Bocong.

109
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,390
How am I nervous?

110
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
You're kidding.

111
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,880
Then who's the one,

112
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,920
feeling insecure just because

113
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,640
I talked a few words with him?

114
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,720
Ding Xian, I used to think,

115
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,440
I know what I want,

116
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,790
but then I found out,

117
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,230
if I don't have you in my world,

118
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,040
then everything is meaningless.

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,640
So, on the road ahead,

120
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,550
shall we walk together?

121
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,110
Zhou Siyue,

122
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,440
all these years,

123
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,790
I've never really changed.

124
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,390
If I say yes,

125
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,669
you'll never let me go again.

126
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,880
I promise you.

127
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,470
We will always,

128
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,080
be together.

129
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,470
This is correct, and...

130
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,030
there are sixteen rooms altogether, right?

131
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,640
Right.

132
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,280
And then this...

133
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,080
Zhou Siyue.

134
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,470
Boss, so,

135
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,030
when we were given awards,

136
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,200
this Mr. Chen from Hongguang Technology wanted you to contact him.

137
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,000
Right,

138
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,080
did your idea work?

139
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,590
I figured it out.

140
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,470
The meaning of my life is to eat.

141
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,400
I don't make super big bucks,

142
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,440
why should I work super hard?

143
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,550
Good morning.

144
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,550
Morning.

145
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,910
I'll take it myself.

146
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,440
Just get on the bus.

147
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,080
Hi.

148
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,790
I got it, I got it.

149
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,320
Please sit.

150
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,880
How about I go sit over there?

151
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,710
Just sit here.

152
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,520
Ding Xian,

153
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,520
have you finished the activity report of this Comic-con?

154
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,400
It should be out in our WeChat account today.

155
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,640
When did this become my responsibility?

156
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,080
On our meeting last night.

157
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,790
It was decided on the spot when you were absent.

158
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,790
Okay, I'll do it right away.

159
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,350
It's time to

160
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,640
give the report of the competition, right?

161
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,110
Dong Zhengfei,

162
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,670
you're the team leader but you don't work at all.

163
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,520
Shame on you.

164
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,110
Yuan Fang.

165
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,320
I'll write it. It's okay.

166
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,080
You can get some sleep.

167
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,670
Thank you, Boss.

168
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,960
Could you help me get my bag?

169
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,280
Thank you.

170
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,400
Would you like some music?

171
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,840
I have finished the report.

172
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,960
And you?

173
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,590
Not yet.

174
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,440
You can get some sleep first.

175
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,550
Okay.

176
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,440
I didn't know that Zhou,

177
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,000
could be so gentle and considerate.

178
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,640
Me, neither.

179
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's go, Boss.

180
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,080
You can't read social cues at all.

181
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,320
Wake up.

182
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,670
Have we arrived yet?

183
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,470
Hello, Ms. Sun.

184
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,000
Ding Xian.

185
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,670
These last few episodes of "Shadows" are really good.

186
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,030
We thought about it,

187
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,670
and decided to update every three days.

188
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,670
If it's okay,

189
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,710
could you please send me a new draft tonight?

190
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,440
Tonight?

191
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,520
Yes, I want it tonight.

192
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I see.

193
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,280
I'm gonna have to work on my draft.

194
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,760
See you then.

195
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,230
Zhou Siyue, would you like to have dinner together tonight?

196
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,710
It's okay if you don't want to eat. I know that there's a...

197
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,280
Can you stay away from me?

198
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,670
- See you. - See you.

199
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,880
Do you hate me so much?

200
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,030
I've been chasing you for so long.

201
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,590
Anyone can see, if he's not a fool.

202
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,000
Where am I not as good as her?

203
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,550
She is better than you in everything.

204
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,550
You're kidding me.

205
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,520
It was you who locked Ding Xian in the dressing room

206
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,280
the other day, isn't it?

207
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,440
Xing Lufei,

208
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,710
I'm telling you for the last time,

209
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Ding Xian is the only girl I like.

210
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,000
About the thing between you and Director Zhang,

211
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,790
I already heard.

212
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
Why were you so impulsive?

213
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,910
I'm sorry, Mr. Ma.

214
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,350
That was my fault.

215
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,960
I'll try to make up for it.

216
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,840
Su,

217
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,520
do you know why,

218
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,230
I chose you before,

219
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,470
and start a business together with you?

220
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,880
Because you're young,

221
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,000
and you already know what you want.

222
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,910
And you're so motivated,

223
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,910
with a calmness beyond your peers.

224
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,840
But now it seems that,

225
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,030
you're still too young.

226
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,640
Mr. Ma, I heard you.

227
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Right.

228
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:36,280
I have a project at hand,

229
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,760
that needs someone in charge to follow up.

230
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,430
Since you happen to have time,

231
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,520
I'll give this project to you.

232
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,000
Boss,

233
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,190
waiting for Xianxian's message?

234
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,280
I can't believe you've also come to this.

235
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,070
I guess it's fair luck after all.

236
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,070
I don't seem to remember you getting lucky once, have you?

237
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,310
You're so mean!

238
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,470
Professor Ye.

239
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,560
Siyue.

240
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,800
Mr. Chen of Hongguang Technology came to me yesterday.

241
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,800
He's interested in your robot,

242
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,190
and wanted to work with our team.

243
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,920
Mr. Chen of Hongguang Technology?

244
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,470
Right.

245
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,350
I think I kind of remember him.

246
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,230
I remembered.

247
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,160
It was at the last robot contest,

248
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,110
at the award ceremony,

249
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,070
he asked me to hand over his business card to you.

250
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,040
So what exactly does their company do?

251
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
You don't know?

252
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,680
Hongguang Technology is currently the most authoritative

253
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,760
intelligent robot company in China.

254
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,710
Their main products are

255
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,520
humanoid intelligent robots.

256
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,190
Professor Ye.

257
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,920
I don't really want to work with them.

258
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,400
Are you out of your mind?

259
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,110
Working with Hongguang is not only profitable,

260
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,350
but also you get to collaborate with the top teams in the country.

261
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,920
You're giving up this great opportunity like this?

262
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,470
What are you thinking?

263
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,190
Indeed, Hongguang Technology is very good.

264
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,350
It might even be

265
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,110
our best option at the moment.

266
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,680
But why,

267
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,680
why does a high-end technology company,

268
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,830
want to work with a team of sophomores?

269
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,470
What's more, the robot technology we have

270
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,560
is not perfected.

271
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,400
It does not have a relatively clear direction for application.

272
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,880
But

273
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,040
that doesn't mean we won't make progress.

274
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,760
So that's the problem.

275
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,710
Obviously they can go to more accomplished teams,

276
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,470
with more mature performance and techniques.

277
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,230
Or wait for us to grow,

278
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,350
and then come and cooperate with us.

279
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,110
With the timing that they come to us,

280
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,640
I suspect that the cooperation is just an excuse.

281
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,590
Their real purpose

282
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,160
is to buy out our patents.

283
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
But a buy-out of our patents,

284
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,280
doesn't sound like a bad thing currently, does it?

285
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,110
When we're not sure about whether we share

286
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,160
similar ideas for a cooperation,

287
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,000
selling out our patents would mean,

288
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,110
that we hand over the results

289
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,400
of our year-long research.

290
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,190
Are you willing to do that?

291
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,280
Professor Ye.

292
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,280
I think you should reconsider it.

293
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,800
If Zhou Siyue's not willing to,

294
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,190
I can lead our team and work with Hongguang.

295
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,470
I'll think about it.

296
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,160
Bye, Professor.

297
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,310
After a whole night of working on my draft,

298
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,710
it's so nice to finally get to enjoy some nice food.

299
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,070
Aren't you tired?

300
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,760
Not really.

301
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,230
I like drawing.

302
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,520
So I'm not tired.

303
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,950
It's just...

304
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,280
I ate too much.

305
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,280
Too much?

306
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,640
You ate too much, but you're still buying so many snacks?

307
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,230
For a girl,

308
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,950
we don't use the same stomach for eating dinner and eating snacks.

309
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,350
Is there anything else you want to eat?

310
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,310
I want ice cream.

311
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,040
Isn't that cold?

312
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,800
I'll just take a bite if you buy one.

313
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,350
What about the rest?

314
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,560
You'll finish it.

315
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,560
No I'm not.

316
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,520
Come on!

317
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,760
What flavor do you want?

318
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,430
Blueberry.

319
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,000
Blueberry.

320
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,920
It's so cold.

321
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,400
Just don't eat if it's cold.

322
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,070
No, this is delicious.

323
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,350
Can't be wasted.

324
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,280
Would you like some?

325
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,190
No, it's all yours.

326
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,040
You don't want to eat my leftover?

327
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,400
It's so cold.

328
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,520
Isn't it delicious?

329
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,880
It is good.

330
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,230
I have work to do in my lab.

331
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,880
Why don't you go back first?

332
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,000
So I'll go back to the studio then.

333
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,110
Okay.

334
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,280
See you.

335
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,950
You shouldn't come see her anymore.

336
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,680
What if I'm here for you?

337
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,950
This is a young team from Hua Qing.

338
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,310
They just won the championship in the robot contest.

339
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,110
And they were targeted by Hongguang.

340
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,040
You should get in touch with them.

341
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,040
Talk to them.

342
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,680
Do you want to,

343
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,830
scout them?

344
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,110
It's not them that I want.

345
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,400
I want to know what Hongguang's been up to.

346
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,920
Oh,

347
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,880
I have this document here,

348
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,230
that's maybe of help to you.

349
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,710
I'm flattered,

350
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,680
but I'm just a student.

351
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,760
I'm not planning on working with any company just yet.

352
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,590
Not working with us,

353
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,950
but working with Hongguang.

354
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,400
You want me to hack information from Hongguang?

355
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,880
I didn't expect you people can

356
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,040
do anything by fair means or foul just for making money.

357
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,000
I still hope that you could consider.

358
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,040
There's no need for further discussion between us.

359
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,470
I won't do anything illegal.

360
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,950
You'd be embarrassing yourself.

361
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,280
Why don't you take a look at this before you make a decision?

362
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,680
With your health situation,

363
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,520
I keep telling you to walk outside more often, and you just wouldn't listen.

364
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,400
You'd rather stay in the room.

365
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,470
Whenever I walk around,

366
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,230
my brain will be packed with ideas.

367
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,160
Reading brings me some peace.

368
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,230
I won't do anything illegal.

369
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,430
You'd be embarrassing yourself.

370
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,350
Why don't you take a look at this before you decide?

371
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,880
We've found out

372
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,160
the man who set your father up.

373
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,470
Siyue, you're here.

374
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,350
No classes at school?

375
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,560
Class is over.

376
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,760
Here.

377
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,880
Are you feeling any better?

378
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,950
Much better.

379
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,920
I heard that,

380
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,760
you won a prize again.

381
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Well done.

382
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,950
That's because of your teachings.

383
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,400
Here, have some water.

384
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,190
I'm sorry, dad.

385
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,470
What, you're in trouble?

386
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,760
I'm just...

387
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,520
sorry that I got you worried.

388
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,760
Your mom and I know,

389
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,310
that you're always

390
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,310
a very good boy.

391
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,070
We never worry about you making mistakes.

392
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,430
Whatever you want to do,

393
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,680
just go ahead and do it.

394
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,880
Don't worry.

395
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,230
But what if that thing

396
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,000
takes sacrifices?

397
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,950
It always takes sacrifices.

398
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,000
Doesn't it?

399
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,230
If it didn't happen to us,

400
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,040
I never knew,

401
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,520
that we,

402
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,400
could be such a happy family.

403
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,400
Mark my words,

404
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,190
no matter what happens,

405
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,520
as long as think it through for yourself, go for it.

406
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,590
I have no regrets.

407
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,760
I just want my son,

408
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,760
to have no regrets, either.

409
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,950
You're gonna recover.

410
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,070
I will.

411
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,560
It's such a simple thing.

412
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,310
Have you even put any effort in it?

413
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,800
It's so great to be rich.

414
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,760
You can even buy the truth.

415
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,520
But I still refuse.

416
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,190
You won't do it now,

417
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,920
but it doesn't mean you won't do it in the future.

418
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,110
She loves you for your honesty and integrity now,

419
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,800
but one day you're gonna bow before reality.

420
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,640
By that time,

421
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,590
do you think,

422
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,880
that she'll still love you?

423
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,000
I am not the same kind of person like you.

424
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
For me?

425
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,350
Now that the shoes are delivered,

426
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
I'll see you later.

427
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,280
What's the rush?

428
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Let's take a look.

429
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,590
How do you like them?

430
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,800
Not bad.

431
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,880
You've got eyes for these.

432
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,710
Of course.

433
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,470
You gotta see who bought them.

434
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,830
Why did you transfer so much?

435
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,000
Of course.

436
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,590
I can't take advantage of you.

437
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,760
Then forget it.

438
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:05,950
I can't take this.

439
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,110
I've earned money lately.

440
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,710
I got paid 4,000 yuan for this draft.

441
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,110
I feel it's easy for me to make money.

442
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,920
How about this? In the future, you stay home,

443
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,950
and I'll go earn the bread.

444
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,040
You see, you've been so busy lately.

445
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,520
I feel bad for you.

446
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,400
Look at that smugly face of yours.

447
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,800
Happy about earning this little money.

448
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,400
4,000 yuan is not a little.

449
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,920
Plus,

450
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,680
I earn money with my own hands.

451
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,880
I don't cheat or

452
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,680
compromise to the reality.

453
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,880
Let me ask you a question.

454
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,190
What if...

455
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,400
one day you found me changed

456
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,040
into a person not knowing right from wrong,

457
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
what would you do?

458
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,880
Why are you asking that?

459
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,880
Are you in a bad mood?

460
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,560
No.

461
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,000
So?

462
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,160
Is it because of the contest?

463
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,230
No.

464
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Your experiment?

465
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,880
I asked you first,

466
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,160
you gotta answer me first.

467
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,640
Don't forget to stay true to yourself.

468
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,710
I can't imagine

469
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,830
what you would be like if you change.

470
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,760
Hello.

471
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,350
Ding Xian, we've got some copyright issue

472
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,560
with the novel adapted from your comics.

473
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,710
Director Su,

474
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,950
about that blogger of the "Little Monster Diaries",

475
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,230
I think she's in trouble.

476
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,760
Hello, Director Sun.

477
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,560
Director Sun.

478
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,800
Please have a seat.

479
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,070
Regarding the copyright of "Shadows",

480
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,880
what's the deal with that?

481
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,680
About that copyright,

482
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,280
I'm sorry I didn't make things clear for you.

483
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,680
Look at Article 39.

484
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,710
After the copyright of "Shadows" expires,

485
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,640
the copyright of "Shadows",

486
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,520
should be owned by the artist and the Dream Journey Press.

487
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,590
Dream Journey has the right to the final interpretation.

488
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,950
That's why you shared the copyright with me?

489
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,310
So that I'd share

490
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,800
the risk of infringement?

491
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,830
You can go ask around.

492
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,000
Nowadays, no publishing agency

493
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,640
would share the copyright with their artists.

494
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
The reason we're doing this

495
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,710
is for your own good.

496
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,470
But you hid the expiration of the copyright from me!

497
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,280
It's clearly written in the contract.

498
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,470
The profits they made out of the "Shadows" comics,

499
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,230
is totally enough for Dream Journey Publishing

500
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,160
to cover the compensation easily.

501
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,110
I get minimal pay for my work,

502
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,430
but I have to take on half of the compensation.

503
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,350
They've planned it all along.

504
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,160
They made a trap and wait for me to jump in.

505
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,310
It's all right.

506
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,230
It's inevitable to be fooled when you are new in the business.

507
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,920
But when they asked you

508
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,430
to share the copyright,

509
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,230
weren't you suspecting at all?

510
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,110
I didn't think that much.

511
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,710
I thought that there are

512
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,520
always good people in the world.

513
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,950
How silly!

514
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,920
Right.

515
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,190
You are the smartest.

516
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,230
Here.

517
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,520
Have a cup of coffee.

518
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,150
Take it easy.

519
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,000
Your latte art

520
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,280
is so bad!

521
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm not professional.

522
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,520
Try it yourself if you're that good.

523
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,670
Why not?

524
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,600
Do it.

525
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,870
How should I start?

526
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,320
Hold the coffee in your left hand,

527
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,190
and hold the milk in your right hand.

528
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,120
Pour slowly little by little from this angle.

529
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,389
Don't rush.

530
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,630
What?

531
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,520
I see that now. I'll do it myself.

532
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,120
Here.

533
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,230
You're adding too much sugar?

534
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,040
The coffee is too bitter. I prefer the sweet.

535
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,840
Give me a sec.

536
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,670
Here.

537
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,840
Wait.

538
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,470
You take a bite of this,

539
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,710
and then try a sip of coffee.

540
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,280
How is it?

541
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,360
Delicious.

542
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,120
Wait.

543
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,710
Got a stamp on you.

544
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,520
Are you happy now?

545
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,710
Thank you for cheering me up.

546
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,870
So what are you going to do next?

547
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,320
I want to talk to the original author.

548
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,280
It is best to settle this in private.

549
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,840
But there is another thing that is also very important.

550
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,630
You are also a victim of this.

551
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,000
So,

552
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,840
while you talk to the original author,

553
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,470
you'd better also look for

554
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,560
any evidence that the publisher lied to you.

555
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,080
Do you have the contract you signed

556
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,280
or chat records or anything like that?

557
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,430
I'll help you.

558
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,560
I can do it myself.

559
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,000
I know you're worried about me.

560
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,120
But I also have to learn

561
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,870
to solve problems by myself.

562
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,360
Okay.

563
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,910
But what if you can't find any evidence?

564
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,190
Then I'll pay for the compensation.

565
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,120
How much is that?

566
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,910
500,000 yuan.

567
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,630
Don't worry. It's not gonna get that far.

568
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,950
At the worst,

569
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,950
you could hire me.

570
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,910
Professor Ye.

571
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,910
I think I should see Mr. Chen of Hongguang.

572
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,870
Have you been waiting for a long time?

573
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,600
Give me.

574
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,470
No.

575
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,670
Sorry.

576
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,430
It's okay.

577
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,040
I saw your performance

578
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,190
at the competition.

579
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,910
But

580
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,000
you rejected me before,

581
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,360
didn't you?

582
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,520
Yes.

583
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,600
I thought,

584
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,950
that I didn't share the same ideas as you.

585
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,870
So I chose to refuse.

586
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,630
Then why now,

587
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,670
you come to me?

588
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,230
Because I need money.

589
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,000
You are very straight-forward.

590
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,000
To be honest,

591
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,760
before,

592
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,190
I just wanted to buy out your robot patent.

593
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,390
But now I've changed my mind.

594
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,040
I want your patent

595
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,230
plus a two-year contract after your graduation.

596
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,470
Name your price.

597
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,560
500,000 yuan.

598
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,470
Si Yue.

599
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,560
If it's okay,

600
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,040
I want the money now.

601
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,000
Don't be so hasty, young man,

602
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,870
we still have to wait,

603
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,120
for the procedures of the contract, don't we?

604
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,360
Okay.

605
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,040
Then I'll be waiting.

606
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,040
Hello?

607
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,910
Hello, Ding Xian.

608
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,800
I've got your 500,000 yuan.

609
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,670
I'll clarify the plagiarism case for you

610
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,520
on Weibo in a moment.

611
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,470
Don't worry.

612
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,870
But I didn't send you any money.

613
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,280
A gentleman contacted me yesterday,

614
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,560
saying that he'll help you with the money.

615
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,630
Don't you know that?

616
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,280
So... could you tell me,

617
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,470
the name of that man?

618
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,390
Su,

619
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,710
I've been looking all over for you.

620
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,600
Xianxian,

621
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,600
why are you here?

622
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,910
Thank you for paying the money for me.

623
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,630
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

624
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,190
That's...

625
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,000
That's the only thing I can do for you.

626
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,470
Su, are you all right?

627
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,120
Are you okay?

628
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,470
I'm okay. I'm okay.

629
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,390
I'm okay. Just go. See you later.

630
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,840
It's okay. You don't have to worry about me. I'm okay.

631
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,710
What can I do?

632
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,320
Maybe I should just get you home first?

633
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,710
Su.

634
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,000
Su.

635
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,190
Can you get up?

636
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,390
Be careful!

637
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,630
Where are you going, young lady?

638
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,190
Just a minute, sir.

639
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,840
Su.

640
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,950
Su, where do you live?

641
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,320
Su?

642
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,320
Jiangnan Avenue.

643
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,230
Jiangnan Avenue.

644
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,320
All right.

645
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,430
Here we are, young lady.

646
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,760
Su.

647
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,190
Wake up!

648
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,390
Jiangnan Avenue and?

649
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,630
Hey, young lady, are you getting off or not?

650
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,560
What should I do?

651
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,280
Su, we're there.

652
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,600
You...

653
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,710
Su, you are too heavy!

654
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:39,800
Su.

655
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,150
You're drunk!

656
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,630
If I weren't drunk,

657
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,150
I'd never be able to say this.

658
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:06,710
Ding Xian,

659
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,710
I love you.

660
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:16,710
Su.

661
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,360
I'm already in a relationship.

662
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,520
I see.

663
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,360
Sorry about that.

664
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,230
You should go home and get some rest.

665
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,190
Zhou Siyue.

666
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,120
Zhou Siyue.

667
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:26,800
Director Su,

668
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,280
there is someone waiting for you in your office.

669
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:42,840
Zhou Siyue.

670
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,280
There is 500,000 yuan in this card.

671
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,390
The password is Ding Xian's birthday.

672
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,630
Please tell Xianxian,

673
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:11,670
I'm sorry.

674
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,800
What did you do to her?

675
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,470
I am warning you.

676
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:25,760
Leave her alone!

677
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,600
I'm about to lose my patience.
