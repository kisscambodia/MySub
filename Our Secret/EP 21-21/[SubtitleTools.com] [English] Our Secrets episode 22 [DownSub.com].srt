Our Secret
EP22

2
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,950
I'm back.

3
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,400
Finally.

4
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,910
Your computer has been ringing for a day.

5
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,800
Come and see!

6
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,000
Let me take a look.

7
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,800
I see.

8
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,550
Have a try.

9
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,750
Wow, Childe Zhou has even learned how to cook.

10
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,079
Too bad I could only have instant noodles in high school.

11
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,470
Eat or not?

12
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,440
Sure.

13
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,750
This one.

14
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,829
Is it good?

15
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,550
Nice.

16
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,320
So much better than before!

17
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,880
How did you do that?

18
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,800
When my dad was in hospital,

19
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,160
I cooked for him.

20
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,240
How is him now?

21
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,550
He's fine, except that his heart has a little problem.

22
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,079
Thanks to timely discovery,

23
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,390
the treatment

24
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,670
was effective.

25
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,110
Good then.

26
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,420
Continue.

27
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,220
Oh, right.

28
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,960
Here are your five hundred thousand yuan.

29
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,670
Where did you get it?

30
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,030
Is it my turn?

31
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,670
I'd like to hear your answer first.

32
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,670
Where did you get five hundred thousand?

33
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,190
I...

34
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,030
I sold the patent of robots

35
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,220
that won me a prize.

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,520
You sold it?

37
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,910
You worked so hard for it.

38
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,910
What are you going to do in the future?

39
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,240
Future?

40
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,000
I can invent another one in the future.

41
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,670
You still haven't told me your answer.

42
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
I explained

43
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,670
all details on my Vlog.

44
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,910
And many painters came to me

45
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,750
saying they were cheated by Dream Journey Press.

46
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,110
Then,

47
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,880
we informed against this company jointly.

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,030
And it was under investigation.

49
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,110
Great!

50
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,910
I have another good news.

51
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,440
The author of "Shadows"

52
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,390
loves my comics very much.

53
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,270
He decided to give me his copyright,

54
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,110
so that I could continue to make adaptions.

55
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:26,320
He even signed a profit share contract with me.

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,550
I can draw my original comics in the future.

57
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,760
Do you think it's good to

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,740
draw our stories in comics?

59
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,950
What do you think?

60
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,640
What do you think?

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,350
What are you doing?

62
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,670
Do you think

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,480
I talk too much?

64
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,230
No, you're cute.

65
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,790
Why are you laughing?

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,480
You still keep it.

67
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,600
So, have you

68
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,160
seen everything?

69
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,160
Have I seen what?

70
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,390
The secret diary.

71
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Didn't you mean to let me notice it?

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,720
20121221

73
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,790
But,

74
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,950
I always wonder.

75
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,040
Hello, I'm April.

76
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,320
I'm so tired, April.

77
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,350
What's this?

78
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,200
So you've found it already.

79
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,800
You told me

80
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,390
that you wanted a star shining forever.

81
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,550
When

82
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,070
did I say that?

83
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,760
You don't remember?

84
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,070
I want to have

85
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,920
a star that will never dim.

86
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,950
That's a big dream.

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,390
So,

88
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,790
from that moment, you...

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,270
What?

90
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,640
How is that possible?

91
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,350
I made this to encourage you in case that

92
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,070
you might be tired in the repeating grade.

93
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,880
Looks like it worked.

94
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,480
I'm so tired, Siyue.

95
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,640
Zhou Siyue.

96
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Tell me,

97
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,760
when did you start to like me?

98
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,270
Tell me. I wanna know.

99
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,320
It's a secret.

100
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,320
Your phone.

101
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,110
Hey, mom.

102
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,510
Xianxian, you winter vacation is coming, right?

103
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,000
When will you come back?

104
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,110
I'll be back in two or three days.

105
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,550
Dad, mom,

106
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,790
I'm back.

107
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
Xianxian, it's good to have you back.

108
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,480
Good to see you, uncle.

109
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,640
Siyue.

110
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,110
Good to see you.

111
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,070
Thank you for bringing presents.

112
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,350
Wanxian, come on. Siyue.

113
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,920
Good to see you, aunt.

114
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,160
I haven't see you for over one year.

115
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,670
And you've become slenderer.

116
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,320
You need to eat more today.

117
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,790
Why do you two...

118
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,669
Ding Xian said she would come back for the Spring Festival.

119
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,320
I wanted come back too, so we came together.

120
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,590
It's nice to have you two back together.

121
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:46,840
Come on in.

122
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,789
How's your father now?

123
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,230
He's still under medical observation.

124
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,640
In Jiangling.

125
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,790
Okay.

126
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,880
Wash your hands and let's have lunch.

127
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,790
Have more cups of drink with me this time.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,200
You don't need to change shoes.

129
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,150
Wine. I have good wine here.

130
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,640
Go wash your hands.

131
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,640
Come on, Siyue, take a seat.

132
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,110
So many kinds of dishes.

133
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,320
No, you're the guest, take your seat.

134
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,840
Take it.

135
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,910
You seem happier to see him than see me.

136
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,080
Of course.

137
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,280
Siyue is such an excellent kid.

138
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,030
He was recommended to Huaqing University

139
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,440
with decent personality.

140
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,470
Everyone will be happy to meet him.

141
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,080
This is my collected wine.

142
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,640
Let's have some cups later.

143
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,550
Just sit down. Ding Juncong.

144
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,280
Lunch is ready.

145
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,840
I'm not hungry. You go first.

146
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,220
Don't you want to see your sister?

147
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,590
I'm telling you,

148
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,550
Ding Juncong

149
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,200
is in puberty, a rebellious period.

150
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,470
Just ignore him.

151
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,590
All because you spoil him.

152
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,710
Siyue, you're Xianxian's senior.

153
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,470
On campus,

154
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,200
please take more care of her.

155
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,790
Of course, I'll take good care of her.

156
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,790
And remember to watch out for her.

157
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,150
She will indulge herself

158
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,080
if no one is supervising her.

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,110
I won't.

160
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,790
I hope so.

161
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,790
If I know that

162
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,080
all you know is pleasure and dating,

163
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,110
after spending so much effort to go to Huaqing University,

164
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,520
You will get your lessons.

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,710
Mom,

166
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,470
I'm an adult now.

167
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,520
Why can't I date?

168
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,550
No, you can't.

169
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,080
Such a waste of time！

170
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Enough, enough.

171
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,880
Don't nag anymore.

172
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,230
She's old enough to date anyone. Don't interfere.

173
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,840
She's my daughter no matter how old she is.

174
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,760
I have the right.

175
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,710
Okay, okay.

176
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,880
Don't mind them.

177
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,910
Let's drink our wine.

178
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,910
Come on, Siyue.

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,670
Welcome.

180
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,790
Thank you, uncle.

181
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,910
Siyue.

182
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,710
Leave it for me. You are guest.

183
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,000
It's fine, aunt.

184
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,080
I often wash dishes at home.

185
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Let me do it.

186
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,710
It's fine, really.

187
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,080
Mom, just drop it. I'll do it.

188
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,150
Can I trust you two?

189
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,640
Don't worry, aunt. We can handle this.

190
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,110
Come on.

191
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,030
Let the kids do it.

192
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,150
Let's go.

193
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,960
Find something else to do if you are terribly bored.

194
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,710
What?

195
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,350
Aren't you worried?

196
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,550
Why don't we

197
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,110
just tell them?

198
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,080
No.

199
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,030
What if my mom beat me?

200
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,470
Then I'll stand in front of you,

201
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,880
so she can only beat me.

202
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,470
What if she makes me break up with you?

203
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,590
Then I'll beg her,

204
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,110
until she agrees.

205
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,670
What if she doesn't want me to go home anymore?

206
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,520
Then,

207
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,590
she won't let me enter the house either.

208
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,710
No, forget it.

209
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,440
You will leave

210
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,640
in two or three days.

211
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,840
And I'll have to face them all by myself.

212
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,760
Tell me!

213
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,280
Who is the "sweetheart" in your contact list?

214
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,550
Ouch, ouch.

215
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,110
Tell me.

216
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,110
Who is the "sweetheart"?

217
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,520
Tell me.

218
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,550
Who is the "sweetheart"?

219
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,200
I can't believe it.

220
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,590
You are in great trouble.

221
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,400
Where is my feather duster?

222
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,110
-Don't, mom. -Move away.

223
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,760
Help me.

224
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,440
Pray for yourself.

225
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,080
Sweetheart.

226
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,760
Brother-in-law,

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,670
Please help me!

228
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,440
What did you call me?

229
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,910
Brother-in-law.

230
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,110
You're a clever boy.

231
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,710
Go, go, stop her.

232
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,710
-Move away. -Mom.

233
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,470
Got out of the way, Siyue.

234
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,030
Aunt.

235
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,550
Alright, stop.

236
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,670
-Siyue, get out of the way. -Please calm down.

237
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,550
Get out of the way, Siyue.

238
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,280
I must teach him a lesson, or he won't learn.

239
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,080
Don't beat him. You don't have to beat him.

240
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,760
What are you doing?

241
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,470
He deserves it, aunt.

242
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,200
But,

243
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,790
you can't have an answer even if you beat him.

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,400
Ding Juncong,

245
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,550
you're lucky that there's a guest. I'll let it go this time.

246
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,550
Wait and see.

247
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,440
Calm down, aunt.

248
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,960
He's in puberty.

249
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,080
This is so irritating.

250
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,200
Siyue.

251
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,280
Can you...

252
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,110
No problem, aunt.

253
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,470
I'm free recently.

254
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,080
I can help Juncong

255
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,320
with his lessons.

256
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,320
And help you watch him.

257
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,200
Siyue is so considerate.

258
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,150
I wonder

259
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
who will have the bliss to marry him.

260
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,590
Who is the "sweetheart"?

261
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,550
Is the one with a claw braid

262
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,840
or the one in a short skirt?

263
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,350
What are you doing, Ding Xian?

264
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,960
Brat,

265
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,640
mind your manners.

266
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,960
Do your homework.

267
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,110
I got it.

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
There is something wrong between you two.

269
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,350
Just focus on your homework.

270
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,400
You two were dating in high school.

271
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,470
How can you blame me?

272
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,320
Who said we were dating in high school?

273
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,200
We weren't.

274
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,470
She has a crush on me, that's all.

275
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,440
Didn't you have a crush on me too?

276
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,200
You two are lame.

277
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,320
It's none of your business.

278
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,470
Solve your problems first.

279
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,910
Who is that sweetheart?

280
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,670
It's not what you think.

281
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,110
You two are so bad.

282
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,670
I'll report your thing to mom.

283
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,280
Sit down.

284
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,550
Don't tell mom.

285
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,710
You're dead if you tell her.

286
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,280
You're bullying me.

287
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,640
That's only the start.

288
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,400
Take out your homework. I'll teach you.

289
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,790
Please teach him well then.

290
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,320
It causes me headache to look at his homework.

291
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,230
Concentrate on it.

292
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,380
Come on, buddy.

293
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,880
I don't want to do my homework, brother-in-law.

294
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,640
I'm hungry.

295
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,470
I want to eat something.

296
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,840
What did you call me?

297
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,230
Brother-in-law.

298
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,440
Don't eat so much, stop.

299
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,230
That's enough.

300
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,110
It's fine. Go on.

301
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,520
You're spoiling him.

302
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,760
He doesn't eat any dishes at home,

303
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,140
except some snacks.

304
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,760
What's wrong with it?

305
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,880
You had plenty of snacks in high school.

306
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,550
You want some for yourself, right?

307
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,550
Come on, try it.

308
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,200
What are you two doing?

309
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,230
Don't just focus on your snacks.

310
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,550
You need to finish that test paper too.

311
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,790
I'll give you explanation on your problems.

312
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,710
Where do you live tonight?

313
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,310
Your place.

314
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,280
No, what if my mom finds out?

315
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,110
Why don't you just tell her?

316
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,080
Do your homework.

317
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,240
Don't listen to adults' conversation.

318
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,640
Then

319
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,400
you'll have to go to my place.

320
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,950
Your place?

321
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,350
Let's do it.

322
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,920
How long will it take to clean it up?

323
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,950
I remember I have some unfinished business at home.

324
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,920
I gotta go now.

325
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,040
You've entered my home.

326
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,680
Do you think you can leave so easily?

327
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,920
I haven't entered yet.

328
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,560
I haven't.

329
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,660
Siyue.

330
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,560
I'm bringing you quilts.

331
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,880
Thank you, aunt.

332
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,350
I remember

333
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,190
your house hasn't been cleaned for a long time,

334
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,110
so you could use it when you sleep.

335
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,520
Why are you flushing?

336
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,920
It's hot here, mom.

337
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,230
Don't you think?

338
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,310
It's hot indeed.

339
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,640
You wear too much.

340
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,760
Siyue,

341
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,950
if you feel uncomfortable at night,

342
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,800
come and sleep in our house.

343
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,070
You can sleep in Juncong's room.

344
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,760
There's no need, aunt.

345
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,280
I can sleep here.

346
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,430
It's fine.

347
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,470
Okay.

348
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,950
Tomorrow morning,

349
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,470
come and have breakfast at our place.

350
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,280
You like golden cakes, don't you?

351
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,310
I'll make them for you.

352
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,070
Okay.

353
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,160
Are you leaving with me or not?

354
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,230
Yes, yes.

355
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,520
Something is wrong.

356
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,280
So wrong.

357
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,640
Do you feel that something is wrong

358
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,710
between Xianxian and Siyue?

359
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,830
I think there's something wrong with you.

360
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,680
What? I'm enjoying it.

361
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,310
I must ask them.

362
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,800
Ding Juncong.

363
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,110
Come here.

364
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,190
Do you know anything?

365
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,040
I...

366
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,590
I don't know.

367
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,310
Don't give him a hard time.

368
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,830
Why are you so inquisitive?

369
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,310
What do you want?

370
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,000
You can go to sleep if you have nothing else to do.

371
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,110
Don't be such a stickybeak.

372
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,310
Tell me,

373
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,310
what do you know?

374
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,000
Ding Juncong,

375
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,680
whenever you lie, you stare at the floor.

376
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,590
Tell me.

377
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,040
Alright, I can tell you.

378
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,190
But give my phone back.

379
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,070
I'm sorry, brother-in-law.

380
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,000
Zhou Siyue

381
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,710
is her sweetheart.

382
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
I'm going to bed.

383
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,520
Xianxian.

384
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,720
Dad.

385
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,760
Don't stare at your phone.

386
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,040
Your eyesight is failing.

387
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,400
Who are you texting?

388
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,430
Nobody.

389
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,470
Being young is so great.

390
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,830
I think so.

391
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,040
It reminds me of the days when your mom and I were young.

392
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,560
We had so much to say to each other.

393
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,040
And even a little thing could make us so happy.

394
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,280
Me too.

395
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,430
Just seeing him can make me happy.

396
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,710
Dad,

397
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,680
how could you scam secret out of me like that?

398
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,470
I did not.

399
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,110
I've long known

400
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,350
your little secret.

401
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,310
You're texting Siyue, aren't you?

402
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,280
I'm 21 now.

403
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,950
I can have a relationship.

404
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,430
I'm here to tell you,

405
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,830
I watched Siyue grow up,

406
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,400
and I'm glad to see you two being together.

407
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,800
Thank you, dad.

408
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,310
You understand me.

409
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,560
But,

410
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,070
if your mom does something to you,

411
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,190
don't be mad.

412
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,110
You know her. She loves being a stickybeak.

413
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,920
Why would she be mad?

414
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,710
Alright, sleep early.

415
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,710
Drink them.

416
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,920
Mom.

417
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,430
You said you were going to make golden cakes.

418
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,800
Congee is good enough for you.

419
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,230
Congee is good.

420
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,470
Siyue.

421
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,880
Come on.

422
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,280
Have more.

423
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,040
You're still growing.

424
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,000
And you're so thin.

425
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,190
Thank you, aunt.

426
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,920
Don't peek.

427
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,040
You should also have more.

428
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,680
I'm already full, mom.

429
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,680
Well,

430
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
I remember

431
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,800
I must leave now for something important.

432
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,430
It's Spring Festival. What is so urgent?

433
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
School's affairs.

434
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,350
I heard there is a student...

435
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,590
Hello?

436
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,190
How's the breakfast, brother-in-law?

437
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,110
Mom has already known.

438
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,760
When did it begin?

439
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,070
Aunt.

440
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,710
We weren't together until last month.

441
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,040
You two kept it from me together.

442
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,190
Is it funny?

443
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,950
It's my fault, aunt.

444
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,470
I should have taken care of her earlier.

445
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,110
What have you done to my daughter?

446
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,880
What are you talking about?

447
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,950
No, aunt,

448
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,310
don't make me wrong.

449
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,920
I mean,

450
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,350
I have been

451
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,560
disappointing her for too long.

452
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
So I'll do my best

453
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,660
to offer her the best.

454
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,470
Don't be angry, mom.

455
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,800
I'm angry.

456
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

457
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,920
You told me that

458
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,470
I couldn't date anyone.

459
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,920
So I didn't tell you.

460
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,430
But you didn't tell me it was Siyue.

461
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,230
He is such a hard-working kid.

462
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,640
If you learn from him,

463
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,350
I will support you.

464
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,230
Aunt,

465
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,430
actually,

466
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,680
I should thank Ding Xian.

467
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,310
Without her,

468
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,110
maybe I'll still

469
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,520
live a depressing life.

470
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,800
Siyue.

471
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,470
It's nice that you and Xianxian can be happy.

472
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,760
She's my only daughter.

473
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,920
Please be nice to her.

474
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,520
You like golden cakes, don't you?

475
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,230
I've made for you.

476
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,400
Wait.

477
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,710
Are you still full?

478
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,710
I feel that I don't need to eat anything

479
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,830
in the next three days.

480
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,680
You're leaving again.

481
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,830
When can we spend Spring Festival together?

482
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,920
Professor Ye has a new program,

483
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,350
and I need to keep my parents' company.

484
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,920
I understand.

485
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,880
The proper business matters.

486
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,560
Be cheerful.

487
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,000
Alright, go home now.

488
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
Or your parents will worry about you.

489
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,070
I want to stay with you longer.

490
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,920
No,

491
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,350
or it will be too difficult for me to say goodbye.

492
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,190
Then, give me a hug.

493
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,590
Okay.

494
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,830
We'll see each other soon.

495
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,710
Hug me longer.

496
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,160
Hold me tighter.

497
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,070
The doctor said,

498
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,880
your father is in unstable condition.

499
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,640
Go and see him.

500
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,040
I want to go home.

501
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,950
When you've recovered,

502
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,070
we can go home.

503
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,350
Okay.

504
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,350
I'm aging.

505
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,110
Now I always recall the past.

506
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,800
I remember when you were a kid,

507
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,520
the art teacher

508
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,590
asked you to make bookmarks.

509
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,760
You didn't want to make them.

510
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,800
So, you picked up a leaf on your way home.

511
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,680
I remember it.

512
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,430
Teacher praised me at that time.

513
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,110
She said I was innovative.

514
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,000
However,

515
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,760
when I went back home,

516
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,560
you scolded me.

517
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,680
I rarely came back home,

518
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:30,470
but still left you unpleasant memories.

519
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,190
Actually, when I was little,

520
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,520
I envied Song Ziqi.

521
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,350
Whatever he did,

522
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,800
his dad would be there for him,

523
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,350
praised him

524
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,310
and encouraged him.

525
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,520
But when I was little,

526
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,070
you were strict to me.

527
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,560
You taught me that

528
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,880
I need to take on every responsibility.

529
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,880
Be excellent and independent.

530
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,590
I didn't understand back then.

531
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,470
So, I felt stressful,

532
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,110
tired and hard.

533
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,400
But now I understand it all.

534
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,310
If I can be a little help

535
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,230
for you and mom,

536
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,070
I'll be happy.

537
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,880
You wouldn't

538
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,590
say these things to me before.

539
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,590
You wouldn't listen to me, either.

540
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,000
Brat.

541
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,800
Hey, Shadi.

542
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,640
Hey, Xianxian.

543
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,950
Guess where we are.

544
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,830
Where are you?

545
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,070
Little Monster.

546
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,000
When did you come back?

547
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,110
Just today.

548
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,040
I heard that Keke came back too.

549
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,310
Come and hang out with us tomorrow.

550
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,430
Okay.

551
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,710
Which one do you want, Kong Shadi?

552
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,760
This one or that one? I'll hang up.

553
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,680
See you tomorrow.

554
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
What are you doing recently?

555
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,230
Enjoy.

556
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,950
I'm busy thinking about you.

557
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,420
Can you two stop whispering since we hang out for fun?

558
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,430
You can go out if you have a problem.

559
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,880
Alright, go on.

560
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,190
I'll pick the songs.

561
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,310
Keke!

562
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,350
Jiang Chen?

563
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,830
Why didn't you tell me earlier, brother?

564
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,590
I thought you wouldn't come back for the festival.

565
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
I wanted to surprise you.

566
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,350
Where is Zhou Siyue?

567
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,680
He went back to Jiangling to deal with somethings.

568
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,830
Don't mind him.

569
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,400
Today is our girls party.

570
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,800
Then why did you bring your man here?

571
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,880
Yeah.

572
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,760
He insisted on coming here with me.

573
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,280
And you're blaming me?

574
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,880
You brought your man too.

575
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,640
He is not my man.

576
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,280
I feel insecure when I go back home at night.

577
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,470
So, he's my bodyguard.

578
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,830
Bodyguard.

579
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,190
What's this?

580
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,520
Did you get her or not?

581
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,470
Don't mention it.

582
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,190
We're in same situations.

583
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,080
I'm not.

584
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,909
I heard that Zhou Ziyue had met your parents.

585
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,909
It's going pretty fast.

586
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,320
He did.

587
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,710
But,

588
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,670
I don't think anything is in progress.

589
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,120
What do you mean?

590
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,280
It feels we are still acting like we were in high school.

591
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,949
Nothing has changed.

592
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,800
Where exactly are you now?

593
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,630
We've held hands,

594
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,360
and kissed.

595
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,280
That's all?

596
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,190
I understand.

597
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,389
Does he still treat you as a kid?

598
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:00,630
Maybe.

599
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,800
Please be confident.

600
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,840
He is treating you as a kid.

601
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,230
You two

602
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,800
are nothing like a couple.

603
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,710
What took you so long?

604
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,520
I just finished the things at the laboratory.

605
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,190
Are you tired?

606
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,280
Ding Xian.

607
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,040
You must let him know

608
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,760
that you're a girl.

609
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,430
You need to tease him appropriately,

610
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,390
so that he wants to protect you.

611
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,190
Sweetheart,

612
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,950
I feel cold.

613
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,150
What's wrong?

614
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,120
I'm cold.

615
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,320
You don't have a fever.

616
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,280
I've been waiting you for so long.

617
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,390
Don't you think you should do something?

618
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,710
Wait.

619
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,600
Come on, it's still hot.

620
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,280
Warm your hands with it.

621
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,360
Do you feel better?

622
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,000
Let's grab some food after we put away the luggage.

623
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,150
Maybe not today.

624
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,470
A project in the laboratory

625
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,040
needs to be done soon.

626
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,280
Let me walk you to the dormitory.

627
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,040
Thanks.

628
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,800
But I need to go shopping.

629
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,190
Then I'm leaving now.

630
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,630
Ding Xian.

631
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,080
Are you really not going to have dinner?

632
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,320
No, I don't have any appetite.

633
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,710
Where's your boyfriend?

634
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
You haven't seen him for a vacation.

635
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,710
Don't you want to meet him?

636
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
He stays in the laboratory all the time.

637
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,710
I just met him,

638
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,150
and he went back again.

639
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,470
Is he so obsessed with academic research?

640
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,840
Go ahead.

641
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,760
We'll bring you snacks back.

642
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,800
Go.

643
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,000
We're leaving.

644
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,600
I'm done.

645
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm downstairs at your dormitory.

646
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,040
Studying?

647
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,430
Are you serious?

648
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,630
I heard that

649
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,870
in this semester,

650
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,520
Profess Wang's courses are troublesome.

651
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,320
I can help you prepare for them.

652
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,040
But I haven't had supper yet.

653
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,120
I've prepared it for you.

654
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,230
It's your favorite cake.

655
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,230
There's plenty of them for your roommates too.

656
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,470
But I want to have supper with you.

657
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,230
No need, I've had it.

658
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,600
Have you figured out

659
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,600
the question I explained to you last time?

660
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,630
This one.

661
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,760
No.

662
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,840
It's fine.

663
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,710
I'll do it first,

664
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,950
and think about this method.

665
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,710
D, C.

666
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,710
Professor Wang wants me to read a book,

667
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,870
but I can't find where it is.

668
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,630
What book?

669
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,870
Come and look for it with me.

670
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,630
What book?

671
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,910
Where is it?

672
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,320
What's the name?

673
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,670
Is it here?

674
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,040
I don't think so.

675
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,760
Here?

676
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,230
This one?

677
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,910
I'm back.

678
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,360
What's that?

679
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,080
Zhou Siyue bought it. He wanted us to share.

680
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,560
He's so sweet.

681
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,630
Why do you look so depressed?

682
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,190
It feels nothing has changed.

683
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,760
Is it because

684
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,800
you two are too familiar with each other?

685
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,040
Maybe as time goes,

686
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,470
you two don't feel fresh anymore.

687
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,800
Really?

688
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,910
What should I do then?

689
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,520
I think

690
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,710
you can change yourself.

691
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:40,910
Change myself?

692
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,630
Look.

693
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,280
I barely recognize you, you know that?

694
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,670
I thought it was our campus belle.

695
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,360
Yeah.

696
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,710
You want to find our boss?

697
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,710
He just left.

698
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,630
Then I'll go and find him.

699
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,600
Okay, bye.

700
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,430
I don't know why our boss is so lucky.

701
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,800
Good then.

702
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,280
Remember,

703
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,040
if you have anything you don't understand,

704
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,280
come and ask me.

705
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,040
If you have any problems in academic research...

706
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,000
Zhou Siyue!

707
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,040
Do you miss me?

708
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,150
I just saw you yesterday.

709
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,800
You should still miss me today.

710
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,280
Okay, I'm leaving.

711
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,280
Okay.

712
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,950
What's wrong?

713
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,470
Are you mad?

714
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,710
I know why you ignored me recently.

715
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,470
Did I say yes too quickly?

716
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,320
What is going on

717
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,840
in your little head?

718
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,000
That is

719
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,950
our software engineering teacher.

720
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,280
An elective subject.

721
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,040
An elective subject?

722
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,190
To get in her class,

723
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,910
Yuan Fang secretly changed my class schedule.

724
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,430
Why would I lie to you?

725
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,230
Why do you dress like this?

726
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,630
Is it pretty?

727
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,870
Yes.

728
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,320
But you might get arthritis dressing this way.

729
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,470
It's cold recently.

730
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,710
Wear pants next time.

731
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,710
Okay?

732
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,000
Why do you act like an old man?

733
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,390
What?

734
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,120
Did I say something wrong again?

735
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,520
Do you still treat me like a kid?

736
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,910
You always act like we were in high school.

737
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,630
You help me with lessons and take care of me.

738
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,630
But the relationship between us

739
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,560
has changed.

740
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,710
I want to stay with you every day.

741
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,470
I want you to compliment my dress.

742
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,280
And I want to hear you say you like me.

743
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,560
I'm sorry.

744
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,080
I'm too stupid.

745
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,390
I misunderstood you every day,

746
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,430
and ignored your feelings.

747
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,320
But I won't do that anymore.

748
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,470
I like you.

749
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,630
I like you a lot.

750
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,630
Then you know why I'm mad, don't you?

751
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,710
I know.

752
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,080
Come on.

753
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,670
Let's have lunch together.

754
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:09,910
Your cake.

755
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:10,520
Thank you.

756
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,120
You're welcome.

757
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,360
Come on.

758
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,040
Wait, I want to take a photo.

759
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,430
Okay.

760
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,430
Okay?

761
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,620
Take this.

762
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:35,950
Good?

763
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,000
Look.

764
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,720
Yeah.

765
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,230
Here we are.

766
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,120
Thank you for walking me here.

767
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:32,630
Alright.

768
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:33,840
Go up there.

769
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,520
I want a hug.

770
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,150
Okay.

771
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,760
Go.

772
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,000
I'll watch you leaving.

773
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,470
I'll watch you going upstairs.

774
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,670
You go first.

775
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,040
Come on, listen to me.

776
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,520
I'm leaving now.

777
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,470
I can't.

778
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:41,520
The door is locked.

779
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,000
If you can't go back,

780
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,470
you'll have to stay here for one night.

781
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,080
Wear these.

782
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,230
Take a seat.

783
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,280
I'll get you cleaning items.
