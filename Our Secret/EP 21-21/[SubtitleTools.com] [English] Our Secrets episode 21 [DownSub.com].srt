Our Secret
EP21

2
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,870
Su,

3
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,120
this original piece by Xianxian

4
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,270
is very good.

5
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,479
We can expand it into 200 episodes.

6
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,440
It won't be a problem.

7
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,870
We can also convert it into an animation,

8
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,080
or a game,

9
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,190
something like that.

10
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,000
Guaranteed to make a hit!

11
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,870
Director Zhang,

12
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,800
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,509
I can't sign the contract.

14
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,000
Director Zhang, Xianxian has never signed a contract before.

15
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,510
I think she needs some time to think.

16
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,190
Young lady,

17
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,550
you've made a promise.

18
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
How can you break it?

19
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,110
I'm really, really sorry.

20
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,000
The artists that I contract with on my comics app

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,240
are all very popular on Weibo.

22
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,190
If you refuse to work with me for your own reasons,

23
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,800
when words get out,

24
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,320
what do people think of you?

25
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,079
Director Zhang...

26
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,440
Young lady,

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,880
you need to learn right from wrong.

28
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,960
Sign it.

29
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,670
What's right and what's wrong?

30
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,670
Party A and party B.

31
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,240
Collaborating upon mutual consent.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,800
There's no reason for forced signing.

33
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,190
Zhou Siyue.

34
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,470
We're talking about Ding Xian's business here.

35
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm also doing this for Director Zhang's sake.

36
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,240
Signing a contract hastily before reaching an agreement,

37
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,030
if anything goes wrong with the project one day,

38
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,360
I don't think you'd want

39
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,670
people to talk about how you made a big mistake, right?

40
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,630
For this piece of work,

41
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,600
its greatest value is in Ding Xian herself.

42
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,390
It's what she's always had in her.

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,030
So from a business perspective,

44
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,520
Ding Xian

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,800
is not the best commodity for you, Director Zhang.

46
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,720
Come on.

47
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,000
Change your shoes.

48
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,600
Why did you bring a pair of shoes?

49
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,030
I got them by the road on my way here.

50
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,079
It's okay.

51
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,720
You look so good today.

52
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,670
Let me do it.

53
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,270
How did you know my feet hurt?

54
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,470
Because my feet hurt, too.

55
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,720
Do they fit?

56
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,950
Xianxian.

57
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,550
Xianxian, I don't quite understand.

58
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't you want other people to look up to you,

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,070
make a better life,

60
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,720
and become someone...

61
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,640
Su,

62
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,440
I just want to be the person I want to be.

63
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,040
I thought we were the same kind of people.

64
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,270
We used to be.

65
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,640
Su.

66
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,160
Director Zhang.

67
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,550
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,600
What happened today...

69
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,070
Don't worry about it.

70
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,790
I've given her the opportunity

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,230
for your sake.

72
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,950
I wonder why you help her so much.

73
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,880
If I'm not mistaken,

74
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,880
you like her?

75
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,640
Director Zhang, let me see you to the car.

76
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,390
Su,

77
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,480
women like this

78
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,110
love guys like you,

79
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,390
talented and rich.

80
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,440
Director Zhang,

81
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,720
I can't agree with what you said.

83
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,670
About the project this time,

84
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,760
I opt out.

85
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,510
I think

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,070
I dreamed of a scene like this.

87
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,600
You dreamed of me?

88
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,790
You were holding my hand like this in my dream.

89
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,920
At that time, I thought,

90
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,550
I'd never be with you.

91
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,390
So I had a lot of dreams about you.

92
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,270
I'm sorry, Ding Xian.

93
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,790
I promise you,

94
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,110
I won't ever hurt you again.

95
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,390
So,

96
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,600
how are you gonna explain to Xing Lufei?

97
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,720
It's none of her business.

98
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,670
She likes you.

99
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,480
It's none of my business.

100
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,270
Then should I talk to her...

101
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,320
It's none of your business.

102
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,350
Zhou Siyue,

103
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,070
you are avoiding my question.

104
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,390
I never thought,

105
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,920
that you would be nervous,

106
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,000
about people like Xing Lufei.

107
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,720
I never thought,

108
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,110
that you would be nervous about people like Su Bocong.

109
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,390
How am I nervous?

110
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,720
You're kidding.

111
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,880
Then who's the one,

112
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,920
feeling insecure just because

113
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,640
I talked a few words with him?

114
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,720
Ding Xian, I used to think,

115
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,440
I know what I want,

116
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,790
but then I found out,

117
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,230
if I don't have you in my world,

118
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,040
then everything is meaningless.

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,640
So, on the road ahead,

120
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,550
shall we walk together?

121
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,110
Zhou Siyue,

122
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,440
all these years,

123
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,790
I've never really changed.

124
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,390
If I say yes,

125
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,669
you'll never let me go again.

126
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,880
I promise you.

127
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,470
We will always,

128
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,080
be together.

129
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,470
This is correct, and...

130
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,030
there are sixteen rooms altogether, right?

131
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,640
Right.

132
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,280
And then this...

133
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,080
Zhou Siyue.

134
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,470
Boss, so,

135
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,030
when we were given awards,

136
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,200
this Mr. Chen from Hongguang Technology wanted you to contact him.

137
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,000
Right,

138
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,080
did your idea work?

139
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,590
I figured it out.

140
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,470
The meaning of my life is to eat.

141
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,400
I don't make super big bucks,

142
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,440
why should I work super hard?

143
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,550
Good morning.

144
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,550
Morning.

145
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,910
I'll take it myself.

146
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,440
Just get on the bus.

147
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,080
Hi.

148
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,790
I got it, I got it.

149
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,320
Please sit.

150
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,880
How about I go sit over there?

151
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,710
Just sit here.

152
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,520
Ding Xian,

153
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,520
have you finished the activity report of this Comic-con?

154
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,400
It should be out in our WeChat account today.

155
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,640
When did this become my responsibility?

156
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,080
On our meeting last night.

157
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,790
It was decided on the spot when you were absent.

158
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,790
Okay, I'll do it right away.

159
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,350
It's time to

160
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,640
give the report of the competition, right?

161
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,110
Dong Zhengfei,

162
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,670
you're the team leader but you don't work at all.

163
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,520
Shame on you.

164
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,110
Yuan Fang.

165
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,320
I'll write it. It's okay.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,080
You can get some sleep.

167
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,670
Thank you, Boss.

168
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,960
Could you help me get my bag?

169
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,280
Thank you.

170
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,400
Would you like some music?

171
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,840
I have finished the report.

172
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,960
And you?

173
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,590
Not yet.

174
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,440
You can get some sleep first.

175
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,550
Okay.

176
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,440
I didn't know that Zhou,

177
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,000
could be so gentle and considerate.

178
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,640
Me, neither.

179
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's go, Boss.

180
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,080
You can't read social cues at all.

181
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,320
Wake up.

182
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,670
Have we arrived yet?

183
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,470
Hello, Ms. Sun.

184
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,000
Ding Xian.

185
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,670
These last few episodes of "Shadows" are really good.

186
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,030
We thought about it,

187
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,670
and decided to update every three days.

188
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,670
If it's okay,

189
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,710
could you please send me a new draft tonight?

190
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,440
Tonight?

191
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,520
Yes, I want it tonight.

192
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I see.

193
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm gonna have to work on my draft.

194
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,760
See you then.

195
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,230
Zhou Siyue, would you like to have dinner together tonight?

196
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,710
It's okay if you don't want to eat. I know that there's a...

197
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,280
Can you stay away from me?

198
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,670
- See you. - See you.

199
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,880
Do you hate me so much?

200
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,030
I've been chasing you for so long.

201
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,590
Anyone can see, if he's not a fool.

202
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,000
Where am I not as good as her?

203
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,550
She is better than you in everything.

204
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,550
You're kidding me.

205
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,520
It was you who locked Ding Xian in the dressing room

206
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,280
the other day, isn't it?

207
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,440
Xing Lufei,

208
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,710
I'm telling you for the last time,

209
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Ding Xian is the only girl I like.

210
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,000
About the thing between you and Director Zhang,

211
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,790
I already heard.

212
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
Why were you so impulsive?

213
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,910
I'm sorry, Mr. Ma.

214
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,350
That was my fault.

215
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,960
I'll try to make up for it.

216
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,840
Su,

217
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,520
do you know why,

218
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,230
I chose you before,

219
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,470
and start a business together with you?

220
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,880
Because you're young,

221
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,000
and you already know what you want.

222
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,910
And you're so motivated,

223
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,910
with a calmness beyond your peers.

224
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,840
But now it seems that,

225
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,030
you're still too young.

226
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,640
Mr. Ma, I heard you.

227
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,920
Right.

228
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:39,280
I have a project at hand,

229
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,760
that needs someone in charge to follow up.

230
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,430
Since you happen to have time,

231
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,520
I'll give this project to you.

232
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,000
Boss,

233
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,190
waiting for Xianxian's message?

234
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,280
I can't believe you've also come to this.

235
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,070
I guess it's fair luck after all.

236
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,070
I don't seem to remember you getting lucky once, have you?

237
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,310
You're so mean!

238
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,470
Professor Ye.

239
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,560
Siyue.

240
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,800
Mr. Chen of Hongguang Technology came to me yesterday.

241
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,800
He's interested in your robot,

242
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,190
and wanted to work with our team.

243
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,920
Mr. Chen of Hongguang Technology?

244
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,470
Right.

245
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,350
I think I kind of remember him.

246
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,230
I remembered.

247
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,160
It was at the last robot contest,

248
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,110
at the award ceremony,

249
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,070
he asked me to hand over his business card to you.

250
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,040
So what exactly does their company do?

251
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
You don't know?

252
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,680
Hongguang Technology is currently the most authoritative

253
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,760
intelligent robot company in China.

254
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,710
Their main products are

255
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,520
humanoid intelligent robots.

256
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,190
Professor Ye.

257
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,920
I don't really want to work with them.

258
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,400
Are you out of your mind?

259
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,110
Working with Hongguang is not only profitable,

260
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,350
but also you get to collaborate with the top teams in the country.

261
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,920
You're giving up this great opportunity like this?

262
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,470
What are you thinking?

263
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,190
Indeed, Hongguang Technology is very good.

264
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,350
It might even be

265
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,110
our best option at the moment.

266
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,680
But why,

267
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,680
why does a high-end technology company,

268
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,830
want to work with a team of sophomores?

269
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,470
What's more, the robot technology we have

270
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,560
is not perfected.

271
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,400
It does not have a relatively clear direction for application.

272
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,880
But

273
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,040
that doesn't mean we won't make progress.

274
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,760
So that's the problem.

275
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,710
Obviously they can go to more accomplished teams,

276
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,470
with more mature performance and techniques.

277
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,230
Or wait for us to grow,

278
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,350
and then come and cooperate with us.

279
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,110
With the timing that they come to us,

280
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,640
I suspect that the cooperation is just an excuse.

281
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,590
Their real purpose

282
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,160
is to buy out our patents.

283
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
But a buy-out of our patents,

284
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,280
doesn't sound like a bad thing currently, does it?

285
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,110
When we're not sure about whether we share

286
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,160
similar ideas for a cooperation,

287
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,000
selling out our patents would mean,

288
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,110
that we hand over the results

289
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,400
of our year-long research.

290
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,190
Are you willing to do that?

291
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,280
Professor Ye.

292
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,280
I think you should reconsider it.

293
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,800
If Zhou Siyue's not willing to,

294
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,190
I can lead our team and work with Hongguang.

295
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,470
I'll think about it.

296
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,160
Bye, Professor.

297
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,310
After a whole night of working on my draft,

298
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,710
it's so nice to finally get to enjoy some nice food.

299
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,070
Aren't you tired?

300
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,760
Not really.

301
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,230
I like drawing.

302
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,520
So I'm not tired.

303
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,950
It's just...

304
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,280
I ate too much.

305
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,280
Too much?

306
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,640
You ate too much, but you're still buying so many snacks?

307
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,230
For a girl,

308
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,950
we don't use the same stomach for eating dinner and eating snacks.

309
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,350
Is there anything else you want to eat?

310
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,310
I want ice cream.

311
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,040
Isn't that cold?

312
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,800
I'll just take a bite if you buy one.

313
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,350
What about the rest?

314
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,560
You'll finish it.

315
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,560
No I'm not.

316
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,520
Come on!

317
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,760
What flavor do you want?

318
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,430
Blueberry.

319
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,000
Blueberry.

320
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,920
It's so cold.

321
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,400
Just don't eat if it's cold.

322
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,070
No, this is delicious.

323
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,350
Can't be wasted.

324
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,280
Would you like some?

325
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,190
No, it's all yours.

326
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,040
You don't want to eat my leftover?

327
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,400
It's so cold.

328
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,520
Isn't it delicious?

329
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,880
It is good.

330
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,230
I have work to do in my lab.

331
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,880
Why don't you go back first?

332
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,000
So I'll go back to the studio then.

333
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,110
Okay.

334
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,280
See you.

335
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,950
You shouldn't come see her anymore.

336
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,680
What if I'm here for you?

337
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,950
This is a young team from Hua Qing.

338
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,310
They just won the championship in the robot contest.

339
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,110
And they were targeted by Hongguang.

340
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,040
You should get in touch with them.

341
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,040
Talk to them.

342
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,680
Do you want to,

343
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,830
scout them?

344
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,110
It's not them that I want.

345
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,400
I want to know what Hongguang's been up to.

346
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,920
Oh,

347
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,880
I have this document here,

348
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,230
that's maybe of help to you.

349
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,710
I'm flattered,

350
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,680
but I'm just a student.

351
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,760
I'm not planning on working with any company just yet.

352
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,590
Not working with us,

353
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,950
but working with Hongguang.

354
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,400
You want me to hack information from Hongguang?

355
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,880
I didn't expect you people can

356
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,040
do anything by fair means or foul just for making money.

357
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,000
I still hope that you could consider.

358
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,040
There's no need for further discussion between us.

359
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,470
I won't do anything illegal.

360
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,950
You'd be embarrassing yourself.

361
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,280
Why don't you take a look at this before you make a decision?

362
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,680
With your health situation,

363
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,520
I keep telling you to walk outside more often, and you just wouldn't listen.

364
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,400
You'd rather stay in the room.

365
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,470
Whenever I walk around,

366
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,230
my brain will be packed with ideas.

367
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,160
Reading brings me some peace.

368
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,230
I won't do anything illegal.

369
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,430
You'd be embarrassing yourself.

370
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,350
Why don't you take a look at this before you decide?

371
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,880
We've found out

372
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,160
the man who set your father up.

373
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,470
Siyue, you're here.

374
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,350
No classes at school?

375
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,560
Class is over.

376
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,760
Here.

377
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,880
Are you feeling any better?

378
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,950
Much better.

379
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,920
I heard that,

380
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,760
you won a prize again.

381
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Well done.

382
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,950
That's because of your teachings.

383
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,400
Here, have some water.

384
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,190
I'm sorry, dad.

385
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,470
What, you're in trouble?

386
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,760
I'm just...

387
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,520
sorry that I got you worried.

388
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,760
Your mom and I know,

389
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,310
that you're always

390
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,310
a very good boy.

391
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,070
We never worry about you making mistakes.

392
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,430
Whatever you want to do,

393
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,680
just go ahead and do it.

394
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,880
Don't worry.

395
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,230
But what if that thing

396
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,000
takes sacrifices?

397
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,950
It always takes sacrifices.

398
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,000
Doesn't it?

399
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,230
If it didn't happen to us,

400
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,040
I never knew,

401
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,520
that we,

402
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,400
could be such a happy family.

403
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,400
Mark my words,

404
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,190
no matter what happens,

405
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,520
as long as think it through for yourself, go for it.

406
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,590
I have no regrets.

407
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,760
I just want my son,

408
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,760
to have no regrets, either.

409
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,950
You're gonna recover.

410
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,070
I will.

411
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,560
It's such a simple thing.

412
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,310
Have you even put any effort in it?

413
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,800
It's so great to be rich.

414
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,760
You can even buy the truth.

415
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,520
But I still refuse.

416
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,190
You won't do it now,

417
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,920
but it doesn't mean you won't do it in the future.

418
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,110
She loves you for your honesty and integrity now,

419
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,800
but one day you're gonna bow before reality.

420
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,640
By that time,

421
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,590
do you think,

422
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,880
that she'll still love you?

423
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,000
I am not the same kind of person like you.

424
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
For me?

425
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,350
Now that the shoes are delivered,

426
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
I'll see you later.

427
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,280
What's the rush?

428
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Let's take a look.

429
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,590
How do you like them?

430
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,800
Not bad.

431
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,880
You've got eyes for these.

432
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,710
Of course.

433
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,470
You gotta see who bought them.

434
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,830
Why did you transfer so much?

435
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,000
Of course.

436
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,590
I can't take advantage of you.

437
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,760
Then forget it.

438
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,950
I can't take this.

439
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,110
I've earned money lately.

440
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,710
I got paid 4,000 yuan for this draft.

441
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,110
I feel it's easy for me to make money.

442
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,920
How about this? In the future, you stay home,

443
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,950
and I'll go earn the bread.

444
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,040
You see, you've been so busy lately.

445
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,520
I feel bad for you.

446
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,400
Look at that smugly face of yours.

447
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,800
Happy about earning this little money.

448
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,400
4,000 yuan is not a little.

449
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,920
Plus,

450
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,680
I earn money with my own hands.

451
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,880
I don't cheat or

452
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,680
compromise to the reality.

453
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,880
Let me ask you a question.

454
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,190
What if...

455
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,400
one day you found me changed

456
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,040
into a person not knowing right from wrong,

457
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
what would you do?

458
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,880
Why are you asking that?

459
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,880
Are you in a bad mood?

460
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,560
No.

461
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,000
So?

462
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,160
Is it because of the contest?

463
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,230
No.

464
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Your experiment?

465
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,880
I asked you first,

466
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,160
you gotta answer me first.

467
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,640
Don't forget to stay true to yourself.

468
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,710
I can't imagine

469
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,830
what you would be like if you change.

470
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,760
Hello.

471
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,350
Ding Xian, we've got some copyright issue

472
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,560
with the novel adapted from your comics.

473
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,710
Director Su,

474
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,950
about that blogger of the "Little Monster Diaries",

475
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,230
I think she's in trouble.

476
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,760
Hello, Director Sun.

477
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,560
Director Sun.

478
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,800
Please have a seat.

479
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,070
Regarding the copyright of "Shadows",

480
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,880
what's the deal with that?

481
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,680
About that copyright,

482
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,280
I'm sorry I didn't make things clear for you.

483
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,680
Look at Article 39.

484
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,710
After the copyright of "Shadows" expires,

485
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,640
the copyright of "Shadows",

486
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,520
should be owned by the artist and the Dream Journey Press.

487
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,590
Dream Journey has the right to the final interpretation.

488
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,950
That's why you shared the copyright with me?

489
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,310
So that I'd share

490
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,800
the risk of infringement?

491
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,830
You can go ask around.

492
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,000
Nowadays, no publishing agency

493
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,640
would share the copyright with their artists.

494
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
The reason we're doing this

495
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,710
is for your own good.

496
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,470
But you hid the expiration of the copyright from me!

497
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,280
It's clearly written in the contract.

498
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,470
The profits they made out of the "Shadows" comics,

499
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,230
is totally enough for Dream Journey Publishing

500
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,160
to cover the compensation easily.

501
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,110
I get minimal pay for my work,

502
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,430
but I have to take on half of the compensation.

503
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,350
They've planned it all along.

504
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,160
They made a trap and wait for me to jump in.

505
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,310
It's all right.

506
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,230
It's inevitable to be fooled when you are new in the business.

507
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,920
But when they asked you

508
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,430
to share the copyright,

509
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,230
weren't you suspecting at all?

510
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,110
I didn't think that much.

511
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,710
I thought that there are

512
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,520
always good people in the world.

513
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,950
How silly!

514
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,920
Right.

515
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,190
You are the smartest.

516
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,230
Here.

517
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,520
Have a cup of coffee.

518
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,150
Take it easy.

519
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,000
Your latte art

520
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,280
is so bad!

521
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm not professional.

522
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,520
Try it yourself if you're that good.

523
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,670
Why not?

524
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,600
Do it.

525
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,870
How should I start?

526
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,320
Hold the coffee in your left hand,

527
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,190
and hold the milk in your right hand.

528
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,120
Pour slowly little by little from this angle.

529
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,389
Don't rush.

530
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,630
What?

531
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,520
I see that now. I'll do it myself.

532
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,120
Here.

533
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,230
You're adding too much sugar?

534
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,040
The coffee is too bitter. I prefer the sweet.

535
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:06,840
Give me a sec.

536
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,670
Here.

537
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,840
Wait.

538
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,470
You take a bite of this,

539
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,710
and then try a sip of coffee.

540
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,280
How is it?

541
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,360
Delicious.

542
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,120
Wait.

543
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,710
Got a stamp on you.

544
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,520
Are you happy now?

545
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,710
Thank you for cheering me up.

546
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,870
So what are you going to do next?

547
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,320
I want to talk to the original author.

548
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,280
It is best to settle this in private.

549
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,840
But there is another thing that is also very important.

550
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,630
You are also a victim of this.

551
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,000
So,

552
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,840
while you talk to the original author,

553
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,470
you'd better also look for

554
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,560
any evidence that the publisher lied to you.

555
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,080
Do you have the contract you signed

556
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,280
or chat records or anything like that?

557
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,430
I'll help you.

558
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,560
I can do it myself.

559
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,000
I know you're worried about me.

560
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,120
But I also have to learn

561
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,870
to solve problems by myself.

562
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,360
Okay.

563
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,910
But what if you can't find any evidence?

564
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,190
Then I'll pay for the compensation.

565
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,120
How much is that?

566
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,910
500,000 yuan.

567
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,630
Don't worry. It's not gonna get that far.

568
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,950
At the worst,

569
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,950
you could hire me.

570
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:30,910
Professor Ye.

571
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,910
I think I should see Mr. Chen of Hongguang.

572
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,870
Have you been waiting for a long time?

573
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,600
Give me.

574
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,470
No.

575
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,670
Sorry.

576
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,430
It's okay.

577
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,040
I saw your performance

578
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,190
at the competition.

579
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,910
But

580
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,000
you rejected me before,

581
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,360
didn't you?

582
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,520
Yes.

583
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,600
I thought,

584
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,950
that I didn't share the same ideas as you.

585
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,870
So I chose to refuse.

586
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,630
Then why now,

587
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,670
you come to me?

588
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,230
Because I need money.

589
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,000
You are very straight-forward.

590
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,000
To be honest,

591
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,760
before,

592
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:27,190
I just wanted to buy out your robot patent.

593
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,390
But now I've changed my mind.

594
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,040
I want your patent

595
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,230
plus a two-year contract after your graduation.

596
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,470
Name your price.

597
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,560
500,000 yuan.

598
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,470
Si Yue.

599
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,560
If it's okay,

600
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,040
I want the money now.

601
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,000
Don't be so hasty, young man,

602
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,870
we still have to wait,

603
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,120
for the procedures of the contract, don't we?

604
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,360
Okay.

605
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,040
Then I'll be waiting.

606
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,040
Hello?

607
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,910
Hello, Ding Xian.

608
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,800
I've got your 500,000 yuan.

609
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,670
I'll clarify the plagiarism case for you

610
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,520
on Weibo in a moment.

611
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,470
Don't worry.

612
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,870
But I didn't send you any money.

613
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,280
A gentleman contacted me yesterday,

614
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,560
saying that he'll help you with the money.

615
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,630
Don't you know that?

616
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,280
So... could you tell me,

617
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,470
the name of that man?

618
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,390
Su,

619
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,710
I've been looking all over for you.

620
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,600
Xianxian,

621
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,600
why are you here?

622
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,910
Thank you for paying the money for me.

623
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,630
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

624
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,190
That's...

625
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,000
That's the only thing I can do for you.

626
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,470
Su, are you all right?

627
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,120
Are you okay?

628
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,470
I'm okay. I'm okay.

629
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,390
I'm okay. Just go. See you later.

630
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,840
It's okay. You don't have to worry about me. I'm okay.

631
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,710
What can I do?

632
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,320
Maybe I should just get you home first?

633
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,710
Su.

634
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,000
Su.

635
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,190
Can you get up?

636
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,390
Be careful!

637
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,630
Where are you going, young lady?

638
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,190
Just a minute, sir.

639
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,840
Su.

640
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,950
Su, where do you live?

641
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,320
Su?

642
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,320
Jiangnan Avenue.

643
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,230
Jiangnan Avenue.

644
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,320
All right.

645
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,430
Here we are, young lady.

646
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,760
Su.

647
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,190
Wake up!

648
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,390
Jiangnan Avenue and?

649
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,630
Hey, young lady, are you getting off or not?

650
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,560
What should I do?

651
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,280
Su, we're there.

652
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,600
You...

653
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,710
Su, you are too heavy!

654
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:42,800
Su.

655
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,150
You're drunk!

656
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,630
If I weren't drunk,

657
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,150
I'd never be able to say this.

658
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:09,710
Ding Xian,

659
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,710
I love you.

660
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:19,710
Su.

661
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,360
I'm already in a relationship.

662
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,520
I see.

663
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,360
Sorry about that.

664
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,230
You should go home and get some rest.

665
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,190
Zhou Siyue.

666
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,120
Zhou Siyue.

667
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:29,800
Director Su,

668
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,280
there is someone waiting for you in your office.

669
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:45,840
Zhou Siyue.

670
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,280
There is 500,000 yuan in this card.

671
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,390
The password is Ding Xian's birthday.

672
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:11,630
Please tell Xianxian,

673
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,670
I'm sorry.

674
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,800
What did you do to her?

675
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:25,470
I am warning you.

676
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:28,760
Leave her alone!

677
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,600
I'm about to lose my patience.
