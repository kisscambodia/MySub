Our Secret
EP19

2
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,160
Is it here?

3
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,680
Are you sure that you got rid of them?

4
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,550
I seem to hear Song Ziqi's voice.

5
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,910
This is not something we can afford to be careless about.

6
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,229
If she appears at the door the next moment,

7
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,630
I'd die, no kidding.

8
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,310
Seriously.

9
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,000
You have no idea

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,630
that I have not slept well for the past few days.

11
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,360
I have nightmares every night.

12
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,270
It's here, I think.

13
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:29,870
Zhou Siyue

14
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,190
Song Ziqi, open the door.

15
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,310
Song Ziqi, open the door.

16
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,000
I know you're here.

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,720
Don't hide in there and not speak!

18
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,000
Song Ziqi

19
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,110
Open the door.

20
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,360
Shut up.

21
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,720
Song Ziqi

22
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,030
Song Ziqi. Get the heck out.

23
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,550
I know you are here.

24
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,240
Come out now.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,270
You are being suspended, so what?

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you have to hide here and get so sullen about it?

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,520
Get out of the bathroom!

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,320
Hello.

29
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,670
You douchebag! You...

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,030
There's no need to...

31
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,910
Don't stop me.

32
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,670
Shadi, calm down first.

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,670
You two get out.

34
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,470
I want to talk to him alone.

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,550
No...

36
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,360
No, you...

37
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,440
How about

38
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,160
I take you back to school?

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,440
My bag is still in there.

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,240
I'd better wait outside.

41
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,160
Can't you go easy on me?

42
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,270
If you hurt me, I won't be able to become a pilot.

43
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,240
You still want to be a pilot?

44
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,550
Aren't you trying to stay away from everyone?

45
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,829
Aren't you running away?

46
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,630
You didn't pick up your phone.

47
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,800
Your QQ is off-line.

48
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,000
And you just sent me a message,

49
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,600
telling me that I should never try to find you.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,360
Song Ziqi, who do you think you are?

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,240
Why did you treat me like that?

52
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,030
I am sorry.

53
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,390
Sorry?

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,550
You are just being suspended.

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,829
Big deal?

56
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,670
Do you need to avoid me like the plague?

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,160
Calm down.

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,510
I can't calm down.

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,550
Can't you just man up?

60
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,440
You said you wanted to be with me.

61
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,720
You said you wanted to be a pilot.

62
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,320
And it was you who insisted on our long-distance relationship.

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,830
And now, something went wrong.

64
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,270
All you want to do is to hide. Not dare to confront it.

65
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,070
Song Ziqi, are you still a man?

66
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,110
Enough!

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,880
Ding Xian

68
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,670
Actually...

69
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,920
Sweet potatoes.

70
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,200
Boss, give me a sweet potato please.

71
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,350
Ten yuan for two.

72
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,440
Okay.

73
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,200
I forgot my bag.

74
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,390
You forgot to bring your money?

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,160
Young man, your girlfriend doesn't have money with her.

76
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,950
Come and pay!

77
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,600
Song Ziqi

78
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,760
I miss you.

79
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,270
Go back.

80
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,440
I'm late for the flight already.

81
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,000
Then catch the next one.

82
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,720
Are you kidding me?

83
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,440
Go back, please.

84
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,920
I am not going back.

85
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,510
I can't let you run away anymore.

86
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,790
So, are you here to save me?

87
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,110
I...

88
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,790
I came for the money!

89
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,760
What money?

90
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,040
100 yuan for a kiss.

91
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,160
You can count how many times you kissed me.

92
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,640
Hold on.

93
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,670
Enough?

94
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,480
If it is not enough, I will give you my credit card.

95
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,920
Take it.

96
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
You douchebag!

97
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,760
Thank you.

98
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,440
I will pay you back later.

99
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,670
No need.

100
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,230
Shadi

101
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,110
Did you see Shadi?

102
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,110
Isn't she inside?

103
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,040
No, she just rushed out.

104
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,760
Did you see her?

105
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,830
No.

106
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,350
Call her.

107
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,640
She won't pick up.

108
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,600
What are you guys doing?

109
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,270
Shadi

110
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,070
I am sorry. It was my fault.

111
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,000
I wasn't thinking straight. That wasn't me.

112
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,110
I am sorry, Shadi.

113
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,000
Song Ziqi, let go of me.

114
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,880
No, I won't.

115
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,790
No.

116
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,350
You don't know anything but running around.

117
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,880
If something really happens to you,

118
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,070
I...

119
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,470
What about you?

120
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:08,789
I don't know.

121
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,880
If Ding Xian is really not around me anymore,

122
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,110
I think I will be so scared.

123
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,550
Let me do it.

124
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,110
No need for the courtesy with me.

125
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,200
I am leaving. Don't cry alone

126
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,790
in the basement.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,030
You should speak out

128
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,790
the things you need to say.

129
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,320
Got it.

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,520
Xianxian, I miss you so much.

131
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Me too.

132
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,670
Maybe you guys should stay for two more days.

133
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
That's not okay.

134
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,230
If we stay for two more days, Song Ziqi will run away again.

135
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,470
And,

136
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,200
we should let him get back and apologize to his parents at least.

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,030
I don't think he'll dare to do it again.

138
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,280
Rest assured.

139
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,470
Then, you...

140
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,350
Zhou Siyue,

141
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,110
if anything happens to Xianxian,

142
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,520
I will come back and get you.

143
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,030
Don't worry.

144
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,440
She'll not get lost.

145
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,590
Glad to hear it.

146
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,760
You, come over.

147
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,960
What?

148
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,200
So, are we good now?

149
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,440
Are you dreaming?

150
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,110
How long have I been searching for you?

151
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,590
You need to make it up to me twice as much.

152
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,640
We are leaving now.

153
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,110
Be safe. Bye.

154
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,320
Don't cry.

155
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,470
Hurry up.

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,790
Take care.

157
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,000
Let me take you back to school.

158
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,080
No need. I can walk back to school myself.

159
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,470
I'd leave now.

160
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,470
If you are busy in school,

161
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,840
you don't need to come here so frequently.

162
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,790
Your mom and I are fine.

163
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,280
I can spare some time.

164
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,760
Right.

165
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,840
Ding Xian is also in Hua Qing now.

166
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,710
I like this girl.

167
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,590
She has a spirit.

168
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,200
Extraordinary.

169
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,760
I'm holding you up.

170
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,030
I didn't mean that.

171
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,670
It is just that I don't think it is the right time yet.

172
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,960
What do you mean, "not the right time"?

173
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,280
When is the right time then?

174
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,760
When I was young,

175
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,110
I needed to go to Jiangling to teach.

176
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,200
I wanted to take you and your mom with me.

177
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,030
But your mom,

178
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,200
since she was used to living a stable life,

179
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,030
she didn't want to move around with me.

180
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,000
I thought that as a family,

181
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,640
we shouldn't live separately in two different places.

182
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,590
But she was stubborn.

183
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,440
She wouldn't agree no matter what.

184
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,960
In the end, we dropped this matter.

185
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,440
Regarding this,

186
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,790
we have argued

187
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
for many times.

188
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,280
I used to think

189
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,670
that she wouldn't be able to carry on in Shenhai,

190
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,550
raising you all by herself.

191
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,590
She would come to me one day.

192
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,670
Only later did I find out

193
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,030
that I had underestimated her.

194
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,550
Not only did she bring you up,

195
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,670
but also raised you to be such an excellent man.

196
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,440
I don't know, for so many years,

197
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,760
how much she has been through

198
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,110
and how much she has suffered.

199
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,880
Not until this accident

200
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,880
did it dawn on me

201
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,230
that your mom has always been

202
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,960
a capable woman.

203
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,000
In order to take care of me,

204
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,520
she put away the obsession for so many years

205
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,880
and came to Jiangling,

206
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,440
busy around without a single complaint.

207
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,520
Every time,

208
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,910
I see her sleep when she is exhausted,

209
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,590
I would think,

210
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,470
why did I have to come to Jiangling

211
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,440
to be a professor?

212
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,670
Why did I

213
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,080
have to keep her waiting for me?

214
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,710
Let's get inside.

215
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,280
There is a draft here.

216
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,000
You may catch a cold.

217
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,520
I believe,

218
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,640
wherever my son goes,

219
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,350
he will be successful.

220
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,670
But I don't want you

221
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,280
to find

222
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,470
that you are all alone

223
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,910
after you succeed.

224
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,840
Don't make your mom and me

225
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,670
an excuse of your own business.

226
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,470
We are great.

227
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,000
You don't need to worry about us.

228
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,000
Alright.

229
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,000
Go back if you don't have other things.

230
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,840
Boss,

231
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,520
you finally admit.

232
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,230
I knew it! You have feelings for Ding Xian all along!

233
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,640
Fine.

234
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:45,589
Just tell me whether you will help me or not.

235
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,430
Of course.

236
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
I am good at chasing girls.

237
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,560
Hello, guys.

238
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,710
We are Love Chasing League from now on.

239
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,560
Then I am Love.

240
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,950
I am Chasing.

241
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,800
You are League.

242
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,000
I'd be brain-damaged to ask you two for help.

243
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,760
Hurry.

244
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,190
Don't rush.

245
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,110
I have already learned

246
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,040
that members of the Anime Club are going to participate

247
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,520
in a Comic-con in Huai City.

248
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,190
And there is a great amusement park in Huai City.

249
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,190
Amusement park, great idea.

250
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,000
You see.

251
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,710
You can grab her hand when you're on the roller coaster.

252
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,520
Go to the haunted house.

253
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,040
When she gets scared in the haunted house, she'll hug you.

254
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,760
Last time I took Kong Shadi there,

255
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,230
she screamed and hugged me right away.

256
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,110
What are you talking about?

257
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,350
I am out now.

258
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,400
Boss.

259
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,590
Are you still chasing love now?

260
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,070
Yes.

261
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,710
Come in.

262
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,830
Mr. Su.

263
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,880
About the science expo of Robot Competition in Huai City,

264
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,190
its exhibits have already been prepared.

265
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,310
Please take a look.

266
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,950
Have you booked the ticket to Huai City?

267
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,800
Yes, nine o'clock tomorrow night.

268
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,830
Reschedule it to the morning.

269
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,070
Okay.

270
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,280
Thanks.

271
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,830
Get on quickly. Okay.

272
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,830
Sorry, Lou Feng.

273
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,400
Ji Hang happened to have other things to do.

274
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,160
So we asked for your help.

275
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,350
That's okay. I am free, anyway.

276
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,190
I just took it as a free trip.

277
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,400
Alright, then I should get on first.

278
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,110
Hurry.

279
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,800
Good morning, Lou Feng.

280
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,710
Do you know why the head of the Anime Club

281
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,920
doesn't come this time?

282
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,640
Isn't it because he has other business to do?

283
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,310
Are you silly?

284
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,280
Can't you tell that he likes Xing Lufei?

285
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,190
I heard that Ji Hang

286
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,310
has a crush on her Xing Lufei for years.

287
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,710
But he can only watch her

288
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,880
falling in love with other people again and again.

289
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,310
And some time ago, he confessed his love to her.

290
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,160
Guess what?

291
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,430
What?

292
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,830
Xing said,

293
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,160
"I thought we were good friends."

294
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,640
Good morning.

295
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,830
Morning, Yuan Fang.

296
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,680
Good morning.

297
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,470
Xianxian.

298
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,280
Do you need my help?

299
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,000
No.

300
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,430
I want some.

301
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Here you go.

302
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,950
Xing Lufei is really something.

303
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,950
Doesn't she keep harassing your Zhou?

304
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,680
You need to be careful.

305
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,470
Speak of the devil.

306
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,800
Why are you here?

307
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,880
There are only five members in the robot team.

308
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,350
That's okay.

309
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,710
I have talked to Professor Ye.

310
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,470
I thought you wouldn't come today.

311
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,830
Zhou Siyue,

312
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
how do you know that I am going to Huai City?

313
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,590
No, it is not because of you.

314
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,950
Boss comes because of...

315
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,190
Xing Lufei

316
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,760
is really obsessed with Zhou.

317
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,070
Let's go.

318
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,830
Zhou Siyue, have an apple.

319
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,590
No, thanks. I am not hungry.

320
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,560
You are not hungry now, but you can still save it for tonight.

321
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,110
Here you are.

322
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,520
Xing

323
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,760
Have you heard of

324
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
an old saying?

325
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,920
What?

326
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,190
Apples should be eaten in the morning.

327
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,310
In the morning, the apple you eat is a golden one.

328
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,520
In the afternoon, it becomes a silver one.

329
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,350
At night,

330
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,640
it becomes a poisonous one.

331
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,880
That's too far-fetched.

332
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,830
That's real.

333
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,800
An old man in our village liked to eat apples at night.

334
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,710
Later...

335
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,800
What happened later?

336
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,800
Later,

337
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,310
he died.

338
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,310
Nonsense.

339
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,230
Fine.

340
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,000
Aren't you sleepy?

341
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,040
Take some sleep.

342
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,160
We are here.

343
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,760
I am so hungry now.

344
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,310
Let's go.

345
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,000
Instant noodles with an egg, bad luck comes to an end.

346
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,040
The weather is so nice today.

347
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,040
I want to have a spicy chicken burger.

348
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,640
Sure.

349
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,680
Xianxian.

350
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,110
Who is this? Why did he call you "Xianxian"?

351
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,000
He was a senior in my high school.

352
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,230
Su

353
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,310
Bocong, you are here so early?

354
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,830
The rooms for the Anime Club

355
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,110
have been arranged properly.

356
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,590
You can just bring in your luggage and check in.

357
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,000
Thanks.

358
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,000
Xianxian, Bocong is not only handsome and rich,

359
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,560
but also favors you.

360
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,400
You should not let the chance slip away.

361
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,350
I'd better get inside first.

362
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,040
- Are you tired? - I'm fine.

363
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
I can carry it myself.

364
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,560
Su

365
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
What are the odds?

366
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,110
Long time no see.

367
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,280
Your job covers quite a wide range now.

368
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,400
You need to receive the guests too?

369
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,110
I am here for Xianxian.

370
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,680
Right, the Robot Competition you join

371
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,560
is sponsored by Red Horse.

372
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,350
Red Horse seems to always be like this,

373
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
getting involved in everything.

374
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,950
But you need to have strength to get involved.

375
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,560
I am looking forward to your performance in the competition.

376
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,800
You don't need to worry about that.

377
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,400
Yuan Fang

378
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,230
Hurry up.

379
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,880
-Here. -Xianxian, have you eaten yet?

380
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,560
I know.

381
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,710
Not yet.

382
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,280
It is shameless to keep harassing others!

383
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,710
What are you talking about?

384
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,640
Sorry about that.

385
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,710
I arrived. I'll call you later.

386
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,000
Are you Mr. Su of Red Horse Tech?

387
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,310
You are?

388
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,040
You can give my luggage to me.

389
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,430
I am going inside now. I'll leave you guys to your business.

390
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,830
Let's go.

391
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,000
Hello.

392
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,830
Excuse me for a moment.

393
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,190
Xianxian.

394
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,230
Do you want to have dinner with me tonight?

395
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,560
It is probably not okay tonight.

396
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,000
I need to beat the deadline of the draft.

397
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,000
That's okay. I'll ask the hotel to bring you dinner.

398
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,400
By the way, my room number is 902.

399
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,520
You can find me whenever you want.

400
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,760
- Sure. - Go get some rest.

401
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,000
Bye bye.

402
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,560
Bye bye.

403
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,680
He even told you his room number,

404
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,110
and you said he is just a senior of your old school?

405
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,800
Yeah.

406
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,880
Mr. Su, hello.

407
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,680
Hello.

408
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,190
I heard that Red Horse Tech is sponsoring this competition.

409
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,520
And I have always looked forward to meeting you.

410
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,520
It never occurs to me that I can meet you here.

411
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,950
This is my name card.

412
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,880
I am sorry, but I have something to do now.

413
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,520
Let's talk in details later.

414
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,230
Sure.

415
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,430
Zhou Siyue of Hua Qing Scientific Research Group?

416
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,310
It is me.

417
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,830
Hello, Professor Ye called me just now.

418
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,590
He asked me to discuss things about the competition with you.

419
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,110
Sure. No problem.

420
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,310
Can I have your phone number?

421
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,000
For contact. Is that okay?

422
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,800
Sure.

423
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,070
It seems that no matter where a handsome guy goes,

424
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,560
he can get special treatment.

425
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,680
Are you finished?

426
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,040
That's it.

427
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,000
Okay. Thanks.

428
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,640
Please rest well.

429
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,880
- Bye. - Hello.

430
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,950
I am Yuan Fang.

431
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,470
What are you doing?

432
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Full.

433
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,000
Not yet.

434
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,760
Now it is full.

435
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,560
What plan do you have for tomorrow?

436
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,760
I'll take you to a place.

437
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,760
What are you trying to do?

438
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,470
I want to date you.

439
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,000
I am not available tomorrow.

440
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,310
Not available at any time.

441
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,590
Fine.

442
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,560
Then tell me where you are going tomorrow?

443
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,230
I'll go find you.

444
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,190
Can you stop pestering me?

445
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,920
You hate talking to me that much?

446
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,830
There is nothing for us to talk about now.

447
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,950
Zhou Siyue, don't be such a rascal.

448
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,400
Give me a chance to explain.

449
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,160
Actually, about what you said to Su Bocong that day,

450
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,190
I heard it all.

451
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,590
So, when I knew how hard and exhausting it was for you

452
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,160
as a Senior Three returnee in that year,

453
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,590
and it was all because of me,

454
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,920
I hesitated.

455
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,640
I thought that if I push you away,

456
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,590
you could find your own life.

457
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,310
I thought that what I did was for your good.

458
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,070
That was why I took the liberty to make all the decisions.

459
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,430
Actually, for these days,

460
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,920
I have always been questioning myself.

461
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,640
I was afraid of seeing you.

462
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,590
I was afraid that when you see me,

463
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,400
you will be disappointed at me.

464
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,560
Because I am no longer

465
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,190
the old Zhou Siyue.

466
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,110
Not the Zhou Siyue

467
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,520
who can lend you energy.

468
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,830
That was why I chose to run away from you.

469
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,760
But later,

470
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,920
when you came to Hua Qing,

471
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,830
and you showed up around me,

472
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,950
I couldn't help caring about you.

473
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,880
I just couldn't help picturing our future.

474
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,040
But this future

475
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,800
should never be a future that need you to sacrifice

476
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,520
what you like for my sake.

477
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,400
Actually I just want you to understand this.

478
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,560
And don't just ignore me like this.

479
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,470
Are you done?

480
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,590
Yes.

481
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,310
I have thought about

482
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,800
what you said.

483
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,640
You are afraid that uncle's thing will affect me.

484
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,710
That I can understand.

485
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,830
But I have never been afraid of that.

486
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,800
You said you wanted to go abroad, trying to push me away.

487
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,950
Then I would deal with

488
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,110
your worries about a long-distance relationship.

489
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
As for the opinions of the people in the university,

490
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,430
I won't care about them.

491
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,000
I chased after you so hard

492
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,280
for a simple reason.

493
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,000
That is, I like you.

494
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,560
But now I understand

495
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,590
that a true relationship is neck and neck.

496
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,000
But not that you come to tell me,

497
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,350
what to do at a time,

498
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,070
and what not to do at another time.

499
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,590
Zhou Siyue

500
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,950
Have you ever thought about

501
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,430
what really love is?

502
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,070
Zhou Siyue, there you are.

503
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,760
I happen to have something to ask you.

504
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,800
Ding Xian.

505
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,640
What are you guys doing here?

506
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,830
Wait a second.

507
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,710
Zhou Siyue,

508
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,920
you don't really like Ding Xian, do you?

509
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,230
I like her.

510
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,190
So what?

511
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,350
Boss.

512
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,000
That's not going to work.

513
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,800
Ding Xian just rejected you right away.

514
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,950
Then our plans are of no use.

515
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,040
Do you know how to contact Ding Xian's roommate?

516
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,920
Lou Feng.

517
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,760
So what's in it for me?

518
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,160
Aren't you in Professor Ye's Scientific Research Group?

519
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,470
There is a course taught by Professor Ye

520
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,230
that I can't sign up no matter what.

521
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,880
Don't go too far.

522
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,280
I am just an intern myself.

523
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,590
I will take care of it.

524
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,350
Zhou promised.

525
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,710
Your request will be fulfilled.

526
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,000
Feng, who were you calling just now?

527
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,470
An old classmate of mine.

528
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,760
Isn't the Comic-con the day after tomorrow?

529
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,160
Let's go have some fun tomorrow?

530
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,680
Okay.

531
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,400
Where should we go?

532
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,430
Just leave it to me.

533
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,800
Where are you, Lou Feng?

534
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,950
Alright, just hurry.

535
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,430
Good for you.

536
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,400
Bribed my roommate?

537
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,430
It seems

538
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,590
that everyone wants to help me.

539
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,310
The tickets are bought already.

540
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,640
You are really not going?

541
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,280
You have come so far away.

542
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,310
The tickets are quite expensive.

543
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,880
Fine.

544
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,920
But let me be clear.

545
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,520
It's just hanging around.

546
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,190
Don't you hold any other thoughts about me.

547
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,680
Whatever you say.

548
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,280
Let's see where we should have fun.

549
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,360
Boss, how is it?

550
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,630
Got inside. But we don't know where to go.

551
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,230
Take her to the haunted house.

552
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:11,670
Yes, take her there.

553
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,280
But I don't see one.

554
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,120
Hello, can I add your WeChat?

555
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,840
Sorry.

556
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,949
I already have a girlfriend.

557
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,560
Why do you walk so fast?

558
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,560
If you don't want to get around,

559
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,950
I can go myself.

560
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,600
How is it possible that I don't want to have fun?

561
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,360
Then tell me, what do you want to play?

562
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,870
What a huge maze!

563
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,360
We are in a Children's Park today, aren't we?

564
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,710
That's why there is not a haunted house.

565
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,150
What did you say?

566
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,470
What children's park?

567
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,230
It is for both adults and children.

568
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,760
Are you afraid of going into a maze?

569
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,910
How could I be afraid of that?

570
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,910
Then shall we compete?

571
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,910
See who gets out of the maze first.

572
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,950
If I get out first,

573
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,430
you'll promise me

574
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,600
not to ignore me from now on.

575
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,000
Okay.

576
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,390
But if I get out first?

577
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,760
Then whatever you ask me to do, I'll do it.

578
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,000
Deal.

579
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,470
Deal.

580
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,910
Left, or right?

581
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,080
Why do you grin?

582
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,800
I feel that you are still the same as usual.

583
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,430
Didn't change at all.

584
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,560
I am warning you.

585
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,760
Don't try to touch me.

586
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,280
I am going that way. Don't follow me.

587
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,230
I just came here, didn't I?

588
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,470
Zhou Siyue

589
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,600
Ding Xian

590
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,520
I'm here.

591
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,080
Don't be scared.

592
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,430
I am not.

593
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
I am worried

594
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,080
that you can't find your way.

595
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,800
Go. Lead the way.

596
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,600
This way.

597
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,670
The air outside is great.

598
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,800
I won.

599
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,360
What?

600
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,520
I got out first.

601
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,470
Fine, but that was because I let you win.

602
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,390
You let me win?

603
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,040
I won.

604
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,120
What? You don't think it's fair?

605
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Kind of.

606
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,760
Then, let's have another match.

607
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,520
Sure. Let's do it.

608
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,080
Thank you.

609
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,710
Here.

610
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,430
Thank you.

611
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,360
You are welcome.

612
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,630
What are you looking at?

613
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,390
When I was a child, my parents took me to an amusement park.

614
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,360
I also wanted a balloon.

615
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,390
But my mom didn't allow me to.

616
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,670
But she bought one for my brother.

617
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,000
Right.

618
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,120
I won in the maze game.

619
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,000
I haven't punished you yet.

620
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,670
What do you want me to do?

621
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,190
What?

622
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,280
Play a mascot for me.

623
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,280
I, Zhou Siyue,

624
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,430
play a mascot for you?

625
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,710
Are you kidding me?

626
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,150
Sorry.

627
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,520
Why did you apologize to me?

628
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,390
I wanted

629
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,470
to give you all.

630
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,670
But there is only one left.

631
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,600
Actually, one is enough.

632
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,000
What?

633
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,080
Nothing.

634
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,630
So?

635
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,800
Do you still have anything you want to play?

636
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,910
Were you caught in the rain?

637
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,600
No.

638
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,630
Wait for me here.

639
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,280
A cup of hot coco, and paper tissue, please.

640
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:19,670
No, thanks.

641
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,280
Thank you.

642
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,000
Your back is all wet.

643
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,800
I'll do it myself.

644
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,800
Stay still.

645
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,230
Why are your ears so red?

646
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,430
So hot.

647
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,470
Your hands are so cold.

648
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:01,190
It seems to be the second time that we get caught in a rain.

649
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,710
Do you still remember

650
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,430
when we got caught in the rain the first time?

651
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,840
I do.

652
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,280
When we were in Senior One.

653
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,630
We went to watch the movie 2012.

654
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,800
And we almost bumped into Mr. Liu.

655
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,320
Then...

656
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,280
The end-of-the-world fireworks

657
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,120
was set by you?

658
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,000
Thank you.

659
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,870
The end-of-the-world fireworks

660
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,520
gave me a reason to apply for Hua Qing University again.
