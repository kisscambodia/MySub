Our Secret
EP19

2
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,160
Is it here?

3
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,680
Are you sure that you got rid of them?

4
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,550
I seem to hear Song Ziqi's voice.

5
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,910
This is not something we can afford to be careless about.

6
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,229
If she appears at the door the next moment,

7
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:22,630
I'd die, no kidding.

8
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,310
Seriously.

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,000
You have no idea

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,630
that I have not slept well for the past few days.

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,360
I have nightmares every night.

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,270
It's here, I think.

13
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:31,870
Zhou Siyue

14
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,190
Song Ziqi, open the door.

15
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,310
Song Ziqi, open the door.

16
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,000
I know you're here.

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,720
Don't hide in there and not speak!

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,000
Song Ziqi

19
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,110
Open the door.

20
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,360
Shut up.

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,720
Song Ziqi

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,030
Song Ziqi. Get the heck out.

23
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,550
I know you are here.

24
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,240
Come out now.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,270
You are being suspended, so what?

26
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you have to hide here and get so sullen about it?

27
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,520
Get out of the bathroom!

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,320
Hello.

29
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,670
You douchebag! You...

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,030
There's no need to...

31
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,910
Don't stop me.

32
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,670
Shadi, calm down first.

33
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,670
You two get out.

34
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,470
I want to talk to him alone.

35
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,550
No...

36
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,360
No, you...

37
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,440
How about

38
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,160
I take you back to school?

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,440
My bag is still in there.

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,240
I'd better wait outside.

41
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,160
Can't you go easy on me?

42
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,270
If you hurt me, I won't be able to become a pilot.

43
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,240
You still want to be a pilot?

44
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,550
Aren't you trying to stay away from everyone?

45
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,829
Aren't you running away?

46
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,630
You didn't pick up your phone.

47
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,800
Your QQ is off-line.

48
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,000
And you just sent me a message,

49
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,600
telling me that I should never try to find you.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
Song Ziqi, who do you think you are?

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,240
Why did you treat me like that?

52
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,030
I am sorry.

53
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,390
Sorry?

54
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,550
You are just being suspended.

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,829
Big deal?

56
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,670
Do you need to avoid me like the plague?

57
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,160
Calm down.

58
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,510
I can't calm down.

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,550
Can't you just man up?

60
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,440
You said you wanted to be with me.

61
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,720
You said you wanted to be a pilot.

62
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,320
And it was you who insisted on our long-distance relationship.

63
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,830
And now, something went wrong.

64
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,270
All you want to do is to hide. Not dare to confront it.

65
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,070
Song Ziqi, are you still a man?

66
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,110
Enough!

67
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,880
Ding Xian

68
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,670
Actually...

69
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,920
Sweet potatoes.

70
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,200
Boss, give me a sweet potato please.

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,350
Ten yuan for two.

72
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,440
Okay.

73
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,200
I forgot my bag.

74
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,390
You forgot to bring your money?

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,160
Young man, your girlfriend doesn't have money with her.

76
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,950
Come and pay!

77
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,600
Song Ziqi

78
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,760
I miss you.

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,270
Go back.

80
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,440
I'm late for the flight already.

81
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,000
Then catch the next one.

82
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,720
Are you kidding me?

83
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,440
Go back, please.

84
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,920
I am not going back.

85
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,510
I can't let you run away anymore.

86
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,790
So, are you here to save me?

87
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,110
I...

88
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,790
I came for the money!

89
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,760
What money?

90
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,040
100 yuan for a kiss.

91
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,160
You can count how many times you kissed me.

92
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,640
Hold on.

93
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,670
Enough?

94
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,480
If it is not enough, I will give you my credit card.

95
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,920
Take it.

96
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
You douchebag!

97
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,760
Thank you.

98
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,440
I will pay you back later.

99
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,670
No need.

100
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,230
Shadi

101
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,110
Did you see Shadi?

102
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,110
Isn't she inside?

103
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,040
No, she just rushed out.

104
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,760
Did you see her?

105
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,830
No.

106
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,350
Call her.

107
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,640
She won't pick up.

108
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,600
What are you guys doing?

109
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,270
Shadi

110
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,070
I am sorry. It was my fault.

111
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,000
I wasn't thinking straight. That wasn't me.

112
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,110
I am sorry, Shadi.

113
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,000
Song Ziqi, let go of me.

114
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,880
No, I won't.

115
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,790
No.

116
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,350
You don't know anything but running around.

117
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,880
If something really happens to you,

118
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,070
I...

119
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,470
What about you?

120
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:10,789
I don't know.

121
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,880
If Ding Xian is really not around me anymore,

122
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,110
I think I will be so scared.

123
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,550
Let me do it.

124
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,110
No need for the courtesy with me.

125
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,200
I am leaving. Don't cry alone

126
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,790
in the basement.

127
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,030
You should speak out

128
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,790
the things you need to say.

129
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,320
Got it.

130
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,520
Xianxian, I miss you so much.

131
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Me too.

132
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,670
Maybe you guys should stay for two more days.

133
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
That's not okay.

134
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,230
If we stay for two more days, Song Ziqi will run away again.

135
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,470
And,

136
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,200
we should let him get back and apologize to his parents at least.

137
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,030
I don't think he'll dare to do it again.

138
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,280
Rest assured.

139
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,470
Then, you...

140
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,350
Zhou Siyue,

141
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,110
if anything happens to Xianxian,

142
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,520
I will come back and get you.

143
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,030
Don't worry.

144
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,440
She'll not get lost.

145
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,590
Glad to hear it.

146
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,760
You, come over.

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,960
What?

148
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,200
So, are we good now?

149
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,440
Are you dreaming?

150
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,110
How long have I been searching for you?

151
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,590
You need to make it up to me twice as much.

152
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,640
We are leaving now.

153
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,110
Be safe. Bye.

154
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,320
Don't cry.

155
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,470
Hurry up.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,790
Take care.

157
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,000
Let me take you back to school.

158
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,080
No need. I can walk back to school myself.

159
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,470
I'd leave now.

160
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,470
If you are busy in school,

161
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,840
you don't need to come here so frequently.

162
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,790
Your mom and I are fine.

163
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,280
I can spare some time.

164
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,760
Right.

165
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,840
Ding Xian is also in Hua Qing now.

166
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,710
I like this girl.

167
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,590
She has a spirit.

168
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,200
Extraordinary.

169
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,760
I'm holding you up.

170
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,030
I didn't mean that.

171
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,670
It is just that I don't think it is the right time yet.

172
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,960
What do you mean, "not the right time"?

173
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,280
When is the right time then?

174
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,760
When I was young,

175
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,110
I needed to go to Jiangling to teach.

176
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,200
I wanted to take you and your mom with me.

177
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,030
But your mom,

178
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,200
since she was used to living a stable life,

179
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,030
she didn't want to move around with me.

180
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,000
I thought that as a family,

181
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,640
we shouldn't live separately in two different places.

182
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,590
But she was stubborn.

183
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,440
She wouldn't agree no matter what.

184
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,960
In the end, we dropped this matter.

185
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,440
Regarding this,

186
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,790
we have argued

187
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
for many times.

188
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,280
I used to think

189
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,670
that she wouldn't be able to carry on in Shenhai,

190
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,550
raising you all by herself.

191
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,590
She would come to me one day.

192
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,670
Only later did I find out

193
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,030
that I had underestimated her.

194
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,550
Not only did she bring you up,

195
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,670
but also raised you to be such an excellent man.

196
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,440
I don't know, for so many years,

197
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,760
how much she has been through

198
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,110
and how much she has suffered.

199
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,880
Not until this accident

200
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,880
did it dawn on me

201
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,230
that your mom has always been

202
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,960
a capable woman.

203
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,000
In order to take care of me,

204
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,520
she put away the obsession for so many years

205
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,880
and came to Jiangling,

206
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,440
busy around without a single complaint.

207
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,520
Every time,

208
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,910
I see her sleep when she is exhausted,

209
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,590
I would think,

210
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,470
why did I have to come to Jiangling

211
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,440
to be a professor?

212
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,670
Why did I

213
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,080
have to keep her waiting for me?

214
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,710
Let's get inside.

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,280
There is a draft here.

216
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,000
You may catch a cold.

217
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,520
I believe,

218
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,640
wherever my son goes,

219
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,350
he will be successful.

220
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,670
But I don't want you

221
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,280
to find

222
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,470
that you are all alone

223
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,910
after you succeed.

224
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,840
Don't make your mom and me

225
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,670
an excuse of your own business.

226
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,470
We are great.

227
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,000
You don't need to worry about us.

228
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,000
Alright.

229
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,000
Go back if you don't have other things.

230
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,840
Boss,

231
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,520
you finally admit.

232
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,230
I knew it! You have feelings for Ding Xian all along!

233
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,640
Fine.

234
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:47,589
Just tell me whether you will help me or not.

235
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,430
Of course.

236
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
I am good at chasing girls.

237
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,560
Hello, guys.

238
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,710
We are Love Chasing League from now on.

239
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:04,560
Then I am Love.

240
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,950
I am Chasing.

241
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,800
You are League.

242
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,000
I'd be brain-damaged to ask you two for help.

243
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:13,760
Hurry.

244
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,190
Don't rush.

245
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,110
I have already learned

246
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,040
that members of the Anime Club are going to participate

247
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,520
in a Comic-con in Huai City.

248
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,190
And there is a great amusement park in Huai City.

249
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,190
Amusement park, great idea.

250
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,000
You see.

251
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,710
You can grab her hand when you're on the roller coaster.

252
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,520
Go to the haunted house.

253
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,040
When she gets scared in the haunted house, she'll hug you.

254
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,760
Last time I took Kong Shadi there,

255
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,230
she screamed and hugged me right away.

256
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,110
What are you talking about?

257
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,350
I am out now.

258
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,400
Boss.

259
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,590
Are you still chasing love now?

260
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,070
Yes.

261
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,710
Come in.

262
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,830
Mr. Su.

263
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,880
About the science expo of Robot Competition in Huai City,

264
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,190
its exhibits have already been prepared.

265
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,310
Please take a look.

266
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,950
Have you booked the ticket to Huai City?

267
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,800
Yes, nine o'clock tomorrow night.

268
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,830
Reschedule it to the morning.

269
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,070
Okay.

270
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,280
Thanks.

271
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,830
Get on quickly. Okay.

272
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,830
Sorry, Lou Feng.

273
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,400
Ji Hang happened to have other things to do.

274
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,160
So we asked for your help.

275
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,350
That's okay. I am free, anyway.

276
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,190
I just took it as a free trip.

277
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,400
Alright, then I should get on first.

278
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,110
Hurry.

279
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,800
Good morning, Lou Feng.

280
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,710
Do you know why the head of the Anime Club

281
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,920
doesn't come this time?

282
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,640
Isn't it because he has other business to do?

283
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,310
Are you silly?

284
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,280
Can't you tell that he likes Xing Lufei?

285
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,190
I heard that Ji Hang

286
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,310
has a crush on her Xing Lufei for years.

287
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,710
But he can only watch her

288
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,880
falling in love with other people again and again.

289
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,310
And some time ago, he confessed his love to her.

290
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,160
Guess what?

291
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,430
What?

292
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,830
Xing said,

293
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,160
"I thought we were good friends."

294
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,640
Good morning.

295
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,830
Morning, Yuan Fang.

296
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,680
Good morning.

297
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,470
Xianxian.

298
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,280
Do you need my help?

299
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,000
No.

300
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,430
I want some.

301
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Here you go.

302
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,950
Xing Lufei is really something.

303
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,950
Doesn't she keep harassing your Zhou?

304
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,680
You need to be careful.

305
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,470
Speak of the devil.

306
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,800
Why are you here?

307
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,880
There are only five members in the robot team.

308
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,350
That's okay.

309
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,710
I have talked to Professor Ye.

310
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,470
I thought you wouldn't come today.

311
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,830
Zhou Siyue,

312
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
how do you know that I am going to Huai City?

313
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,590
No, it is not because of you.

314
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,950
Boss comes because of...

315
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,190
Xing Lufei

316
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,760
is really obsessed with Zhou.

317
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,070
Let's go.

318
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,830
Zhou Siyue, have an apple.

319
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,590
No, thanks. I am not hungry.

320
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,560
You are not hungry now, but you can still save it for tonight.

321
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,110
Here you are.

322
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,520
Xing

323
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,760
Have you heard of

324
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
an old saying?

325
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,920
What?

326
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,190
Apples should be eaten in the morning.

327
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,310
In the morning, the apple you eat is a golden one.

328
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,520
In the afternoon, it becomes a silver one.

329
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,350
At night,

330
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,640
it becomes a poisonous one.

331
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,880
That's too far-fetched.

332
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,830
That's real.

333
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,800
An old man in our village liked to eat apples at night.

334
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,710
Later...

335
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,800
What happened later?

336
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,800
Later,

337
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,310
he died.

338
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,310
Nonsense.

339
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,230
Fine.

340
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,000
Aren't you sleepy?

341
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,040
Take some sleep.

342
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,160
We are here.

343
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,760
I am so hungry now.

344
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,310
Let's go.

345
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,000
Instant noodles with an egg, bad luck comes to an end.

346
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,040
The weather is so nice today.

347
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,040
I want to have a spicy chicken burger.

348
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,640
Sure.

349
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,680
Xianxian.

350
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,110
Who is this? Why did he call you "Xianxian"?

351
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,000
He was a senior in my high school.

352
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,230
Su

353
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,310
Bocong, you are here so early?

354
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,830
The rooms for the Anime Club

355
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,110
have been arranged properly.

356
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,590
You can just bring in your luggage and check in.

357
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,000
Thanks.

358
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,000
Xianxian, Bocong is not only handsome and rich,

359
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,560
but also favors you.

360
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
You should not let the chance slip away.

361
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,350
I'd better get inside first.

362
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,040
- Are you tired? - I'm fine.

363
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
I can carry it myself.

364
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,560
Su

365
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
What are the odds?

366
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,110
Long time no see.

367
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,280
Your job covers quite a wide range now.

368
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,400
You need to receive the guests too?

369
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,110
I am here for Xianxian.

370
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,680
Right, the Robot Competition you join

371
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,560
is sponsored by Red Horse.

372
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,350
Red Horse seems to always be like this,

373
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
getting involved in everything.

374
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,950
But you need to have strength to get involved.

375
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,560
I am looking forward to your performance in the competition.

376
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,800
You don't need to worry about that.

377
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,400
Yuan Fang

378
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,230
Hurry up.

379
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,880
-Here. -Xianxian, have you eaten yet?

380
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,560
I know.

381
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,710
Not yet.

382
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,280
It is shameless to keep harassing others!

383
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,710
What are you talking about?

384
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,640
Sorry about that.

385
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,710
I arrived. I'll call you later.

386
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,000
Are you Mr. Su of Red Horse Tech?

387
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,310
You are?

388
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,040
You can give my luggage to me.

389
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,430
I am going inside now. I'll leave you guys to your business.

390
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,830
Let's go.

391
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,000
Hello.

392
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,830
Excuse me for a moment.

393
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,190
Xianxian.

394
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,230
Do you want to have dinner with me tonight?

395
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,560
It is probably not okay tonight.

396
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,000
I need to beat the deadline of the draft.

397
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,000
That's okay. I'll ask the hotel to bring you dinner.

398
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,400
By the way, my room number is 902.

399
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,520
You can find me whenever you want.

400
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,760
- Sure. - Go get some rest.

401
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,000
Bye bye.

402
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,560
Bye bye.

403
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,680
He even told you his room number,

404
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,110
and you said he is just a senior of your old school?

405
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,800
Yeah.

406
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,880
Mr. Su, hello.

407
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,680
Hello.

408
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,190
I heard that Red Horse Tech is sponsoring this competition.

409
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,520
And I have always looked forward to meeting you.

410
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,520
It never occurs to me that I can meet you here.

411
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,950
This is my name card.

412
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,880
I am sorry, but I have something to do now.

413
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,520
Let's talk in details later.

414
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,230
Sure.

415
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,430
Zhou Siyue of Hua Qing Scientific Research Group?

416
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,310
It is me.

417
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,830
Hello, Professor Ye called me just now.

418
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,590
He asked me to discuss things about the competition with you.

419
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,110
Sure. No problem.

420
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,310
Can I have your phone number?

421
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,000
For contact. Is that okay?

422
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,800
Sure.

423
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,070
It seems that no matter where a handsome guy goes,

424
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,560
he can get special treatment.

425
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,680
Are you finished?

426
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,040
That's it.

427
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,000
Okay. Thanks.

428
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,640
Please rest well.

429
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,880
- Bye. - Hello.

430
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,950
I am Yuan Fang.

431
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,470
What are you doing?

432
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Full.

433
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,000
Not yet.

434
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,760
Now it is full.

435
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,560
What plan do you have for tomorrow?

436
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,760
I'll take you to a place.

437
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,760
What are you trying to do?

438
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,470
I want to date you.

439
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,000
I am not available tomorrow.

440
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,310
Not available at any time.

441
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,590
Fine.

442
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,560
Then tell me where you are going tomorrow?

443
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,230
I'll go find you.

444
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,190
Can you stop pestering me?

445
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,920
You hate talking to me that much?

446
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,830
There is nothing for us to talk about now.

447
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,950
Zhou Siyue, don't be such a rascal.

448
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,400
Give me a chance to explain.

449
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,160
Actually, about what you said to Su Bocong that day,

450
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,190
I heard it all.

451
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,590
So, when I knew how hard and exhausting it was for you

452
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,160
as a Senior Three returnee in that year,

453
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,590
and it was all because of me,

454
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,920
I hesitated.

455
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,640
I thought that if I push you away,

456
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,590
you could find your own life.

457
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,310
I thought that what I did was for your good.

458
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,070
That was why I took the liberty to make all the decisions.

459
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,430
Actually, for these days,

460
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,920
I have always been questioning myself.

461
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,640
I was afraid of seeing you.

462
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,590
I was afraid that when you see me,

463
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,400
you will be disappointed at me.

464
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,560
Because I am no longer

465
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,190
the old Zhou Siyue.

466
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,110
Not the Zhou Siyue

467
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,520
who can lend you energy.

468
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,830
That was why I chose to run away from you.

469
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,760
But later,

470
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,920
when you came to Hua Qing,

471
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,830
and you showed up around me,

472
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,950
I couldn't help caring about you.

473
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,880
I just couldn't help picturing our future.

474
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,040
But this future

475
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,800
should never be a future that need you to sacrifice

476
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,520
what you like for my sake.

477
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,400
Actually I just want you to understand this.

478
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,560
And don't just ignore me like this.

479
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,470
Are you done?

480
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,590
Yes.

481
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,310
I have thought about

482
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,800
what you said.

483
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,640
You are afraid that uncle's thing will affect me.

484
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,710
That I can understand.

485
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,830
But I have never been afraid of that.

486
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,800
You said you wanted to go abroad, trying to push me away.

487
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,950
Then I would deal with

488
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,110
your worries about a long-distance relationship.

489
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
As for the opinions of the people in the university,

490
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,430
I won't care about them.

491
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,000
I chased after you so hard

492
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,280
for a simple reason.

493
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,000
That is, I like you.

494
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,560
But now I understand

495
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,590
that a true relationship is neck and neck.

496
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,000
But not that you come to tell me,

497
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,350
what to do at a time,

498
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,070
and what not to do at another time.

499
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,590
Zhou Siyue

500
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,950
Have you ever thought about

501
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,430
what really love is?

502
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,070
Zhou Siyue, there you are.

503
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,760
I happen to have something to ask you.

504
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,800
Ding Xian.

505
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,640
What are you guys doing here?

506
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,830
Wait a second.

507
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,710
Zhou Siyue,

508
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,920
you don't really like Ding Xian, do you?

509
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,230
I like her.

510
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,190
So what?

511
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,350
Boss.

512
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,000
That's not going to work.

513
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,800
Ding Xian just rejected you right away.

514
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,950
Then our plans are of no use.

515
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,040
Do you know how to contact Ding Xian's roommate?

516
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,920
Lou Feng.

517
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,760
So what's in it for me?

518
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,160
Aren't you in Professor Ye's Scientific Research Group?

519
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,470
There is a course taught by Professor Ye

520
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,230
that I can't sign up no matter what.

521
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,880
Don't go too far.

522
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,280
I am just an intern myself.

523
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,590
I will take care of it.

524
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,350
Zhou promised.

525
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,710
Your request will be fulfilled.

526
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,000
Feng, who were you calling just now?

527
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,470
An old classmate of mine.

528
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,760
Isn't the Comic-con the day after tomorrow?

529
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,160
Let's go have some fun tomorrow?

530
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,680
Okay.

531
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,400
Where should we go?

532
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,430
Just leave it to me.

533
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,800
Where are you, Lou Feng?

534
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,950
Alright, just hurry.

535
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,430
Good for you.

536
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,400
Bribed my roommate?

537
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,430
It seems

538
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,590
that everyone wants to help me.

539
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,310
The tickets are bought already.

540
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,640
You are really not going?

541
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,280
You have come so far away.

542
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,310
The tickets are quite expensive.

543
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,880
Fine.

544
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,920
But let me be clear.

545
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,520
It's just hanging around.

546
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,190
Don't you hold any other thoughts about me.

547
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,680
Whatever you say.

548
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,280
Let's see where we should have fun.

549
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,360
Boss, how is it?

550
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,630
Got inside. But we don't know where to go.

551
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,230
Take her to the haunted house.

552
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,670
Yes, take her there.

553
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,280
But I don't see one.

554
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,120
Hello, can I add your WeChat?

555
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,840
Sorry.

556
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,949
I already have a girlfriend.

557
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,560
Why do you walk so fast?

558
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,560
If you don't want to get around,

559
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,950
I can go myself.

560
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,600
How is it possible that I don't want to have fun?

561
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,360
Then tell me, what do you want to play?

562
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,870
What a huge maze!

563
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,360
We are in a Children's Park today, aren't we?

564
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,710
That's why there is not a haunted house.

565
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,150
What did you say?

566
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,470
What children's park?

567
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,230
It is for both adults and children.

568
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,760
Are you afraid of going into a maze?

569
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,910
How could I be afraid of that?

570
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,910
Then shall we compete?

571
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,910
See who gets out of the maze first.

572
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,950
If I get out first,

573
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,430
you'll promise me

574
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,600
not to ignore me from now on.

575
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,000
Okay.

576
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,390
But if I get out first?

577
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,760
Then whatever you ask me to do, I'll do it.

578
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,000
Deal.

579
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,470
Deal.

580
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,910
Left, or right?

581
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,080
Why do you grin?

582
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,800
I feel that you are still the same as usual.

583
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,430
Didn't change at all.

584
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,560
I am warning you.

585
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,760
Don't try to touch me.

586
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,280
I am going that way. Don't follow me.

587
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,230
I just came here, didn't I?

588
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,470
Zhou Siyue

589
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,600
Ding Xian

590
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,520
I'm here.

591
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,080
Don't be scared.

592
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,430
I am not.

593
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
I am worried

594
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,080
that you can't find your way.

595
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,800
Go. Lead the way.

596
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,600
This way.

597
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,670
The air outside is great.

598
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,800
I won.

599
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,360
What?

600
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,520
I got out first.

601
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,470
Fine, but that was because I let you win.

602
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,390
You let me win?

603
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,040
I won.

604
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,120
What? You don't think it's fair?

605
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Kind of.

606
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,760
Then, let's have another match.

607
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,520
Sure. Let's do it.

608
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,080
Thank you.

609
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,710
Here.

610
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,430
Thank you.

611
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,360
You are welcome.

612
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,630
What are you looking at?

613
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:45,390
When I was a child, my parents took me to an amusement park.

614
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,360
I also wanted a balloon.

615
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,390
But my mom didn't allow me to.

616
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,670
But she bought one for my brother.

617
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,000
Right.

618
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,120
I won in the maze game.

619
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,000
I haven't punished you yet.

620
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,670
What do you want me to do?

621
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,190
What?

622
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,280
Play a mascot for me.

623
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,280
I, Zhou Siyue,

624
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,430
play a mascot for you?

625
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,710
Are you kidding me?

626
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,150
Sorry.

627
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,520
Why did you apologize to me?

628
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,390
I wanted

629
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,470
to give you all.

630
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,670
But there is only one left.

631
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,600
Actually, one is enough.

632
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,000
What?

633
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,080
Nothing.

634
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,630
So?

635
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,800
Do you still have anything you want to play?

636
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:50,910
Were you caught in the rain?

637
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,600
No.

638
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,630
Wait for me here.

639
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,280
A cup of hot coco, and paper tissue, please.

640
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:21,670
No, thanks.

641
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,280
Thank you.

642
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,000
Your back is all wet.

643
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,800
I'll do it myself.

644
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,800
Stay still.

645
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,230
Why are your ears so red?

646
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,430
So hot.

647
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,470
Your hands are so cold.

648
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:03,190
It seems to be the second time that we get caught in a rain.

649
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,710
Do you still remember

650
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,430
when we got caught in the rain the first time?

651
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,840
I do.

652
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,280
When we were in Senior One.

653
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,630
We went to watch the movie 2012.

654
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,800
And we almost bumped into Mr. Liu.

655
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,320
Then...

656
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,280
The end-of-the-world fireworks

657
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,120
was set by you?

658
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,000
Thank you.

659
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,870
The end-of-the-world fireworks

660
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,520
gave me a reason to apply for Hua Qing University again.
