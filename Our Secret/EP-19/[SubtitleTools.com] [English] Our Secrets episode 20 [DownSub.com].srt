Our Secret
EP20

2
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
Thank you.

3
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,870
The end-of-the-world fireworks

4
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:21,680
gave me a reason to apply for Hua Qing University again.

5
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,520
Tomorrow

6
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,079
is the opening exhibition of the robotics competition.

7
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,720
Would you like to come?

8
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,110
Don't push your luck here.

9
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,440
We had a deal today.

10
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,270
Hanging out together was an accident.

11
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,750
Well then,

12
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,320
you are gonna have to hang on a little longer,

13
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,030
cause I'm not giving up.

14
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,960
Xianxian.

15
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,320
Su.

16
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,670
What are you doing here?

17
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,720
I tried to find you in your room.

18
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,910
Your roommate said you were out.

19
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,030
It was raining outside.

20
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,440
Hope you didn't get caught in the rain.

21
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,800
With me around,

22
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,829
she won't.

23
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:04,160
Am I interrupting something?

24
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,470
No.

25
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,440
A little bit.

26
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,110
Well, how about you give us a minute, then?

27
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,000
Sorry.

28
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,880
There's something about work

29
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,160
to discuss with Xianxian.

30
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,750
She's getting a little tired.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,910
What about another day.

32
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,079
Su, it's okay.

33
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,960
What do you need me for?

34
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,110
Let's find a quiet place,

35
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,829
that we can sit down to talk.

36
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,110
Okay.

37
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,440
Let's go.

38
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,830
Xianxian, look over this.

39
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,000
This is...

40
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,510
You're everywhere!

41
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,830
Good point.

42
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,790
What's wrong with me being a customer here?

43
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,640
Xianxian,

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,110
There was this comic book company in the Huai city,

45
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,640
who asked us to design an app.

46
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,790
It's almost done

47
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,070
and is about to be launched.

48
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,550
The Director Zhang of the comic book company,

49
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,110
asked me if I could recommend an artist.

50
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,510
And I thought of you.

51
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,350
Tech companies make comic book apps, too?

52
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,720
Your company really does everything.

53
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,920
Yeah, because we are a startup company.

54
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,390
The boss wants to try various services.

55
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,040
He's got foresight.

56
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,320
Thank you.

57
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,390
If he doesn't,

58
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,790
he wouldn't send me here to cooperate with Xianxian.

59
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,070
You're right about that.

60
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,550
That could be the only common point

61
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,320
that we share.

62
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,230
But,

63
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,670
I have no experience in

64
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,640
working on comic book apps like this.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,070
Don't worry about this.

66
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,480
This app is currently the first one in China.

67
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,510
and the only professional platform exclusively for comics.

68
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,390
I think it's quite good.

69
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,600
I wonder if you're interested.

70
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,070
So what do I need to do?

71
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,040
It happens that we are currently in the Huai City,

72
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,670
if you're interested,

73
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,070
come with me to see director Zhang tomorrow.

74
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,200
Tomorrow? Tomorrow is probably not okay.

75
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,830
Are you...

76
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,640
Are you going to see him?

77
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,720
No.

78
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,350
The show-stand for our comic club need to be prepared tomorrow.

79
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,510
I'm afraid I can't make time.

80
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,390
Then...

81
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,720
I'll make arrangement when you are free.

82
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,830
That's great. Thank you, Su.

83
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,160
So I'll take my leave now.

84
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,040
I have to work on my sketch tonight.

85
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,830
Let me walk you to your place.

86
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,880
Don't we all stay in the same hotel here?

87
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,070
See you then. You don't have to walk me there.

88
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,510
Wait a minute.

89
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,600
I need to talk to you.

90
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,160
Could you please give us some privacy?

91
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,160
Su,

92
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,070
how about you go first?

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,760
Okay.

94
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,200
Remember to rest early.

95
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,550
If there's anything,

96
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,790
call me at any time.

97
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,230
Okay, Su, bye.

98
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,200
Bye.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,270
Good night.

100
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,510
Go ahead.

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,480
To be honest,

102
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,350
I don't like this guy very much.

103
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,320
But,

104
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,830
what he just said,

105
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,880
sounds like a good opportunity.

106
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,920
It worth you consideration.

107
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,070
You chose to do what you love,

108
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,720
I'll definitely stand behind you.

109
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,440
Then I'll go back to my room.

110
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,880
Don't forget to come to the robot exhibition opening tomorrow.

111
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,830
I'll be waiting for you.

112
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:15,760
Did you two make up?

113
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,710
We were never together.

114
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,880
There can't be "make up".

115
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,880
Forget about that.

116
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,000
You betrayed me!

117
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,150
You've been in the amusement park all day,

118
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,470
and earned a course from Professor Ye.

119
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,710
Couldn't ask for more.

120
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,470
Xianxian's not here yet?

121
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,030
How could it be？ It's late already.

122
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,280
Hurry up.

123
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,230
Lou Feng.

124
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,670
You put this here first,

125
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,280
then go upstairs to get tomorrow's schedule.

126
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,670
And you need to check out tomorrow's costumes in the dressing room.

127
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,350
I have to go to the dressing room?

128
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,320
I'll go to the dressing room.

129
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,080
My work is done here anyway.

130
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,520
You're not going to the robot contest opening?

131
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,080
No time for chat. Just move.

132
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,110
Okay, see you then!

133
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,400
Xianxian, I love you!

134
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,350
Get the schedule, hurry up.

135
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,080
Sir, this truck is ready to go!

136
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,910
Are you guys ready?

137
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,760
In a minute,

138
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,590
everyone's going to the central exhibition hall to give speeches.

139
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,110
Could you wait for some minutes?

140
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,710
We need few more minutes.

141
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,230
How many plans are you gonna show?

142
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,710
Let's go with one first.

143
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,200
Are you doing this or not?

144
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,470
You can start the show now.

145
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,910
Don't wait for me.

146
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,400
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,470
Without Xianxian,

148
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,960
you can still give the show of your robot.

149
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,550
Without her here,

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,790
there is no point in doing the show anymore.

151
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,280
Why don't you just go inside? It's fine.

152
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,110
So, one two three four five six...

153
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,110
Why is it locked?

154
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,350
I'll go to the dressing room. My work is done here anyway.

155
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,880
Anyone out there?

156
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Someone's in here!

157
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,030
Good work. See you guys.

158
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,670
Bye! Bye!

159
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,280
Xing Lufei, I got the schedule.

160
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,150
Good.

161
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,710
Then we're done here today.

162
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,960
Good work.

163
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,440
So...

164
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,230
Where's Ding Xian?

165
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,520
Ding Xian is...

166
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,400
She went to check out the dressing room,

167
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,840
and then I think there's something urgent, and she just left.

168
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,470
Then I'll see you.

169
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,320
Bye.

170
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,200
Something urgent?

171
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,710
Boss,

172
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,670
The opening ceremony is over.

173
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,880
I don't think Xianxian will come.

174
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,590
Why don't we just go?

175
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,470
It's okay. You can go.

176
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,550
You don't have to wait for me.

177
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,550
Okay, don't be too late.

178
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,030
No worries.

179
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,470
Sir, why do you have Ding Xian's cell phone?

180
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,280
Oh, I'll fetch it right away.

181
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,440
Wasn't she with you?

182
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,790
Don't tell me she is...

183
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,880
still at the Comic-Con Center.

184
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,440
Ding Xian!

185
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,670
Ding Xian!

186
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,710
Ding Xian!

187
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,960
Ding Xian!

188
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,350
Zhou Siyue!

189
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,910
Zhou Siyue!

190
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,710
Zhou Siyue, I'm here!

191
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,080
Ding Xian!

192
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,280
I'm here. Can you hear me?

193
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,960
Ding Xian, are you in there?

194
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,440
I'm locked inside!

195
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,280
You step back a little!

196
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,400
Step back, okay?

197
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,030
Are you all right?

198
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,760
I'm okay.

199
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,150
Come.

200
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,400
Getting in here like this,

201
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,320
are you sure we won't get caught?

202
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,590
It's an emergency after all.

203
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Just give me a second.

204
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,200
How did you get locked up in there?

205
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,080
I have no idea.

206
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,030
You have to be more careful from now on.

207
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,230
If I'm not around someday,

208
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,230
what should you then?

209
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,200
Well...

210
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,550
I'm sure I'll get out the next day.

211
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,080
I could just wait for someone to open the door for me.

212
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,960
That's enough tough talk.

213
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,960
Oh,

214
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,670
how was your opening ceremony?

215
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,280
I didn't do it.

216
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,520
Why?

217
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,080
Aren't you here,

218
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,790
just for the robot contest?

219
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,880
That's not entirely true.

220
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm also here for you.

221
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,080
My little Lord Zhou,

222
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,320
when did you become so unambitious?

223
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,550
That's because,

224
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,350
I am sure enough that

225
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,320
I can get the first place in the contest,

226
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,790
and I will get you too.

227
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,790
I'm leaving.

228
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,960
Why do you hate being with me so much?

229
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,670
Zhou Siyue,

230
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,910
when did you become such a scoundrel?

231
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,080
Maybe you should get to know me better.

232
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,200
Come here.

233
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,790
Come here.

234
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,320
Stay here and don't move.

235
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,230
Fellows, I'm leaving.

236
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,400
I want to go away and look around.

237
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,230
Will you come back?

238
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,640
I'll be back. Bye!

239
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,910
Goodbye!

240
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,030
We'll wait for you to come back!

241
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,670
I'll miss you guys.

242
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,640
Don't you forget to miss me!

243
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,840
Help, help!

244
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,840
He's awake! Yes!

245
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,670
That's great!

246
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,190
I thought

247
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,640
that you never check Weibo.

248
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,190
"Little Monster Dairies"

249
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,560
Catchy name.

250
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,160
Ding Xian,

251
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,520
you once asked me

252
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,160
what is true love.

253
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,350
Now I know the answer.

254
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,950
Her look seems ordinary,

255
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,880
yet I finding her beautiful day by day.

256
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,070
It's like...

257
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,710
she is so stubborn that almost makes in rage

258
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,400
and yet making me feel,

259
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,560
she is the cutest in the world.

260
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,070
It's like knowing that she's lying,

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,350
and yet,

262
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,560
I just couldn't spoil her poor acting.

263
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,070
It's like...

264
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,640
always crying like a mess,

265
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,310
and yet she is still attractive.

266
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,040
You're a mess.

267
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,430
Who is that

268
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,160
you are talking about?

269
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,280
Ding Xian,

270
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,760
I love you.

271
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,760
Would you be my girlfriend?

272
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,560
What are you doing here?

273
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,680
Who let you in?

274
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,280
How did you get in here?

275
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,760
Now you people don't even give a shit

276
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,230
about us security guards anymore?

277
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,880
Put down your information!

278
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,710
We're sorry.

279
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,280
I brought her there.

280
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,830
So, it has nothing to do with her.

281
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,430
You young lovers nowadays...

282
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,230
Must you have to seek thrills?

283
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,760
Write. What are you looking at?

284
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,880
Just write, everything!

285
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,640
We're not lovers.

286
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,040
Look at your good-looking face,

287
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,230
how come you can't even get a girl?

288
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,920
I was working on it.

289
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,560
And then you cut me off.

290
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,430
Y'all wait here for a sec.

291
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,430
I'll go for a check.

292
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,000
You can't leave until everything's clear.

293
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,190
You haven't given me an answer yet.

294
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,280
Zhou Siyue,

295
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,280
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,590
I'm not planning on a relationship.

297
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,680
Gee, you,

298
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,880
you sure can hold a grudge.

299
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,000
Fine,

300
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,710
I'll be waiting for you.

301
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,190
I'll wait for your answer.

302
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,710
Xianxian.

303
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,470
why are you here?

304
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,040
Su.

305
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,310
Mr. Su, what brings you here?

306
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,830
You know them?

307
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,590
They're my friends.

308
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,710
Here.

309
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,430
Thank you.

310
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,430
That's it. You can leave now.

311
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,400
Don't do that again.

312
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,560
Mr. Su, see you then.

313
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Good work.

314
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,110
Why are you here?

315
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,350
The contest starts tomorrow.

316
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,310
I'm here to check the procedures with the organizer.

317
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,800
Are you going back to the hotel?

318
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,880
I can give you a ride.

319
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,230
Sure.

320
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,560
Thank you.

321
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,040
Xianxian,

322
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,040
your mom called me the other day.

323
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,560
She asked me to take good care of you,

324
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,800
since we are both in the Huai City now.

325
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,710
I'm a little busy these days,

326
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,880
when I'm done, I'll take you out for fun.

327
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,190
Mr. Su, you're so busy,

328
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,040
maybe we should forget about these social courtesies.

329
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,400
That's where you're wrong.

330
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,000
For me, Xianxian was never a courtesy.

331
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,000
She always sees me as a brother, too.

332
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,110
Does she?

333
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,830
Then how come I have never heard her mention

334
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,470
you, her big brother?

335
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,880
Maybe it's because you two

336
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,230
were never that close?

337
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,070
It's no wonder that you didn't know.

338
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,230
Of course Xianxian wouldn't tell you.

339
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,830
She wouldn't tell anything to a stranger.

340
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,470
Even if she doesn't tell me anything,

341
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,640
I know what she likes,

342
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,800
and what she dislikes.

343
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,230
Xianxian,

344
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,280
I want to talk to you,

345
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,760
about the comic book app.

346
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,800
What is it?

347
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,830
Do you mind giving us a minute?

348
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,160
It's not a secret.

349
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,760
Can't you talk in front of me?

350
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,160
It's okay, Su. Go ahead.

351
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,310
Director Zhang of the comic book company

352
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,470
saw your works on your Weibo, and liked them very much.

353
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,310
He's having a dinner tomorrow,

354
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,950
and wants to sign the contract with you in person.

355
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,560
That's great. Thank you so much, Su.

356
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,590
I didn't do much.

357
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,710
I just introduced you.

358
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,590
I'll take you shopping for some clothes tomorrow.

359
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,640
It's better to dress formally.

360
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,470
What's wrong with her clothes?

361
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,350
It's okay, Su.

362
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,040
I have clothes.

363
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,190
Don't worry.

364
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,190
Okay then, I'll go with you tomorrow.

365
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,560
Don't be nervous.

366
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,760
Ding Xian won't be nervous.

367
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,710
You don't know her very well.

368
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,190
I'll see you then.

369
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Zhou Siyue,

370
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,070
I have told you,

371
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,560
stay away from Xianxian.

372
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,680
I have told you too,

373
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,400
I won't let go.

374
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,950
So that's all for today's discussion,

375
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,470
I hope that in the contest,

376
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,880
we'll all have a good performance.

377
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,310
Thank you all.

378
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,400
Awake now?

379
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,760
You took notes?

380
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,040
Good for you.

381
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,350
Career, love,

382
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,640
acing in both.

383
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,400
Look at him,

384
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,160
what a social butterfly.

385
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,070
Talking to everyone.

386
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,160
Come on, it's none of your business.

387
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,190
Let's go.

388
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,760
Where are you going?

389
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,920
Comic-Con.

390
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,880
Maybe you shouldn't go.

391
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,710
Why?

392
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,830
Because Xianxian is not there.

393
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,880
How do you know that she's not there?

394
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,590
I asked Lou Feng and she told me.

395
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,800
Then where is she?

396
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,590
She's...

397
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,760
she's taken back to the hotel by Su Bocong.

398
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,310
Xianxian, how was your show today?

399
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,560
It went well.

400
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,160
And there were a lot of people.

401
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,400
I finished just now.

402
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,000
So you haven't eaten all day?

403
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,400
- I'm used to it. I'm not hungry. - Ding Xian!

404
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,070
Why didn't you answer my call?

405
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,400
My cell phone is dead.

406
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,070
Weren't you at the academic conference?

407
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,950
Why are you back so soon?

408
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,560
It's over.

409
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,000
Don't you have a speech to prepare?

410
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,160
I pulled an all-nighter and finished it last night.

411
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,710
Then you should go back to your room and catch some sleep.

412
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,950
What are you doing here?

413
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,830
I wanna see you.

414
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,640
Mr. Zhou, you are really everywhere.

415
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,830
Can't seem to lose you.

416
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,880
Right back at you.

417
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,590
Mr. Su.

418
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,520
You're probably not in a position to laugh at me.

419
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,400
Anyone wants some juice?

420
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,830
- I'll get it. - I'll get it.

421
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,230
No, no, no, I'll go.

422
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,880
- Stay here. - Stay here.

423
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,590
Waiter, a glass of juice please.

424
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,830
What kind of juice would you like?

425
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,000
- Blueberry. - Blueberry.

426
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,710
Hot or cold?

427
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,800
- Cold. - Cold.

428
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,800
And sweetness?

429
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,950
- Full sweetness. - Full sweetness.

430
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,110
One cup?

431
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,590
One cup each.

432
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,680
I'll pay for mine, and he pay by himself.

433
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,430
Okay.

434
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,590
Thank you.

435
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,710
This is too much. I can't drink this much.

436
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,400
Xianxian, you must be hungry.

437
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,070
What about have a dinner together before we go back?

438
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,470
Okay.

439
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,710
Mr. Su, you treated me last time.

440
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,830
I feel quite embarrassed.

441
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,470
I'll pay this time.

442
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,590
I haven't said yes yet.

443
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,430
Sure.

444
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,560
Why don't we call up everyone?

445
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,800
We haven't had dinner together yet in the Huai City, anyway.

446
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,880
I know a place that is quite good.

447
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,560
However,

448
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,880
Mr. Zhou, I'm afraid it's gonna cost you.

449
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,400
Don't worry about me.

450
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,590
You should worry about

451
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,560
whether you stand a chance anymore.

452
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,920
Too sour.

453
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,640
See you around.

454
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,830
You're back.

455
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,230
What is this?

456
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,430
Blueberry juice.

457
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,680
No, thanks. It's too sour.

458
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,950
Rumors had it, two cute guys

459
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,070
went for you at the same time today.

460
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,470
Tell me tell me,

461
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,160
are you super happy today?

462
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,830
How is that possible?

463
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,640
They are two big babies!

464
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,680
I am so annoyed.

465
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,400
Anyway,

466
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,310
I'm still rooting the CP of you and Zhou Siyue.

467
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,400
You liked him for so many years.

468
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,470
If you can't be together,

469
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,400
it'd be such a huge shame.

470
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,190
Actually,

471
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,950
he asked me If I would be his girlfriend.

472
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,470
I almost said yes.

473
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,230
You refused?

474
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,040
I liked him for so many years.

475
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,280
And he's only been after me for a few days.

476
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,470
If I just say yes so easily,

477
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
I'll be completely controlled by him

478
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,920
in the future.

479
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,310
You have a point.

480
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
But,

481
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,800
I always feel that something is missing

482
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,560
between the two of us.

483
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,280
What is missing?

484
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,190
I don't know.

485
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,560
I can't figure it out.

486
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,000
Is she going?

487
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,800
It's his treat this the evening.

488
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,190
Are you going?

489
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,310
Forget it. I'm not.

490
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,190
Come now!

491
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,950
I'll go out for a while.

492
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,470
Bocong,

493
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,680
why didn't you go inside?

494
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,680
I want to tell you something.

495
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,590
What is it?

496
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,070
Here's the thing.

497
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,190
I know that you like Ding Xian.

498
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,470
I can help you.

499
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,800
Why are you helping me?

500
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,680
For Zhou Siyue?

501
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,110
Well, they're not together yet.

502
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,760
I still have a chance. So do you.

503
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,350
Lou Feng,

504
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,470
did you forget something again?

505
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,470
You're so...

506
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,350
Why are you here?

507
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,310
To take you to dinner.

508
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,430
I'm not hungry.

509
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,470
You don't want to see me?

510
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,920
Don't flatter yourself.

511
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,310
I'm buying dinner for everyone because of you.

512
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,280
I can't believe you're not even coming.

513
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,040
I didn't ask for that.

514
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,590
Anyway, I'll starve myself here if you won't go.

515
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,230
I'm not leaving.

516
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,830
Fine, I'll go.

517
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,230
I'll go eat.

518
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Welcome!

519
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,470
Xianxian.

520
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,400
Here.

521
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,760
Xianxian, this way, I saved you a seat.

522
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,950
Okay.

523
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,640
Zhou Siyue, sit here.

524
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Boss, here.

525
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
I'm telling you,

526
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,520
we've been here for so many days,

527
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,520
and didn't get the chance to get together, right?

528
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,640
Today, my boss pays the bill.

529
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,560
Just order anything you want, cheers!

530
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,710
Okay, thank you, Prince Charming.

531
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,110
You're welcome.

532
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,760
Just enjoy yourself.

533
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,950
Here, order the food.

534
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,640
Thank you.

535
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,590
I want this.

536
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,830
Thank you, handsome.

537
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,280
Nice that we're together here today.

538
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,430
Let's not just eat.

539
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,640
How about playing a game?

540
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,430
Which game? Just the one we used to play.

541
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,710
The King game.

542
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,230
I brought the cards. Here.

543
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,680
You are all prepared.

544
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,520
Of course.

545
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,590
Do you know how to play?

546
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,880
I don't know.

547
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,110
Here, I'll deal.

548
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,070
It's okay. I'll teach you.

549
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,830
Pass it on.

550
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,430
First hand, who's the king?

551
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,070
I am the king.

552
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,000
My order is simple.

553
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,400
Give me a toast, and call me gorgeous.

554
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,560
That'll do.

555
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,190
Who do you want? Right. What's the number?

556
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,160
What's the number? What's the number?

557
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,430
Number two.

558
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,310
Number two. Who's number two? Who's number two?

559
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,070
Who is number two?

560
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,350
Gorgeous, to you.

561
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,950
What? I can't hear you.

562
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,760
What?

563
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,760
Ban Jiayu, sorry.

564
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,560
You gorgeous, here to you!

565
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,590
Drink it up! Up, up.

566
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,120
Drink up. You're good.

567
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,870
Well done.

568
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,760
Nice.

569
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,429
Go on, go on.

570
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,800
Who is the king? Who?

571
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,150
I am

572
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,389
the king.

573
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:06,320
Number three should ask number six a question.

574
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,949
Fine, number three, number six.

575
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,429
I'm number six.

576
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,000
Who's number three? Number three.

577
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,710
Number three.

578
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,630
Number three.

579
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,840
Go ahead and ask.

580
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,120
A question.

581
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,520
Have you done anything bad lately?

582
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,360
What kind of question is that?

583
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,670
You should get punished. Come on.

584
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,870
Are you serious, Zhou Siyue?

585
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,560
You're still holding the grudge about me stealing your chocolate?

586
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,760
That's mean!

587
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,840
That doesn't count. Change the question.

588
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,430
That's fine. I have asked already.

589
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,230
I'll have one myself.

590
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,230
You drink up.

591
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,430
Drink up.

592
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,710
I'm in poor health, don't mess with me.

593
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
No problem.

594
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,190
Come on.

595
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,910
So this time, you deal.

596
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,150
Okay.

597
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,630
What kind of question was that?

598
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,040
I'm missing one here.

599
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,000
I suspect that the other day,

600
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,120
it's her who locked you in the dressing room.

601
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,390
No way

602
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,600
I am the king.

603
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,000
Since you are all so uptight,

604
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,950
I'll be the bad guy.

605
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,800
So, number five and number four.

606
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,910
Kiss each other.

607
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,040
Number four, number five.

608
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,560
Number four, number five.

609
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,040
Number four, number five.

610
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Okay, okay,

611
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,040
Who?

612
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,390
Who is it?

613
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:45,670
Who?

614
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,080
Who is it?

615
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,800
Who? I'm number five. I'll punish myself.

616
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,280
Wait.

617
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,840
Let's drink together.

618
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,280
Drink up, drink up.

619
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,630
Drink up, drink up.

620
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,190
Drink up, drink up.

621
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,800
Drink up, drink up.

622
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,280
You can hold liquor just fine.

623
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,120
Boring, no kiss.

624
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,600
Boring.

625
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,000
One more round, one more round.

626
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,150
Boss, I...

627
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,080
Zhou Siyue, see you.

628
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,870
See you.

629
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,230
Bye!

630
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,560
Thank you, Prince Charming.

631
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,190
Take care of Yuanfang.

632
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,230
Why should I take care of Yuan Fang?

633
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,320
Zhou Siyue,

634
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,560
You should be clear that

635
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,950
she'll live a better life if she is with me.

636
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,600
The point is if she wants or not.

637
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,910
I don't think so.

638
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,560
Give me some time.

639
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,230
I'll make her understand.

640
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,950
That's some wishful thinking of yours.

641
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,430
That's the truth.

642
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,870
So long as she's willing to,

643
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,800
sooner or later, we'll belong with each other.

644
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,150
What about you?

645
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,840
whether you're studying abroad, or finding a job,

646
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,950
you don't really think that your little high school romance,

647
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,560
is enough to get you through all that, do you?

648
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,870
Think it over.

649
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,230
Here's your change, sir.

650
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,630
Thank you.

651
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,600
You're welcome.

652
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,760
Now I declare the robot contest

653
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,670
a successful complete.

654
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,080
In this contest,

655
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,670
we've seen

656
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,000
outstanding students from major universities across the country.

657
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,150
Nanjing University, Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology...

658
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,190
How much longer is this gonna take?

659
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,910
Any minute now.

660
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,360
So now, we're going to announce

661
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,870
the top three of this year's robot contest.

662
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,760
First of all, the champion of this contest,

663
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,000
goes to Zhou Siyue from Hua Qing University.

664
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,150
Let's have Zhou Siyue up the stage for the award.

665
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,080
Thank you.

666
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,360
Hello, everyone.

667
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,040
I am from Hua Qing University.

668
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,190
I'm Zhou Siyue from the research team.

669
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,710
Hello?

670
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,710
Hello?

671
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,390
Siyue, use this one.

672
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,190
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

673
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,470
Liu Xiaofeng.

674
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,040
It's been a while.

675
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,950
Yes, indeed.

676
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,560
You're here representing the University of Science and Technology?

677
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,000
Yeah.

678
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,910
Why did you go to the University of Science and Technology?

679
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,120
I remember you said you wanted to study economics

680
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,470
You remember that?

681
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,560
Actually, I am majoring in computer because of you.

682
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,150
Uh-wait, no, I didn't mean...

683
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,630
Don't get me wrong.

684
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,670
I'm just really grateful to you.

685
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,190
I'm not sure if you remember,

686
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,560
when the college entrance exam was close,

687
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,470
I was very nervous.

688
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,430
The pressure of that last year of high school was too much.

689
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,150
In fact, I am also very confused.

690
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,360
Whether I get in the university or not,

691
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,360
I am not sure what I should do in the future.

692
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,950
What kind of person I want to be.

693
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,470
In this world,

694
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,190
There are many, many hard-working people.

695
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,910
But not everyone

696
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,360
can get what he wants.

697
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,230
But,

698
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,120
if you can't get what you want through hard work,

699
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,600
then what's the point for working hard anyway?

700
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,600
We work hard so we won't regret.

701
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,390
If it wasn't you,

702
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,150
I would have no confidence to go to the college.

703
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,710
That's gross, man.

704
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,630
No, I mean it.

705
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,800
At that time,

706
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,000
I always thought that you were so out of touch.

707
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,150
But ever since you hang around with Ding Xian,

708
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,120
you've got a little more human touch.

709
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,670
Am I this cold-blooded before?

710
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,840
No.

711
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,080
How do I put it? It like...

712
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,120
Maybe I think that's who you really are.

713
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,520
How are you two now?

714
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,000
Are you together?

715
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,080
Not yet.

716
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,360
I'm still waiting for her.

717
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,470
Why wait?

718
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,230
She's been waiting for me all these years.

719
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,710
I...

720
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,000
should give her enough patience too.

721
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,390
But have you ever thought about this,

722
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,600
for a girl as good as her,

723
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,870
she's never short of admirers.

724
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:40,870
You're right.

725
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,430
Then see you!

726
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,230
Wait.

727
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,670
What are you gonna do?

728
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,840
Go find her.

729
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,430
Hello, hello.

730
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,430
Excuse me, where's Zhou Siyue?

731
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,560
He has some business to attend to and left.

732
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,080
If you have something important,

733
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
I can tell him.

734
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,760
Here's the thing.

735
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,710
I want to work with him on a project.

736
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,910
Here is my name card.

737
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,190
Please do give it to him.

738
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,800
Okay, thank you.

739
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,910
- Xianxian. - Su.

740
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:21,760
Wait a minute.

741
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:24,190
What's the matter? It's the first time I wear high heels.

742
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,190
Not very used to it.

743
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,520
It's hurting my feet.

744
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,120
You look...

745
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,080
beautiful today.

746
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,630
Really? Yes.

747
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,320
Thank you!

748
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,670
This is for you.

749
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,870
Su.

750
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,560
You've helped me a lot.

751
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,670
I can't take any more gift from you.

752
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,600
And this is too expensive.

753
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,000
Not really.

754
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,470
Just for good luck.

755
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,190
So you could successfully seal the contract tonight.

756
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,150
You're wearing such a beautiful dress,

757
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,190
it should go with a nice necklace.

758
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,080
I can do it myself.

759
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,560
It looks great on you.

760
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,560
Thank you.

761
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,150
If I can seal the contract,

762
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,080
I will buy you a big meal.

763
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,150
I really wish you don't be too polite with me.

764
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,470
Let's go.

765
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,630
Here.

766
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,520
Thank you.

767
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,950
Let's go in.

768
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,840
Director Zhang.

769
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,360
Okay, you can go.

770
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,840
Su, you're here.

771
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,280
This is...

772
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,190
This is the one I told you about before,

773
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,080
the author of the Little Monster Dairies,

774
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:15,950
Ding Xian.

775
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,190
She's so young!

776
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,670
How do you do, Director Zhang.

777
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,600
First of all, thank you very much for enjoying my comic.

778
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,800
I hope we can have a pleasant collaboration.

779
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,800
About the content of comics,

780
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,950
here's what I think.

781
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,470
I have some new ideas,

782
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,710
and I hope to give you a briefing.

783
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,390
Sure, please.

784
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,120
Here's my idea.

785
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,390
What about making your little monster,

786
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,280
personified.

787
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,950
Then we give the little monster a romance,

788
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,470
and let him fight against evil monsters to level up.

789
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,950
Meanwhile, we lengthen the content.

790
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,040
The audience nowadays,

791
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,760
like that kind of stuff.

792
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,320
By the way, if the contract with this little lady

793
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,320
has no problem,

794
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,870
let's sign it today.

795
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,230
Excuse me, Director Zhang,

796
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,840
I need to go to the bathroom.

797
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:09,470
Director Zhang, will you excuse me for a moment.

798
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,320
Okay.

799
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:13,840
Xianxian,

800
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,470
are you all right?

801
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,560
Yeah.

802
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,520
I just find...

803
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:26,280
this is different than what I thought.

804
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,710
Xianxian,

805
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,470
people in this line of work

806
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,910
only care about maximizing profits,

807
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,950
which might make you a little uncomfortable.

808
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,080
But,

809
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:38,870
he doesn't even care about my idea about the work,

810
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,800
or the ideas I want to convey.

811
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,150
The two are inherently different.

812
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,190
The comic series that you started out at first was for yourself.

813
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:50,000
You don't need to care about other people's feelings.

814
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,840
But when it comes to commercial use,

815
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,360
you have to consider whether the public likes it or not.

816
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,800
That's just the way it is.
