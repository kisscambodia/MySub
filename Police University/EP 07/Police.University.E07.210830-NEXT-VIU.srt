1
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:16,645
Hey! Hold on. Where did he go?

2
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:19,054
- Go, team! - Go, team!

3
00:00:19,054 --> 00:00:20,609
- Hey, look! - Where's he going?

4
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:23,624
- What's going on? - Where are you going? Hey!

5
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,989
- Where's he going? - Where is he going now?

6
00:00:26,554 --> 00:00:28,219
Darn it!

7
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:33,235
(Residence Hall)

8
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:35,599
I got you, punk.

9
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,249
Hey.

10
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,519
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:02,019
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

12
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:04,959
I asked what you are doing here!

13
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:06,990
Why would you yell at me?

14
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:08,704
They told me not to return because of aftereffects.

15
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:11,775
Therefore, I was appointed as a professor...

16
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:13,029
at Korean National Police University.

17
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,270
So we're colleagues now.

18
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:16,699
What?

19
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:41,434
(Episode 7)

20
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,434
I thought you'd be happy to see me if I surprised you like this.

21
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:45,770
What's with that look on your face?

22
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:48,199
I'm just tired, that's all.

23
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:50,600
Why did you come here today of all days?

24
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:53,070
The sooner I come, the sooner I can start helping you out.

25
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:54,680
What?

26
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:57,745
I know you're investigating the illegal gambling ring here.

27
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:59,684
Captain told me everything.

28
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:00,814
Apparently, I told you...

29
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:02,820
that they're at the Police University.

30
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:05,049
You idiot, shut your mouth.

31
00:02:05,094 --> 00:02:06,790
How could you blurt it out here?

32
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:09,224
Leave at once. Get lost.

33
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:10,860
You're making me even more tired.

34
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,895
Come on. Where are you going?

35
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:15,564
We should go for a drink and celebrate me joining you here.

36
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:17,659
The restaurant across the street sells pork rinds.

37
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:25,770
Chul Jin asked for it, saying he wants to work by your side.

38
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:27,775
That's why I transferred him there.

39
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,045
Even so...

40
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:31,039
How could you do this without talking to me first?

41
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:33,979
Anyway, okay. I have to go.

42
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,680
What happened?

43
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:44,420
Because of this...

44
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:46,990
Do you know...

45
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:49,599
what I had to give up on today because of this?

46
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,700
What?

47
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:55,740
Someone sneaked into my empty room and went through my laptop.

48
00:02:56,374 --> 00:02:58,640
The frame for my family photo is broken.

49
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:04,210
(Captain)

50
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,050
Goodness.

51
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:07,779
Professor.

52
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:16,819
Professor.

53
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:21,289
Professor.

54
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:40,580
This jerk...

55
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:43,580
He's doing some funny things.

56
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:47,849
Professor.

57
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:49,689
Professor!

58
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,934
What are you going to do?

59
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:59,004
Hey, this is a homemade listening device,

60
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:01,170
and the maximum transmission range is 3km.

61
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:03,444
The only person within the distance who'd listen in on our talks...

62
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,275
is Mr. Go!

63
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,745
We don't know that for sure yet.

64
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:08,545
And even if it's him, what will you do right this instant?

65
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:11,115
I'll figure out what to do, so move out of my way!

66
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:12,555
Calm down.

67
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:15,355
That little rat. I will catch him!

68
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,450
- Please, Professor! - Let go, you punk!

69
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:20,489
(Korean National Police University)

70
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,260
Darn it.

71
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:32,299
Hey! Why did you try to stop me?

72
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:33,770
"Why"?

73
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,909
You told me to stop you when you were about to do something rash.

74
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:42,745
You said that's why every cop needs a partner...

75
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,615
and why 2 are better than 1.

76
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:47,510
You were the one who told me to do this. And what? "Why"?

77
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,155
Hey, this situation is...

78
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:53,150
So it's different in every situation?

79
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:55,659
Then take back what you said.

80
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:58,890
I don't care what happens. I won't stop you anymore!

81
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:03,260
So take back what you said.

82
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:05,799
Hey.

83
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:08,345
A real man...

84
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:11,770
never takes back his words because that's just embarrassing.

85
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:15,979
And since when did you always listen to me?

86
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,750
Okay, fine.

87
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:21,954
The fact that I had no idea that jerk has been...

88
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:25,950
sneaking into my office made me blow a fuse.

89
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:28,890
I'm sorry about that. Are we good now?

90
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:30,965
Why say that at the end and ruin your apology?

91
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,760
Wait until you get to my age because you'll be doing that too.

92
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:38,529
What are you going to do now?

93
00:05:38,874 --> 00:05:40,630
What do you think?

94
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:42,675
We'll get the serial number from the device...

95
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,444
and find out where and when it was purchased...

96
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,109
as well as who bought it.

97
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:48,840
Then we'll catch the culprit.

98
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:52,210
What?

99
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,254
No. Hold on.

100
00:05:58,254 --> 00:05:59,595
Hey, stop!

101
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:01,624
What's with those losers?

102
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:02,859
Stop!

103
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:07,190
Hey! You scumbag!

104
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:44,630
This is actually for the best.

105
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:47,229
Yes.

106
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:55,880
Why do you look so upset? What are you thinking about?

107
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:58,409
What do you think...

108
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:01,049
he gained from planting a bug?

109
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,824
Hey, think about what we gained.

110
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,595
We've now confirmed that the culprit is close by.

111
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,694
That we haven't been barking up the wrong tree.

112
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:12,365
He got scared and wiretapped me. Why?

113
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,004
It's because we're so close to catching him.

114
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,400
That's what's important here.

115
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,675
If the culprit is within the range,

116
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:20,429
that means we're in danger.

117
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,400
He even saw my family photo.

118
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:25,310
- Gosh. - Come on!

119
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:28,014
That's exactly what that jerk wants.

120
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,444
Getting scared by this.

121
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:30,985
And stepping back because we're scared...

122
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,155
so that we won't investigate him!

123
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:36,020
You punk. Are you going to feed him with what he wants?

124
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:38,179
But this is my first time!

125
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:41,454
I've never gone through this before.

126
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:43,489
Isn't it only natural that I'm scared?

127
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:53,770
Stop it!

128
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:57,374
You punk. Why are you whining here?

129
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:59,814
You should've gotten rid of such thoughts...

130
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,785
before coming here, you brat.

131
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:03,510
- Hey! - "Hey"?

132
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:08,555
What now? You want to have a go at me when I'm your professor?

133
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,285
Bring it on.

134
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:13,155
Gosh, that nutjob.

135
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:14,419
I can hear you.

136
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:21,960
What? Why? Are you really going to have a go at me?

137
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,200
Why did Chul Jin suddenly get transferred?

138
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:27,270
Am I the only one who finds it strange?

139
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,799
That he got transferred to our school now of all times?

140
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:33,310
Don't bark up the wrong tree.

141
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:37,115
Chul Jin is here to help with our investigation,

142
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:39,479
and I knew it all along.

143
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:41,950
Are you sure?

144
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:46,849
Are you sure you knew?

145
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,259
Of course, you punk!

146
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,639
Gosh.

147
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,639
Darn it.

148
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:27,430
Hey, Sun Ho.

149
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,670
Why did you do that?

150
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:38,670
Back in the field.

151
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:43,280
Oh, that...

152
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:49,780
I suddenly got a stomachache.

153
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,149
I must've eaten something bad during lunch.

154
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:57,259
My stomach was upset.

155
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:00,129
Is that true?

156
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:10,274
Five minutes to the evening roll call.

157
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:12,014
Get ready for the roll call.

158
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:14,239
I'll get going. Good night.

(Scientific Investigation, Professor Seo Sang Hak)

160
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:54,749
Do you know the serial murder case that occurred in saunas?

161
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,050
It was raining.

162
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:02,195
The night was chilly.

163
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:06,264
The phone rang sharply despite the loud sound of rain.

164
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:09,599
Ring!

165
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:11,634
"This is a sauna in Dogok-dong."

166
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:13,330
"There's a man dying here!"

167
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:14,670
"What did she say?"

168
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:19,009
When we arrived at the scene, the victim was already dead.

169
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:22,840
The suspect set the sauna on fire and fled.

170
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:25,615
All the evidence was destroyed,

171
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:28,455
and we were thinking this will cause us a headache.

172
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:29,783
But right then!

173
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:32,394
From a distance, someone shouted, "Inspector Seo! Come look at this!"

174
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:33,519
"What?"

175
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:37,359
One step, two steps.

176
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:40,530
I went close to the burned body.

177
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,899
"Wait, that is..."

178
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:47,170
The suspect's prints were clearly visible on the body.

179
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:50,170
You're bluffing!

180
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:54,840
Is this true?

181
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:00,154
Thanks to the prints left on the victim's body,

182
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:01,685
the case was solved.

183
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:04,050
It's the first case of Korea.

184
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:05,849
No way.

185
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:14,560
Professor Yu, when did you get here?

186
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:28,070
I heard you've been teaching as a professor your whole career.

187
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:33,310
It's just a rumor.

188
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:34,810
Oh, a rumor?

189
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:36,619
Right.

190
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:40,649
What brought you to the clubroom?

191
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:43,465
Oh, I wanted to...

192
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:45,865
ask you for a favor.

193
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,190
(Korean National Police University)

194
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:51,430
Why is the TV off?

195
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:56,399
My gosh.

196
00:12:57,304 --> 00:13:00,440
The first baseman, Kim Ji Ho, is dashing at full speed.

197
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:06,249
You've never tasted a beer like this. This is Gossi Beer.

198
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,009
What...

199
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:09,420
Darn it.

200
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:12,050
What was that about?

201
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:15,119
What?

202
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,920
Where did the remote control go?

203
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:24,729
Well...

204
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,030
Can you check if the print on this remote control...

205
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:32,570
is on this laptop?

206
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:35,379
Aren't you going to tell me...

207
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:38,554
the story behind this when you're asking for a favor?

208
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:41,149
Don't you think you need to tell me that?

209
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:43,920
Do you think you can handle it?

210
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:47,290
It might be disturbing.

211
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:52,190
I'm weakhearted, so...

212
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:54,294
Just consider it done.

213
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:55,735
It's nothing difficult anyway.

214
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,499
Okay. Thank you.

215
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:00,570
Oh, right.

216
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:03,170
There's also a difficult favor I must ask.

217
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,820
Do you need anything, Kang Hee?

218
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:26,660
I...

219
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,830
like you.

220
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:40,540
Are you that upset?

221
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:44,109
Do you want to use my holiday?

222
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:46,780
No, it's not because of that.

223
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:51,349
You're not even done.

224
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:55,763
Hey, guys! I got good news!

225
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,664
Did you hear?

226
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,259
They're giving everyone a holiday!

227
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:01,694
- What? - The faculty members decided it.

228
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:04,259
Everyone will get a day off!

229
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:07,475
- Are you sure? - Yes!

230
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:10,070
It looks like Professor Seo pushed ahead with it.

231
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,080
This is amazing!

232
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:22,180
Professor Seo is a romanticist in many ways.

233
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,550
Right.

234
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:26,654
But he used to be really scary when I was in school.

235
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:27,695
Oh, right.

236
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:29,995
You went to our school too, right?

237
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,160
- Yes, I did. - You know everything about him.

238
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,930
I guess you've become friends with him already.

239
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:36,404
I'm in the 25th batch.

240
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:37,935
I studied at the Yongin campus,

241
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:39,369
so I'm not very familiar with this one.

242
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:42,540
How did you become friends with Professor Yu?

243
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,575
He was my first supervisor in Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

244
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:48,144
Since then, I've followed him everywhere.

245
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:49,310
We were inseparable.

246
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:52,040
It seems like you remember everything.

247
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:55,450
Are you sure you're suffering from dissociative amnesia?

248
00:15:57,325 --> 00:16:00,119
That condition can be quite funny.

249
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:03,095
Some erase the entire memory of their first love.

250
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,294
Some erase the people they met in the army from their memory.

251
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:08,960
They say an entire part of your life gets erased.

252
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:12,629
But I'm not sure which part of mine got erased.

253
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:14,999
I hope only bad memories were erased.

254
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,639
Thank you.

255
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:18,815
She can be quite nosy.

256
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:21,609
Where is Professor Yu? Did he go home already?

257
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:23,884
What?

258
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:25,955
The surveillance cameras were all very old,

259
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:27,910
so we've been replacing all of them for a month.

260
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,249
So we don't have any recorded footage.

261
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,624
Then what am I supposed to do?

262
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,649
Sorry? About what?

263
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,825
Sorry about that. Darn it.

264
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:39,430
(Professor Yu Dong Man)

265
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:47,499
Gosh, you startled me.

266
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:49,300
Hey, airhead!

267
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:51,670
Are you here to see Dong Man? He isn't in.

268
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,879
I'm not sure if you saw the board,

269
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:06,320
but how could you order fried eggs at a pub?

270
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:10,720
Is there a law saying that you can't sell fried eggs at a pub?

271
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:14,395
I'm sure you know about laws better than me.

272
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:16,230
The one who breaks the law...

273
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,300
knows better than the one who keeps the law.

274
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:24,639
Well, we all live different lives.

275
00:17:25,514 --> 00:17:26,869
By the way,

276
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:29,614
did you leave...

277
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:32,179
after seeing me win in the relay race yesterday?

278
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:35,649
Relay race?

279
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:37,619
I didn't see it. Why?

280
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:40,990
Well, I was just curious if you did.

281
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:42,395
Since you came to school yesterday.

282
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:46,034
I see. I just looked around the school.

283
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:47,560
I went to the residence hall too.

284
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:49,199
I see.

285
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,230
Why are you so surprised? I was even more surprised.

286
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:04,040
I'll be off. It's about time for the roll call.

287
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:15,090
Of course I did.

288
00:18:15,324 --> 00:18:18,859
Gosh, you were so fast.

289
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,735
I see. So you did see me.

290
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:26,205
Sun Ho ran out first in a flash,

291
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:30,669
and you ran after him in a flash.

292
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:34,709
Are you saying that you won with that?

293
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:36,340
My goodness.

294
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:39,385
So he was watching all along?

295
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,510
Gosh.

296
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:48,619
I guess you and Sun Ho are very close.

297
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:54,030
You guys were totally like a team.

298
00:19:00,804 --> 00:19:02,699
Gosh, that jerk.

299
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:10,439
What do you think he gained from planting a bug?

300
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:13,409
Kang Sun Ho.

301
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,139
Eon Ju.

302
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:22,050
Sun Ho. This is the day.

303
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:24,149
Weren't you asleep?

304
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,655
(Korean National Police University)

305
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:29,324
Students in uniform are not allowed...

306
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:32,965
to stain the dignity of students at the Police University.

307
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,635
Putting your hands in your pocket, clasping them behind your back,

308
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,104
spitting,

309
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:40,230
smoking, or eating while walking are all forbidden.

310
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:43,344
Also, you're not allowed to enter places that can damage...

311
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:45,004
your reputation and dignity.

312
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:47,715
You're not allowed to enter places that are...

313
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:49,580
only for entertainment.

314
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:51,284
Refrain from all acts...

315
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,985
that can harm the dignity of the Police University.

316
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,584
What you do in your uniform...

317
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,084
can become the image of the police.

318
00:20:57,084 --> 00:20:59,524
Please keep that in mind.

319
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:03,090
We will now check your uniform and hair.

320
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:11,500
Your decision as a romanticist worked out.

321
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:15,399
It's against equity though.

322
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:20,540
I told you to say the right thing at a right time.

323
00:21:20,715 --> 00:21:22,614
People will talk behind your back.

324
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,609
You shouldn't hang out with abnormal people.

325
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,619
Don't fight.

326
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:33,449
Unfortunately, I'm not the romanticist.

327
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:34,590
What?

328
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,459
Wear your badge correctly.

329
00:21:46,235 --> 00:21:47,629
Shine your shoes.

330
00:21:50,104 --> 00:21:52,070
I have a date today.

331
00:21:52,274 --> 00:21:53,639
What are you doing today?

332
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,439
I...

333
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:59,754
have a very important appointment.

334
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:00,849
"Appointment"?

335
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,225
You're not hiding anything from me, right?

336
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:08,050
Of course not. I don't have anything.

337
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,959
Sun Ho, what are you doing today?

338
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:14,260
I...

339
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:16,459
I don't know yet.

340
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,780
If the culprit is within the range, that means we're in danger.

341
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:33,909
He even saw my family photo.

342
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:50,534
Sung Soo, what are you going to do?

343
00:22:50,534 --> 00:22:52,459
- I don't know. - Why not?

344
00:22:54,235 --> 00:22:57,300
Nice.

345
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,139
Let's sit here.

346
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:12,594
Why? Did you forget something?

347
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:16,520
I did. I need to drop by the residence hall. You go ahead.

348
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:17,959
All right.

349
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,490

Let's investigate Mr. Park too.

354

Like we did with Professor Kwon.

355
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:52,847
It's a relief if there's nothing.

356
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:54,647
So if we check thoroughly this time again...

357
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:55,771
I think...

358
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:58,712
I've told you that Chul Jin is not in the picture.

359
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:02,851

Stop working on this case.

363
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:27,771
Is it because I asked you to investigate Mr. Park?

364
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,917
Shouldn't you ask me why I think so first?

365
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:34,357
Save that foolish assumption for your reports.

366
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:36,152
Don't you hear me?

Don't come to my office.

368
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:42,456
From now on, the only place...

369
00:24:42,456 --> 00:24:44,462
that you and I will meet is the classroom.

370
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,002
Is that it?

371
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:58,142
The partner you've been saying?

372
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,811
You said you'll never give up on the investigation,

373
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:04,841
but this is it?

374
00:25:07,817 --> 00:25:09,321
You are scared.

375
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:14,121
Isn't that what you wanted to hear?

376
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:33,771
Gosh.

377
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:41,652
Do you think you can break it with that?

378
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:10,317
(Police University)

379
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:14,152
(Police University)

380
00:26:17,557 --> 00:26:20,426
Hey, why won't you take the shuttle bus?

381
00:26:20,426 --> 00:26:21,992
Why did you lie to me?

382
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:28,892
I wanted to kick you but took it out on the poor trash can instead.

383
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:31,462
Take the next bus!

384
00:26:43,347 --> 00:26:45,117
I'll just go get some tests done at the hospital.

385
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:47,657
When I'm back, we'll go for pork belly and drinks.

386
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:49,327
You'd better hurry.

387
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:50,781
The traffic is bad on weekends.

388
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:55,291
Dong Man, is everything okay?

389
00:26:57,226 --> 00:26:58,327
Why?

390
00:26:58,327 --> 00:26:59,762
You look like someone...

391
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:03,361
who just got dumped.

392
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,902
I'll be right back.

393
00:27:23,157 --> 00:27:24,452
You are scared.

394
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:26,791
Isn't that what you wanted to hear?

395
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:43,601
(Parking Reserved for Professors Only)

396
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:45,541
- Are you going somewhere? - Gosh, you startled me.

397
00:27:46,547 --> 00:27:48,571
Yes, I'm going somewhere.

398
00:27:49,347 --> 00:27:51,912
Where? Oh, you bought booze.

399
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:54,817
I'm not in the mood to joke with you.

400
00:27:54,817 --> 00:27:57,281
You're going to drink soju? With who? Is it a woman?

401
00:27:57,986 --> 00:28:01,192
Are you always this interested in everyone's business?

402
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:02,966
Or are you just like this with me?

403
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,192
Just with you.

404
00:28:06,496 --> 00:28:09,502
You're a dangerous lady. You really are.

405
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:14,071
Who is this woman? Is she prettier than me?

406
00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:16,242
That's impossible.

407
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:20,412
Get in the car if you're curious.

408
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:24,442
Are you crazy?

409
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:31,652
How long have you worked at the Police University?

410
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:35,752
I think this is my 7th or 8th year.

411
00:28:37,827 --> 00:28:40,892
Was Gossi Beer around when you first joined the school?

412
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:44,361
No, it suddenly opened one day.

413
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,307
That spot has always been like that.

414
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:50,172
It always had different owners doing different things.

415
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:53,377
But surprisingly, Mr. Go has been there for a while.

416
00:28:53,377 --> 00:28:56,212
And he befriended all the neighbors very quickly.

417
00:28:57,317 --> 00:28:58,512
Why do you ask?

418
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:02,182
I should pick up some ramyeon too.

419
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:04,551
Where are we going?

420
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:26,442
Do you really want to get kicked in the shin?

421
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:31,442
Just kick me.

422
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:35,081
Do it all you want, if it'll make you feel better.

423
00:29:35,186 --> 00:29:36,351
I can put up with it.

424
00:29:36,827 --> 00:29:39,551
But you know, the trial...

425
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,821
Hold on. Gosh.

426
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:46,061
I've been waiting for this day.

427
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,936
I even put on the uniform without knowing you were...

428
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:49,662
taking me to my mom's trial,

429
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:51,702
so I'm...

430
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:53,531
really upset right now.

431
00:29:54,107 --> 00:29:56,002
You'd better not follow me.

432
00:29:56,877 --> 00:29:58,972
If you do, I'll actually break your leg.

433
00:30:00,117 --> 00:30:01,642
Wait, Kang Hee...

434
00:30:06,186 --> 00:30:07,952
(Court in Session)

435
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:12,157
All the evidence shows that...

436
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:15,152
the defendant willingly participated in the opening of the casino.

437
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:18,361
yet the defendant refuses to accept it?

438
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,331
Well...

439
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:24,167
She admits to everything and...

440
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,871
Didn't she request an appeal because she can't accept it?

441
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:28,276
My point exactly!

442
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:29,476
(Defendant)

443
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:30,871
Let me do the talking.

444
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,012
Look, Prosecutor.

445
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,242
I admit that I gambled.

446
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:37,381
Ma'am.

447
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:40,186
They told me I had to open a crypto account...

448
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:42,557
or whatever it's called to place bets.

449
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:44,887
I had no idea what it was, so I asked them to take care of it.

450
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:47,857
That's why that man opened the account for me.

451
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:51,367
I played a few games with it but ended up blowing all the money.

452
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:53,397
Then I quit. That was a long time ago.

453
00:30:53,397 --> 00:30:55,897
And what? I opened the casino?

454
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,402
Come on! I'm not gutsy enough to do something like that.

455
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:02,002
I'd like to bring in a witness.

456
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:04,877
(Witness)

457
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:06,712
I clearly remember her telling me...

458
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:08,817
that she was running an illegal gambling site...

459
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:10,746
with some people in the Philippines...

460
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:12,611
and that it was very lucrative.

461
00:31:13,686 --> 00:31:14,886
You witch.

462
00:31:14,887 --> 00:31:17,186
Don't you dare lie like that.

463
00:31:17,186 --> 00:31:20,627
Why would I run away if I were running something so lucrative?

464
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:22,256
And why would I let my daughter...

465
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,621
freeload off other people all her life?

466
00:31:26,097 --> 00:31:27,762
Order!

467
00:31:29,436 --> 00:31:30,601
And Witness.

468
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:32,262
Spit out your gum, please.

469
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:33,672
Sure.

470
00:31:34,036 --> 00:31:38,271
You two. I bet you talked and decided to dump this all on me.

471
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:39,742
Ms. Oh Jung Ja.

472
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:42,912
You said your name was Oh Ga Eul.

473
00:31:44,147 --> 00:31:46,212
Why are you calling me by the name I do not wish to use?

474
00:31:46,357 --> 00:31:48,311
Do I not have any rights?

475
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:52,456
Hey. From the get-go, you were planning...

476
00:31:52,456 --> 00:31:54,597
to dump it all on me and close the case.

477
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:56,397
I may look like I've had an easy life,

478
00:31:56,397 --> 00:32:00,167
but I've been through all sorts of things. Don't mess with me!

479
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,831
I bet you were bribed. Who bribed you?

480
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,561
You call this the law?

481
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:09,676
Hey! Yes, you. As soon as I get out of jail,

482
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:12,571
I will kill you. Do you hear me?

483
00:32:16,986 --> 00:32:18,182
Let's go.

484
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:22,152
- You don't need to see this. - Order!

485
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:24,351
Is this the law?

486
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:29,962
No. You need to see this, Kang Hee.

487
00:32:31,926 --> 00:32:34,061
You are the only one who can tell whether or not...

488
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:35,831
your mom is telling the truth.

489
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:38,766
So you have to stay and watch the trial.

490
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,902
You'd better tell the truth.

491
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:43,776
Kang Sun Ho, let go.

492
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,301
You let go.

493
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:48,841
What are you guys doing in a courtroom?

494
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:50,412
Let go, both of you.

495
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:52,442
She's lying!

496
00:32:55,117 --> 00:32:56,781
Defendant, please be seated.

497
00:32:56,986 --> 00:32:59,551
Prosecutor, you may give your closing argument.

498
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:00,752
Let go!

499
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:02,756
The estimated sum of the bets...

500
00:33:02,756 --> 00:33:04,466
accumulated by this illegal gambling site...

501
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:08,091
under the defendant's name reaches tens of millions of dollars.

502
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,476
Her accomplice, Kim Soon Ae,

503
00:33:14,476 --> 00:33:17,501
has admitted to everything and withdrew the appeal,

504
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:21,616
whereas Defendant Oh Jung Ja, who has priors,

505
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:23,846
is busy listing excuses in this courtroom...

506
00:33:23,846 --> 00:33:26,312
instead of showing remorse.

507
00:33:26,516 --> 00:33:30,656
Ergo, the original sentence of two years in prison...

508
00:33:30,656 --> 00:33:33,027
along with the fine of 500,000 dollars...

509
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:36,027
for habitual gambling, setting up a site for gambling,

510
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:38,067
and violating the Electronic Financial Transactions Act was fair.

511
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:41,432
Hence, I ask the court to dismiss her appeal.

512
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,406
We will hear the defense counsel's closing argument...

513
00:33:46,406 --> 00:33:48,202
before we wrap up.

514
00:33:48,677 --> 00:33:49,941
Counsel.

515
00:33:54,217 --> 00:33:55,312
Your Honor.

516
00:33:56,846 --> 00:33:58,042
(Judge)

517
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:02,481
You know, I have admitted to everything I did.

518
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:05,582
Gambling? Yes, I gambled.

519
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:07,921
And I will gladly accept the punishment for it.

520
00:34:08,527 --> 00:34:09,751
But...

521
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:12,622
I refuse to be punished for something I didn't do.

522
00:34:13,697 --> 00:34:14,932
Opening the gambling site?

523
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:23,401
I swear on my daughter's name.

524
00:34:24,346 --> 00:34:27,571
I never did such a thing.

00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:14,441
I know her.

547
00:37:15,147 --> 00:37:17,242
I know how she's like when she lies.

548
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:22,111
When I was seven,

549
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:26,751
I asked her why I'm the only one without a dad,

550
00:37:27,697 --> 00:37:29,622
and she said this while avoiding my eyes.

551
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:33,861
"Your dad is working abroad."

552
00:37:35,897 --> 00:37:37,662
When I was 13,

553
00:37:38,107 --> 00:37:40,671
I asked her if she's going to prison again,

554
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:43,131
and she avoided my eyes again and said...

555
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,242
that she's not.

556
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:50,841
But she did.

557
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,211
That's when I realized it.

558
00:37:56,116 --> 00:37:57,381
That...

559
00:37:58,357 --> 00:38:01,091
if Mom avoids my eyes,

560
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,361
that means she's lying.

561
00:38:10,036 --> 00:38:12,901
But in the courtroom, she looked straight into my eyes.

562
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:21,742
Mom didn't do it.

563
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:36,091
I'm asking this because I'm dumbfounded.

564
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:39,321
Why are you here?

565
00:38:39,496 --> 00:38:40,832
My point exactly.

566
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:42,861
Because I'm lonely.

567
00:38:44,237 --> 00:38:46,461
Why would you come here when you're lonely?

568
00:38:46,837 --> 00:38:48,107
My point exactly.

569
00:38:48,107 --> 00:38:50,031
Because I'm super lonely.

570
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:52,602
Your close colleague got transferred.

571
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:54,211
Why didn't you go see him?

572
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:58,142
Hey, when people are super lonely,

573
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,981
they meet people they're not close to.

574
00:39:01,857 --> 00:39:04,281
The closer you are, you can't be honest.

575
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:06,622
There are times when you can't share everything.

576
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,337
- What? - Here.

577
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:20,976
I thought you wouldn't let me use it because it's expensive.

578
00:39:20,976 --> 00:39:23,231
Just hang onto it while I use the restroom.

579
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:29,972
Gosh, am I getting old?

580
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:32,886
What's going on, seriously?

581
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:35,012
Why did you become so weak? What's wrong?

582
00:39:37,757 --> 00:39:38,981
You know...

583
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:42,757
I said all those things, knowing I'll regret it later,

584
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:45,792
but I'm regretting it already. Darn it.

585
00:39:47,436 --> 00:39:49,392
Then why did you say it?

586
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:52,531
I didn't want to regret it more later.

587
00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:56,131
It's strange.

588
00:39:56,406 --> 00:40:00,102
I'm not sure what it's about, but why are you already scared?

589
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:03,512
I guess it's because I have people to protect now.

590
00:40:03,786 --> 00:40:05,812
I'm scared to make choices.

591
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:09,751
Who is that woman? Is she prettier than me?

592
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:12,981
Gosh.

593
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:46,781
- Eon... - Eon Ju!

594
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:02,872
What... Noh Bum Tae?

595
00:41:04,947 --> 00:41:06,102

598

I have a date with Eon Ju.

599
00:41:17,587 --> 00:41:18,852
- Cheers. - Cheers.

600
00:41:23,897 --> 00:41:25,622
How could you not tell me?

601
00:41:26,797 --> 00:41:29,662
You're the one who didn't tell me. I told you I have a date.

602
00:41:29,837 --> 00:41:31,961
Hey, what's the problem?

603
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:34,877
You both wanted to see me,

604
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:37,401
so I thought we could all meet up.

605
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:40,242
Here. Drink up!

606

Hey, is this the date you mentioned?

608
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:53,421
What? You're not keeping any secret from me?

609
00:41:55,527 --> 00:41:57,162
What? Are you not going to drink it?

610
00:41:57,596 --> 00:41:58,892
Drin up.

611
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:01,162
Hurry up!

612
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,366
When it comes to alcohol,

613
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:06,702

614
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:11,075
- Drink up! - Bottoms up!

615

- No, never mind. - What about me and Min Kyu?

637
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:43,091
I was wondering if you two were seeing each other.

638
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:46,932
Are you crazy? He's just a friend.

Sorry? Not at all.

I mean, he is nice.

694
00:47:59,662 --> 00:48:03,401
But he's pretty decisive, and he rarely gets flustered.

695
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:06,401
Also, he's very outspoken, so our classmates look up to him.

I've never seen him like that.

700
00:48:15,742 --> 00:48:17,676

703
00:48:27,122 --> 00:48:29,687
But he's all protective of me now that he's grown up.

704
00:48:31,432 --> 00:48:34,397
He was like the Polkaroo when he was little.

705
00:48:35,762 --> 00:48:37,866
He'd be right behind me when I thought he wasn't there.

706
00:48:38,472 --> 00:48:40,397
And when I thought he was there, he was gone.

00:50:44,762 --> 00:50:46,187
Yoon Taek Il?

728
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:48,702
Do you have any photos of Sun Ho when he was a baby?

729
00:50:48,702 --> 00:50:50,926
I only see photos of him grown up.

730
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:52,271
Oh, that's...

731
00:50:52,271 --> 00:50:55,567
We moved around a lot,

732
00:50:55,642 --> 00:50:58,067
so I don't have photos of my sons when they were little.

733
00:51:03,242 --> 00:51:06,147
Is that why he seemed like an outsider to me as well?

734
00:51:18,961 --> 00:51:20,996
Do you like her that much?

735
00:51:23,101 --> 00:51:24,967
Why are you so surprised?

736
00:51:27,032 --> 00:51:30,472
Well, we're just friends.

737
00:51:30,472 --> 00:51:31,642
What are you talking about?

738
00:51:31,642 --> 00:51:35,576
Figure out where things stand, no matter what her answer may be.

739
00:51:36,342 --> 00:51:37,547
Right.

740
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:47,446
Dad.

741
00:51:49,122 --> 00:51:50,886
You said this to me a while back.

742
00:51:51,492 --> 00:51:53,386
About things that happen before I become a cop,

743
00:51:54,032 --> 00:51:56,056
you said I can repay them in the future.

744
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:57,826
Yes, I did.

745
00:51:59,202 --> 00:52:01,036
But what if...

746
00:52:02,501 --> 00:52:06,437
dangerous things happen when I do that?

747
00:52:07,142 --> 00:52:11,306
And what if I fail to protect someone who is dear to me?

748
00:52:12,251 --> 00:52:13,607
What should I do, then?

749
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:17,987
That thought terrifies me.

750
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:22,016
I'm scared. My head is telling me not to do it...

751
00:52:22,461 --> 00:52:26,056
and that I don't need to do it. But the thing is...

752
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:27,996
But...

753
00:52:28,032 --> 00:52:29,797
you want to do it.

754
00:52:31,872 --> 00:52:33,366
Then you should do it.

755
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:36,167
You've always held yourself back,

756
00:52:36,601 --> 00:52:39,467
so the fact that you're this torn...

757
00:52:39,811 --> 00:52:41,237
tells me that you should do it.

758
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:49,176
Just do it.

759
00:52:49,651 --> 00:52:51,547
But make sure you do it properly.

760
00:52:52,552 --> 00:52:55,987
Only then will you become a great police officer...

761
00:52:56,122 --> 00:52:58,127
who can protect everyone who is dear to you.

762
00:53:01,862 --> 00:53:02,996
As your dad,

763
00:53:04,572 --> 00:53:07,397
I will always believe in the decisions that you make.

764
00:53:32,691 --> 00:53:35,957
Why don't we try to analyze this burner phone's call patterns?

765
00:53:36,162 --> 00:53:38,932
There's a program that analyzes call patterns and frequency.

766
00:53:38,932 --> 00:53:40,872
If we look into the base station using that,

767
00:53:40,872 --> 00:53:44,467
we should be able to track down the person using the burner phone.

768
00:53:55,531 --> 00:53:56,867
Done.

769
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:05,106
(Soju)

770
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:13,416
Is the investigation still ongoing?

771
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:17,787
Yes, I haven't caught the culprit yet.

772
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:21,657
Is Kang Sun Ho working on it with you?

773
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,296
Why are you so surprised?

774
00:54:25,602 --> 00:54:27,226
It's so obvious.

775
00:54:27,872 --> 00:54:30,996
Well, I was just training him.

776
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:32,666
But he's no longer involved.

777
00:54:34,002 --> 00:54:35,436
That's why you're lonely now.

778
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:42,206
When you're investigating a case, you have to suspect...

779
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:45,476
even those closest to you if you spot anything suspicious.

780
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:48,586
It can be awful and lonely,

781
00:54:49,991 --> 00:54:51,287
but you have to do it.

782
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:54,456
That's why you were suspicious of me as well?

783
00:54:59,002 --> 00:55:00,626
Just like fishing,

784
00:55:01,332 --> 00:55:03,097
the investigation will eventually come to an end.

785
00:55:03,431 --> 00:55:07,867
What or whom will I see at the end of this investigation,

786
00:55:08,611 --> 00:55:10,737
and what will happen in the end?

787
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:14,336
I'm scared to find out.

788
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,746
That's when you can...

789
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:19,177
lean on your friends.

790
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:28,487
Just come here anytime you're lonely.

791
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,796
What? You caught one.

792
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:37,496
What?

793
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:41,111
- Gosh. - Wow!

794
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:43,942
Gosh, what's this? I caught one!

795
00:55:43,942 --> 00:55:45,542
- Oh, my! Help me. - Wow!

796
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,312
- Help me! - Hold on.

797
00:55:47,312 --> 00:55:48,746
- Wait. - Grab it!

798
00:55:49,151 --> 00:55:50,976
My gosh.

799
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:53,447
- Look at that. - Wow.

800
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:56,646
Goodness.

801
00:55:57,861 --> 00:55:59,487
My gosh.

802
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,557
Your dad seems like a nice man.

803
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,097
You've grown up well.

804
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:15,307
Anyway, don't tell anyone that I slept over at your place.

805
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:18,807
I don't want people to gossip when we're not even seeing each other.

806
00:56:21,551 --> 00:56:22,746
Kang Hee.

807
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:28,746
I'll catch the real culprit of your mother's case.

808
00:56:30,022 --> 00:56:33,186
I'll put everything back to normal.

809
00:56:34,732 --> 00:56:36,086
Actually,

810
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:39,896
I've been investigating a case with Professor Yu.

811
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,626
I see.

812
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:46,496
- What? - I couldn't finish the race...

813
00:56:46,801 --> 00:56:48,606
because of that investigation.

814
00:56:49,611 --> 00:56:51,476
What are you investigating?

815
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:55,756
I mean, is that related to my mom's case?

816
00:56:57,231 --> 00:56:58,466
That...

817
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:03,136
I'll tell you after I discuss it with Professor Yu.

818
00:57:04,201 --> 00:57:07,242
I'm planning to have it out with him today.

819
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:08,437
Have it out?

820
00:57:09,141 --> 00:57:11,506
Yes, and...

821
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:15,317
I'm going to have it out with you after him.

822
00:57:16,451 --> 00:57:19,787
It's about time we have it out and decide what we are.

823
00:57:29,061 --> 00:57:31,366
(Professor Yu Dong Man)

824
00:57:31,601 --> 00:57:34,466
Yes, I'll go to your office.

825
00:57:40,112 --> 00:57:43,207
(KCSI)

826
00:57:49,021 --> 00:57:50,446
Did you get his print?

827
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:57,317
Yes, I did, but...

828
00:57:58,962 --> 00:58:02,397
(Forensic Science Room)

829
00:58:13,742 --> 00:58:16,076
The print on this laptop...

830
00:58:16,212 --> 00:58:18,846
wasn't found on this remote control you brought...

831
00:58:19,951 --> 00:58:22,046
but on this plastic cup.

832
00:58:23,782 --> 00:58:27,116
You look like someone who just got dumped.

833
00:58:27,552 --> 00:58:30,357
I'll be right back. Goodness.

834
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:00,546
Dong Man.

835
00:59:10,132 --> 00:59:11,326
Professor Yu.

836
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:25,946
I can't stop working on this case.

837
00:59:26,212 --> 00:59:28,776
No. I won't.

838
00:59:30,222 --> 00:59:32,116
You said the culprit is here.

839
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:37,317
- How did you... - I must...

840
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,787
catch the culprit at all costs.

841
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:43,957
So that I can...

842
00:59:45,072 --> 00:59:46,866
protect the people I love.

843
00:59:51,512 --> 00:59:53,136
I've made up my mind,

844
00:59:53,942 --> 00:59:55,537
so you should decide.

845
00:59:56,641 --> 00:59:58,076
I must...

846
00:59:59,251 --> 01:00:01,477
see the end of this case.

847
01:00:03,552 --> 01:00:04,676
Dong Man.

848
01:00:55,541 --> 01:00:57,972
(Police University)

849
01:00:57,972 --> 01:01:00,811
You're not getting Sun Ho...

850
01:01:00,811 --> 01:01:03,311
involved in your private matter, are you?

851
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:04,612
You did it, didn't you?

852
01:01:04,612 --> 01:01:05,882
We don't know if you were injured...

853
01:01:05,882 --> 01:01:06,981
while carrying out a sting operation...

854
01:01:06,981 --> 01:01:08,877
or if you're just putting on a show.

855
01:01:08,922 --> 01:01:10,521
Is that really what you think?

856
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:11,951
Do you know what this is?

857
01:01:11,951 --> 01:01:13,021
I got a report.

858
01:01:13,021 --> 01:01:16,187
It says that the sample questions going around the students...

859
01:01:16,462 --> 01:01:18,532
seem to be the exam paper for Criminal Investigation.

860
01:01:18,532 --> 01:01:19,692
He can't deny it.

861
01:01:19,692 --> 01:01:21,462
They even found an envelope of money in his office.

862
01:01:21,462 --> 01:01:22,701
The arrest warrant will be issued soon.

863
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:24,101
You must hurry.

864
01:01:24,101 --> 01:01:26,671
We'll be able to save Professor Yu, right?

865
01:01:26,672 --> 01:01:28,767
I'm going to save your supervisor.
