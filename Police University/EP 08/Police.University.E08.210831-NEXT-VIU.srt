1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,740
(All characters, places, institutions, incidents,)

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,996
(and organizations portrayed in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:13,065
Goodness, I'm coming.

4
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:15,575
- Darn you. - Shut it.

5
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:19,046
(4 years ago)

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,046
Is it the dirtbag in Incheon?

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,351
I'll go with you.

8
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,191
Go away, punk. You're so annoying.

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,519
What are you going to do all by yourself?

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,421
Don't you know that the award ceremony is tomorrow?

11
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:31,561
And it's been 1 year since I joined Crime Investigation Team 1.

12
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:32,791
I'm your partner.

13
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:36,100
Partner, my foot. Give me a break.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,825
Go away.

15
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,865
I'll show you...

16
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:41,935
that I deserve to be called your partner.

17
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:46,435
Gosh, seriously.

18
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,536
Stop, you jerk!

19
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:52,445
- Hey! - Stop right there!

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,755
I told you not to follow me!

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,426
- Darn it! - Gosh.

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,365
Gosh.

23
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,436
Darn it.

24
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:20,925
Step back.

25
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:44,345
Darn it. Where did he go?

26
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,916
No!

27
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,786
Chul Jin!

28
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,655
That crazy scum!

29
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,096
Let go!

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,041
Let go of me, you jerk!

31
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,266
Chul Jin!

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,550
I said, let go of me, you jerk!

33
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,006
I'll never let you go!

34
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,245
Dong Man!

35
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:07,696
Over there!

36
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,536
I'm sorry that I left you behind...

37
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,705
when I'm your partner.

38
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,506
You don't have to be sorry.

39
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:27,715
Now that I have a stab wound,

40
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:29,645
it's kind of cool,

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,816
but it was really scary.

42
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,786
How will I ever go after a suspect alone at night?

43
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,055
You will never go out alone, you punk.

44
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:42,326
From now,

45
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,840
I'll always be behind you,

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,335
so don't be scared.

47
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,506
Darn it.

48
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,506
Darn it.

49
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,645
My gosh.

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,715
Dong Man.

51
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,395
The print on this laptop...

52
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,296
wasn't found on this remote control you brought...

53
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,736
but on this plastic cup.

54
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,106
Professor Yu.

55
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:40,815
I can't stop working on this case.

56
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,425
No. I won't.

57
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,096
You said the culprit is here.

58
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,770
How did you...

59
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,966
I must...

60
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,540
catch the culprit at all costs.

61
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,666
So that...

62
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,706
I can protect...

63
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,406
the people I love.

64
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:06,476
I've made up my mind,

65
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,786
so you should decide.

66
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:11,255
I must...

67
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,526
see the end of this case.

68
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,385
Dong Man.

69
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:35,675
("Defensive Tactics")

70
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,115
It looks like he's back, but...

71
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,416
Where is Sun Ho? Is he at the library to save our seats?

72
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:48,726
Everyone is there because our finals started.

73
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,856
Who are you? Do you know me?

74
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:55,170
I'm here to see my friend, Sun Ho.

75
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,501
- Please leave. - I'm leaving!

76
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,195
- Go! - Come on!

77
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,505
Sun Ho!

78
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,580
Hi.

79
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,206
Wait. That seat is reserved.

80
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,875
Sorry.

81
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:20,586
Where did he go to have it out with the professor?

82
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,226
(Stir-fried Cartilage, Boneless Chicken Feet)

83
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,681
Why are you drinking so much? Do you want to get drunk?

84
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:44,175
My gosh.

85
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,995
You go first.

86
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:01,765
Sorry?

87
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,265
Go ahead and explain why you think...

88
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:07,195
he's the culprit.

89
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,935
What? What are you talking about? Are you calling me the culprit?

90
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,216
I finished analyzing Chul Jin's communications data.

91
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:24,856
What?

92
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:27,420
When a burner phone that picked up a signal...

93
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,726
from a cell site near our school...

94
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:30,691
called Chul Jin's phone,

95
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:33,325
Chul Jin's phone picked up a signal...

96
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:35,565
from the same cell site a few hours later.

97
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:37,096
Several times, at that.

98
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,466
Gosh.

99
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,106
- So? - That means the owner...

100
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,536
of the burner phone called him, and he came to the school.

101
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:50,206
The calls, travel route, and the same cell site.

102
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:53,280
I kept seeing the same pattern.

103
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,391
What nonsense are you spewing, you punk?

104
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,956
Hey! This is unbelievable.

105
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,896
Are you certain of the causality?

106
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,125
Are you sure that's all there is?

107
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:09,666
Wasn't there a case where I called him,

108
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,135
and he came over to the school?

109
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,865
Your speculation lacks basis.

110
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,976
But that doesn't mean that it's not true.

111
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,776
Why did you come to our school...

112
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,115
when Professor Yu didn't call you?

113
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,125
Why is this jerk... He keeps talking nonsense.

114
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,971
Dong Man, it's not me.

115
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:44,466
Why would I do something like that?

116
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,795
Shut your mouth and follow me.

117
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,176
Why that little...

118
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:15,295
Dong Man, you don't believe a word he's blabbering, do you?

119
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,736
Dong Man. Say something!

120
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:26,176
Why did you touch Sun Ho's laptop?

121
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:33,346
Dong Man.

122
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:36,150
Are you talking about the laptop on his desk?

123
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,846
I just took a look because I got curious.

124
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,415
What about you?

125
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,385
Why did you dig up on my communications data?

126
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,895
What are you accusing me of?

127
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,660
We don't know if you were injured...

128
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,165
while carrying out a sting operation...

129
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,736
or if you're just putting on a show...

130
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:54,635
because you're working for those jerks.

131
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:56,106
Are you serious?

132
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,405
We don't know if you touched his laptop...

133
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,405
to dig something up from it or not!

134
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:09,446
Is that really what you think?

135
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,991
I've been working as your partner for six years,

136
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,785
and I even got stabbed!

137
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,125
That's why I know you well.

138
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:23,865
I know the face you make when you lie.

139
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,275
Just go, Chul Jin.

140
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:18,856
Sir, can you make a U-turn?

141
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,736
Do I make a U-turn or not?

142
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:43,106
Mr. Park Chul Jin.

143
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:51,655
You were in my car last time too.

144
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:54,155
I can't do this.

145
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:57,655
I want to stop here.

146
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,295
This is too much.

147
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,395
Seriously.

148
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,206
Sir, please stop the car.

149
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,736
I can see that you remember it.

150
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:19,875
He will call you.

151
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,169
(Korean National Police University)

152
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,700
You're almost done with submitting the exam papers, right?

153
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,270
Yes, except for the Investigation Studies.

154
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,365
I see.

155
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:47,676
Professor Yu, you must upload them to the cloud by tomorrow night.

156
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,115
Professor Yu?

157
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:55,216
- What? - The exam papers.

158
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,285
Oh, right. I got it.

159
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:02,930
Okay then. Let's wrap it up here.

160
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,456
- Okay. - Good job, everyone.

161
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:08,770
Do you want to go for a drive after submitting them tomorrow?

162
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,895
Where to?

163
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:12,741
You know. Misa-ri or Yangsu-ri.

164
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:13,940
Anywhere that ends with "ri".

165
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,341
Why would you go to such places?

166
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,940
It's dark, the roads are narrow, and accidents occur there a lot.

167
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,280
That's why we're going there.

168
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,706
It's dark and narrow, and I'm hoping for some accidents there.

169
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,545
What happened? Did he just turn me down?

170
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:38,395
Gosh, the deadly exams are coming up.

171
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:40,101
I've already messed up my mid-terms,

172
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:42,895
so I'm dead if I mess it up again in the finals.

173
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,169
Right, you're dead already.

174
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,596
No, it's not.

175
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:10,785
How is it going with studying? You want to grab some coffee?

176
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,066
Here you go.

177
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,135
So... Did you make up with Professor Yu?

178
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:28,375
Not yet. I think he needs more time.

179
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,216
But I'm sure he'll be fine soon.

180
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:35,645
From what I know, he's always like that.

181
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,091
I thought you were just investigating together,

182
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:39,686
but I guess you guys got close too.

183
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:41,591
We always fight.

184
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,160
That means you guys are close.

185
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,625
If not, why would you even fight? You'd just ignore each other.

186
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:51,200
So when are you going to tell me...

187
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,865
about that investigation you're doing with him?

188
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,936
Well...

189
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,635
We haven't had it out yet.

190
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,275
- I'm sorry. - What's there to be?

191
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,976
I'm going to have it out with you after him.

192
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,515
It's about time we have it out and decide what we are.

193
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,800
Hey, I'm not asking because I want to have it out with you.

194
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,826
I was curious since it seemed like it's related to my mom.

195
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:33,775
What? Why are you smiling now?

196
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:36,751
I don't have time for this.

197
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:38,915
Let's go. I'll finish it off.

198
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,745
You don't have time for this? Hey, Sun Ho!

199

(Investigation Studies Exam)

200
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,436
Sir, are you available now?

201
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,966
Gosh.

202
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,576
Goodness.

203
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,375
Since when did you know about it?

204
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,015
That the culprit is in the Police University.

205
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,415
After the sports festival.

206
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:56,726
I heard you talking with Mr. Park.

207
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,655
You punk. Why would you eavesdrop on grown-ups' talking?

208
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:03,625
Why didn't you tell me about it?

209
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,995
I wasn't so sure about it.

210
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:08,871
It could've just confused the investigation.

211
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:11,366
But still, we got the bug.

212
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:13,105
Isn't it clear enough?

213
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,281
Nothing is ever clear enough.

214
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:17,105
You've never done a proper investigation.

215
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,285
We first went after the illegal gambling gang.

216
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,320
Whether they are in the Police University or not,

217
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:29,585
they are close to us. That's a fact.

218
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:34,156
If Chul Jin is the culprit,

219
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,131
don't you think we should investigate...

220
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:39,166
how deep he is involved in,

221
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:41,595
and who is hiding behind him?

222
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:50,345
So that means you're going to do it right.

223
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,146
You won't back off no matter what, right?

224
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,015
Didn't you hear anything?

225
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,831
Of course I won't back off.

226
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:06,055
What do you want me to say?

227
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:10,071
You can't avoid it even if you want to.

228
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:12,301
Nothing will change if I stop.

229
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,835
I should at least keep going to get something out of it, right?

230
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:21,275
I don't know what's at the end of this investigation,

231
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:23,676
but we'll see when we get there.

232
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,815
I'll stop him from doing anything.

233
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,555
I'll do whatever I can...

234
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,855
to stop him from investigating.

235
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,555
I'll get it done this time.

236
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:43,295
If you give me one last chance...

(Professor Yu Dong Man)

239
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,285
Why did I choose to become a police officer?

240
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,490
Tell me about it. If we mess up the exams...

241
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,631
and fail to graduate,

242
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:46,055
we won't be able to become one anyway.

243
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:50,031
Gosh, study more instead of worrying about it.

244
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,866
- I can't focus on studying. - Guys.

245
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,535
You know what this is?

246
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,035
- What is this? - What's that?

247
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:00,236
- Goodness! - Why?

248
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:04,680
You all know the legendary graduate...

249
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,051
who got straight-A in every class for four years.

250
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:08,920
The one at the headquarters now, so-called the next commissioner.

251
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,085
- Of course I know. - This is...

252
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,160
These are the sample questions that he used to study.

253
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,355
- Gosh. - Goodness.

254
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,190
- How much for a page? - Give your price first.

255
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,626
There won't be any negotiations, right?

256
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:24,565
Guys, we're at the Police University.

257
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,271
If you get into something speculative...

258
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:28,835
- Fried chicken. - Okay, fried chicken.

259
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,436
And pizza.

260
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,105
- Pizza? - And beer.

261
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,881
Beer?

262
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:37,206
I'm not in.

263
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,781
- Are you sure? - Yes, I'll be off.

264
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,891
- And the blind date. - Really? Blind date?

265
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:43,950
And the blind date expenses.

266
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,716
- Are you sure? - Yes, totally.

267
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:20,815
Stop staring at me and read your book, will you?

268
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:22,626
Okay.

269
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:32,966
Right, did the talk with your professor go well?

270
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:37,335
I did talk to him but...

271
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,676
Sorry.

272
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,815
Just until the exams are over.

273
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:49,616
After that,

274
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:52,815
you'll have to tell me everything.

275
00:21:54,321 --> 00:21:55,825
Okay, I will.

276
00:21:57,591 --> 00:21:58,825
Try to focus again.

277
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:00,726
Okay.

278
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,075
Hey, Min Kyu. Did you see this?

279
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,146
Give it back when you're done.

280
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,666
Mr. Park Chul Jin seemed to have regained his memory.

281
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:40,795
You didn't know?

(Professor Baek)

285
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,605
- Hello? - Professor Yu.

286
00:23:20,341 --> 00:23:22,745
I got a report from a student.

287
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,876
It says that the sample questions going around the students...

288
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,745
seem to be the exam paper for Investigation Studies.

289
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,095
Professor Yu, is it true?

290
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,265
Is it the exam paper?

291
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,396
Yes, it is. How did this get out?

292
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:53,936
The exam for Investigation Studies hasn't been uploaded yet though.

293
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,505
Did you print a copy of it by any chance?

294
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:02,986
Yes, I printed a copy last night to do a final check.

295
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,116
Then do you remember if anyone visited your office...

296
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:07,616
after you finished writing all the exam questions?

297
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,930
First, let's check the CCTV footage from the camera in the hallway.

298
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,095
Okay.

299
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:18,726
Yes, Mr. Hyun.

300
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,035
Professor Yu, can I have a word with you?

301
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,910
The old exam questions you were looking at this morning?

302
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,775
Yes. Apparently, they were for our Investigation Studies exam.

303
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,815
I guess they were leaked somehow.

304
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:38,186
Where's Professor Yu?

305
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,916
It's been reported to Asan Police Station as well.

306
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:45,896
They called and said their officers are on their way now.

307
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,166
I see.

308
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,295
Let me ask you again.

309
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,366
After you completed writing all the exam questions,

310
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:59,075
did anyone visit your office that night?

311
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,605
One of my students stopped by.

312
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,676
Was it Kang Sun Ho again?

313
00:25:08,851 --> 00:25:10,045
Yes.

314
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:12,121
It was Sun Ho.

315
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:15,355
But we just talked. And until he left my office,

316
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:17,260
I was there with him the whole time.

317
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,690
The CCTV footage will prove it.

318
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,765
The laptop you submitted for fingerprint analysis...

319
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,495
is also his, isn't it?

320
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:32,035
You're not getting Sun Ho...

321
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,476
involved in your private matter, are you?

322
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:41,376
I hope that is not the case, Professor Yu.

323
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:48,255
You may return to your office.

324
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:52,156
Yes, sir.

325
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,470
You're not getting Sun Ho...

326
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,305
involved in your private matter, are you?

327
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,206
I hope that is not the case, Professor Yu.

328
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,245
Gosh, I have a headache now.

329
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,956
What is this?

330
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,166
What in the world...

331
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,575
Professor Yu Dong Man, we're from Asan Police Station.

332
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,150
- What's that behind you? - Nothing.

333
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,515
What is this?

334
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:54,956
Professor...

335
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,626
Professor.

336
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,693
Professor. Wait.

337
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,832
Say something! Please?

338
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:16,133
This can't be true.

339
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:19,373
- Professor! - Just a moment.

340
00:27:23,578 --> 00:27:26,012
Professor Yu can get in my car. We'll follow you.

341
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,878
But we were told to arrest him immediately.

342
00:27:28,878 --> 00:27:31,018
You don't have solid evidence yet,

343
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:34,183
so it's unnecessary to do this in front of the students.

344
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:36,058
From the tone of my voice, I'm sure you can tell...

345
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:38,623
that I'll take issue with this if this conversation drags on.

346
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:40,723
And from the look on my face, you can tell...

347
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,092
that I want to wrap up this talk if you got my point.

348
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,102
You know where Asan Police Station is, right?

349
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:09,252
(Stop)

350
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,842
You didn't have to do this.

351
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,613
I said we should go for a drive.

352
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,782
Although it's not dark yet, and we're driving on a wide road.

353
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:41,352
But there has been an accident indeed.

354
00:28:42,257 --> 00:28:44,628
A case, not an accident.

355
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:46,123
It is an accident.

356
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:49,193
An accident that was sprung on you out of the blue.

357
00:28:54,697 --> 00:28:59,133
Did this happen because I didn't step on the brakes?

358
00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:04,572
I wonder if this was done to stop me...

359
00:29:05,007 --> 00:29:06,613
because I wasn't going to stop.

360
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,943
(Korean National Police University)

361
00:29:14,858 --> 00:29:16,752
I'm not sure if this is an appropriate analogy,

362
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:20,252
but there's a day I regret the most in my whole life.

363
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:24,822
That day, I had an awful dream.

364
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:29,032
So I told my husband to skip work for just one day...

365
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:32,433
and go to the beach somewhere with me.

366
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:34,772
But he was adamant about going to work no matter what I said.

367
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:38,943
He was like that. Regardless of what I said,

368
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,512
he remained stubborn and did everything his way.

369
00:29:44,747 --> 00:29:48,782
If I knew we'd never be able to go to the sea again,

370
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,282
I should've stopped him at all costs.

371
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:55,223
I should've done everything I could to stop him.

372
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,762
I should've done something at least.

373
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:00,532
I regret it every day.

374
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:08,233
You need to stay alive...

375
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:11,542
to forgive and make up.

376
00:30:15,818 --> 00:30:17,012
Don't you think so?

379
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:27,453
(Lee Ju Won)

380
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,967
He can't deny it.

381
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:38,223
They even found an envelope of money in his office.

382
00:31:38,628 --> 00:31:40,592
But I find it suspicious.

383
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:43,268
They found the evidence too easily. It's strange.

384
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,403
That's true.

385
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:47,437
He was once called a legend of Investigation Studies.

386
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:49,742
I don't think he'd have been this sloppy.

387
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:50,943
Exactly.

388
00:31:50,947 --> 00:31:53,742
He doesn't seem like the type to receive bribes either.

389
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:57,282
- Right? - You never know.

390
00:31:57,618 --> 00:32:00,252
He'll either be dismissed or fired.

391
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:03,822
Do you think they'll fire him?

392
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:19,203
So that means you're going to do it right.

393
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:21,538
You won't back off no matter what, right?

394
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:23,947
Of course I won't back off.

395
00:32:23,947 --> 00:32:26,072
What do you want me to say?

396
00:32:28,717 --> 00:32:29,842
Hello.

397
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:33,852
Sun Ho.

398
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:41,393
All right. Thank you.

399
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:45,693
They're starting his investigation now.

400
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,602
Why won't they let us see the surveillance camera footage?

401
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:05,913
Take a careful look.

402
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,888
Someone turned the surveillance camera,

403
00:33:07,888 --> 00:33:09,483
so it caught nothing.

404
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:13,053
Tell me about it.

405
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:16,927
Seeing how he knows the angle, it must be someone from inside.

406
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,392
Who's your accomplice?

407
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:21,938
Whether it's a student or not, you must've done this...

408
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:23,863
so that it wouldn't catch you accepting the 10,000 dollar bribe.

409
00:33:24,407 --> 00:33:25,602
Someone from inside.

410
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:31,872
Professor Yu, why don't you just confess?

411
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:34,047
They're analyzing the footage now,

412
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:35,743
and the arrest warrant will be issued soon.

413
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:39,852
Dong Man!

414
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:45,188
Gosh, why are you here? This is humiliating.

415
00:33:45,188 --> 00:33:47,093
You brat!

416
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:50,162
You know this is humiliating, don't you?

417
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:54,593
I know you're a nutjob,

418
00:33:54,737 --> 00:33:57,233
but you wouldn't do something so low.

419
00:33:57,768 --> 00:33:59,062
You punks!

420
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:04,542
I know, right? Why is he doing this?

421
00:34:05,748 --> 00:34:06,972
What did you say?

422
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:11,513
If he wanted to frame me, then he should've done a better job.

423
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,582
You know who did it, don't you?

424
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:17,553
Who is it? What's this about?

425
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,722
Did he do this to stop me from investigating any further?

426
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:25,493
Tell me what this is about. It's frustrating.

427
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:29,562
Captain, I have a favor to ask.

428
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:32,863
Here, have some tea.

429
00:34:34,677 --> 00:34:38,372
The night before the exam paper was leaked,

430
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:41,772
you were with Professor Yu in his office, right?

431
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:46,783
Yes, I went to talk to him for a second.

432
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,352
May I ask what it was about?

433
00:34:55,058 --> 00:34:57,292
I was stuck while studying Investigation Studies,

434
00:34:58,168 --> 00:34:59,733
so I wanted to ask him.

435
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,602
Just this month alone,

436
00:35:04,668 --> 00:35:08,403
you visited Professor Yu's office more than ten times.

437
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:11,243
Were you there to ask questions on Investigation Studies?

438
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:22,412
You shouldn't make that face when the police ask you a question.

439
00:35:28,027 --> 00:35:29,622
Let me see.

440
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,027
He was arrested without a warrant,

441
00:35:32,027 --> 00:35:34,668
so Professor Yu will be detained...

442
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:36,863
for about 36 hours.

443
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:41,702
If you want to prove his innocence before he's cornered,

444
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:43,903
you'll need to hurry.

445
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:49,743
You may leave.

446
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:51,582
Yes, sir.

447
00:35:54,558 --> 00:35:57,852
(Forensic Science Room)

448
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:09,533
You are behind this, aren't you?

449
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:14,033
Just go and study for your exams.

450
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:16,702
I'll make sure...

451
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:21,343
to find evidence on you.

452
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:25,142
I'd love to see you try.

453
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:28,883
Although I'm not sure if a greenhorn like you is capable of doing that.

454
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:37,423
Sun Ho!

455
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:43,507
It's really strange though.

456
00:36:43,507 --> 00:36:46,772
Why did the culprit share the paper when he could've had it for himself?

457
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:49,573
The police are investigating it,

458
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,372
so wouldn't they find it strange too?

459
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:55,213
An envelope of money was found during their investigation,

460
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:56,648
so they'll investigate based on the evidence,

461
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,113
not the circumstance.

462
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,157
Then they'll miss the golden time.

463
00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:02,857
Still, I think the police...

464
00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:05,627
will find a suspect from the students first.

465
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:06,792
I think so too.

466
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:09,392
And that'd be me.

467
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,297
What?

468
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:13,562
What? It's you?

469
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:16,363
I went to see Professor Yu...

470
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,438
in his office the night before.

471
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:20,573
What?

472
00:37:21,677 --> 00:37:25,047
But still, you didn't leak the paper.

473
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,812
Of course he didn't.

474
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:30,412
Professor Yu didn't do it either. He's being framed.

475
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:36,283
I must catch the culprit.

476
00:37:37,828 --> 00:37:41,193
Speaking of which,

477
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,562
can you guys help me?

478
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,963
Never mind. It's exam week.

479
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:54,573
I'll get going.

480

481
00:38:04,087 --> 00:38:05,582
What do you think you're doing?

482
00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:09,513
Of course we must help you when you're in trouble.

483
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:13,423
Exams? They're not important at all!

484
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:19,263
He's right. Sun Ho, I might not be of much help,

485
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:21,033
but I...

486
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:23,133
want to help you too.

487
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:27,303
You would've done the same if this happened to me.

488
00:38:27,578 --> 00:38:30,872
That's right, brother. Don't underestimate us.

489
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:32,343
We're friends, after all.

490
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:39,812
You guys...

491
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,558
Hey, don't get emotional. We're running out of time.

492
00:38:43,558 --> 00:38:44,722
You're right.

493
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,058
Don't get emotional. We're running out of time.

494
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,193
What shall we start with?

495
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,412
It looks like the kids from our year bought the leaked paper.

496
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:16,522
Then Bum Tae and Jun Wook, you should start with questioning.

497
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:18,958
Question those who didn't buy the paper like I did,

498
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:20,752
or those who borrowed it.

499
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:24,022
And those who didn't buy it when they're likely to do so.

500
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:27,432
Let's narrow down suspects by questioning them.

501
00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:31,208
Also, find out Dong Gu's alibi since he sold the paper.

502
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,633
- Roger that. - Roger that.

503
00:39:35,078 --> 00:39:36,202
What about us?

504
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:38,872
We must go to the crime site first.

505
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:42,142
Evidence and clues are always left at the scene.

506
00:39:43,018 --> 00:39:44,142
Let's go.

507
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:50,852
They haven't caught the culprit when there's a camera right here?

508
00:39:53,898 --> 00:39:56,763
We'll know who did it if we can watch the footage even just once.

509
00:39:57,998 --> 00:39:59,423
Then let's see if we can do that.

510
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:01,863
No.

511
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:05,368
Those at Asan Police Station believe that this case...

512
00:40:05,368 --> 00:40:07,272
could have been an inside job,

513
00:40:07,507 --> 00:40:09,233
so even the professors aren't allowed to access it.

514
00:40:09,308 --> 00:40:11,047
Then can we take a quick look at it here?

515
00:40:11,047 --> 00:40:13,817
Goodness. I already said no.

516
00:40:13,817 --> 00:40:15,013
Get out.

517
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,148
We're asking because I think I saw someone...

518
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:22,213
fiddling with the CCTV camera in front of Professor Yu's office.

519
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,783
You saw it?

520
00:40:25,558 --> 00:40:26,852
Was it a man or a woman?

521
00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:30,923
That I don't know. It was too dark.

522
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:34,067
Get out. Go.

523
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:36,133
- Please... - Go, get out.

I'm impressed.

527
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:54,713
The other guys must've finished their job by now. Let's go.

528
00:40:56,927 --> 00:40:59,682
Can you let go?

529
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:02,193
Right.

533
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,472
Dong Gu got his hands on the exam paper...

534
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:18,972
on Monday, around midnight.

535
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:23,443
He found it on top of the printer in the Residence Hall.

536
00:41:23,518 --> 00:41:26,852
According to him, that was when he printed copies of it.

00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:41,533
Sung Soo, and Hae Ju.

541
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:42,693
Wait.

542
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,633
Cha Sung Soo and An Hae Ju didn't buy it?

543
00:41:44,737 --> 00:41:45,903
Right?

544
00:41:46,067 --> 00:41:48,138
Those two, of all people,

545
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,772
must have bought it.

546
00:41:51,047 --> 00:41:52,573
What's more shocking is that...

547
00:41:52,947 --> 00:41:55,872
over 80 percent of the students bought the copy.

548
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:57,288
That's right.

549
00:41:57,288 --> 00:42:00,513
Park Dong Gu should become a salesman, not a cop.

550
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:03,182
So we have two suspects.

551
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:05,653
I'll talk with Hae Ju.

552
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,693
Jun Wook and Bum Tae, you two talk with Sung Soo.

553
00:42:08,857 --> 00:42:11,863
I'll see if we can get our hands on the CCTV footage somehow.

554
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:16,567
(To be continued)

555
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,602
We'll be able to save...

556
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,133
Professor Yu, right?

557
00:42:28,968 --> 00:42:31,733
Mr. Yu, are you going to keep up this uncooperative attitude?

558
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:34,634
Mr. Yu Dong Man!

559
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:37,344
Goodness.

560
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:54,123
(Forensic Science Room)

561
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:10,444
I talked to An Hae Ju.

562
00:43:10,508 --> 00:43:12,249
She said the one who left the print room before her...

563
00:43:12,249 --> 00:43:14,074
was wearing a neon watch.

564
00:43:14,118 --> 00:43:15,373
Check Cha Sung Soo's watch.

565
00:43:15,448 --> 00:43:17,448
If it's a neon-colored watch, he's the one who found it first.

566
00:43:17,448 --> 00:43:19,944
(Investigation Task Force, 4 Members)

567
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:25,683
It's exam time. Shouldn't you be studying?

568
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:28,599
I have somewhere to be.

569
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:29,753
Let's talk another time.

570
00:43:30,129 --> 00:43:31,264
What about me?

571
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:35,163
"Another time", again?

572
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:37,603
I...

573
00:43:39,508 --> 00:43:40,674
like you.

574
00:43:44,649 --> 00:43:46,603
I don't expect you to give me your answer now.

575
00:43:47,718 --> 00:43:50,514
I'm just telling you how I feel.

576
00:43:51,948 --> 00:43:54,284
Okay, I see.

577
00:43:55,419 --> 00:43:57,324
Then let's talk another time.

578
00:44:01,129 --> 00:44:06,293
(The 41st Chungram Sports Festival)

579
00:44:11,638 --> 00:44:13,733
(Women's Residence Hall)

580
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:15,404
Okay.

581
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:17,503
Let's just talk now.

582
00:44:19,278 --> 00:44:21,713
Min Kyu, there's someone I like.

583
00:44:22,849 --> 00:44:27,054
I can't afford to worry about how upset you are...

584
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:29,913
because I'm so worried about him right now.

585
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,253
Who is that?

586
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:35,924
Is it Kang Sun Ho?

587
00:44:37,329 --> 00:44:38,694
I have to go.

588
00:44:49,738 --> 00:44:52,373
You'd like to see the CCTV footage?

589
00:44:52,709 --> 00:44:55,344
Yes. I know that I'm not allowed to view it,

590
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:58,683
but I figured you probably can access it.

591
00:45:00,689 --> 00:45:03,359
That's a lot to ask.

592
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,753
Right, I apologize.

593
00:45:05,258 --> 00:45:07,454
I'm aware that it's a lot to ask, but I wanted to give it a shot.

594
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:09,654
Why is that?

595
00:45:11,298 --> 00:45:12,824
Because trying is better...

596
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,134
than not trying at all.

597
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:19,833
There are times when doing nothing is better for your own sake.

598
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:23,904
I've got nothing to lose,

599
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:26,574
and nothing will change if I stand still and do nothing.

600
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:27,844
When you're investigating a case,

601
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:31,583
you must keep pushing forward to find clues.

602
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:35,384
That's what Professor Yu taught me.

603
00:45:36,928 --> 00:45:41,253
I'm worried you'd trip and fall if you kept pushing forward.

604
00:45:41,428 --> 00:45:43,393
But that's not a failure.

605
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,824
Wouldn't it be a process to learn to walk straight?

606
00:45:48,298 --> 00:45:50,194
I still remember what you told us...

607
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,134
when we went to the shooting range for the first time.

608
00:45:53,468 --> 00:45:56,204
You said we as police officers must pick up guns...

609
00:45:56,979 --> 00:45:59,474
to protect and save lives, not to kill.

610
00:46:03,278 --> 00:46:05,583
Would you hand me a bullet,

611
00:46:06,588 --> 00:46:08,784
so I can protect Professor Yu?

612
00:46:23,638 --> 00:46:26,003
At three o'clock. A neon watch, confirmed.

613
00:46:28,379 --> 00:46:31,143
At eight o'clock. Also confirmed.

614
00:46:34,879 --> 00:46:36,114
What are you guys doing?

615
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,543
No matter the angle,

616
00:46:39,919 --> 00:46:41,154
it is indisputably neon.

617
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:42,683
What?

618
00:46:47,399 --> 00:46:48,994
I heard the CCTV footage shows...

619
00:46:49,499 --> 00:46:52,094
the person who first found the exam paper.

620
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:55,833
Hey, what do you mean? There are no cameras there...

621
00:46:58,868 --> 00:47:00,034
So it was you.

622
00:47:11,689 --> 00:47:12,718
Cha Sung Soo.

623
00:47:12,718 --> 00:47:14,488
You may refuse to give an incriminating statement.

624
00:47:14,488 --> 00:47:15,583
Don't move!

625
00:47:15,618 --> 00:47:17,258
You'll be given a chance to explain yourself...

626
00:47:17,258 --> 00:47:18,629
and have the right to an attorney.

627
00:47:18,629 --> 00:47:20,959
You may request the court to review the legality of this arrest...

628
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:22,154
- That's not right. - What?

629
00:47:22,428 --> 00:47:24,523
Take it up with the Leadership Room, not the court.

630
00:47:24,669 --> 00:47:27,534
- Stay still. - Let me go, you crazy jerks.

631
00:47:31,368 --> 00:47:33,204
Hey, you'll break my arms!

(Forensic Science Room)

633
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:49,654
- Hey, Bum Tae. - Sung Soo found it first.

634
00:47:49,818 --> 00:47:52,954
But someone was in the print room before he got there.

635
00:47:53,698 --> 00:47:54,793
What?

636
00:48:04,508 --> 00:48:05,963
Can we talk?

637
00:48:12,008 --> 00:48:14,014
If you've got something to say, just say it and leave.

638
00:48:15,149 --> 00:48:16,373
I told you.

639
00:48:17,488 --> 00:48:19,114
I will find evidence to prove...

640
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,183
that you did it.

641
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:24,424
I have Cha Sung Soo's statement...

642
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:27,623
that he ran into you in the print room...

643
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:29,054
the night the exam paper got leaked.

644
00:48:32,198 --> 00:48:33,428
Such statements or circumstantial clues...

645
00:48:33,428 --> 00:48:34,994
cannot serve as admissible evidence.

646
00:48:39,008 --> 00:48:41,634
Which is why I'm planning to secure physical evidence as well.

647
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:45,804
So that...

648
00:48:46,709 --> 00:48:48,344
I can save Professor Yu,

649
00:48:49,548 --> 00:48:50,944
your supervisor.

650
00:48:53,289 --> 00:48:54,784
I'm going to save him.

651
00:48:57,088 --> 00:48:58,224
Do you...

652
00:48:59,459 --> 00:49:01,824
really think saving Dong Man from this case...

653
00:49:02,629 --> 00:49:04,924
is a good thing for him?

654
00:49:06,669 --> 00:49:08,393
This time, it was only an exam paper.

655
00:49:09,068 --> 00:49:11,264
Aren't you scared that something worse...

656
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:14,174
might happen to him next?

657
00:49:18,379 --> 00:49:20,713
No, I'm not scared.

658
00:49:21,818 --> 00:49:23,674
That must be exactly...

659
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,983
what they want.

660
00:49:29,859 --> 00:49:31,888
Us getting scared because of this incident...

661
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:34,094
and stepping back...

662
00:49:34,499 --> 00:49:35,824
so that...

663
00:49:37,129 --> 00:49:38,793
we stop investigating any further.

664
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,933
Both Professor Yu and I...

665
00:49:46,669 --> 00:49:49,333
will never give those jerks what they want.

666
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:55,213
Are you sure...

667
00:49:57,118 --> 00:49:58,713
you can handle this?

668
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:03,554
Do you think you can...

669
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:07,494
stay next to Dong Man until the end without running away?

670
00:50:11,499 --> 00:50:12,623
Yes.

671
00:50:25,678 --> 00:50:27,074
He's better than me.

672
00:50:36,689 --> 00:50:38,388
Have you checked on it, Captain?

673
00:50:38,388 --> 00:50:41,924
Chul Jin did withdraw 10,000 dollars.

674
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:44,494
What on earth is going on?

675
00:50:45,198 --> 00:50:48,733
Did he get blackmailed or something?

676
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:52,733
Okay, Captain. I'll call you again.

677
00:51:00,178 --> 00:51:02,514
Can I make another call?

678
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:10,284
Hello?

679
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:12,424
It's me.

680
00:51:12,959 --> 00:51:15,494
Goodness, we have all the witness statements,

681
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,463
but we don't have the final blow.

682
00:51:18,669 --> 00:51:19,924
That hurt.

683
00:51:20,638 --> 00:51:22,494
Where did Sun Ho go?

684
00:51:26,908 --> 00:51:28,704
Let's find the last piece of evidence.

685
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:30,404
- What is that? - What is it?

686
00:51:30,778 --> 00:51:33,344
- What is that? - What is that?

687
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:34,913
Did you find anything?

688
00:51:56,468 --> 00:51:57,563
Yes.

689
00:51:58,769 --> 00:52:00,603
I have something to report.

690
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:09,213
Pause it.

691
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:16,087
What? Only his hand was caught.

692
00:52:16,088 --> 00:52:19,353
Wait. I'm sure it's a man's hand.

693
00:52:20,088 --> 00:52:22,094
The culprit is a male.

694
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:33,333
I don't think we'll be able to tell who turned the camera.

695
00:52:48,758 --> 00:52:50,183
What are you doing?

696
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,023
I can see something!

697
00:52:59,198 --> 00:53:01,499
We got him!

698
00:53:01,499 --> 00:53:04,103
Hey, but isn't he...

699
00:53:04,238 --> 00:53:06,233
the new professor?

700
00:53:06,638 --> 00:53:09,474
He is. It's Professor Park Chul Jin.

701
00:53:15,718 --> 00:53:16,913
Let's go.

702
00:53:18,618 --> 00:53:21,683
Did he get blackmailed or something?

703
00:53:29,899 --> 00:53:31,123
Sir.

704
00:53:33,028 --> 00:53:35,864
- All right. - Let's go.

705
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:40,933
There are only two.

706
00:53:47,178 --> 00:53:48,413
No!

707
00:53:49,778 --> 00:53:52,083
It still hurts on rainy days.

708
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:53,919
And I still turn around in panic mode,

709
00:53:53,919 --> 00:53:55,318
thinking someone might attack me from behind.

710
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:56,959
- So please... - I'll never let you go!

711
00:53:56,959 --> 00:53:58,129
Chul Jin!

712
00:53:58,129 --> 00:53:59,829
Dong Man!

713
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:01,753
Don't leave me alone.

714
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:03,928
I'll show you...

715
00:54:03,928 --> 00:54:05,428
that I deserve to be called your partner.

716
00:54:05,428 --> 00:54:08,899
My gut feeling tells me that this case is dangerous.

717
00:54:08,899 --> 00:54:12,109
I was appointed as a professor at Korean National Police University.

718
00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:14,278
- What? - Chul Jin asked for it,

719
00:54:14,278 --> 00:54:15,508
saying he wants to work by your side.

720
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:19,209
From now, I'll always be behind you,

721
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:20,813
so don't be scared.

722
00:54:21,919 --> 00:54:23,913
You will never give up, will you?

723
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:26,083
You'll never give up...

724
00:54:26,618 --> 00:54:28,213
on going after those jerks, will you?

725
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:41,833
Let's...

726
00:54:44,238 --> 00:54:45,704
start with the report.

727
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:48,534
Are you serious?

728
00:54:55,678 --> 00:54:57,718
I got the permission slip to go out from Professor Seo.

729
00:54:57,718 --> 00:54:59,983
The taxi is here. Let's hurry.

730
00:55:18,908 --> 00:55:20,764
Hello. This is Seo Sang Hak.

731
00:55:24,209 --> 00:55:25,674
What did you say?

732
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:32,419
An exam paper was leaked right before the exam...

733
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:35,088
at Korean National Police University.

734
00:55:35,088 --> 00:55:37,289
The cradle of justice, Korean National Police University.

735
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:39,988
KCS will report thorough coverage on the corruption case...

736
00:55:39,988 --> 00:55:42,654
that overshadows the school's philosophy.

737
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:44,829
It hasn't been a year since Professor Yu...

738
00:55:44,829 --> 00:55:46,298
was appointed to this school,

739
00:55:46,298 --> 00:55:49,669
but he leaked an exam paper of the subject he's teaching.

740
00:55:49,669 --> 00:55:51,169
According to the Asan Police Station,

741
00:55:51,169 --> 00:55:53,408
Yu denied all charges at first,

742
00:55:53,408 --> 00:55:56,674
but he ended up admitting them during the investigation.

743
00:55:57,309 --> 00:55:59,944
Why did he admit them all of a sudden?

744
00:56:00,178 --> 00:56:01,749
He didn't do it.

745
00:56:01,749 --> 00:56:03,419
Sir, could you speed up a little?

746
00:56:03,419 --> 00:56:04,583
Sure.

747
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:11,289
The police are suspecting him of solicitation,

748
00:56:11,289 --> 00:56:13,028
and they will investigate further...

749
00:56:13,028 --> 00:56:16,224
to find the illegal dealings made.

750
00:56:16,229 --> 00:56:18,264
This is Im Hyun Seok of KCS.

751
00:56:29,209 --> 00:56:32,548
It's still under investigation, so we're not sure...

752
00:56:32,548 --> 00:56:35,043
There's nothing we can say.

753
00:56:35,379 --> 00:56:37,583
- I'm sorry. - That's...

754
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:42,514
Where is Mr. Park Chul Jin?

755
00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:44,853
Who gave you the money?

756
00:56:45,988 --> 00:56:47,623
I have no idea.

757
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:52,269
I heard I'd get paid in cash if I handed over the exam paper.

758
00:56:52,269 --> 00:56:54,293
I thought you wanted us to start writing a report.

759
00:56:54,368 --> 00:56:56,364
What is this?

760
00:56:56,638 --> 00:56:58,034
Gosh.

761
00:57:10,579 --> 00:57:13,483
(Friendly police of the citizens)

762
00:57:14,658 --> 00:57:16,313
What are you talking about?

763
00:57:44,749 --> 00:57:45,913
Hello?

764
00:57:47,249 --> 00:57:48,384
It's me.

765
00:57:52,158 --> 00:57:53,954
I was wondering if you were doing okay.

766
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,063
Seeing how you picked up, I guess you're fine.

767
00:58:00,068 --> 00:58:02,364
- That's all I needed to know. - Dong Man.

768
00:58:06,209 --> 00:58:07,873
How can you worry about me...

769
00:58:10,948 --> 00:58:13,003
in this situation?

770
00:58:15,318 --> 00:58:17,574
I told you that I'll protect you.

771
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:22,514
That darn promise.

772
00:58:23,718 --> 00:58:25,424
I'm finally keeping my word, you punk.

773
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:57,114
I was the one...

774
00:58:58,129 --> 00:58:59,253
who leaked the exam paper.

775
00:59:03,758 --> 00:59:06,063
Hey, what are you doing?

776
00:59:08,568 --> 00:59:10,534
You should've been the one to cuff me.

777
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:13,063
Hey, Park Chul Jin!

778
00:59:26,349 --> 00:59:28,083
I was just trying to make some money on the side...

779
00:59:29,459 --> 00:59:31,123
but ended up coming this far.

780
00:59:33,689 --> 00:59:34,829
Hey, you idiot!

781
00:59:34,829 --> 00:59:38,163
You should have given up when you found the bug.

782
00:59:39,198 --> 00:59:41,494
What was the point of me acting like I lost my memory?

783
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:43,694
You just wouldn't step on the brakes.

784
00:59:43,698 --> 00:59:46,134
You jerk! Shut your mouth!

785
00:59:47,738 --> 00:59:49,233
Senior Inspector Yu Dong Man.

786
00:59:50,408 --> 00:59:51,603
My supervisor.

787
00:59:55,118 --> 00:59:57,514
You no longer need to have my back.

788
00:59:59,988 --> 01:00:01,913
You crazy idiot!

789
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:56,908
(Police University)

790
01:00:56,908 --> 01:01:00,249
I didn't come here to learn from someone like Yu Dong Man.

791
01:01:00,249 --> 01:01:01,718
Who sent a tip to the news?

792
01:01:01,718 --> 01:01:04,474
If you did it because of me, don't do it ever again.

793
01:01:05,019 --> 01:01:06,888
- How dare he touch her? - She smiled.

794
01:01:06,888 --> 01:01:08,218
Don't smile!

795
01:01:08,218 --> 01:01:09,413
So you didn't do it?

796
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:12,983
If this turns out to be a lie, I will cut all ties with you.

797
01:01:13,289 --> 01:01:15,224
I want to investigate the case with you.

798
01:01:15,399 --> 01:01:18,324
And I like you, Kang Sun Ho.

799
01:01:19,229 --> 01:01:21,738
What you saw and learned isn't a proper way to do things,

800
01:01:21,738 --> 01:01:23,764
- so forget all about it. - No, I don't want to.

801
01:01:23,769 --> 01:01:25,904
I went through hoops to learn them. Why should I forget them?

802
01:01:26,408 --> 01:01:27,563
Okay, fine.

803
01:01:28,908 --> 01:01:30,134
The burner phone is on.

804
01:01:30,939 --> 01:01:32,344
It was you?
