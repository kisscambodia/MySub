00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,980
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,240
- What is this?
- My gosh.

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,490
Gosh, Kang Hee.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,019
Be quiet.

5
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,190
This is driving me crazy.

6
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,269
(Oh Kang Hee)

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,639
(Oh Kang Hee)

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,670
(Student ID, Oh Kang Hee)

9
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:45,909
(Kang Hee)

10
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,509
Hey, do you think it's really okay
to ignore her call?

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,810
You punk!

12
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,019
If you're a loyal friend,
you shouldn't pick up.

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,850
I know this best.

14
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:58,250
Wait, what time is it now?

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,490
- It's 1 a.m.
- What?

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,389
If they get caught outside...

17
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,529
They'll get disciplinary action!

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,560
- No!
- Oh, gosh!

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,069
I can't breathe!

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,469
Please keep quiet.

21
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,378
Come on, Kang Hee.

22
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,540
- Will you be quiet?
- Oh Kang Hee!

23
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,079
Oh Kang Hee!

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,749
Oh Kang Hee!

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,578
Oh Kang Hee!

26
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,889
- They will be expelled instantly.
- Oh Kang Hee!

27
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,018
- They will be expelled instantly.
- Oh...

28
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,390
- You will be expelled!
- Oh...

29
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,200
Oh Kang Hee, you'll be expelled!

30
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,840
Gosh...

31
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:36,710
Darn it. Hey.

32
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:39,110
Kang Sun Ho. Please wake up.

33
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,250
Will you please wake up? Oh, gosh.

34
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:47,759
(Restricted Area)

35
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,270
Who's on duty tonight?

36
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,900
Where did they go? Goodness.

37
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,370
Gosh, this is so upsetting.

38
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,979
Corporal Nam!

39
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,710
Salute.
Corporal Nam Hyun Tae reporting.

40
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,379
How many duty officers
are on night duty tonight?

41
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:19,788
Must you count?

42
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:22,519
How many are there? Hurry up!

43
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,658
- There are five.
- Call all of them right now.

44
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:27,230
I think there's a rat
hiding in this place.

45
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,129
What's all this fuss about
in the middle of the night?

46
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,068
You know, a junior...

47
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:36,069
brought in her boyfriend secretly
last year...

48
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,410
and got expelled because she was
caught by Guidance Director.

49
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,879
What about Kang Hee?
Why isn't she coming out?

50
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:48,579
Well... She's in the bathroom.

51
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:19,209
Bum Tae, you should...

52
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,318
go first.

53
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,379
Okay.

54
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,649
You're saying
you'll go first, right?

55
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,859
That's right. I'll cover your back.

56
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,430
If you go first,
I'll cover your back.

57
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,699
Okay.

58
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,930
- Good plan.
- Good plan.

59
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:51,708
You should go first!

60
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:53,448
Be quiet! You said you'll go first.

61
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,889
- You should've gone first.
- No, you told me you'll go first.

62
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,699
- We're doomed.
- We're doomed.

63
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,769
Those rats.

64
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:21,438
Whatever jumps out from that room,

65
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,378
don't lose any one of them. Got it?

66
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,810
Yes, ma'am.

67
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:28,620
Excuse me, Ms. Baek!

68
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,648
- What is it?
- I have something to tell you.

69
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,420
Okay. Let's talk later.

70
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,589
Open it.

71
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,229
I think it's
a violation of human rights...

72
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,860
to do a roll call at this hour!

73
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,829
If you don't want your rights to be
violated, go back to your room.

74
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:46,989
What are you waiting for? Open it.

75
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,138
You need to treat the students
with rights to decide...

76
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:51,508
as an individual being...

77
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:52,610
Hey!

78
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,209
Kang Hee, I did all I could.

79
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,310
- Gosh, I can't believe it.
- Open it now.

80
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,089
Park Min Kyu?

81
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:42,560
What are you doing here?

82
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,110
Professor Choi.

83
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,179
Ms. Baek.

84
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,279
What are you doing here right now?

85
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,419
Listen.

86
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,919
Can't you rent me a room
in the residence hall?

87
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,430
I want to get the energy
from young kids.

88
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,458
I also want to
get their sensibility.

89
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,828
If you're drunk,
you should've gone home.

90
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:28,099
Why do you always...

91
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,339
Why do you do this all the time?

92
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,009
That's right. I have my own home.

93
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,979
But there's no man.

94
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,850
I want to live
in the residence hall too!

95
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,810
But there's no extra room here.

96
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,179
How come it's always out of things?

97
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,989
Why is it always out of things?

98
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,619
There's nothing for me.

99
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,559
You're out of your mind right now.

100
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,590
Let go of me.

101
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:53,190
Move.

102
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,299
There's nothing for me.

103
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,940
Ms. Baek isn't the rude type.

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
She's just very responsible,
that's all.

105
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,539
Get back to your work.

106
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:08,179
I'll pay you back with fried chicken
for the extra work you did tonight.

107
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,179
(Storage)

108
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:37,940
(Student ID, Oh Kang Hee)

109
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,450
Are you okay, Sun Ho?

110
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:49,149
Be careful.

111
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,519
Gosh, that punk.

112
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:55,190
What on earth is going on?

113
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,528
We ran into Min Kyu...

114
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,369
when we were getting out
of the residence hall.

115
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,058
If he didn't step in to help,

116
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,229
we'd have been in big trouble.
Right?

117
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,398
Yes. Hey, Min Kyu.

118
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,039
I didn't know you were a good guy.

119
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,110
Do you find this funny?

120
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,080
No.

121
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,080
What happened to your shirt,
Kang Hee?

122
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,590
- What are you looking at?
- No, I'm not looking.

123
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,259
You should get back.

124
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,929
Seeing how the lights are all on,

125
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:37,405
I think the female residence hall...
will do the roll call again.

126
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,899
Okay.

127
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:40,600
Thanks.

128
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,469
Then should we get going now?

129
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,909
Right, it's too late.

130
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:49,580
- Hey, Sun Ho.
- Sun Ho.

131
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,049
Hey, Bum Tae, Jun Wook.

132
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,299
Gosh, my head.

133
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,909
Where is it?

134
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,049
- You haven't found it yet?
- No.

135
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,320
Why don't you just get a new one?

136
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,400
It would be uncomfortable
without the student ID.

137
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:37,490
That's when he showed up,
and we could get away with it.

138
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,389
So Min Kyu helped us?

139
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:40,799
Well...

140
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,429
It just turned out like that.

141
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:47,870
Sun Ho. You really don't remember
what happened yesterday?

142
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Not at all?

143
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,080
I must have made mistakes
to Kang Hee, right?

144
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,210
"Mistakes"?

145
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,819
You call that a mistake?

146
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,549
You filthy...

147
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:04,789
Sun Ho, it's okay.

148
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,190
It happened when you were drunk.

149
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,659
Let's just hope that
she takes it into account.

150
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:11,889
Let's eat first.

151
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:15,899
What Min Kyu said yesterday
was so cool, right?

152
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,899
What's so cool about it?

153
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,269
Why? What did he say?

154
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,299
"Hey, Bum Tae, Jun Wook."

155
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:29,580
Kang Hee wasn't here today.

156
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,480
If the rumor spreads,
and she gets in trouble,

157
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,649
I won't stand it anymore.

158
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,049
- Min Kyu said that?
- Yes.

159
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,319
He did.

160
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,729
I thought he would report it
to the student council...

161
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,659
and make a big fuss out of it.

162
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,398
I didn't know,
but Min Kyu is a man indeed.

163
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:52,429
Even I almost fell for...
Gosh, it's bulgogi.

164
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,399
- Gosh, bulgogi.
- Sun Ho, it's bulgogi.

165
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,669
Gosh!

166
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,710
Help yourselves!

167
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,279
Kang Hee!

168
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,889
It's over.

169
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,220
Is it over?

170
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,158
Gosh, this bulgogi sauce is amazing.

171
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,189
- Right.
- Look at its color.

172
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,000
- Eat, Bum Tae.
- Okay.

173
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,960
Hey, Sun Ho!

174
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:26,399
Gosh, how did I run into him
just like that?

175
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,899
Kang Hee!

176
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,039
Kang Hee.

177
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:44,620
Yes? What's up?

178
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,220
Well...

179
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:57,100
Oh...

180
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,379
Well... I'm sorry
about what happened yesterday.

181
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:13,250
You're sorry?

182
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,720
Well, I mean...

183
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:22,220
Well, I don't remember anything...

184
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,289
from last night.

185
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,259
I think I blacked out.

186
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:34,070
I see.
So you don't remember anything?

187
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:40,980
If you don't remember what happened,
does it mean it never happened?

188
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:43,339
- What?
- Because of jerks like you,

189
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,609
there are punks who ask for...

190
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,319
a reduced sentence claiming...

191
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,980
that they were unfit and drunk.

192
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
- Kang Hee.
- So you remember my name?

193
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,360
What? Why don't you forget that too?

194
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:16,009
Hey.

195
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,148
You've never thought about
Kang Hee getting into trouble...

196
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,379
because of
your thoughtless behavior?

197
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,389
By the way,
what have you done to her?

198
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,899
(Authorized Personnel Only)

199
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:42,899
Come this way.

200
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,570
Goodness. I guess something happened
to that detective.

201
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:48,440
Why?

202
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,808
You must not be sober
from last night,

203
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:54,379
but you're checking the CCTV footage
first thing in the morning.

204
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,018
On that day, he was drunk...

205
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:01,489
- and lost his wallet.
- Goodness.

206
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,289
It's troublesome for detectives
when they lose ID cards.

207
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,529
Gosh, what to do?

208
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,899
Just wait. I'll look into it.

209
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,189
I taught the kids...

210
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,649
how to use their knives
in real-life situations.

211
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,089
"In real-life situations"?

212
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,490
Oh, I was convicted twice.

213
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:58,350
Size 285mm?

214
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,750
Gosh...

215
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,389
He was here on that day.

216
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,759
Gosh, what a sight.

217
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,360
Why would you check on
someone else's smelly shoe?

218
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,230
Was Chul Jin here alone on that day?

219
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,069
I remember that day
after watching the footage.

220
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,199
He was here alone.

221
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,669
He barely touched his food...

222
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,368
and had about two bottles of soju.

223
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,909
I think he left after that.

224
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,779
Take a look at it. Here.

225
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,779
Okay, let me see it.

226
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,339
(CN 33B 6360)

227
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,940
It was raining,
and there were no customers.

228
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,980
He got in the taxi
but didn't say where to go.

229
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:08,779
He said just go, but where is there
to go in that area?

230
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:12,619
So I just headed to the fishery.

231
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,659
But then,
he must have been nauseous.

232
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,740
He suddenly made a scene
and told me to stop the car.

233
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:20,660
Sir, please stop the car.

234
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,539
Gosh.

235
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,440
On my way to the fishery,

236
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,309
I saw someone throwing up
on the side of the road.

237
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,380
He wobbled a bit.
I guess he was drunk.

238
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:41,549
Hey, Mr. Sung!
Aren't you having lunch?

239
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,848
I can go, right?

240
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:44,720
There's one last thing.

241
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:48,420
At that hour, why did you go
to the Police University?

242
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,618
(Do Not Enter, Police Line,
Investigation in Progress)

243
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:52,160
I went there
because Mr. Go called me.

244
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:55,400
Are you close with Mr. Go?

245
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:58,170
He's our regular customer.

246
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,869
But he can't remember that?

247
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,039
Professor Go.

248
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,849
There must be something with him.

249
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:34,500
Do you like fishing?

250
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,039
I didn't at first.

251
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:38,539
But I liked how it felt...

252
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:41,509
when I hooked a fish
as soon as it bites the bait.

253
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,140
I got to like it
as I came here from time to time.

254
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:48,019
I should've caught culprits
like that.

255
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,849
It's all noisy and confusing
both at the school and the field.

256
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:55,259
But it seems quiet when I come here.

257
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:01,329
Can I try throwing that?

258
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:04,700
It's expensive.

259
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,470
You have no friends, right?

260
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:12,910
What?

261
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:21,420
Hey, did you check it?

262
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
I did.

263
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:25,249
The calls from the burner phone
to Inspector Park...

264
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,949
were too short,

265
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,920
and they went through
too many stations.

266
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:30,559
So it's hard to specify it.

267
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:35,160
Then Detective Joo,
can you check on someone?

268
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:38,769
So what you've seen...

269
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,539
was Kang Hee
with a button off her shirt?

270
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,369
And her face was beet red.

271
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:47,508
No, that is not
reasonable suspicion.

272
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,940
You'd both had drinks,
and it was cold.

273
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,279
Gosh, what on earth
happened that night?

274
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:54,619
Listen up.

275
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,920
Here's what I think.

276
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,588
Hey, Oh Kang Hee.
What did I do so wrong?

277
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:03,789
Is it a crime to drink? Is it?

278
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,460
Hey! How dare you
rip a woman's shirt?

279
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,000
Hey.

280
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:13,999
I know I was drunk, but why would I
grab her by the collar?

281
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,868
He's right. Every investigation
begins with a hypothesis,

282
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:18,869
but that's just wrong.

283
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,069
You think so?

284
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:21,409
What do you think?

285
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,509
Well...

286
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,130
Hey!

287
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:43,358
- Calm down.
- What are you even thinking?

288
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,368
- Sun Ho.
- Got a death wish?

289
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,669
Calm down, Sun Ho.

290
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,569
- He's got a dirty mind.
- What I'm saying is,

291
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,139
we should consider
all possible scenarios.

292
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,309
Besides, when a guy and a girl
get locked in a storage room...

293
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,778
Come here.

294
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:01,119
- Hey, don't!
- My gosh!

295
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,119
That little...

296
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,789
Where did this jerk go?

297
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,259
If you don't remember what happened,
does it mean it never happened?

298
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,900
What did you do, you crazy idiot?

299
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,900
Hey!

300
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,569
Why are you swearing in the hallway?

301
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,769
What? What's this weapon for?

302
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,379
Why did you have to hit me
in the head?

303
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,410
Why are you yelling at me?

304
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:33,109
Do you know
how many times I called you?

305
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,578
Get your act together.

306
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:36,579
Put that back and come with me.

307
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,720
Gosh...

308
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,029
Why did you call me?

309
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,530
Hey, are you not going
to investigate the case?

310
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,629
Oh, that.

311
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,399
What?

312
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,470
"Oh, that"?

313
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,970
I'm sorry.

314
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:02,480
What is it?

315
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,210
Why are you upset?

316
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:10,818
Professor,
is there a special technique...

317
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:13,520
for investigating a suspect
after an alcohol-related blackout?

318
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:16,259
- What?
- You know,

319
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,828
when you need
to interrogate a drunk suspect.

320
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:20,530
Or, it could be a witness too.

321
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,859
You need to interview
the witnesses first.

322
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,970
Then based on witness statements
you've collected,

323
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:28,699
you can put the puzzle together
and find evidence.

324
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,368
No, I'm not talking about that.

325
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:31,440
No?

326
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,909
Then what? You mean,
investigative hypnosis?

327
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,210
Stuff like that?

328
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,709
I don't know, you punk!

329
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,378
Is that even important now?

330
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:41,710
You wanted me to tell you.

331
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:43,819
Why did you call me?

332
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,980
Right.

333
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,559
We have the base station
for the burner phone,

334
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:51,489
but the location keeps changing.

335
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,930
(Base Station Outgoing Call Records)

336
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:55,598
I've actually been
doing some thinking...

337
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,039
while going over
Mr. Park's call log.

338
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:00,629
Why don't we try to analyze
this burner phone's call patterns?

339
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,339
What do you mean?

340
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,069
There's a program that analyzes
call patterns and frequency.

341
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:06,868
If we look into the base station
using that,

342
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:10,338
we should be able to track down
the person using the burner phone.

343
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:12,809
Do you think we're shooting
the James Bond series?

344
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,450
The software is used by the FBI,

345
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:18,020
but I can code the program.

346
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,649
Although it'll take some time.

347
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:23,859
About two weeks, I think.

348
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:26,760
- Should I do it or not?
- Hey!

349
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,898
If there's something like that,
we should try it right away!

350
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:33,128
Now, this is the Yoon I know.

351
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:37,439
Great. You focus on what
you're good at. I'll do the same.

352
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,010
This is what a truly ideal
joint investigation should be like.

353
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:43,309
- My goodness.
- Right, sure.

354
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,078
All right, then. Get some rest.

355
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,180
Okay, you too.

356
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,579
By the way,

357
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:52,549
you only had
a couple of drinks last night.

358
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,720
Did you black out?

359
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,460

No.

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,609
Sun Ho, did you think
you were dating? Why are you quiet?

375
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,750
Hey.

376
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,818
Right.

377
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:35,088
Such words aren't important.

378

that's all that matters.

380
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,559

I need a drink in broad daylight?

Can you please
not tell anyone about this?

384
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:55,879
Hey, I can pick up clues.

385

it never happened.

in the storage room that night...

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,440

or see it in my dream.

- Kang Hee.
- Why are you acting like you do?

in every possible way.

511
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,250
push me to the edge of a cliff, Mom?

512
00:33:58,059 --> 00:33:59,669

you looked into?

513
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,930

514
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:04,770
The judge for your mother's trial...

515
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,138
He's dealt with such cases often,

516
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:08,869
so I heard he doesn't give
harsh sentences.

517
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,450
So don't worry.

518
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:15,349
Okay?

519
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,720
Were you always interested in
other people's business?

520
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,889
You know that's not true.

521
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,120
I do, so why are you doing this?

522
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,688
- Kang Hee.
- Just talk behind my back...

523
00:34:27,689 --> 00:34:28,689

524
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,229

- It's a smartwatch.

535
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:57,518
Make sure to connect it with your
phone and check it all the time.

536
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,819

I'll do anything to help you.

538
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,829
But why don't we participate
in Chungram Sports Festival first?

539
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,830
What did you say, you punk?

540
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,830
I must win the prize.

541
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:11,060
I really need to.

542
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,969
Since you're on our team,

543
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,068
why don't we prepare
for the sports festival first?

544
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:18,569
Gosh, you weren't listening to me.

545
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,870
I need to win it.

546
00:36:22,209 --> 00:36:25,379
No, I must win it.

547
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,818
Listen to me carefully.

548
00:36:29,819 --> 00:36:31,079
On the day
of Chungram Sports Festival,

549
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,748
the building
will be completely empty.

550
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:36,490
(Relations Team)

551
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,729
I'm going to win that special leave.

552
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:42,899
I'll win it...

553
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,830
and give it to Kang Hee.

554
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,568
- Pass it to me!
- Go!

555
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:52,439
It's only a practice.
Aren't we training too hard?

556
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:54,910
- Aren't we?
- We must win it no matter what.

557
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:57,309
Let's go! Hurry up.

558
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,010
Wait up!

559
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,959
Gosh, this punk.

560
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,829
- Hey!
- Gosh, you scared me.

561
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,668
You need to control your breathing.

562
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:23,398
Breathe in deep.

563
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:25,499
(Mom's trial)

564
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,160
Thank you.

565
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:23,800
Gosh, why did they get me
this shirt?

566
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:30,539
What is he up to every night?

567
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,979
Hey.

568
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,609
When I was your age,
I ran 100m in 10 seconds.

569
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,280
No, you didn't.

570
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:49,688
I did, you punk!

571
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:53,529
Gosh, then you'd have become
a track and field athlete instead.

572
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,599
Goodness. Why do you always
want to have the last word?

573
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,959
What good will it be
to win against a young man like me?

574
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:06,609
What?

575
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,510
Hey.

576
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:13,080
Sun Ho.

577
00:39:13,749 --> 00:39:16,780
I only touched your mouse,
and this showed up.

578
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,918
How did you know?

579
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:25,060
Did you catch him?
Who is it? Who is that punk?

580
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,660
Professor Yu?

581
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,030
Gosh.

582
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:34,030
You punk! Why did you touch
his laptop?

583
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,839
At this rate, you'll become a thief.

584
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,398
Gosh, that startled me.

585
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:39,769
A thief?

586
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:41,569
Leave him be. He's just cranky.

587
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:43,709
What's that?

588
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,640
Apparently, this is our uniform.

589
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,280
Oh Kang Hee... Team White.

590
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,870
Put a check mark
and take your uniform.

591
00:39:53,689 --> 00:39:54,720
Kang Sun Ho, right?

592
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:56,539
Put a check mark
and take your uniform.

593
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,419
Okay.

594
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,260
Team White.

595
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,430
- I'm on Team White too.
- I see.

596
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,039
Why aren't you asking?

597
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:18,740
About my mom's trial.

598
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,780
You must know about it too.

599
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,190
I was waiting until
you wanted to talk about it.

600
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,289
Like now.

601
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:29,589
It's nothing nice.

602
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,390
By the way, why are you so serious
about the sports festival?

603
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,600
I have to win the special leave,
that's why.

604
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,430
Why? Do you have to go somewhere?

605
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,240
Yes.

606
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:47,339
Where? Do you have to go
see your mom or something?

607
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,180
I don't have a mom.

608
00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:55,709
I'm sorry.

609
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,149
But I do want to go see my dad.

610
00:41:01,089 --> 00:41:03,789
After I see you at your mom's trial.

611
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:11,330
That's why I have to win
the special leave.

612
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,100
For you as well.
I should take responsibility.

613
00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:17,800
Responsibility for what?
Why do you keep saying that?

614
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:24,910
He remembers.

615
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,209
Of course.

616
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,479
I should take responsibility.

617
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:31,249
I have to.

618
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:34,648
He knows what happened that night.

619
00:41:34,649 --> 00:41:35,749
So, Kang Hee...

620
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:38,459
Let's go together, okay?

621
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,399
I should take responsibility.

622
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:49,229
You crazy punk.

623
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,669
I am a crazy punk,

624
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:55,269
but let's go together, Kang Hee.
Okay?

625
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,410
Kang Hee!

626
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:02,180
Let's go together, okay?
I'll make sure we can go.

627
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:08,018
- Look at this.
- Come on in.

628
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:09,050
This is amazing!

629
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,588
Come check this out!

630
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:13,089
- The uniform looks great on you.
- Come on in.

631
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:14,760
Here you go.

632
00:42:16,629 --> 00:42:19,069
Those people aren't from our school.
What are they doing here?

633
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,029
Oh, you didn't know?

634
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,199
The cafeteria is closed on the day
of Chungram Sports Festival.

635
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,240
Instead, we order food
from restaurants in the area.

636
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,168
The restaurant owners are
already here to drop off the food,

637
00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:29,609
so they can stay
and watch the games.

638
00:42:32,209 --> 00:42:34,409
Nice! Professor Go is here.

639
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:37,009
- Chicken! I want chicken!
- Hello, Professor Choi.

640
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,950
- Chicken and beer go hand in hand.
- My gosh.

641
00:42:41,649 --> 00:42:43,220
- Good luck today.
- Thank you.

642
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,530
It's so refreshing.

643
00:42:54,399 --> 00:42:55,869
The last character...

644
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,769
of "Chungram Sports Festival"
means "war."

645
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:06,109
Which means,

646
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:09,979
it's like a fierce war
made to look like a sports festival.

647
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:24,859
To win this war,

648
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:29,399
we must get the upper hand
in the first fight, at all costs.

649
00:43:30,229 --> 00:43:32,538
- Go, team!
- We got this!

650
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:34,370
Hey, bring it on!

651
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:36,869
Come here. Bring it on.

652
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,609
Are you going to fight
with your mouth?

653
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,148
- Kwon Hyuk Phil!
- Kwon Hyuk Phil!

654
00:43:41,149 --> 00:43:42,748
- Go, team!
- Invincible Team White!

655
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:43,749
- Go!
- Hey!

656
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,019
- Come here!
- Hey!

657
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,289
He's biting me!

658
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:59,160
My gosh,
Professor Yu is really something.

659
00:43:59,399 --> 00:44:01,628
My goodness. Can I go in instead?

660
00:44:01,629 --> 00:44:03,830
I can easily beat them all.

661
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:07,910
I'll pull some strings,
so you can join us next semester.

662
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,939
Professor Kwon
is doing his best too.

663
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,050
They're the same age, right?

664
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,249
Yes.

665
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,879
They seem to be good friends.
It's good to see them getting along.

666
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,139
- Go, Team White!
- Go, Team White!

667
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,768
- We're invincible!
- We're invincible!

668
00:44:41,769 --> 00:44:44,680
- Go, Team White!
- Go, Team White!

669
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,810
Oh, my.
This is getting more interesting.

670
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:52,249
- Well done!
- My, look at that.

671
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:55,248
- Thank you.
- This looks great.

672
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:56,289
Nice, pizza.

673
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,019
Hey, that looks delicious.

674
00:44:58,089 --> 00:44:59,260
- Hey.
- My gosh.

675
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,390
This is like a buffet. I love this.

676
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,529
It is nice,

677
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,229
but why do I feel like
I'm watching "Hometown Report"?

678
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,870
I know.

679
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,269
There's too much going on.
It's not good.

680
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:12,140
Drink up.

681
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,140
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

682
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,379
- Have a beer.
- Thank you.

683
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,838
Drink up. It'll cool you down.

684
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:21,708
My gosh.
You came to deliver this yourself.

685
00:45:21,709 --> 00:45:24,249
- Doesn't it look amazing?
- Thank you.

(Korean National Police University)

688
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:44,800
- Go!
- Good luck!

689
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:46,600
Go for it!

690
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:49,139
Get them!

691
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,168
Darn it!

692
00:45:50,169 --> 00:45:52,680
I told you to target the head!

693
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,979
I got it. Hey!

694
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,319
Make them pass out!

695
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,089
My gosh, he's saying all the things
I want to say.

696
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:04,260
They should target the head indeed.

697
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:06,019
- Hey!
- Goodness.

698
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,289
Easy, guys! You'll get hurt.

699
00:46:10,629 --> 00:46:12,099
- Go!
- We got this!

700
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,499
- We got this!
- Go, team!

701
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,200
Nice!

702
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,470
- Nice!
- Yes!

703
00:46:28,149 --> 00:46:30,209
- Let's score another!
- We can do this!

704
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,419
- We got this.
- Let's go.

705
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,459
No!

706
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:02,950
- I'm...
- Oh, no.

707
00:47:03,709 --> 00:47:05,018
- A double nosebleed...
- My gosh.

708
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:06,339
- It's a double nosebleed.
- Gosh.

709
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,950
- Hey, are you okay?
- My goodness.

710
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,459
- Bum Tae, my gosh.
- Bum Tae.

711
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,088
- Goodness.
- Are you okay?

712
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:15,160
Are you all right?

713
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,858
We're getting a new professor?
No one told me anything about it.

714
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:21,200
Oh, that's...

715
00:47:28,439 --> 00:47:29,470
Sorry.

716
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,679
They had to pause the game
because of me.

717
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,209
It ruined the momentum.

718
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,909
No, it's okay.
We were losing anyway.

719
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:36,950
Let's just accept it.

720
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,280
But the score is still 1-1.

721
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,450
Yes, we can beat them
in the relay race.

722
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,788
Yes, that's right!

723
00:47:44,789 --> 00:47:47,559
Sun Ho has been training so hard
for this day.

724
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,160
You went for a run even on the days
we didn't have running drills.

725
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:55,668
Go out for dinner with me
if we win the special leave.

726
00:47:55,669 --> 00:47:58,569
That jerk! He's having
another 1-on-1 chat with her!

727
00:47:58,839 --> 00:47:59,899
That little...

728
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,379
About the special leave...

729
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,570
You know how we can use
the holiday on Saturday, right?

730
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,189
Meet me at the front gate at 11 a.m.

731
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,478
How are you feeling? Good?

732
00:48:39,479 --> 00:48:40,838
Yes.

733
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:43,350
You need to do well. You can do it!

734
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,780
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

735
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,890
- You can do it.
- Good luck, Sun Ho!

736
00:48:51,919 --> 00:48:54,459
Let's go, Team Blue!

737
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,459
Let's go!

738
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,399
- Professor Yu!
- Good luck!

739
00:49:04,129 --> 00:49:06,439
You must win the race. You must.

740
00:49:06,669 --> 00:49:08,139
Gosh, you punk.

741
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,469
Okay, I heard you. I will.

742
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,539
Good luck.

743
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,249
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

744
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:26,120
- Let's go, Team Blue!
- Run!

745
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:28,060
Ready.

746
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,128
You can do it. Good luck!

747
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:32,629
You can do it!

748
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,269
(Kang Sun Ho)

749
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,930
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

750
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:11,899
- Run!
- Go get it!

751
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,769
- Run!
- You got this!

752
00:50:17,709 --> 00:50:20,378
You're almost there. Pass it to me!

753
00:50:20,379 --> 00:50:22,410
Let's go!

754
00:50:22,649 --> 00:50:25,349
- Go!
- All right!

755
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,989
He's winning!

756
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,918
No!

757
00:50:29,919 --> 00:50:32,919
Team White!

758
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:39,359
If I win this race,
I'll give the prize to Kang Hee.

759
00:50:41,229 --> 00:50:42,629
And I'm going to ask her out.

760
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,499
I'll tell her I like her.

761
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,740
I won't let you win.

762
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:52,539
(Korean National Police University)

763
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,249
Hurry up!

764
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:04,719
- Hurry up!
- Kwon Hyuk Phil, let's go!

765
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,519
Good luck!

766
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,069
You know how we can use
the holiday on Saturday, right?

767
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:17,970
Meet me at the front gate at 11 a.m.

768
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,370
No, this can't be him.

769
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:27,180
You got this!

770
00:51:31,919 --> 00:51:33,418
On the day
of Chungram Sports Festival,

771
00:51:33,419 --> 00:51:35,649
the building
will be completely empty.

772
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:39,720
I'm sure the culprit
will show up that day.

773
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,399
If I win this race,
I'm going to ask her out.

774
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:21,129
- Good luck!
- Team White!

775
00:52:24,169 --> 00:52:25,869
- No!
- Professor Kwon!

776
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:29,838
- You can do it!
- Go, Professor Yu!

777
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:34,108
Go, Professor Yu!

778
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,248
What's going on? Where is he going?

779
00:52:36,249 --> 00:52:39,319
- Hey!
- Where is he going?

780
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,450
Darn it!

781
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:52,959
(Residence Hall)

782
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:02,309
(Residence Hall)

783
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,640
I got you, punk.

784
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:38,979
Gosh, we almost won.

785
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:50,688
We were almost there though.
Darn it.

786
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:53,220
- We won!
- Darn it.

787
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:55,129
Darn it.

788
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:55,050
Hey.

789
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,350
What are you doing here?

790
00:54:57,819 --> 00:55:00,019
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

791
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:04,389
I asked what you are doing here!

792
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:06,329
Why would you yell at me?

793
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:08,068
They told me not to return
because of aftereffects.

794
00:55:08,069 --> 00:55:11,099
Therefore, I was appointed
as a professor...

795
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,540
at Korean National
Police University.

796
00:55:12,669 --> 00:55:14,300
So we're colleagues now.

797
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,810
What?

798
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:28,749
You lost.

799
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:33,619
What happened to Sun Ho
and Professor Yu though?

800
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,830
I know.

801
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:36,890
Did something happen to them?

802
00:55:37,689 --> 00:55:39,959
Hey, Sun Ho! What happened?

803
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:41,530
Kang Hee.

804
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:46,569
So... Let me explain what happened.

805
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:09,030
(The 41st Chungram Sports Festival)

806
00:56:18,899 --> 00:56:20,899
What did I expect?
That was so foolish of me.

807
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,129
Kang Hee.

808
00:56:43,629 --> 00:56:46,159
If it's not something urgent,
can we talk later?

809
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,459
I'm a bit tired.

810
00:56:52,939 --> 00:56:54,539
I heard I could hand over...

811
00:56:55,439 --> 00:56:57,439
the special leave I won as a prize
to someone else.

812
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:07,249
You need to attend your
mother's trial. You should use it.

813
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,350
Didn't I tell you this before?

814
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,120
Either talk behind my back
or just ignore it.

815
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,430
Do you really not know
why I'm doing this?

816
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,569
No, I don't. Why are you doing this?

817
00:57:42,689 --> 00:57:45,018
I'll carry this to the meeting spot
for you.

818
00:57:45,019 --> 00:57:47,759
It says you can't use
the suspect's statement...

819
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,458
as evidence against him
at his trial.

820
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:53,029
Did you hear about this?

821
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:54,359
(Freshman Oh's shocking secret)

822
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,569
Director Baek.

823
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,599
Please take down the post...

824
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,839
attacking Oh Kang Hee
on our website.

825
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:06,839
Please hurry before she sees it!

826
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,850
I...

827
00:58:17,749 --> 00:58:18,919
like you.

828
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,490
(The 41st Chungram Sports Festival)

829
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,620
Chul Jin asked for it, saying
he wants to work by your side.

830
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,858
That's why I transferred him there.

831
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:57,228
Even so...

832
00:58:57,229 --> 00:58:59,189
How could you do this
without talking to me first?

833
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:01,700
Anyway, okay. I have to go.

834
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,600
What happened?

835
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,410
Because of this...

836
00:59:13,709 --> 00:59:14,950
Do you know...

837
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:17,580
what I had to give up on today
because of this?

838
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,720
What?

839
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,330
Someone sneaked into my empty room
and went through my laptop.

840
00:59:25,089 --> 00:59:27,220
The frame for my family photo
is broken.

841
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:32,499
(Captain)

842
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,660
Goodness.

843
00:59:35,229 --> 00:59:36,330
Professor.

844
00:59:43,269 --> 00:59:44,310
Professor.

845
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:48,810
Professor.

846
01:00:13,669 --> 01:00:14,800
Maybe the real war...

847
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:17,939
was just beginning.

848
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,249
(Police University)

849
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:03,819
Why did you lie to me?

850
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:07,088
I wanted to kick you but took it out
on the poor trash can instead.

851
01:01:07,089 --> 01:01:09,259
The seats for the last one
have sold out.

852
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,288
Sorry?

853
01:01:10,289 --> 01:01:12,829
I've got a date today.
What are you up to?

854
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,930
I have very important plans.

855
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:16,568
What? Bum Tae?

856
01:01:16,569 --> 01:01:18,128
Why was Mr. Park
suddenly transferred here?

857
01:01:18,129 --> 01:01:20,539
Am I the only one who thinks
it's odd that he came here now?

858
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,009
I guess
you and Sun Ho are very close.

859
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:27,039
What do you think
he gained from planting a bug?

860
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:29,550
- Kang Sun Ho.
- You said the culprit is here.

861
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,819
I must catch the culprit
at all costs.
