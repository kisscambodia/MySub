00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,480
Two months ago, 99 girls

187
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,180
from Korea, China, and Japan
who speak different languages

188
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,270
and who have different cultures
gathered here with

189
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,880
the same dream of becoming a K-pop star.

190
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,810
But unfortunately,

191
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,220
someone will have to leave Girls Planet.

192
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,590
At the first survival announcement,

193
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,160
a cell will either survive or
be eliminated together.

194
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,900
Who will stay and who will go
among the 33 cells

195
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,340
will be decided by the votes of
the Planet Guardians.

196
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,600
From 164 countries all over the world

197
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,620
we had 39,360,000

198
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,020
and 509 votes.

199
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,550
Numerous Planet Guardians

200
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,480
supported and cheered on for your dreams.

201
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,450
Thank you all.

202
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,090
Thank you.

203
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,090
That's a lot.

204
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,730
Those votes will decide

205
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,860
the ranks from 1 to 17.
Only 17 cells will survive

206
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,270
and remain in Girls Planet.

207
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,410
But those who are eliminated
could still have a chance

208
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,410
by the masters' Planet Pass.

209
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,280
Among those who are eliminated,
one per group K, C, and J

210
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,590
will survive with the Planet Pass.

211
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,920
And the five teams

212
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,330
who won the Connect Mission

213
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,660
received a benefit during the global vote.

214
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,920
Let's see

215
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,200
how the benefit affected

216
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,870
the girls' survival and elimination.

217
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,170
Also, the new Planet TOP9
changed by voting

218
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,880
will be revealed.

219
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,450
Who will have the honor of
becoming the first TOP9 member

220
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,320
that is solely selected
by Planet Guardians' votes?

221
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,820
The great story of the girls.

222
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,480
The first survival announcement
of Girls Planet 999.

223
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,180
It begins now.

224
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,380
The first survival announcement
of Girls Planet 999.

225
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,520
Who will have to leave
and who will get to stay?

226
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,090
I will now reveal the first survival cell

227
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,330
of Girls Planet 999.

228
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,120
Right away?

229
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,330
Right away.

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,040
Before I announce

231
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,010
the last place, 17th cell...

232
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,470
My goodness. Why?

233
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,970
What?

234
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,570
-"Before"?
-"Before"?

235
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,680
-What's going on?
-What is it?

236
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,520
I will announce the 16th cell first.

237
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,210
-Seriously.
-I knew it. It's Mnet.

238
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,790
That's so cruel.

239
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,550
We placed 16th.

240
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,450
We should be around here somewhere.

241
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,260
I'm getting goosebumps.

242
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,090
The cell that placed 16th

243
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,440
received the voting benefit
from the last Connect Mission.

244
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,510
Is that us?

245
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,770
-Is it us?
-Could it be us?

246
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,700
Do you think that's us?

247
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,030
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

248
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,130
I have no idea.

249
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,770
I hope we placed 16th.

250
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,450
-What now?
-It's going to be okay.

251
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,950
And this cell includes

252
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,580
a girl who played the main vocalist
in the Connect Mission.

253
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
That's not us.

254
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,750
Is it Bo Ra's cell?

255
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,500
-Yes. That's right.
-Bo Ra.

256
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,390
♫ You see if it's love
you will know right away ♫

257
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,340
♫ You will notice ♫

258
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,990
-No.
-It's you.

259
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,770
There's also Hye Rim.

260
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,410
It's Hye Rim.

261
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,770
♫ I don't know what you'll choose,
so I got you two choices ♫

262
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,980
The survival cell will be on the screen.

263
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,980
Who will be the first cell to survive?

264
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,850
The 16th cell survived
through the global voting.

265
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,330
The music...

266
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,490
This music... Everyone's hands are sweaty.

267
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,370
The 16th cell is...

268
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,660
Please show us.

269
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,410
It's coming.

270
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,150
Kim Bo Ra, Zhang Luo Fei,

271
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,090
- and Hayase Hana.
-Congratulations.

272
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,050
What? My goodness.

273
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,890
I never imagined this.

274
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,620
-Why are you crying?
-Why are you crying?

275
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,960
-Congratulations.
-Don't cry.

276
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,360
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

277
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,570
-Congratulations.
-Good work.

278
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,730
I love you.

279
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,980
This cell received
the double vote benefit.

280
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,680
The benefit must've helped them

281
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,100
-That's possible.
-place 16th.

282
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,740
My goodness.

283
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,120
The benefit is really important.

284
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,840
Congratulations.

285
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,450
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

286
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,830
I will now announce the next cell.

287
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,900
The cell that placed 15th.

288
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,330
Unless we placed 15th, we're at stake.

289
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,230
We're unlikely to make it.

290
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,940
-My goodness.
-My gosh.

291
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,440
15th place.

292
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,180
This cell chose E.B.S.
for the Connect Mission.

293
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,340
They chose a boy group's song

294
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,040
[and presented a wonderful performance
on the stage.]

295
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,380
♫ Break and face it ♫

296
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,020
E.B.S.

297
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,480
Please.

298
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,590
E.B.S.

299
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,660
This cell does not have a member

300
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,000
who was in charge of a killer part
or a leader in the Connect Mission.

301
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,460
What?

302
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,160
-Ye Eun. Isn't that you?
-No.

303
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,460
-I think that's you.
-Maybe them.

304
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,640
-I think it's you.
-It's them.

305
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,030
Who is it?

306
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,670
Who will get to enjoy the joy of survival?

307
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,150
The 15th cell.

308
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Please show us.

309
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,590
Congratulations.

310
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,260
-See?
-Congratulations.

311
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,470
It's An Jeong Min, Wang Ya Le,
and Fujimoto Ayaka.

312
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,190
Please get on to the stage.

313
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,609
I will continue the announcement.

314
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,210
Next is the 14th cell.

315
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,250
We placed 14th last time.

316
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,180
But what if it's not us?

317
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,480
Please let it be us.

318
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,980
The K Group girl in this cell

319
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,860
performed Apink's song

320
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,930
in the Planet Demo Stage.

321
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,370
♫ Mr. Chu
Right on the lips ♫

322
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,700
♫ Plant a sweet kiss ♫

323
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,060
Apink?

324
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:40,980
Hye Won?

325
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,230
Apink?

326
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,100
-Ye Eun?
-Ye Eun?

327
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,840
Why does it always apply to me?

328
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,310
Also, this cell received

329
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,880
the winning benefit
in the Connect Mission.

330
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,160
That's Hye Won.

331
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,550
It's either you or Hye Won.

332
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,590
-Right here.
-Here.

333
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,230
I don't know. I can never guess.

334
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,290
The 14th cell that survived
through the global voting.

335
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,270
Please show us.

336
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,470
The 14th cell.

337
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,210
This cell received
the double vote benefit.

338
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,050
Please get on to the stage.

339
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,700
Follow me soon.

340
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,230
-Okay?
-Yes.

341
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,770
Hurry up.

342
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,270
Stop crying and follow them.

343
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,660
Thank you.

344
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,340
Why are you so sad?

345
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,270
Let's listen to the three cells

346
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,340
that survived in Girls Planet.

347
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,720
First of all, I'd like to thank

348
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,710
the Planet Guardians
who cheered and supported us

349
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,020
to show the next performance.

350
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,620
Ji Yoon and the members of Our Season
who I performed with.

351
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,260
I love you so much and thank you.

352
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Dear Planet Guardians. I love you.

353
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,700
Let's listen to the 15th cell.

354
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,800
Thank you very much, Planet Guardians

355
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,980
who voted for us.

356
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Please continue to support us.

357
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,550
I'd like to thank Planet Guardians

358
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,260
for giving me another chance to perform.

359
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,700
And my Apink members.

360
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,590
Get here as fast as you can, okay?

361
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,900
Thank you so much, everyone.

362
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,010
Liang Jiao.

363
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,510
Do you think you can continue
with your sister?

364
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,170
I'm not crying because I survived.

365
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,940
I'm crying because I'm afraid
my sister might not survive.

366
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,460
Go, Liang Jiao.

367
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,200
The survivors of Girls Planet.

368
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,960
Congratulations.

369
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,140
Please move to the seats
according to your rankings.

370
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,810
Next is the 13th cell

371
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,520
that survived in Girls Planet.

372
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,380
My heart aches so much.

373
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,450
This girl's Planet Demo Stage performance

374
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,800
recorded over five million views.

375
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,510
What? Five million?

376
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,300
-"BOOMBAHYAH"?
-Is it "BOOMBAHYAH"?

377
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,360
It's "BOOMBAHYAH".

378
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,830
♫ BOOMBAHYAH ♫

379
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,080
♫ BOOMBAHYAH ♫

380
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,320
Isn't it "Crazy"?

381
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,810
Did "Crazy" record over five million?

382
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,860
♫ C-R-A-Z-Y, copy me ♫

383
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,320
And this cell showed their cute charms

384
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,730
performing "YES or YES".

385
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,320
-Se In.
-Chae Yun?

386
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,390
Se In or Chae Yun.

387
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,020
-Oh, Se In.
-Se In?

388
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,930
It's Chae Yun.

389
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,030
-It's Chae Yun.
-It could be you.

390
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,170
Ririka.

391
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,340
Why is everyone mentioning us?

392
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,340
-Don't look at us.
-Don't look at us.

393
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,380
I will announce the 13th cell
that survived.

394
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,480
I'm scared.

395
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,910
I'm so afraid.

396
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,480
The 13th cell.

397
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,020
Please show us.

398
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,970
We made it.

399
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,040
-I'm not going to cry.
-It's Lee Chae Yun,

400
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,180
Leung Cheuk Ying, and Kishida Ririka.

401
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,410
-Let's walk fast.
-Walk fast.

402
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,710
Walk fast.

403
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,680
-Thank you.
-I love you guys.

404
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,450
Next is the 12th cell.

405
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,590
This cell

406
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,550
performed "YES or YES"
during the Connect Mission.

407
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,660
And in this cell,

408
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,630
there is one member
who took the killer part.

409
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,590
It's Ji Won or Do Ah.

410
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,730
♫ Choose between the two, yes or yes ♫

411
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,030
♫ Choose between the two, yes or yes ♫

412
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,740
♫ Choose between the two ♫

413
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,950
- ♫ Yes or yes ♫
- ♫ Yes or yes ♫

414
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,270
The 12th cell
will advance to the next mission.

415
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,410
The survivors are...

416
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,050
Please.

417
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,120
It must be Do Ah.

418
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,690
It might be us.

419
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,060
-We weren't as good.
-Right.

420
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,490
It's Huh Ji Won, Chia Yi,
and Yamauchi Moana.

421
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,630
This cell received twice their votes
with the benefit they earned.

422
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,270
-Congrats.
-Congratulations.

423
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,800
Next is

424
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,340
the 11th cell that will remain
on Girls Planet.

425
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,390
One of the survivors

426
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,340
in this cell

427
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,980
is the youngest member of a group.

428
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,590
Myah.

429
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,620
Who's the youngest member of C Group?

430
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,130
And this cell earned the benefit

431
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,440
during the Connect Mission.

432
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,800
-It's either Myah,
-Myah.

433
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,840
Chae Hyun, or Ayana.

434
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,950
I'll announce the 11th cell

435
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,840
chosen by the Planet Guardians
all over the world.

436
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,050
If it's Myah, that means
she went up so much.

437
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,580
She received three times the votes
and she even did the killer part.

438
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,880
Please reveal the 11th cell.

439
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,640
It's Guinn Myah, Yang Zi Ge,
and Kamimoto Kotone.

440
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,980
This cell received three times the votes
with the benefit they earned.

441
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,880
-It's crazy.
-Please come up to the stage.

442
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,980
Let's hear from the three surviving cells.

443
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,280
I'm truly grateful to the Planet Guardians

444
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,120
for giving us a chance to perform
in the next round.

445
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
I love them so much.

446
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,870
And I love my cell so much.

447
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,840
-Gosh.
-Me too.

448
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,300
I'm really grateful
to be able to stand here right now.

449
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,770
Planet Guardians, thank you so, so much.

450
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,010
And Chia Yi, Ji Won.

451
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:13,430
I'm really happy

452
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,160
to have been your team.
Thank you as always.

453
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,840
Dear Planet Guardians,

454
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,430
please show a lot of love to the girls.

455
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,550
-Myah.
-Myah.

456
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,480
"Pretty U" guys,

457
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,780
thank you

458
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,410
for being so nice to me.

459
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,550
I love you.

460
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,230
I'm done.

461
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,470
Please move to your seats.

462
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,800
Congratulations on becoming survivors.

463
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,300
I'll look forward to seeing
greater performances in the next mission.

464
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,670
Congratulations.

465
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,750
The first survivor announcement.

466
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,450
Next up is the tenth cell.

467
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,540
Who was in tenth place last time?

468
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,380
Oh, please.

469
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,760
The K Group girl in this cell

470
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,480
performed "POP/STARS" by K/DA

471
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,680
during the Planet Demo Stage.

472
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,450
♫ Ain't nobody bringing us ♫

473
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,930
♫ Down, down, down ♫

474
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,570
♫ They could try but we're gonna
wear the crown ♫

475
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,800
♫ You could go ♫

476
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,660
Don't cry already. Why are you crying?

477
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,380
-I don't think it's me.
-Don't cry.

478
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,980
We were ranked 9th and 10th.

479
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,510
-Ninth and tenth.
-Right.

480
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
We were ranked 9th and 10th.

481
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,620
At the crossroads
of survival and elimination,

482
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,120
the tenth cell has survived,
and they are...

483
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,020
I can't stand to watch this.

484
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,230
Please. Let it be us.

485
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,190
If we don't make it now,
we won't be able to survive.

486
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,520
Don't cry.

487
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,900
Please reveal the tenth cell.

488
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,630
-It's you.
-Reina.

489
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,840
It's you!

490
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,470
-Reina.
-Choi Ye Young, Chen Hsin Wei, and Reina.

491
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,880
Congratulations.

492
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,840
Please come up to the stage.

493
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,140
-Ye Young.
-Congratulations.

494
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,000
Next is the meaningful number
for Girls Planet 999.

495
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,430
Guess what.

496
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,930
The ninth cell.

497
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,340
That's right. It's the ninth cell
that survived on Girls Planet.

498
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,470
I'm having low expectations now.

499
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,130
One of them is a member of the team
that won first place

500
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,770
in the Signal song evaluation.

501
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,550
Oh, gosh.

502
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,760
-Hikaru should be...
-Hikaru's place might be higher.

503
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,850
-It might not be us.
-Oh, my.

504
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,060
It might be them.

505
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,730
I'll announce the ninth cell
that will stay in the competition

506
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,570
and continue with another mission.

507
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,550
-Congrats.
-It's Kim Da Yeon, Wu Tammy,

508
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,550
-and Sakurai Miu.
-Congrats.

509
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,320
-Da Yeon.
-Congratulations.

510
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,430
Please come up to the stage.

511
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,730
Let's hear from the survivors
this time as well.

512
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,770
When other girls were called,

513
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,730
I felt like there was no place for us.

514
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,840
So I didn't get any hopes up.

515
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,240
But I'm really grateful
to the Planet Guardians.

516
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,910
I hope they keep supporting us. Thank you.

517
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,410
And Chen Hsin Wei.

518
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,930
He's ugly.

519
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,440
He's an ugly man.

520
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,800
-Did you say an ugly man?
-Yes.

521
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,930
I'm sorry.

522
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,070
Why?

523
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,140
Why?

524
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,770
I'm sorry.

525
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,750
Don't be.

526
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,770
I've never thought I was handsome.

527
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,450
No.

528
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,620
You're a handsome man.

529
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,850
I mean it.

530
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,050
Thank you.

531
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,230
-It's a joke.
-You're really handsome.

532
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,770
I'm joking. Don't worry.

533
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,940
Let's hear from the ninth cell.

534
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,030
I'm so grateful and happy

535
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,530
that we get to perform again
with another chance.

536
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,130
Thank you.

537
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,770
Up to the ninth cell has been revealed.

538
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,140
Before moving onto the next cell,

539
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,360
we've prepared a video as a break

540
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,480
for the Planet Guardians
who must've watched it nervously.

541
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,090
-Are you curious?
-What is it?

542
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,430
-What is it?
-Let's watch together.

543
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,770
-What?
-A fashion show?

544
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,930
A fashion show?

545
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,140
"My head hurts."

546
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,750
-"My stomach hurts."
-"Hurts."

547
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,270
I don't see anyone.

548
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,470
She's so pretty.

549
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,530
Have you been well?

550
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,940
-Yes!
-Yes!

551
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,130
Do you want to know
why you're gathered here today?

552
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,940
-For a fashion show!
-For a fashion show!

553
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,970
If you're an idol,
you must never leave this out.

554
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,950
It's fashion.

555
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,740
By the way, I'm here with someone today.

556
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,810
Please come out.

557
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,110
Who is it?

558
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,570
My gosh.

559
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,090
[I'm a huge fan of his.]

560
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,910
[I couldn't breathe.]

561
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,590
[Fuka told me to stop staring at him.]

562
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,020
Hello, it's nice to meet you.
I'm a model, Jung Hyuk.

563
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,920
I'm a model, Bae Yoon Young.

564
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,530
Jung Hyuk, tell me.
How will Planet Fashion Queen proceed?

565
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,200
Nine people who were a team during
the Connect Mission will be a team.

566
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,500
[Please choose one model, one stylist,]

567
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,640
[and lastly, one who will be
in charge of hair and makeup.]

568
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,740
The models will have 30 minutes

569
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,180
to get changed and hair and makeup done.

570
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,340
Two teams who stand out the most

571
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,860
will be chosen as
the Planet Fashion Queen.

572
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,020
And everyone in the two teams

573
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,590
will get a free pass for the day.

574
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,060
Wow, the free pass is...

575
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,560
Free pass. I wanted it so badly.

576
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,590
♫ Freedom! ♫

577
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,440
How will you pick two winning teams?

578
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,840
The first winning team will be

579
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,840
the Best Dresser Team who has

580
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,020
an outstanding fashion sense and
expresses the current trend the best.

581
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,450
And the second winning team,

582
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,280
will be who expresses an
out-of-the-world fashion sense.

583
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,020
It'll be the Worst Dresser Team.

584
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,980
-Then we...
-We'll look cool.

585
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,690
[Honestly, I thought
it would be better to]

586
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,420
go for the Worst Dresser Team.

587
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,920
[I wanted it so bad.]

588
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,100
Go, girls!

589
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,370
Let's do this.

590
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,300
Stand by.

591
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,780
-Do well.
-Okay.

592
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,910
Let's do this!

593
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,680
-Let's go! Stand by.
-Let's do this!

594
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,910
-Three, two, one.
-Two, one.

595
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,340
-Go!
-Go!

596
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,890
Hey.

597
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,730
I think I can do better.

598
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,520
Oh my gosh.

599
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,520
What?

600
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,990
Should I go up like this?

601
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,490
Say you have them because it's hot.

602
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,800
Our model is so cool.

603
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,870
You look good.

604
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,980
There's not much time left.

605
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,050
-It's okay.
-I don't know. Just run!

606
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,580
Try this one.

607
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,410
-No, not like that!
-Sorry.

608
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,360
We'll now start
the Planet Queen Fashion Show.

609
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,150
I'm so excited.

610
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,760
So pretty.

611
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:35,949
She's so good.

612
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,690
[It felt like I was at
a real fashion show.]

613
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,420
[The vibe... It wasn't the Sumomo I knew.]

614
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,420
When you first walked out,

615
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:47,520
you did so well that I thought
I better take it seriously.

616
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,900
Thank you.

617
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,909
Wow.

618
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,770
She has really great proportions.

619
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,270
Power walking.

620
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,390
I want to give you more points.

621
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,860
You almost sprained your ankle here.

622
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,270
Most people get startled
when that happens,

623
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,140
but you handled it professionally.

624
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,230
You went back to posing,

625
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,880
and your level of confidence was the best.

626
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,480
Joung Min!

627
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,300
Joung Min!

628
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,620
Your body shape makes the clothes shine.

629
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,260
I was shocked

630
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,920
[when you took off the jacket.]

631
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,330
[Everything was perfect.]

632
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,330
You should join my agency.

633
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,020
You can pick the one you want.

634
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,970
Why are you trying to steal our talents?

635
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,200
We need stars in the model industry too.

636
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,500
We need them too.

637
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,880
What is this?

638
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,070
-Who is that?
-Wen Zhe.

639
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,710
Wen Zhe.

640
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,290
[She is usually really funny.
It was crazy.]

641
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,090
When I looked at you,

642
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,590
-I want to dress like you.
-Me too.

643
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,700
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

644
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,520
You really have the current trend down.

645
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,230
Wow!

646
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,220
Oh my.

647
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,670
Wow.

648
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,880
[It was shocking and horrifying.]

649
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,220
The makeup... It was insane.

650
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,620
Your hair and makeup are shocking.

651
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,800
It's not just...

652
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,960
It's not just your hair and makeup.

653
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,600
Hello.

654
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,930
Gosh.

655
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,090
[Ji Min is normally not like that.]

656
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,020
She cried

657
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,980
with eyelashes on her cheeks.

658
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,020
The Best Dresser Team is...

659
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,020
Team 2 of "YES or YES".

660
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,660
The Worst Dresser Team is...

661
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,900
Congratulations, Team "Pretty U".

662
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,370
♫ Freedom ♫

663
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,150
Hey, why is it so dark?

664
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,380
It's dark.

665
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,120
I'm scared.

666
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,340
Where are we?

667
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,150
-What is this?
-Look!

668
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,220
Wow!

669
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,270
This is amazing!

670
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,730
There's Ririka here.

671
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,270
Raccoon Ririka.

672
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,880
The ears move.

673
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,750
♫ Baby shark ♫

674
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,140
-Judy Kim Ye Eun.
-Guinn Myah.

675
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,090
I think it'll be scary.

676
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,290
I'm scared.

677
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,360
I can't ride it. I'm not tall enough.

678
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,490
I might faint.

679
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,830
It doesn't work?

680
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,120
It's going up. It's going up.

681
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,970
Why am I here?

682
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,470
This is so scary.

683
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,800
This is not a joke.

684
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,910
Thanks for everything, guys.

685
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,220
It's fun!

686
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,150
It was scary.

687
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,550
It's pretty.

688
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,960
Here it goes.

689
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,870
I like the merry-go-round.

690
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,200
Hello.

691
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,200
This is so romantic.

692
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,520
We were able to see

693
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,220
their unexpected charms

694
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,620
that were different from
when they were on stage.

695
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,520
Next,

696
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,760
here is the next cell to survive.

697
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,420
I'll announce it.

698
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,050
I should stay calm.

699
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,520
My heart is beating so fast. I'm dying.

700
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,800
Of the remaining 25 cells,

701
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,300
only nine will survive.

702
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,510
Only nine.

703
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,410
The 17th cell.
And from the 8th to the 1st.

704
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,080
First, the 8th cell.

705
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,750
I'll announce it.

706
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,580
Hold hands? No, yes? Not now?

707
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,680
Not now.

708
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,260
-You sure?
-Yes.

709
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,550
I'm so nervous.

710
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,190
I think it'll be Su Yeon.

711
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,380
I hope it's Su Yeon.

712
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,200
Yes. Me too.

713
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,160
Let's hold hands.

714
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,430
I wonder who's eighth.

715
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,540
Who's eighth?

716
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,730
Not us.

717
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,840
-Not us.
-In the

718
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,640
Connect Mission...

719
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,980
It's us if he says "Yes or Yes".

720
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,070
Killer part?

721
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,950
-The benefit
-Went to her.

722
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,980
did not go to her, but she survived.

723
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,740
-Do A?
-Do A?

724
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,950
I think it's one of us.

725
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,880
"The Eve"?

726
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,190
We didn't get any benefit points.

727
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,590
Bahiyyih?

728
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
-It could be one of us.
-Yes.

729
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,200
And the girl in this cell,
during the Connect Mission...

730
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,160
-Killer part.
-Killer part.

731
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,530
She led the team.

732
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,700
It's Zi Yin!

733
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,010
We were both leaders.

734
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,410
Ya Ning and you?

735
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,300
-Let's do this.
-Thank you.

736
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,340
-She was a leader too.
-There's one over there.

737
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,350
For us...

738
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,040
Ya Ning? Xu Zi Yin?

739
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
So hard.

740
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,350
Which cell will survive?

741
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,350
I don't know.

742
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,090
Please show us the eighth cell!

743
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,790
Oh no...

744
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,090
What do we do?

745
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,730
We did it!

746
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,340
Wow.

747
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,570
-Good job.
-Great work.

748
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,200
You did great.

749
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,130
-"POP/STARS".
-It's 10, 9, 8.

750
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,730
It's 10, 9, 8.

751
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,380
KDA, yes!

752
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,150
This is amazing.

753
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,050
Kim Su Yeon, Fu Ya Ning, Nonaka Shana.

754
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,690
The seventh cell that survived
on Girls Planet.

755
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,350
Let's hold hands now.

756
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,590
Okay.

757
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,590
I think Do A will be 7th
and Chae Hyun will be 6th.

758
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,770
Because of the benefit points.

759
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,030
They need to call us now.

760
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,320
If not, we won't have a spot.

761
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,560
Do Ah.
I think Chae Hyun will be higher up.

762
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,760
I want to go up there quickly.
Don't you agree?

763
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,870
Maybe he'll go, "'Fiesta' Team 1!"

764
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,040
That's us.

765
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,300
I'm so nervous.

766
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,800
I think it'll be either Bahiyyih or Do Ah.

767
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,020
In the Connect Mission, this cell...

768
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,380
"YES or YES"?

769
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,020
-"YES or YES"?
-"Performed 'YES or YES'."

770
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,750
"This cell performed 'YES or YES'."

771
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,450
This cell performed "Fiesta".

772
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,590
Us?

773
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,660
Is it us?

774
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,450
-Gosh.
-"Fiesta".

775
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,330
My heart's beating so fast. "Fiesta".

776
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,970
♫ When flowers bloom in all colors
and petals scatter ♫

777
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,910
♫ The fiesta reaches the climax ♫

778
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,800
♫ Fiesta,
I swallowed the sun in my heart ♫

779
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,670
Ji Min.

780
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,910
It could be her.

781
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,650
Hold on.

782
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,020
The seventh cell to survive
by global votes.

783
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,050
I can't wait to find out about this one.

784
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,090
Please show us.

785
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,330
So cool.

786
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,160
-Congratulations.
-Good job.

787
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,660
Huening Bahiyyih.

788
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,100
-Why are they so low?
-No idea.

789
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,730
Because of the benefit?

790
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,340
Next is the sixth cell that survived.

791
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,700
Please.

792
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,320
Oh, no.

793
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,680
-There aren't many seats left.
-I know.

794
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,050
Let's hold hands.

795
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:31,930
My stomach hurts.

796
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,160
Gosh.

797
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,260
The K Group member of this cell

798
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,470
may or may not have debuted
as a girl group.

799
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,870
-It's us.
-Let him finish.

800
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,910
And she has.

801
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,010
It's us.

802
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,800
Ye Seo, Do Ah, me...

803
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,800
It's Do Ah.

804
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,240
Ye Seo debuted too.

805
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,170
-Oh, please.
-Don't do this.

806
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,950
If we don't place sixth,
it'll be over for us.

807
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,080
I really want to place sixth.

808
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,360
What do we do?

809
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,990
-I feel like I might die.
-The sixth cell.

810
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,150
Wait.

811
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:10,550
Oh, gosh.

812
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,550
Please show us.

813
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:14,320
Come on out!

814
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,300
It's really...

815
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,860
Right, it's us.

816
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,140
-What a relief.
-I know.

817
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,200
-Do Ah.
-Do Ah.

818
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,980
-Good job.
-Do Ah.

819
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,270
-Gosh.
-Good.

820
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,020
I'm so glad.

821
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:41,450
Let's hear from the girls who survived.

822
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,830
I'd like to give sincere thanks
to the Planet Guardians

823
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,660
for voting for us.

824
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,940
A total of 99 girls.

825
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,730
I don't feel so happy
because I'll have to say goodbye

826
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,700
to some of the girls today.

827
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,570
I think

828
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:04,640
we're already a team
who performed "O.O.O" together.

829
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,990
I hope we will see each other again.

830
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:11,290
We'll work harder. Thank you.

831
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,450
We'll work harder,
so please keep supporting us.

832
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,700
Thank you, Planet Guardians.

833
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,390
They're so pretty.

834
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,770
I'm grateful to the Planet Masters.

835
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,040
The 99 of us went through so much.

836
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,080
Thank you so much, girls.

837
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,720
We'll work harder
to show better performances.

838
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,720
Thank you.

839
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,090
The 8th, 7th, and 6th cells,

840
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,550
please move to your respective seats.

841
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:50,120
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

842
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:53,420
-Oh, that.
-Lucky seven.

843
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,060
Good work.

844
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,270
1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 17.

845
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,380
Yes!

846
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,470
-I was so nervous.
-Me too.

847
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,780
We're safe.

848
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,570
Good work.

849
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,410
A lot of cells are still waiting
for the results.

850
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,890
What do I do?
I feel like I'm melting away.

851
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,950
These are the cells in the upper ranks.

852
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:26,300
I'll announce the 5th, 4th, and 3rd cells.

853
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,700
Oh, the 5th, 4th, and 3rd.

854
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,630
Let's make it in the top five.

855
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,440
First, the fifth cell.

856
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,480
Ye Seo.

857
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,240
-Ye Seo?
-Ye Seo.

858
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,150
-It's us!
-Us.

859
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,090
It's really us!

860
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,350
Let's go higher. Please.

861
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,120
-Gosh.
-During the Connect Mission,

862
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,550
this cell...

863
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,790
"Took the victory."

864
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,230
-Benefit.
-Benefit?

865
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,700
This cell performed a girl group song.

866
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,240
It's not us.

867
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:07,040
-Ye Seo, Ayana...
-Yu Jin.

868
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,540
Can't you feel my heartbeat?

869
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:11,630
Gosh, I'm nervous.

870
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,380
The fifth cell.

871
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,410
Please show us.

872
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,950
Ayana.

873
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,730
This time, it's the fourth cell.

874
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,560
Please.

875
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,730
-Ye Seo?
-Ye Seo?

876
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,510
-Young Eun?
-Xiao Ting?

877
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:45,840
I want to win.

878
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,120
My heart's about to explode.

879
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,620
Me too.

880
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:53,590
All the other cells got the benefit

881
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:56,120
except for Su Rui Qi's cell.

882
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,850
-You're right.
-It could be Hikaru's cell.

883
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:02,850
-Us.
-What?

884
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,090
-Us?
-Us.

885
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,920
No!

886
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,590
No, we have to place higher.

887
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,790
It's really starting now.

888
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,730
I can't breathe.

889
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:12,800
This cell...

890
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,630
But I'm okay with taking fourth place.

891
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,730
-It might be Ye Seo.
-I agree.

892
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,270
During the Connect Mission...

893
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,480
-They won?
-E.B.S.

894
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:23,950
Hey.

895
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,290
One of them was the leader...

896
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,260
-It might be her or you.
-of a team.

897
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,480
What?

898
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,480
That's Mashiro and Yu Jin.

899
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,950
I'll work hard.

900
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,400
-It must be us.
-It's us.

901
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,440
Oh, gosh.

902
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,060
Who is it?

903
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:47,200
-Yu Jin's cell or...
-Mashiro.

904
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,510
I'll announce the fourth cell.

905
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,200
The fourth. This is crazy.

906
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,770
This makes no sense.

907
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,050
Please show us.

908
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,490
-Congratulations.
-Ye Seo.

909
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,960
All three of them are so pretty.

910
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,560
It feels...

911
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:17,800
-It feels strange.
-I know, right?

912
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,960
Let's move onto the top three cells

913
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,110
who received the biggest support
from the Planet Guardians.

914
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,840
I'll start with the third cell.

915
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,880
I'm so cold.

916
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,310
I'm really nervous.

917
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,410
Xiao Ting.

918
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,260
-Su Rui Qi.
-Me too.

919
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,160
TOP3. It's TOP3 now.

920
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,090
No way.

921
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,660
Yu Jin...

922
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:49,990
This is so neck and neck.

923
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,940
In this cell,

924
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,250
-Tell us.
-there's a girl who was in charge of...

925
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,420
-The killer part?
-The killer part in the Connect Mission.

926
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,590
-It's not us.
-Not us.

927
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,910
-The killer part.
-The two of us.

928
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,380
♫ How you like that? ♫

929
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,860
♫ You're going to like that ♫

930
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:20,930
♫ Break and face it ♫

931
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,570
♫ So they can see us ♫

932
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,270
Hikaru, what's with your face?

933
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,380
I think it's either Xiao Ting or Rui Qi.

934
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:35,010
Probably Rui Qi because of the benefit.

935
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,770
-I think she can win without the benefit.
-Also in this cell...

936
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,590
Also in this cell, there's a girl

937
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,590
who got first place...

938
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,980
-She's number one.
-Gosh.

939
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,330
-That's you.
-It's the two of you guys.

940
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,120
Both of them did.

941
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:52,870
This is so fun.

942
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,200
During the Signal song.

943
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:59,940
♫ The sky is open beyond the stars ♫

944
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,810
♫ It's time for your dreams and mine
to connect ♫

945
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,580
My heart's about to explode.

946
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,310
Here, give me your hand.

947
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,590
It's a fight between the two

948
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,240
-first-place winners.
-You're right.

949
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,980
So fun.

950
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,980
I'll announce the third cell who will make

951
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,750
the upper rankings.

952
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,700
The third cell survived
with the global voting.

953
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,500
It might not be us.

954
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,470
Please show us.

955
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,800
The benefit might help them get
a high ranking.

956
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,770
Who is it?

957
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,480
-Yes.
-Right.

958
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,190
It's us!

959
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,380
The benefit can't be ignored.

960
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,770
Let's hear from the survivors.

961
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,560
First, the fifth cell.

962
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,240
I'm thankful to Ayana who made our cell.

963
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,710
Great work, Yiman.

964
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,510
And my "YES or YES" teammates.

965
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,610
I'll be waiting, Hye Rim.

966
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:17,520
Sumomo and Yu Ling too.

967
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:18,750
I love you.

968
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,450
-Mashiro.
-Yes?

969
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,520
Please let us know how you feel.

970
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,620
We'll practice harder

971
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,400
and get better

972
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:36,630
to live up to your votes,

973
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,560
support, and expectations.

974
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:44,670
I want to thank Ye Seo and Xing Qiao.

975
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,200
I'm grateful

976
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,880
to my "Fiesta" teammates.

977
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,720
And Nagomi,

978
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:56,910
I'm truly grateful
that we got to do this together.

979
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,160
I love you.

980
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,690
Thank you.

981
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,560
Next, the third cell.

982
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,130
I always felt like I was a kid

983
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,730
lost in the woods.

984
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:20,070
I'd like to give thanks
to the production team

985
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:23,050
for giving me the chance to prove myself.

986
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,480
Thanks to them, I made 99 friends.

987
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,450
I got to make touching memories.

988
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:34,480
Also, Hikaru picked me and Rui Qi.

989
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:38,830
I'm thankful that we'll be together.

990
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,990
I'll work even harder from now on.
Thank you.

991
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:47,660
Please go find your seats
according to your rankings.

992
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:48,800
Congratulations.

993
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:56,950
What do we do?

994
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,720
Look at the view!

995
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,530
Now, only the cells

996
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,100
in the 1st, 2nd, and 17th places are left.

997
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:13,960
There are only three left.

998
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:15,660
Please say 17th place, Lee Ra Yeon.

999
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:17,500
Who will survive?

1000
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:21,500
Before I continue with the announcement...

1001
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,910
-What?
-Before that.

1002
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,840
There is a very fun video prepared for us.

1003
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:26,880
What is it?

1004
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:28,180
What is it?

1005
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,410
We'll get to see the hidden sides

1006
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,150
of the girls we couldn't see on TV before.

1007
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:36,410
Planet Guardians. Let's watch together.

1008
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,330
[-What's that?
-What's that?]

1009
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,020
Ta-da.

1010
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:43,800
What's this?

1011
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,020
What's this?

1012
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,330
-What's that?
-What's this?

1013
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,770
What's that?

1014
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:52,910
Awards?

1015
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:54,340
-Awards?
-Awards?

1016
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,910
The Planet Awards?

1017
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,150
It's a trophy.

1018
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,210
"You are a candidate for the awards"

1019
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:13,260
"the 99 girls will vote for."

1020
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:14,650
-What?
-What?

1021
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,090
What is this?

1022
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:23,360
Let's check together.

1023
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,230
-In 3, 2, 1.
-In 3, 2, 1.

1024
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,000
"First to wake"?

1025
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,570
-"First to wake"?
-"First to wake"?

1026
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,640
Oh, "First to wake".

1027
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,230
-"First to wake"?
-Wake up?

1028
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,950
-I...
-Did you wake up early?

1029
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,620
I voted for you.

1030
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,730
That's you.

1031
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,730
-I didn't.
-No?

1032
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,450
You were always there for breakfast.

1033
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,290
Kim Bo Ra.

1034
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,390
Bo Ra's always the first one up.

1035
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,320
She's always there alone for breakfast.

1036
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:26,360
She's always
completely ready for breakfast,

1037
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,500
[from head to toe.]

1038
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,270
[She wakes up early, gets ready,
and comes to practice before anyone else.]

1039
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,510
Is that you waking up?

1040
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,350
-Yurina.
-Yurina.

1041
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,880
If we have to head out by 8 a.m.,

1042
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:57,490
[she wakes up at 6:30 a.m. to get ready.]

1043
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:01,200
Yurina wakes up about
an hour and a half before us.

1044
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:05,290
[She gets ready and grabs breakfast.]

1045
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,280
I wonder who it'll be.

1046
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,520
Yurina, you win
the First to Wake Up Award!

1047
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,390
-Congratulations.
-It's nice.

1048
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:22,750
It's pretty.

1049
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:25,750
Which award do you think it is?

1050
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,390
I know what it is!

1051
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:29,500
You know what it is?

1052
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,800
Is this for the prettiest?

1053
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,200
I know what it is too!

1054
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:38,900
We're right.

1055
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,560
Let's receive it together.

1056
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,580
Okay.

1057
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:49,100
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1058
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,520
Thank you.

1059
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,270
Neither of you is letting it go.

1060
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,340
Can't we both be the winners?

1061
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:00,390
-Hello.
-Hello.

1062
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,690
Xiao Ting is pretty.

1063
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:06,030
Xiao Ting is so pretty!

1064
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,570
[She's so pretty.]

1065
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,540
[It's the kind of beauty
that makes you smile.]

1066
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:15,030
[She's so pretty.]

1067
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,880
[Ji Won has the look I like the most.]

1068
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,380
I'm seriously with her all the time,

1069
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,640
[and she's constantly pretty.]

1070
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:31,180
[I can't get used to it.
Every time I look at her, I'm amazed.]

1071
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:35,230
[I'd say Ji Won is the prettiest.]

1072
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,340
Thank you.

1073
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,100
I mean it. You're really pretty.

1074
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,340
Thank you.

1075
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,240
It's all yours.

1076
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,310
Let's share it.

1077
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,020
We did it.

1078
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,220
Bye.

1079
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,650
-"Best Makeup Transformation Award".
-Transformation.

1080
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:18,730
What?

1081
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,300
Without any makeup on,

1082
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:28,700
[she looks as innocent as a baby.]

1083
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:31,570
[But with makeup, she looks fierce.]

1084
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,840
[She's like a different person.]

1085
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,050
♫ An odor to a nice smell ♫

1086
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,590
♫ Mic, mic, bungee ♫

1087
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,850
♫ Mic, mic, bungee,
bright light ♫

1088
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:45,730
[Amazing.]

1089
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:50,490
She always wears glasses
when she doesn't have makeup on.

1090
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,510
[Then she seems kind of quirky.]

1091
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:59,080
[But with makeup,
she's like a different person.]

1092
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:09,790
Yes!

1093
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,090
Thank you.

1094
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,150
It's still an award.

1095
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,160
This could be a weapon
if it's held this way.

1096
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:26,040
-"The most popular".
-"The most popular".

1097
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,840
-Okay.
-Okay.

1098
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,680
Most popular? That's us, of course!

1099
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,730
Even I think I'm really popular.

1100
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,700
I think that about me too.

1101
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,520
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

1102
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:45,480
♫ Congratulations ♫

1103
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,830
She's hardly in her dorm.

1104
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,200
[She's so cheerful and outgoing.]

1105
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,120
[She never seems shy.]

1106
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,270
[She always introduces herself first,]

1107
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,870
[befriends them,]

1108
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,700
[and loves to talk too.]

1109
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:03,330
-We're...
-We're popular.

1110
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,850
Myah's the youngest

1111
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:16,050
[and full of energy.]

1112
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,750
[She's so cute]

1113
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:23,390
[when she approaches me.]

1114
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:26,770
Since you won the Cutie Fatale Award,

1115
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,390
show us your cutie fatale charm!

1116
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,540
Show us.

1117
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:33,700
I love you.

1118
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,510
That's so cute.

1119
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:39,630
-This way.
-Amazing.

1120
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,510
Thank you.

1121
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,720
That was fun!

1122
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:50,910
The Planet Awards certainly showed us

1123
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,350
the participants' many charms.

1124
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:55,090
Congratulations to all the winners.

1125
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,550
You won awards.

1126
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:00,960
Congratulations.

1127
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,590
It's time to reveal the top cell that won

1128
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:07,710
the most votes from Planet Guardians.

1129
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,940
I will now announce

1130
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,730
the top cell.

1131
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,540
-First place?
-The top cell first?

1132
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:14,710
What?

1133
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:17,710
It's unbelievable.

1134
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:20,410
I want to place first.

1135
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:23,590
Which cell will take first place?

1136
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:26,430
We'll first meet two contenders

1137
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,020
on the screen.

1138
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,200
Which one?

1139
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,620
It's obvious.

1140
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,660
Yu Jin?

1141
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:33,700
Yu Jin.

1142
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:35,920
[Yu Jin was in first place
in the interim evaluation.]

1143
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,130
[Yes, that's true.]

1144
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:39,470
I'm not sure.

1145
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,200
[Yu Jin was ranked first.]

1146
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:43,670
[Shen Xiao Ting was second.]

1147
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,740
First and second. They're both good.

1148
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:49,510
Both cells are ready.

1149
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,550
Let's reveal the first contending cell.

1150
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,240
Oh, I can't look.

1151
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,590
Let's see it!

1152
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:01,390
-What?
-Amazing.

1153
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,750
I knew it.

1154
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:04,890
That's amazing.

1155
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,920
Congratulations.

1156
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,960
Thank you.

1157
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:09,370
-Congratulations, May.
-Thank you.

1158
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:11,730
Top place. That's high.

1159
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:18,230
I knew it'd be them.

1160
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,640
[Their energy is different.]

1161
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:23,910
Let's check the 2nd 1st-place candidate.

1162
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,050
Xiao Ting.

1163
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,590
Yurina.

1164
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:27,980
Come here.

1165
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,090
Wait a minute.

1166
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,760
Show us the 2nd 1st-place candidate.

1167
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:39,550
Let's go.

1168
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:41,970
As expected.

1169
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,440
-Congrats.
-Congrats.

1170
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,030
I'm so jealous.

1171
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:47,470
It's cool to see
the 1st and 2nd-place cells compete.

1172
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:50,600
Yurina.

1173
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:52,510
Nice.

1174
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,410
-Right.
-We're the best.

1175
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,480
-They're both Team "How You Like That"?
-The legendary team.

1176
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:00,040
♫ How you like that? ♫

1177
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:06,050
♫ You're going to like that ♫

1178
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,360
Impressive. They were in the same team.

1179
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:09,550
They're rivals now.

1180
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,430
These top one candidates

1181
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:16,320
got the most votes from
the Planet Guardians all over the world.

1182
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:21,000
One of them will take 1st place
and the other, 2nd place.

1183
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,000
They're the best.

1184
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:25,200
-Both of them must be happy.
-I know.

1185
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,140
-Cai Bing.
-Yes.

1186
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,180
Do you think your cell
can become the top cell?

1187
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,120
Are we confident?

1188
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,740
-Yes.
-Yes, we can be the top cell.

1189
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:39,350
How cool.

1190
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:42,330
They topped the interim evaluation
after all.

1191
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,300
Okay.

1192
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:46,970
Shen Xiao Ting, what do you think?

1193
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:48,770
-Oh, she's so pretty!
-How pretty.

1194
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,160
She's so pretty.

1195
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:54,870
It doesn't matter which rank,
they're both great rankings for us.

1196
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:57,270
Any result is good for us.

1197
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:58,730
She's too pretty, it's unfair.

1198
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,040
I'd be happy with second place too.

1199
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:05,640
Now, let's check who will take the honor

1200
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:08,410
of placing first
in the first global voting.

1201
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,520
Gosh.

1202
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:12,550
It will be revealed on the screen.

1203
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,550
Gosh.

1204
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,020
Oh, my gosh.

1205
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:18,950
I can't stand watching this.

1206
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,160
Even I'm nervous.

1207
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,160
We need popcorn for this.

1208
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:27,540
According to the result, the top cell

1209
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:30,800
-received 2,929,629 votes.
-What?

1210
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,910
-That's crazy.
-How many digits?

1211
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:38,980
The 2nd cell received 2,649,735 points.

1212
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,090
The difference is 279,894 points.

1213
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:43,450
Gosh.

1214
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,950
How did they get so many votes?

1215
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:47,920
It's crazy.

1216
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,520
That's inviolable.

1217
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,900
They're the top cell indeed.

1218
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:52,900
Between the two cells,

1219
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:56,870
who received the biggest number of votes
from the Planet Guardians?

1220
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:59,530
-I can't even guess.
-I have no idea.

1221
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:02,960
♫ Choose between the two, 1st or 2nd ♫

1222
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,250
They must be so nervous.

1223
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:09,070
Please show us.

1224
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,070
Who is it?

1225
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,230
Good job.

1226
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:21,680
Congrats.

1227
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,820
Indeed.

1228
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:25,860
Congrats.

1229
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,230
I'm so proud of them both.

1230
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:30,860
-Hey!
-Congrats.

1231
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,100
Thank you.

1232
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,840
They're the top-ranking survivors.

1233
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:41,550
Let's hear from them.

1234
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,550
Well...

1235
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:46,880
First off, dear Planet Guardians,

1236
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:49,280
thank you so much

1237
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,880
for voting and supporting us.

1238
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:54,050
Congrats!

1239
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:58,520
And my "How You Like That" teammates.

1240
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,790
Where is she? Yeon Gyung.

1241
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,430
I really appreciate your hard work.

1242
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:10,900
I love you.

1243
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:13,740
Me too.

1244
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,250
Thank you so much.

1245
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:26,160
Thank you for letting me seize

1246
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,890
this precious opportunity.

1247
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:30,750
Thank you, master.

1248
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:36,520
Yu Jin, thank you so much

1249
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:38,700
for picking me.

1250
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,700
I love you.

1251
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:42,630
Me too.

1252
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,880
Wen Zhe, happy birthday.

1253
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:48,910
Gosh.

1254
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,240
Let's hear from the second cell too.

1255
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:58,950
I'd like to give thanks

1256
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,930
to the Planet Guardians for letting us

1257
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:04,720
take such a high place.

1258
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:08,200
Thank you so much.

1259
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,290
Ji A.

1260
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:17,380
Make sure you make it
so we can perform together.

1261
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:18,729
I love you.

1262
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,640
All 99 girls make me cry.

1263
01:08:22,109 --> 01:08:24,880
Why am I crying?

1264
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:28,050
The 2nd and 1st cells.

1265
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:29,819
Congratulations once again.

1266
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:33,310
Please move to your seats now.

1267
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:38,990
They're so cool.

1268
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,970
The 1st to 3rd cells are so cool.

1269
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,800
Now, only one cell

1270
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,560
remains to survive.

1271
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,029
I'm most curious about the 17th.

1272
01:08:51,529 --> 01:08:53,910
The last 17th cell had the closest call,

1273
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:58,050
but they get to survive and stay.

1274
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,040
This must be so nerve-wracking.

1275
01:09:00,689 --> 01:09:02,810
So many need to survive.

1276
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,960
I'm not giving up,

1277
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:07,750
but I feel like I should practice

1278
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,220
accepting reality.

1279
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,430
The 17th-place candidates...

1280
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,460
There are two candidates?

1281
01:09:13,529 --> 01:09:15,660
Let's check the candidates on the screen.

1282
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:18,770
Oh, my goodness.

1283
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,460
I should just relax.

1284
01:09:20,729 --> 01:09:21,840
The first candidate.

1285
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:22,840
Gosh.

1286
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,180
Please show us.

1287
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:25,609
-Ye Eun?
-Jeong Min?

1288
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:28,479
Hye Rim? Isn't she popular?

1289
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,569
Xu Ruo Wei.

1290
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,950
Oh, Wen Zhe. Please.

1291
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,880
-Ji A...
-Ji A.

1292
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:39,189
-Zhou Xin Yu.
-Please.

1293
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,350
So many of them.

1294
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,350
Please show us.

1295
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:47,090
Who? Please.

1296
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,560
My heart is about to drop.

1297
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:55,030
Gosh, Ji A.

1298
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,340
Ji A.

1299
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:59,130
Don't cry.

1300
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,650
I hope Ji A makes it.

1301
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,640
-Ji A was so good.
-Right.

1302
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,250
The 1st candidate for the 17th cell

1303
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,360
is Ji A, Xin Yu, Moka's cell.

1304
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,090
Let's check the second candidate
on the screen.

1305
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:16,120
This is so scary.

1306
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,300
Hye Rim got the benefit

1307
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,770
through the "YES or YES" performance.

1308
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:25,500
♫ Choose one already, yes or yes ♫

1309
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:27,110
Team 1 of "YES or YES".

1310
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,230
Congratulations.

1311
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:31,980
I think it's plausible.

1312
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,450
Sun Woo's cell also got the benefit.

1313
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:39,170
♫ Just remember this ♫

1314
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:43,190
But their interim ranking was too low.

1315
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:45,690
I have no idea.

1316
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:47,350
Please show us

1317
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:49,090
the second candidate.

1318
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:02,400
Wen Zhe's face!

1319
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,780
The 2nd candidate for the 17th cell

1320
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,120
is Se In, Wen Zhe, and Momoko's cell.

1321
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,180
Please come up the stage.

1322
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,410
This is totally unexpected.

1323
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,250
This is crazy.

1324
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:18,910
-It's either one of them.
-Please.

1325
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:20,930
It's neck and neck.

1326
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,090
It's so hard.

1327
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,820
The last cell to survive and stay.

1328
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:27,890
They are the candidates for the 17th cell.

1329
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:31,570
One of these cells will become

1330
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,800
the 17th cell and continue
to pursue their dreams.

1331
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:37,440
Oh, my.

1332
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:40,030
The other will become the 18th cell

1333
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,050
and sadly be eliminated.

1334
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,880
Oh, it's so cruel.

1335
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:47,120
The two cells must be desperately hoping

1336
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:50,120
for their cell to survive.

1337
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:52,020
Wen Zhe,

1338
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,280
do you think your cell will survive?

1339
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:55,730
I...

1340
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:58,450
I want to survive.

1341
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:06,460
The one last cell to be called.

1342
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:10,470
The 17th cell will be revealed
on the screen.

1343
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,180
Gosh.

1344
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:15,880
Oh, my gosh.

1345
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:21,910
The surviving 17th cell
and the eliminated 18th cell

1346
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:26,390
were distinguished by 69,234 votes.

1347
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,660
What, 69,000?

1348
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:29,390
That's quite a difference.

1349
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:32,620
Yoon Ji A, Zhou Xin Yu, and Shima Moka
threatened the team

1350
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,620
[that had the biggest number
of TOP9 candidates]

1351
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:37,840
with their powerful performance
during the Connect Mission.

1352
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,130
Let it be Ji A, please.

1353
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:40,560
Ji A...

1354
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,560
Kim Se In, Wen Zhe, and Okazaki Momoko

1355
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:46,410
[showed off their skills
as good as the winning team]

1356
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,270
[and made an impressive performance]

1357
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:51,620
during the Connect Mission.
Who will it be between the two?

1358
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:52,840
Let it be Wen Zhe.

1359
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:57,350
One of the 2 candidates
will place 17th and survive.

1360
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,550
The other will place 18th and drop out.

1361
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:01,850
Who do you think will win?

1362
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:03,460
-I have no idea.
-Right?

1363
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,790
The 17th cell.

1364
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:06,200
I can't stand watching it.

1365
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,720
Please.

1366
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:09,390
Please show us.

1367
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:16,860
It's so nerve-racking.

1368
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:33,850
I'm sorry.

1369
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,350
I'm sorry.

1370
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,160
That's too bad.

1371
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,770
Congratulations! The 17th cell is

1372
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:45,800
Yoon Ji A, Zhou Xin Yu, and Shima Moka.

1373
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:51,600
Without "How You Like That" Team 2...

1374
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:55,480
Our leader Seung Eun guided all of us.

1375
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,580
And the expressive Tzu Ling did so well.

1376
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:03,120
So we were able to make it this far.

1377
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,010
I want us to continue together. I'm sorry.

1378
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,890
Planet Guardians, thank you so much.

1379
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:18,640
The 18th cell is eliminated by one rank.

1380
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:22,610
The Planet Guardians that got us to 18th,

1381
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:27,300
thank you so much.

1382
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:33,270
I'm sorry for making sad birthday
for Wen Zhe.

1383
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,590
I'm sorry.

1384
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:43,120
It's okay.

1385
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:47,200
I'm sorry.

1386
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:01,980
[It's always sad.]

1387
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:08,710
Due to the votes from Planet Guardians,
51 girls survived

1388
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:12,020
and 48 were eliminated.

1389
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:16,250
I'll now announce the stars of Planet Pass

1390
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:20,620
the 48 are desperately hoping for.

1391
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,820
Who received another chance

1392
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:26,770
by the masters' mutual consent?

1393
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,860
[Who will survive?]

1394
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:31,480
Out of the three contestants
who'll survive,

1395
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:33,200
the first survivor is

1396
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,840
from J Group.

1397
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,550
This person has

1398
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,620
performed a song by OH MY GIRL.

1399
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:45,020
-OH MY GIRL?
-Fuko?

1400
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:50,090
♫ I am now sure ♫

1401
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,620
-Oh, Ruan.
-Ruan was in "Pretty U" Team.

1402
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,490
She sang OH MY GIRL's song
during Planet Demo Stage.

1403
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,270
♫ My heart skipped a beat ♫

1404
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:01,210
The first survivor who is given
a second chance.

1405
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:06,110
Who will survive

1406
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:07,470
with the Planet Pass?

1407
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,740
-Ruan?
-Ruan.

1408
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,970
[Fuko. Hayashi Fuko.]

1409
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:12,310
It's J Group's

1410
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,810
Ikema Ruan.

1411
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,430
Good job.

1412
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,770
Good job.

1413
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:30,570
-I'm sorry.
-Why are you sorry? You did well.

1414
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,060
-I'm sorry.
-No. You did well.

1415
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:35,130
Good job.

1416
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:39,530
When I saw Ikema Ruan,

1417
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,800
I thought someone like her
should be a celebrity.

1418
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:47,150
She put in a lot of effort from the side
for the benefit of her team.

1419
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:48,780
It was touching.

1420
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,550
Continuing on, I'll announce
the next Planet Pass winner.

1421
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:57,230
I will announce the name.

1422
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:58,950
-She's from C Group.
-Xu Ruo Wei?

1423
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,060
-Let it be Wen Zhe.
-Wen Zhe.

1424
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,190
Let it be Wen Zhe please.

1425
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,460
The Planet Pass survivor from C Group.

1426
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,670
[-Please.
-Please.]

1427
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,010
During Connect Mission...

1428
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:12,300
Did she receive a benefit?

1429
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,780
She was not able to receive the benefit.

1430
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:15,640
That's Wen Zhe.

1431
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:17,320
Do you want to go home?

1432
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:19,680
I don't want to go home.

1433
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:20,750
[Team 1.]

1434
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,410
I think it's Wen Zhe.

1435
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,520
Xu Ruo Wei?

1436
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:29,050
Xu Ruo Wei didn't receive it either.

1437
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,930
Lin Chen Han did well too.

1438
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,120
[The winner is "Pretty U" Team.]

1439
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:38,660
Please.

1440
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:42,130
I'll announce the next contestant

1441
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:44,700
who'll continue with the Planet Pass.

1442
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:46,980
The second person to get the Planet Pass.

1443
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:50,810
The person who will remain
on Girls Planet.

1444
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:53,380
I wonder who that is.

1445
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:54,780
I'll reveal it now.

1446
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,740
My goodness.

1447
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:56,950
I have no idea.

1448
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,780
-I'm so nervous.
-Xu Ruo Wei.

1449
01:17:58,850 --> 01:17:59,810
From C Group.

1450
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,460
The person who will remain
on Girls Planet.

1451
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:16,200
I wonder who that is.

1452
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:17,430
I'll reveal it now.

1453
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,500
-My goodness.
-I have no idea.

1454
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,270
I'm so nervous.

1455
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:22,380
From C Group.

1456
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:28,250
It's Wen Zhe.

1457
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,290
It's Wen Zhe.

1458
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:37,330
My goodness.

1459
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,200
It must be her birthday gift.

1460
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:44,300
Happy birthday.

1461
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:47,630
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

1462
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,030
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

1463
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:54,450
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

1464
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:57,650
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

1465
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,380
I can see how genuine she is in her eyes.

1466
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:07,880
She is so sincere.

1467
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,360
I can't imagine how much she practiced.

1468
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:14,820
She improved so much very quickly.
That's why I chose her.

1469
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,700
Happy birthday.

1470
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,910
Now the last Planet Pass survivor

1471
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:25,410
of Girls Planet 999.

1472
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:26,680
I will announce the name.

1473
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:28,300
Who among K Group?

1474
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:29,840
[Seung Eun.]

1475
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:31,210
[Hye Rim.]

1476
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,550
There are too many of them.

1477
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,380
So many of them should be saved.

1478
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:38,690
I have no idea.

1479
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,380
The last recipient of the Planet Pass

1480
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:44,200
performed "Wow Thing"

1481
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,900
in Planet Demo Stage.

1482
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,900
♫ Just like my beating heart ♫

1483
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,800
♫ Boom, boom, boom ♫

1484
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:54,770
♫ The whole world follows me ♫

1485
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,940
Must be Hye Rim.

1486
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:59,380
Sun Woo or Da Yeon.

1487
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:01,340
Both Hye Rim and Sun Woo...

1488
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:02,850
There are three people.

1489
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:05,820
Sun Woo, Da Yeon, and Hye Rim.

1490
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:07,950
Three of them.

1491
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:11,190
In the Connect Mission...

1492
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:13,120
They both were main vocalists.

1493
01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:14,550
-The main vocalist.
-The main vocalist.

1494
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:18,230
She aced the mission as a main vocalist

1495
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,250
[and impressed the masters.]

1496
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,000
♫ I don't know what you'll choose,
so I got you two choices ♫

1497
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,270
They both were great main vocalists.

1498
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:28,860
It's Hye Rim. Don't say it's me.

1499
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,410
Can't they just spare them both?

1500
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:34,200
The last recipient of Planet Pass.

1501
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:36,340
I'll reveal

1502
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,580
the third survivor.

1503
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,770
So nervous.

1504
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,980
Please save them both.

1505
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:44,590
The last survivor.

1506
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,350
This is scary.

1507
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,990
I'll reveal it now!

1508
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:54,660
From K Group.

1509
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,300
It's Kim Hye Rim!

1510
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:04,740
Congratulations.

1511
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:10,910
Hye Rim.

1512
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:14,850
You must look pretty.

1513
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:16,610
Stop crying.

1514
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,590
[We chose Hye Rim.]

1515
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:22,860
She showed great leadership.

1516
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,250
She's like a legit main vocalist already.

1517
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:29,230
Her "YES or YES" team could win mostly

1518
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:32,700
because of Hye Rim.

1519
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:42,100
The masters have given you another chance.

1520
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:43,240
How are you feeling?

1521
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,980
First of all, thanks for giving me

1522
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:48,810
the last chance.

1523
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:51,760
Thank you very much.

1524
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:59,260
I'll hold onto this last chance

1525
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,460
and do my best.

1526
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:04,760
What a great birthday present.

1527
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,470
My cell...

1528
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,800
We all tried so hard.

1529
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:18,450
Sorry I can't be with you.

1530
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:23,980
I'll try to show you my best.

1531
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:25,110
Thank you.

1532
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:32,950
Please go to your seats.

1533
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:42,100
We now have 54 survivors

1534
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:45,440
who will keep on dreaming.

1535
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:51,380
But this isn't over yet.

1536
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:55,150
Apart from the cell voting earlier,

1537
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,950
the Planet Guardians voted for the girls

1538
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:01,080
[they're rooting for three per group.]

1539
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:05,360
Nine girls with the most votes
from Planet Guardians

1540
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:08,030
will become Planet TOP9.

1541
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:11,370
Who will it be?

1542
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,600
-How happy would they be?
-I know.

1543
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,100
I'd be super happy.

1544
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,200
I'd be very flattered if I could make it.

1545
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,840
Totally.

1546
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:21,200
From the Planet TOP9 chosen
by the masters,

1547
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:24,610
let's see how much change there has been.

1548
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:29,410
Number one chosen by the masters,
Ezaki Hikaru.

1549
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:32,690
Do you think you'll be in TOP9
by global votes too?

1550
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:35,380
I did all I could.

1551
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:38,830
I hope the Planet Guardians noticed it

1552
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:42,420
and selected me.

1553
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:47,590
Out of 54 survivors,

1554
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:50,060
I'll reveal the Planet TOP9
that symbolizes

1555
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:53,410
the debut group of Girls Planet 999!

1556
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:55,740
Drum rolls.

1557
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,720
I really have no clue.

1558
01:23:57,770 --> 01:24:00,280
I'll announce number nine

1559
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:03,210
of Planet TOP9 first.

1560
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:09,880
Number nine has shown growth

1561
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,530
in every performance

1562
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,390
and her pretty voice has captured

1563
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:20,390
the masters and many Planet Guardians.

1564
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:21,540
Voice?

1565
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:22,610
Who is it?

1566
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:27,180
In the Connect Mission, she appealed

1567
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,700
with the song "YES or YES".

1568
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:31,980
♫ Hey, boy, look ♫

1569
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:34,720
♫ I'm going to make this simple for you ♫

1570
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:38,260
♫ Choose between the two, yes or yes ♫

1571
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:41,450
♫ Choose one already, yes or yes ♫

1572
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,330
As a result,

1573
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,420
her team

1574
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:48,370
won.

1575
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:49,870
Chae Hyun or Ji Won.

1576
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,940
-Chae Hyun for number nine?
-Who is it?

1577
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:55,940
Number nine chosen by the global votes!

1578
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:58,270
-Oh, my.
-Who is it?

1579
01:24:58,730 --> 01:24:59,800
I have no clue.

1580
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:00,830
Number nine goes to...

1581
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:02,770
-Chae Hyun?
-Chae Hyun?

1582
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:07,140
From K Group.

1583
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:12,360
It's Kim Chae Hyun!

1584
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:15,720
Chae Hyun.

1585
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:19,320
So cool.

1586
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,620
Congratulations.

1587
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,230
Kim Chae Hyun is

1588
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:27,270
in the first Planet TOP9.

1589
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:30,300
Thanks to all Planet Guardians

1590
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,730
around the world

1591
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,480
who voted for me.

1592
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:36,980
I'll keep trying my best.

1593
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:38,150
Thank you.

1594
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:42,120
-So cool.
-So cool.

1595
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,650
You're so cool.

1596
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:45,480
I'm so happy for her.

1597
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:47,780
That's so cool.

1598
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:50,230
That suits you.

1599
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,330
She got the first necklace.

1600
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,450
-It shines.
-She's finally sitting there.

1601
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,270
Doesn't it look crushy?

1602
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:56,590
So cushy.

1603
01:25:56,770 --> 01:26:00,040
Now number eight out of Planet TOP9.

1604
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,760
Number eight now.

1605
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:07,910
Number eight ranked

1606
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:11,240
sixth in Japan,

1607
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:13,120
eighth in China,

1608
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:16,050
and ninth in Korea.

1609
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,550
From which group, do you think?

1610
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:21,550
I have no clue.

1611
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:25,360
She was in TOP9 chosen by the masters.

1612
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:26,590
It's so hard to guess.

1613
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,300
Someone from C or J Group?

1614
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,320
-Cai Bing.
-Or maybe Ji Yoon.

1615
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,340
-What about Ye Seo?
-Maybe.

1616
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,600
-Maybe Ye Seo is higher up.
-Yes.

1617
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,270
The benefits from the Connect Mission

1618
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,030
were given to her.

1619
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,340
Cai Bing.

1620
01:26:41,650 --> 01:26:43,300
Ye Seo. It's Ye Seo.

1621
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:45,770
Ye Seo or Cai Bing.

1622
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:49,340
Number eight chosen by the global votes.

1623
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:50,450
Number eight is...

1624
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,550
[I'm curious.]

1625
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:54,660
It's Kang Ye Seo!

1626
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,880
It's Kang Ye Seo!

1627
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:03,900
Number eight of TOP9 is Kang Ye Seo.

1628
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,040
Congratulations.

1629
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:06,930
Congratulations.

1630
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,230
Thank you for voting for me.

1631
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:12,970
And my cell members.

1632
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,340
Mashiro and Xing Qiao, you did great.

1633
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:21,140
I'll keep working hard and grow.

1634
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:22,520
Thank you.

1635
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:25,020
Congratulations, Ye Seo.

1636
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,930
It's Mommy.

1637
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,160
So cool, Ye Seo.

1638
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:33,660
She must be happy.

1639
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:38,200
Now revealing

1640
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,630
number seven of Planet TOP9.

1641
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,300
Maybe someone from another group?

1642
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:49,800
According to the global votes,

1643
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:53,170
she got many votes from Spain, France,

1644
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:54,980
and England.

1645
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:55,950
Bahiyyih?

1646
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:57,310
-Hikaru?
-Hikaru?

1647
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,380
Cai Bing.

1648
01:27:58,660 --> 01:27:59,520
What?

1649
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:01,960
Is she popular in Spain?

1650
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:04,530
All foreigners like her.

1651
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,890
In the cell ranking I just announced,

1652
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,430
her cell was in top three.

1653
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:11,100
They're all so popular. I have no clue.

1654
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:13,840
For the Connect Mission,

1655
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:17,270
she performed "How You Like That"
by BLACKPINK.

1656
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:20,000
♫ How you like that? ♫

1657
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,250
♫ How you like that? ♫

1658
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:26,610
♫ Now look at you, now look at me ♫

1659
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,450
♫ How you like that? ♫

1660
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:29,890
Yurina?

1661
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,180
Cai Bing?

1662
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:32,380
-Cai Bing?
-Cai Bing.

1663
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:35,280
-Xiao Ting.
-Xiao Ting.

1664
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:36,450
I don't know.

1665
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:40,300
Number seven was decided
by the global votes.

1666
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:43,060
From C group...

1667
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,120
From C group?

1668
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:45,940
Who is it?

1669
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:51,770
-Don't put your hopes up.
-Don't put your hopes up.

1670
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:54,770
Cai Bing!

1671
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:58,810
Cai Bing.

1672
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,290
Congratulations on being number seven.

1673
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:03,750
How do you feel?

1674
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:05,790
I'm delighted and happy.

1675
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:09,360
As you've put me up so high,

1676
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:13,820
I'll try my best to deserve
all the votes you've given me.

1677
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:14,990
Thank you.

1678
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:19,200
Respect.

1679
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:22,540
[She has this aura...]

1680
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:27,880
It's time for J group.

1681
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:29,300
It's time indeed.

1682
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:30,980
It's number six now.

1683
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:33,880
Now number six out of Planet TOP9.

1684
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:41,220
I used to be number six.

1685
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,590
According to the individual votes,

1686
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:45,660
she was ranked second in Japan,

1687
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:47,850
third in China,

1688
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:51,470
and eighth in Korea.

1689
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:53,030
So high.

1690
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:54,910
-Yurina or Hikaru?
-Hikaru?

1691
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:55,940
Hikaru or Yurina.

1692
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:57,410
Someone from J Group.

1693
01:29:57,530 --> 01:30:00,430
She ranked second in Japan,
so she must be from J Group.

1694
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:05,750
She's also in TOP9 selected
by the masters.

1695
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:08,290
-That's Hikaru.
-It's Hikaru.

1696
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:09,290
Hikaru?

1697
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:10,710
Please.

1698
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:13,020
In the Connect Mission,

1699
01:30:13,090 --> 01:30:15,030
she performed

1700
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:17,680
a boy group song, not a girl group.

1701
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:20,750
♫ The dark streets ♫

1702
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:23,800
♫ Countless desperate dreams ♫

1703
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,840
♫ So they can see us ♫

1704
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:28,200
I think it's Rui Qi.

1705
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:30,340
I think it may be Hikaru.

1706
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:31,540
Maybe Ji Yoon.

1707
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,580
It could be any of them.

1708
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:34,840
The girl who made it to Planet TOP9.

1709
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:36,340
Hikaru or Su Rui Qi.

1710
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:37,880
Su Rui Qi.

1711
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,620
Hikaru.

1712
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:41,410
It's 100 percent Hikaru.

1713
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,740
Number six of Planet TOP9 is...

1714
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:50,020
Come on, Hikaru!

1715
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:53,230
Su Rui Qi from C Group!

1716
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,420
Su Rui Qi from C Group!

1717
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,370
Su Rui Qi from C Group!

1718
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,770
Is it really me?

1719
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:02,710
That's amazing.

1720
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:03,960
-Rui Qi is popular in Japan!
-Yes.

1721
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,170
Rui Qi is popular in Japan.

1722
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,740
Let's hear from her.

1723
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,640
It's like a dream.

1724
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:16,050
I didn't think I'd make it to TOP9.

1725
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:19,820
First, thank you, Planet Guardians.

1726
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:22,660
I'm very satisfied.

1727
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:24,050
Thank you.

1728
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:29,660
It feels like a dream.

1729
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,160
Congratulations.

1730
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:42,480
Only five seats remain for TOP9.

1731
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:44,450
Still no sign of J Group.

1732
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:45,880
There will be one soon.

1733
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:48,520
Let's see who will sit

1734
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:51,150
on those five remaining seats.

1735
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:53,520
Someone from J Group, please.

1736
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:56,090
Now number five of TOP9.

1737
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,620
This participant

1738
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,090
ranked

1739
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,670
first in Japan.

1740
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:09,160
First?

1741
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:10,130
Isn't that Hikaru?

1742
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:11,060
That's amazing.

1743
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:12,680
I think it's Yurina.

1744
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:14,900
And she was the leader

1745
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,640
in the Connect Mission.

1746
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,910
What?

1747
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:18,980
Bo Ra?

1748
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:20,180
Xu Zi Yin?

1749
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,140
Fu Ya Ning or Shen Xiao Ting.

1750
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:23,450
Who is it? I have no clue.

1751
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,980
I have absolutely no idea.

1752
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:27,750
Number five decided by the global votes.

1753
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,180
From J Group.

1754
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,520
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

1755
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:33,760
Who?

1756
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:36,800
Sakamoto Mashiro!

1757
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:42,530
Congrats, Sakamoto Mashiro.

1758
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:43,700
Thank you.

1759
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:46,010
Please say a few words.

1760
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:51,740
I didn't think I'd make it to TOP9.

1761
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:53,220
I wasn't that prepared.

1762
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:56,690
Yet many people voted for me,

1763
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,190
so I'm happy.

1764
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:01,620
I'll perform as well as the rank requires.

1765
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:03,290
This is just the beginning for me.

1766
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:06,050
Please keep your eyes on me. Thank you.

1767
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:18,570
All number twos are doing so well,

1768
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,910
but what am I doing?

1769
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:22,500
When will I get to TOP9?

1770
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,680
There are only four left, right?

1771
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:25,550
Right.

1772
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:27,910
Xiao Ting and you...

1773
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:29,020
No.

1774
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:31,520
What if I don't make it?

1775
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:33,050
-What should I do?
-Then...

1776
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,590
Only four seats remain.

1777
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:37,090
-Bahiyyih...
-I don't know.

1778
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:41,050
The first survival announcement
of Girls Planet 999.

1779
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:47,770
Now, among Planet TOP9,
we only have numbers 4, 3, 2,

1780
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:49,940
and one left.

1781
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,380
My gosh.

1782
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,300
So nervous.

1783
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:58,770
Who will take the glory of
becoming number one?

1784
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:03,810
We'll meet the four candidates
on the screen.

1785
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,820
Is this how it works?

1786
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,720
Right away?

1787
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:10,530
Now we get to know.

1788
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:12,150
Xiao Ting.

1789
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,820
-Hikaru.
-Hikaru.

1790
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:15,160
Yu Jin?

1791
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:17,930
Bahiyyih. Huening Bahiyyih.

1792
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:19,340
Right.

1793
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:20,360
It's obvious.

1794
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:22,230
She's so popular.

1795
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,300
Bahiyyih.

1796
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,700
Bahiyyih.

1797
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,270
I'm so nervous.

1798
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,180
I'm so nervous.

1799
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:30,950
-I can't stand this.
-You'll make it for sure.

1800
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:32,620
-Shen Xiao Ting.
-I don't know.

1801
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:34,520
It's too high.

1802
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:35,650
First place.

1803
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:36,910
-No.
-You have to place first.

1804
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:38,120
I can't.

1805
01:34:38,190 --> 01:34:41,310
These four are ranked first to fourth
of Planet TOP9.

1806
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:42,690
Who will they be?

1807
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,090
Will be revealed now!

1808
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,260
-Two, three.
-Two, three.

1809
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,800
-What?
-What?

1810
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:51,870
Amazing.

1811
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:54,970
What?

1812
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,770
You're there, too!

1813
01:34:58,670 --> 01:34:59,580
What?

1814
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:01,440
Yurina.

1815
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,500
We made it.

1816
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,280
That's awesome.

1817
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:07,320
It's Yurina.

1818
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:08,950
Amazing.

1819
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,520
What?

1820
01:35:10,590 --> 01:35:12,520
-What about Bahiyyih?
-She's not there.

1821
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:14,120
Bahiyyih is not there.

1822
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:15,420
Bahiyyih is not there?

1823
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,180
I thought she would be one of them.

1824
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:19,430
No way!

1825
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:22,460
Choi Yu Jin from K Group.

1826
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:25,540
Shen Xiao Ting from C Group.

1827
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:27,770
Ezaki Hikaru from J Group.

1828
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,730
Kawaguchi Yurina from J Group.

1829
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:34,130
These are the four candidates.

1830
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:36,170
I think Yu Jin will rank number one.

1831
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,200
Right.

1832
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:39,050
Yu Jin would be in first place.

1833
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:41,220
Third and fourth places
would be from J Group.

1834
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:44,240
First place is Yu Jin.
And the rest are all possible now.

1835
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:47,950
First, I'll announce fourth place of TOP9.

1836
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:49,690
It would be from J Group.

1837
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:54,260
Ranked second in Singapore,
Vietnam, and the Philippines.

1838
01:35:54,330 --> 01:35:56,870
Ranked third in the USA and the UK.

1839
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:00,730
And ranked fourth in Korea.

1840
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,630
-Globally popular.
-Globally.

1841
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:05,110
Is it Hikaru?

1842
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:06,080
Yurina?

1843
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,710
I think it's Yurina.

1844
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,800
Yurina?

1845
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:09,800
Hikaru.

1846
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:11,070
So nervous.

1847
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:13,470
-In the Connect Mission,
-The Connect Mission.

1848
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:17,320
she performed
"How You Like That" by BLACKPINK.

1849
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:19,390
It's one of those three.

1850
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:20,520
It's one of you.

1851
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:22,160
I'm okay.

1852
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,660
Does that mean I'm higher?

1853
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:26,620
No way.

1854
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,090
Got to stay in first place.

1855
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:31,120
Let's go for first place.

1856
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:33,230
It's Yurina.

1857
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,230
-Yurina?
-Yurina.

1858
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:37,370
I think it's Yurina.

1859
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,480
I can't breathe.

1860
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:41,530
Fourth place of Planet TOP9 goes to...

1861
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,740
Who is it?

1862
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,300
"It is Kawaguchi Yurina."

1863
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:46,580
She must be so nervous.

1864
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:50,150
Congratulations to Choi Yu Jin of K Group.

1865
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:52,410
Yu Jin?

1866
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,050
Choi Yu Jin.

1867
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:55,830
What?

1868
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,780
Yu Jin?

1869
01:36:58,090 --> 01:36:59,230
Choi Yu Jin.

1870
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:01,500
-What?
-What?

1871
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:05,430
-Yu Jin?
-Fourth place?

1872
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,670
What? Congratulate her!

1873
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:09,660
Congrats.

1874
01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:12,780
Yu Jin.

1875
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:14,300
Congratulations.

1876
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:17,410
Thank you.

1877
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,610
Not first place?

1878
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,340
-I thought she would be in first place.
-Me too.

1879
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:21,210
I can't believe it.

1880
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:22,450
Wait a minute.

1881
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,020
Then who is in first place?

1882
01:37:24,090 --> 01:37:25,180
Please give us your speech.

1883
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:26,090
Oh, my gosh.

1884
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:28,590
In the cell voting,

1885
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:31,180
I was ranked in the middle.

1886
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:33,090
So I expected that I'd survive,

1887
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:36,830
but this is totally unexpected.

1888
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:40,530
I'm grateful just to be
one of the candidates.

1889
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:44,530
I'll make sure to perform better
and live up to this rank.

1890
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,010
Thank you.

1891
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:57,050
I thought she'd place first too.

1892
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:59,410
Me too.

1893
01:37:59,590 --> 01:38:01,930
Maybe it's Shen Xiao Ting.

1894
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:03,350
Could Yurina end up placing first?

1895
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:04,830
If Yurina places first,

1896
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,050
it'll be shocking.

1897
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:07,290
This is amusing.

1898
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:10,820
Let's continue with the announcement.

1899
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:13,340
Third place of TOP9.

1900
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:15,940
I hope she keeps her first place.

1901
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:17,230
I know.

1902
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,640
-Could it be you?
-Yes, first place.

1903
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:23,550
-It might be you.
-Let's not get our hopes up.

1904
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:25,110
As the result of the first global voting,

1905
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:27,320
the US, the UK, France, and Mexico

1906
01:38:27,410 --> 01:38:30,950
gave this contestant

1907
01:38:31,610 --> 01:38:32,720
second place.

1908
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:36,660
And she placed first in Columbia.

1909
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:38,830
That's crazy.

1910
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,420
She's a worldwide star.

1911
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,020
She's global.

1912
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:43,800
That's all over the world.

1913
01:38:43,870 --> 01:38:45,560
-Awesome.
-It really is all over the world.

1914
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:46,630
Moreover,

1915
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:51,530
she has been evaluated
with BLACKPINK's song

1916
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:53,100
on this show.

1917
01:38:53,170 --> 01:38:54,200
It's Yurina.

1918
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,340
♫ It serves me right ♫

1919
01:38:56,410 --> 01:38:58,410
♫ Now, one, two, three ♫

1920
01:38:58,580 --> 01:39:00,610
♫ How you like that? ♫

1921
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,980
Yurina?

1922
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:06,420
It'll be amazing if you come first.

1923
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:08,980
It's all of them.

1924
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:10,430
Yes, it's all of us.

1925
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,530
Oh, wait. "BOOMBAHYAH."

1926
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:17,300
♫ Even if someone dares to stop me,
I'm gonna go brrr, RAMBO ♫

1927
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:18,430
It's all of them.

1928
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,230
-Oh, right.
-It's them all.

1929
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:21,540
It's all three of them.

1930
01:39:21,590 --> 01:39:23,570
Come on, it's all of them.

1931
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:25,480
-You're right.
-Let me announce it.

1932
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:28,270
Who is it?

1933
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:29,980
I don't know.

1934
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:31,500
This is so fun.

1935
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:32,950
It's unpredictable.

1936
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:35,080
Third place of Planet TOP9.

1937
01:39:36,090 --> 01:39:37,550
It goes to...

1938
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:39,780
Who is it?

1939
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,660
Who is it?

1940
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,830
From J Group.

1941
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:49,200
Yurina? Hikaru? I'm confused.

1942
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:51,620
-Hikaru?
-Yurina?

1943
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:53,090
Yurina.

1944
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:54,770
It's Yurina.

1945
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:56,370
Yurina?

1946
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:58,370
Hikaru might place first.

1947
01:39:58,530 --> 01:39:59,630
I'm curious.

1948
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:04,800
-Ezaki Hikaru!
-My gosh.

1949
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:07,780
-Ezaki Hikaru!
-My gosh.

1950
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:10,880
Ezaki Hikaru!

1951
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:13,290
Yurina...

1952
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:19,120
Yurina.

1953
01:40:20,230 --> 01:40:21,450
This is crazy.

1954
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:24,020
They're ranked 1st and 2nd. That's crazy.

1955
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:27,930
The 1st and 2nd ranks are
in the same cell.

1956
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
This is unbelievable.

1957
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:32,910
That cell is too strong.

1958
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:38,510
What is this?

1959
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:40,150
Congratulations, Hikaru.

1960
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:41,720
Thank you.

1961
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:44,240
Any remark for the fans?

1962
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:47,720
When my face showed up on the screen,

1963
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:49,780
I felt like I was dreaming.

1964
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:53,830
It's so hard to believe that

1965
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,990
I'm in this high, third rank.

1966
01:40:56,060 --> 01:40:58,660
Planet Guardians
from all around the world,

1967
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:01,830
thank you so much for letting me

1968
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:04,130
take on this dream-like place.

1969
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:08,130
From now on, I'll do whatever it takes

1970
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:10,540
to make my dream come true.
Please look forward.

1971
01:41:10,610 --> 01:41:13,450
Thank you, and I love you.

1972
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,050
So cute!

1973
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:19,660
We love you!

1974
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:24,020
-She's cute.
-How cute.

1975
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:30,230
Thank you!

1976
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:38,100
What is happening?

1977
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:41,480
Yurina is unbelievable.

1978
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:43,950
I can't wait to see who's ranked first.

1979
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:46,910
We only have 1st and 2nd places

1980
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:49,480
left to be announced.

1981
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:53,350
It's unbelievable
that they are in the same cell.

1982
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:54,660
It's a twist.

1983
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:56,450
One after another...

1984
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:57,660
Who shall have

1985
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:02,330
the honor of placing first?

1986
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,260
How can they be in the same cell?

1987
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:06,460
Who do you think it will be?

1988
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:08,290
Shen Xiao Ting.

1989
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:11,630
Shen Xiao Ting, the TOP9 candidate,

1990
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,300
ranked first in C Group

1991
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:15,280
in the global voting.

1992
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:17,250
Kawaguchi Yurina

1993
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:19,520
ranked first in J Group.

1994
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:23,210
Thumbs up!

1995
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:27,520
These two are in the same cell.

1996
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:30,160
Since they are
both the first-place candidates,

1997
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:31,730
let's hear from them.

1998
01:42:31,790 --> 01:42:33,120
This is so unreal.

1999
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:35,830
I never thought

2000
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,730
I'd make it this high.

2001
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:41,370
I don't think it's important
who ranks first

2002
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,370
because we'll be together either way.

2003
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:45,770
Thank you.

2004
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:53,620
I never thought I'd be in TOP9.

2005
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:56,450
It's like a miracle

2006
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:59,160
that I made it

2007
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:01,810
with my cell-mate, Xiao Ting,

2008
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:04,180
so I'll be happy regardless of the result.

2009
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,030
Thank you.

2010
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:11,430
Who will be

2011
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:14,230
the first contestant to take

2012
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:17,160
first place of Planet TOP9

2013
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:19,880
with Planet Guardians' votes?

2014
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:23,380
Shen Xiao Ting ranked first

2015
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,480
in C Group
in the global voting. Will it be her?

2016
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:30,450
That surprised me.

2017
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:31,950
My gosh.

2018
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:37,920
Or will it be Kawaguchi Yurina
who ranked first in J Group?

2019
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:41,760
The final score
of the first-place contestant

2020
01:43:42,330 --> 01:43:46,130
is 4,446,387.

2021
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,060
I'm so proud.

2022
01:43:49,230 --> 01:43:50,340
This is crazy.

2023
01:43:50,730 --> 01:43:54,880
The first-place contestant
chosen by the Planet Guardians.

2024
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:56,580
I'll announce the name.

2025
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:05,320
Who is ranked 1st of Planet TOP9?

2026
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:13,960
The contestant with glory

2027
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:19,540
will be revealed now.

2028
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:25,840
Coming soon shortly after commercials.

2029
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:33,480
The honorable TOP9's 1st place
chosen by the Planet Guardians!

2030
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,980
I'll announce the name now.

2031
01:44:37,410 --> 01:44:38,690
They must be so nervous.

2032
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:40,590
I'm so curious.

2033
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:42,260
I can't make any predictions.

2034
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:44,090
Xiao Ting?

2035
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:46,120
Yurina?

2036
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:47,760
I really have no idea.

2037
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:51,330
[Yurina and I are]

2038
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,090
[the only ones left,]

2039
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:55,800
[so my place is either 1st or 2nd.]

2040
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:58,730
[But I'm hopeful.]

2041
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,030
[Maybe I'm in first place.]

2042
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:05,750
[It was totally unexpected,]

2043
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:07,640
[so it feels surreal.]

2044
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:11,690
[I feel like I'm dreaming.]

2045
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:14,020
Planet TOP9's 1st place.

2046
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:28,340
It's J Group's Kawaguchi Yurina!

2047
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:30,070
Congratulations.

2048
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:33,380
-Kawaguchi Yurina! Congratulations.
-My gosh!

2049
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:36,550
Good job.

2050
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,720
Kawaguchi Yurina!

2051
01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:47,850
-My gosh.
-Congratulations.

2052
01:45:50,730 --> 01:45:53,420
-This is crazy.
-Unbelievable.

2053
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:54,520
Awesome.

2054
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:59,230
The rankings are crazy this time.

2055
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:00,800
I feel like I'm dreaming.

2056
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:04,240
Good job.

2057
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:05,330
This is crazy.

2058
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,280
Out of 164 countries

2059
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:12,880
that participated in the global voting,

2060
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:16,950
Kawaguchi Yurina placed 1st
in 83 countries.

2061
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:22,210
That is more than half of the countries.

2062
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,800
She is really amazing.

2063
01:46:27,860 --> 01:46:29,860
-I got goosebumps.
-That's crazy.

2064
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:36,940
First of all, thank you to
Planet Guardians

2065
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:40,510
who voted for me.

2066
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:49,780
I'm honored by this result

2067
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:53,220
because I'm still unskilled in many ways.

2068
01:46:53,410 --> 01:46:57,730
I'll work harder from now on

2069
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:00,200
so that the Planet Guardians who voted me

2070
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:04,670
will acknowledge that Kawaguchi Yurina

2071
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:10,040
really does deserve to be in first place

2072
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:12,780
in the TOP9 in the first round of votes.

2073
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,900
I'll do my best so please cheer me on.

2074
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,000
Thank you.

2075
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:22,640
Shen Xiao Ting was placed second

2076
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:26,050
in the TOP9. Please tell us
how you feel as well.

2077
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:28,410
Planet Guardians,

2078
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:33,260
I'm so thankful that you voted for me

2079
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:34,800
and for liking me.

2080
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:40,490
All the experiences

2081
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,510
and the feelings I'm getting
on this show are new to me.

2082
01:47:45,470 --> 01:47:50,050
People started recognizing me

2083
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:54,020
and acknowledging me for the first time.

2084
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,590
I was able to work my way to the center.

2085
01:47:56,650 --> 01:47:59,550
People have high expectations of me now.

2086
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:02,080
I'll keep on driving myself

2087
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:04,530
so that I don't disappoint you.

2088
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:07,660
My goal isn't to be in the TOP9 now,
but to be in the final TOP9.

2089
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:08,790
Thank you.

2090
01:48:12,370 --> 01:48:16,300
Please go to the 1st and 2nd place seats.

2091
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,200
Good job.

2092
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:56,840
The first

2093
01:48:56,910 --> 01:49:00,010
survival announcement is over.

2094
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:03,850
Global Planet Guardians voted and decided

2095
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:06,680
the first Planet TOP9. Congratulations!

2096
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,030
However, that was only the first mission.

2097
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:18,430
Until final debut members are decided,

2098
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:21,160
today's Planet TOP9

2099
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:24,770
cannot be at ease either.

2100
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:29,610
The TOP9 can always change according

2101
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:31,250
to the votes

2102
01:49:33,550 --> 01:49:35,270
cast by Planet Guardians!

2103
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:38,280
[Let's try to maintain the TOP9 position.]

2104
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,160
[I want to remain in my place.]

2105
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:44,380
[I feel like my place isn't secure
as the 9th place in the TOP9.]

2106
01:49:44,850 --> 01:49:47,200
The surviving 54 will begin

2107
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:48,950
a new mission

2108
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:51,400
to debut as a K-pop idol group.

2109
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:55,840
The Planet Guardians' global voting

2110
01:49:57,970 --> 01:50:00,810
will also begin anew.

2111
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:06,040
[I'll have to go up the ranks because
I may be eliminated at this rate.]

2112
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:08,640
[I want to remain here.]

2113
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:11,380
[I want to go up a lot.]

2114
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:14,480
For the girl you support

2115
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:16,980
to continue dreaming of
being a K-pop idol,

2116
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:20,620
please send in your precious votes.

2117
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:23,200
Whose dream

2118
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,200
will you protect?

2119
01:50:33,170 --> 01:50:36,200
[Here are the results of the first
global voting at Girls Planet 999.]

2120
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:39,880
[These are the rankings of each survivor
and the Planet TOP9.]

2121
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:16,090
[Planet Guardians around the world.]

2122
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:20,520
[The second global voting begins now.]

2123
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:24,230
[To protect their dreams
as Planet Guardians,]

2124
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:26,430
[you can vote once a day]

2125
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,890
[on the official app.]

2126
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:31,070
[The second voting is for
individuals votes,]

2127
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:33,870
[and not cell votes.]

2128
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:36,660
[Ten of the lowest ranking members]

2129
01:51:36,730 --> 01:51:38,940
[from each group, which makes
30 in total, will be eliminated.]

2130
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,880
[First, access the voting screen]

2131
01:51:42,950 --> 01:51:46,650
[and select three girls
from Groups K, C, J,]

2132
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:49,880
[selecting nine girls
you support in total.]

2133
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:52,220
[Press the final submission button]

2134
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:54,220
[to complete your vote.]

2135
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:57,090
[The results reflect 50 percent
from Korean votes]

2136
01:51:57,690 --> 01:52:00,990
[and 50 percent from global votes
outside of Korea.]

2137
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:03,000
[The number of votes]

2138
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:05,070
[will become points.]

2139
01:52:06,290 --> 01:52:07,630
[Planet Guardians!]

2140
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:11,800
[Whose dreams will you protect?]

2141
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:34,620
Oh, I want to be

2142
01:52:35,950 --> 01:52:36,920
in the TOP9.

2143
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:38,770
-You can!
-No.

2144
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:42,160
You worked hard,

2145
01:52:42,230 --> 01:52:43,700
so you'll make it.

2146
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:45,770
I know it.

2147
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:48,580
It was fun.

2148
01:52:49,010 --> 01:52:50,880
You can do it.

2149
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:53,150
I know it.

2150
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:57,590
[We all worked hard,]

2151
01:52:57,650 --> 01:53:00,460
[so I felt really bad.]

2152
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:05,080
I'll do my best to make you proud.

2153
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:07,390
I love you.

2154
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:11,490
-We were always here together.
-I know.

2155
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:14,770
Every single day.

2156
01:53:16,340 --> 01:53:21,110
-We were the best cell ever.
-Yes.

2157
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:22,730
-Totally.
-The best.

2158
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:24,800
We were!

2159
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:26,270
Totally.

2160
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:28,480
I'm okay.

2161
01:53:29,550 --> 01:53:32,520
-Good job!
-Good job!

2162
01:53:32,590 --> 01:53:33,910
We were awesome.

2163
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,730
Don't go.

2164
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:46,340
You're the only one left.

2165
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:49,440
You can do it. Make us proud.

2166
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:52,010
[Even though I was eliminated...]

2167
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:56,510
[I was so happy to meet great people.]

2168
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:00,920
[I got to know myself
better on this show.]

2169
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:04,040
[Girls Planet]

2170
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:06,990
[helped me grow.]

2171
01:54:11,690 --> 01:54:13,600
[Girl's Planet's second mission]

2172
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:15,650
will be revealed now.

2173
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:21,090
It is a combination mission.

2174
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:23,410
In this mission, current cells

2175
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:25,640
will be disbanded.

2176
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:28,680
[We're in trouble.]

2177
01:54:28,730 --> 01:54:29,980
[I don't want to get eliminated.]

2178
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:32,840
[I was determined to get the benefit.]

2179
01:54:36,550 --> 01:54:37,650
You should do better.

2180
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:40,190
You're in first place,
so you need to do better.

2181
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:41,690
Why did you choose to do it?

2182
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,730
I think you'll blow up the stage.

2183
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:47,230
Slowly.

2184
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:51,020
Take slow breaths.
You'll otherwise hyperventilate.

2185
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:54,470
Breathe slowly. That's it.
