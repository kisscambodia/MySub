189
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,400
[So, Dou Dou's boyfriend]

190
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,250
[is him.]

191
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,560
No, wait.

192
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,560
What did Ai Jing Chu do to Dou Dou?

193
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,170
He's been dating Dou Dou

194
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,730
and flirting with other women.

195
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,690
Is this Ai Jing Chu so handsome?

196
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,640
When we were in university,

197
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,130
a lot of girls, when they see him,

198
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,050
they'd go crazy over him.

199
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,690
But I don't feel anything when I see him.

200
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,730
So, who do you have feelings for?

201
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,200
Mother, you're here.

202
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,370
Why?

203
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,760
It sounds

204
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,370
as if you don't welcome me here.

205
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,440
That's not true.

206
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,810
I'm beyond happy.

207
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,250
Mother, why are you dressed this way?

208
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,880
What do you think?

209
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:37,930
Isn't it good enough

210
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,170
for "Stage 33 Boom"?

211
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:45,760
Great.

212
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,520
It's my favorite pork knuckle soup.

213
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,130
Since

214
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,370
it's your favorite pork knuckle soup.

215
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,290
I'd like to ask,

216
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,730
why didn't you touch

217
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,050
pork knuckle soup from last week?

218
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,610
I was too busy last week.

219
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,290
As you know,

220
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,130
I'm an enterpreneur.

221
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,370
I'm sorry.

222
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,850
All these collagen.

223
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,050
Look, it's all wasted now.

224
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't you think it's such a waste?

225
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,810
If you don't take nourishment,

226
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,440
your cheeks are going
to lose its plumpness.

227
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,050
It's going to be even harder
for you to find a boyfriend.

228
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,170
Got it.

229
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,400
I promise

230
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,560
I'll drink the pork knuckle soup you make

231
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,640
and become as beautiful as a flower.

232
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,810
Anyway,

233
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,400
you aren't that young anymore,

234
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,290
yet you've never been in a relationship.

235
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,880
I suspect when Yue Lao

236
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,080
unites predestined couples
with a silken cord,

237
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,520
he missed out your name.

238
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,640
It's very likely.

239
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,400
So, you should stop

240
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,290
introducing men to me.

241
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,640
It's all in vain anyway.

242
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,400
It's exactly because of your

243
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,170
indifferent attitude,

244
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,049
that you can't find a partner.

245
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,559
This year, you're 20...

246
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:36,610
26 years old.

247
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:38,730
Do you have any

248
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,640
crisis awareness at all?

249
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,080
In two years' time,

250
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,250
how are you going to

251
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,920
compete with those females
in their early 20s?

252
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,250
Mother,

253
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,640
you're too inconfident

254
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,610
towards your own daughter.

255
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,520
Look at you.

Second marriage at the age of 41,

257
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,490
and third marriage at the age of 45.

258
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,640
Look at me.

259
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,450
What's all this?

260
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,640
There's no rush.

261
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,210
If you had a clear target in mind like me,

262
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,640
and knows what you want,

263
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,520
I won't have to worry about you.

264
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,130
Mother, why are you
looking at me that way?

265
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,450
You're no longer a youth,

266
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,760
but you're quite pretty still.

267
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,640
Why couldn't you get a boyfriend?

268
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,130
You have the figure

269
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,760
and looks.

270
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,640
What could be the problem?

271
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,000
I know.

272
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,920
Your teeth aren't aligned.

273
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,400
It affects your overall appearance.

274
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,520
Especially when you smile.

275
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,280
You aren't

276
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,850
bringing me to
an orthodontist, right?

277
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,970
My daughter knows me best.

278
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,450
Come on, hurry.

279
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm not going.

280
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,880
I'm too old to wear braces.

281
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,680
I'm not going.

282
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,000
It's because you're not young anymore,

283
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,090
that's why it can't be delayed.

284
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,400
Solve the issue when you realize it.

285
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,160
Maybe when your teeth become aligned,

286
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,760
you'll find a boyfriend.

287
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,250
I don't want to.

288
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,520
Let's go.

289
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:33,920
No, no.

Since you aren't suitable for each other,

295
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,400
you should stop contacting him.

297
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,130

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,850
[How ruthless.]

303

[Is he even a man?]

304
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,610
[It's good that she broke up with him,]

305
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,760

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,250
Do you know them?

308
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:19,880
No.

309
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,570
Why are you hiding if you don't know them?

310
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,610
Come on.

311
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,450
Dou Dou's already gone home.

312
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,160
Thank you for helping me, Dr. Ai.

313
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,680
I don't want to interfere
with your personal issues,

314
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,490
but you and Dou Dou

315
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,370

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,800
not asked me for help relentlessly,

318
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,490
I wouldn't meet her in your place.

319
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,000
You ought to clear things up with her.

320
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,400
OK.

321
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,610
I'll talk to her later.

322
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:44,850

I'll make sure to do it.

Your molars,

326
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,280
4 teeth in total,

327
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,250
have to be extracted.

328
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,000
My teeth need to be
extracted to wear braces?

329
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,130
I'm not doing it anymore. I...

330
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,760
Your dentition is crowded.

331

In between teeth,

332
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,250
there's not much space to start with.

333
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,490
If you want to align your teeth,

334
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,040
you have to make space for it.

336
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,040
This needs to be exracted,

337
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,920
OK?

338
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,570
Listen to the doctor.

339
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,160
OK.

340
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,280
So, can we do the tooth extraction today?

342
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,570
No, it's not possible.

345
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,250
Sure.

going back to Henggang today?

No, today I have to

351
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,920
I can't keep you company today.

355
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,090
It's a major surgery.

How can I let you come alone?

357
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm worried.

358
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,040
It's just tooth extraction.

360

[Wu Ying: What do you think about this?]

375
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,250
What about this type?

376
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,640
It's too ugly.

377
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,400
No way.

378
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,450
Do you think my teeth need to be aligned?

379
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,210
I'm on Aunt's side this time.

380
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,250
I didn't think it's an issue,

381
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,920
but after Aunt pointed it out,

382
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,210
all of a sudden, I also
find it problematic.

383
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,160
Especially when you smile,

384
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,000
it becomes even more obvious.

385
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,370
Oh, right.

386
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,920
I visited the dental center today

387
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,370
and ran into Dou Dou and Ai Jing Chu.

[Zeng Li: I met Dou Dou and Ai Jing Chu. They seemed to have broken up.]

389
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,570
[That Ai Jing Chu]

390
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,920
[seemed to have broken up with Dou Dou.]

391
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,450
Sorry, Granny.

392
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,800
My legs hurt.

393
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,490
You bumped into me.

394
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,730
Granny, your legs hurt?

395
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,000
You bumped into me.

396
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:03,920
How can my legs not hurt?

397
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,920
I didn't bump into you.

398
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,970
I'll help you to call an ambulance.

399
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,160
I'll help you get a doctor.

400
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,880
You bumped into me.

401
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,970
Where are you going?

402
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,800
Are you going to run away?

403
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,370
I'm not...

404
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:11,880
You bumped into me,

405
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,250
and now you refuse to admit it?

406
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,800
I didn't bump into you.

407
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,640
What are you talking about?

408
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,610
If you didn't bump into me,

409
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,730
why are my legs hurting?

410
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:20,800
Granny,

411
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,160
it's year 2020.

412
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,450
Aren't scams a little outdated?

413
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,760
So, next, are you going to tell me

414
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,330
to give you money

415
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,130
so you could go to the hospital?

416
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,610
That's right.

417
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,610
You just have to give me some money.

418
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,760
RMB300 or RMB500,

419
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,250
the more, the better.

420
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:34,850
I...

421
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,520
I'm just a worker.

422
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,090
I have no money either.

423
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:37,800
I just want money.

424
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,850
You can't leave.

425
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,400
Stop pulling.

426
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,280
My pants are falling off.

427
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,210
You just have to give me money.

428
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,490
You just have to give me money.

429
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,450
My legs hurt.

430
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:43,850
All right.

431
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,730
What about this?

432
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,730
Hospital, or police station.

433
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,730
Choose one.

434
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,330
Why did this have to happen to me?

435
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,610
Granny, did you make a mistake?

436
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,680
Didn't your legs hurt just now?

437
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,760
Why is your heart aching now?

438
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,400
Fine.

439
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,370
I'll give you, OK?

440
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,610
Granny, stop pretending.

441
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,400
The flloor is cold.

442
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,680
Get up, all right?

443
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,210
Granny!

444
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,610
Granny!

445
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,450
Granny!

446
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,570
Mother, look at that granny.

447
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,610
She seems to be feeling unwell.

448
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,520
Granny!

449
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,330
Granny, what happened to you?

450
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,090
Wake up!

451
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,400
Help, anyone!

452
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,330
Someone fainted!

453
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:15,880
Help.

454
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,040
Someone fainted.

455
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,640
CPR,

456
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,490
how do you do it?

457
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,280
Zeng Li,

458
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:21,970
calm down.

459
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,250
Zeng Li, you can do it.

460
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,760
Granny, don't scare me. Granny!

461
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:28,610
Granny!

462
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,800
Someone help me.

463
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,490
Did you call the ambulance?

464
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,400
Yes.

465
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,640
It's him again.

466
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,610
Carotid artery fluctuations, none.

467
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,210
Granny!

468
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,640
-Ma'am.
-Granny.

469
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,450
How do you feel?

470
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,800
She's having a hypertension episode

471
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,570
which causes sudden
cardiopulmonary arrest.

472
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,370
I just fed her a nifedipine.

473
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,760
Are you her family member?

474
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,160
I happened to pass by.

475
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,730
I'm a dentist at the dental center

476
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,760
of Donghu University-affiliated hospital.

477
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,450
I think I'll go with you

478
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,330
in case something happens.

479
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,490
Sure.

480
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,490
Thank you.

481
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,570
Good work.

482
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,000
You handled it quite well.

483
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,610
But I suggest you to learn

484
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,730
CPR technique.

485
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,570
[So long-winded.]

486
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,160
[Forget it.]

487
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,210
[Since he saved someone's life,]

488
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:49,920
[I'll let him off.]

489
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
[Wait, what is he doing?]

490
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:54,880
[Is it an insect?]

491
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,730
[That scared me. So it wasn't an insect.]

492
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:04,760
Granny.

493
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,280
She bumped into me.

494
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,880
I did not. She's lying.

495
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,569
It was her.

496
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,089
She was arguing with
the old lady just now.

497
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:10,450
No.

498
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,369
She was trying to scam me.

499
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:12,849
I didn't.

500
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,640
[It's a scam.]

501
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,089
[You could tell, right?]

502
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,880
No, I...

503
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,160
[Why aren't you saying anything?]

504
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,570
[Are you dumb?]

505
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,240
[Is Mercury in retrograde today?]

506
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
[Mother made me wear braces
and I even got scammed.]

507
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:37,680
[Don't tell me, later,]

508
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,010
[he expects me to pay the hospital bill?]

509
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,480
[No. 178, He Xiao Xuan,]

510
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
[please go to Emergency Room No. 2.]

511
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,640
What's this?

512
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,770
She fell onto the ground because of you.

513
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,480
You even argued with her.

514
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,880
This is the least you can do.

515
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,090
How many times did I tell you?

516
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,610
I didn't bump into her.

517
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,850
She was trying to scam me. She...

518
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,610
It's already come to this.

519
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,880
Do you have any conscience?

520
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,400
What do you mean I don't have conscience?

521
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,570
You're talking about my
conscience? You jerk...

522
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,160
What did you say?

523
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,610
Stop arguing.

524
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,370
It's a mess as it is.

525
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,330
Yin, how is she?

526
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,290
She's fine now.

527
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:12,400
Dr. Ai,

528
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,480
luckily the CPR

529
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,330
was performed in time.

530
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,050
She's asleep now.

531
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,480
She just has to stay another
24 hours for observation

532
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,880
and get some IV injection
before she is discharged.

533
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,680
Did you contact her family?

534
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,770
Yes,

535
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
but her family members
didn't say they'll come.

536
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,370
Unfilial offsprings.

537
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,810
When the old lady has come to,

538
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,090
you should apologize to her.

539
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:33,960
I...

540
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,400
Zeng Li!

541
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:45,640
Zeng Li!

542
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,200
It really is a misunderstanding.

543
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,400
That old lady

544
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,770
is a regular at emergency department.

545
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,290
She always says someone bumped into her,

546
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,200
but once she did check-up,

547
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,050
the result turns out fine.

548
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
And yet she asks them to pay her

549
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,920
psychological injury compensation.

550
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,200
Otherwise, she won't let them leave.

551
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,480
Some people think it's troublesome,

552
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,370
so they'll give her the money.

553
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,640
But somehow,

554
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,570
she had a hypertension episode today.

555
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,680
Probably it's her family members

556
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
who mistreated her.

557
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,880
She's quite pitiful.

558
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,010
Give me a copy of the invoice.

559
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,770
I'll sort out the payment.

560
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,160
OK.

I'm sorry.

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:27,920
Don't cry.

750
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,090
It'll be over before you know it.

751
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:32,680
Very soon.

752
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,480
[Seems like he]

753
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,720
[has quite a nice voice.]

754
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,090
Come on, open your mouth.

755
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,720
[Why is the world so small?]

756
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,400
[What is this,
endless encounters with him?]

757
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,200
[Zeng Li,]

758
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,680
[why are you tied to this man?]

759
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,290
[How unlucky.]

760
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:15,880
Dr. Ai.

761
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,160
It'll hurt a little.

762
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,050
Just endure for a while.

763
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,720
[Feels like my teeth are going numb.]

764
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,720
[I can't feel a thing.]

765
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,050
How does it feel? Does it still hurt?

766
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,160
Should be fine now.

767
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:57,480
Dr. Ai,

768
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,810
they want to come in to learn.

769
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,090
Come in.

770
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,960
[What's this?]

771
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,160
[Watching a panda at the zoo?]

772
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,050
The plan given by Director Wang

773
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,160
is upper and lower molars,

774
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,640
four teeth in total to be removed.

775
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,640
[I forgot I was going to
have four teeth extracted.]

776
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,200
But I think we only need to

777
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,400
remove the two above,

778
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,720
because her lower dentition

779
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,960
isn't too cramped.

780
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:20,850
So, we're keeping those for now.

781
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,400
We'll decide again

782
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,530
after a consultation with Director Wang.

783
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,090
Usually, extraction of such

784
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,090
bigger-sized teeth

785
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,050
which are attached to the gums,

786
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,640
we need to make a small cut in the gum

787
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,480
and remove it,

788
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,330
followed by stitches.

789
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,330
[Cut open the gums?]

790
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,370
However,

791
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,850
though her teeth are bigger in size,

792
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,570
there isn't

793
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,610
pathological connection.

794
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,720
So, it isn't necessary in this case.

795
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,960
[Ai Jing Chu,]

796
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,050
[don't stop your sentences midway.]

797
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,440
Let's begin.

798
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:47,960
Open your mouth.

799
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,610
[It's happening. He's going to remove it.]

800
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,640
[Did he get the wrong tooth?]

801
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,680
[Is this the right tooth?]

802
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,400
[My tooth,]

803
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,090
[it's... It's moving. It's moving!]

804
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:00,960
All done.

805
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:03,400
[It's done?]

806
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,330
[Why didn't I feel anything?]

807
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,770
I'll leave the rest to you.

808
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,010
Thank you, Dr. Ai.

809
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:10,920
Good work.

810
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:12,920
Good work, Dr. Ai.

811
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:13,920
Good work.

812
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,610
Good work, Dr. Ai.

813
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,570
We'll get going.

814
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:16,640
[They're gone?]

815
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,010
Doctor,

816
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,480
how is my daughter?

817
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,440
Just now, I heard her

818
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,570
wailing pitifully.

819
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,640
She was resistant to anesthetics,

820
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,400
but she's fine now.

821
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,530
You can go in and check on her.

822
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,530
Bite on the cotton swab for an hour.

823
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,440
When the anesthetics effect is gone,

824
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,480
refrain from eating food for awhile.

825
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,880
It's done?

826
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,640
You look like a catfish now.

827
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,330
If it wasn't you

828
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,330
who insisted that I wear braces,

829
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,480
I won't have to go through this suffering.

830
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,370
Just now, when Dr. Ai

831
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,290
was extracting your teeth,

832
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,530
did it feel like

833
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,850
it's done before you realized?

834
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,010
So, it seems this Dr. Ai

835
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,330
is quite a skilled doctor.

836
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,160
What is the use of that?

837
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:01,920
He has a bad character.

838
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,720
Don't talk nonsense.

839
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,480
I'll go and pay the fee first.

840
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,050
Let me show you the way.

841
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:06,960
OK.

842
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,290
Dr. Ai.

843
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,090
This should be

844
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:20,960
our first meeting, right?

845
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,810
Why would you say I have a bad character?

846
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,960
Our first meeting?

847
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,050
Yesterday, because of you,

848
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,130
I spent so much money.

849
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:32,720
I remember now.

850
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:33,720
You're that person

851
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,400
who bumped into
the old lady, right?

852
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,240
Wait, can't you recognize people?

853
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,610
You misunderstood me yesterday

854
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,090
and even... You even made me...

855
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,370
Lie down.

856
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,440
Lie down.

857
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,810
Open your mouth.

858
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:00,960
It hurts.

859
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,720
I haven't even touched you.

860
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,880
I'll remember you this time.

861
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,290
[You'll remember me? Is this blackmail?]

862
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,810
What did you give me?

863
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,010
You even made markings on me?

864
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,200
You overthink. It's an
orthodontic separator

865
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,010
to move the teeth apart slowly.

866
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,050
This way,

867
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,330
it'll make wearing
braces easier in future.

868
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,500
[Outpatient medical records, Zeng Li]

869
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,330
Thanks for taking over my patient.

870
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:34,680
Zeng Li.

871
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,290
That's quite an interesting name.

872
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,160
So, I'm going to transfer

873
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,050
this koi for good luck to you.

874
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,290
You'll have good luck the entire year.

875
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,330
You're now

876
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,160
a resident doctor.

877
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,130
You can't just back away
before difficulties.

878
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,370
I made a mistake during tooth extraction.

879
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,880
Besides, orthodontics

880
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,330
isn't my strength,

881
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,290
and the cycle is so long.

882
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,480
I'm also worried the patient distrusts me.

883
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,010
The more I look,
the more you resemble one.

884
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,530
You're still laughing.
I'm in such pain here.

885
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,330
Zeng Li.

886
00:32:59,480 --> 00:32:59,850
Zeng Li,

887
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
I have good news for you.

888
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,810
Your situation is unique,
being resistant to anesthetics.

889
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,640
Dr. Ai decided

890
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,720
to personally take over your treatment.

891
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,770
I'm the nurse

892
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,880
in charge to work with Dr. Ai.

893
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,530
My name is Zhou Wen. You can contact
me anytime if something happens.

894
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,960
Can I turn it down?

895
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,240
I think she trusts you

896
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,200
more than me.
