[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,320
Stop touching it.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,600
My mouth is numbed and I
think my voice has changed, too.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,980
I can't even speak properly.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,200
It's not too serious.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,150
It won't stay like this, right?

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,880
Of course not. The braces

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,120
will make your teeth look good.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,520
I'll make you some
porridge when we get home.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,720
Aren't you returning to Henggang?

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,200
What's the hurry?

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,640
I'll stay until you put on your braces.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,640
I've already had my two teeth extracted.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,000
So don't worry about me.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,320
Just go home.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,200
I'm heading back to the cafe.

17
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,760
My part-time worker is on leave today.

18
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,200
So the shop is short of staff.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,560
That little cafe of yours
isn't making money.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,000
Why don't you just close it down?

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,840
Mother, you always tend to

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,000
talk about money.

23
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,960
That's my dream,

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,560
okay?

25
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,040
I see.

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,790
You're a university graduate.

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,239
And all you want is to be
a librarian or cafe owner.

28
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,340
Just look at your classmates.

29
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,220
They're either bankers or
working at Fortune 500 companies.

30
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,240
And you?

31
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,440
I have a secure job.

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,200
What?

33
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,960
The young won't care about that.

34
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:20,940
You're the odd one out.

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,640
You have no ambition and are
still unattached until now.

36
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,360
Can't you just give me a break?

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,640
Just go home.

38
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,640
I really have to go now, see you.

39
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,360
-I'm in a rush.
-You haven't eaten yet.

40
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,340
Just go home.

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,600
Don't skip your meal.

42
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,380
[Sweet Teeth]
[Episode 2]

43
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,240
-Hello.
[-Zeng Li.]

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,229
[Where are you?]

45
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,440
I'm at my shop.

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
[Thank god, I need
a favour from you.]

47
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,680
-What's wrong?
[-I woke up late.]

48
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,080
[I'm late for my lecture.]

49
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,880
[Can you help me mark my attendance?]

50
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,780
But we don't look alike.

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
[No worries.]

52
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
[Professor Wang doesn't recognise me.]

53
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,280
You'll be in trouble

54
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,680
if I'm exposed.

55
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,800
[No one can help me except you.]

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,370
[Please.]

57
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,630
[I'll really be in trouble]

58
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,080
[if I'm absent again.]

59
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,360
It's been a long time since I graduated.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,010
Excuse me, you need
to focus on the lecture.

61
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,100
Okay.

62
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,280
Work hard.

63
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,550
And keep it up.

64
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,079
[The students now have changed.]

65
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,840
[No one is reading a magazine.]

66
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,840
What?

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's him?

68
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,400
[Why it's Au Jing Chu?]

69
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,110
[I'm in trouble.]

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,120
Silence.

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,320
Professor Wang is admitted to
the hospital due to heart disease.

72
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,180
I'll replace him for now
until your final term exam.

73
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,680
[Don't tell me Professor Wang
is actually Mr. Wang.]

74
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
We're going to have a roll call.

75
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,480
-Wang Rui Kai.
-Here.

76
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,160
-Zhang De Quan.
-What's wrong with you?

77
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,800
This is Mr. Ai's lecture, okay?

78
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,440
-Chen Rui Xin.
-I bet you've never attended his lecture.

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,510
How I wish I could attend his lectures.

80
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,680
And I really hate this.

81
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,880
You're so lucky.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,920
His lecture is really tough.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,440
Last term, half of the students

84
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,040
failed the prosthodontics exam.

85
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,360
-That's scary.
-Indeed.

86
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,480
-Keep your voice down, okay?
-Just look at her.

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,960
She was reading a magazine earlier.

88
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,800
Now she doesn't even dare utter a word.

89
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,750
[-I'm finished.]
-Lei Xin Lin.

90
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,480
[-Ai Jing Chu knows Dou Dou.]
-Here.

91
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,560
[What should I do?]

92
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,520
-Hao Ru.
-Here.

93
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,120
Dou Dou.

94
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,160
Dou Dou.

95
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,880
Help me.

96
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,040
Here!

97
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,440
Please stand on your feet.

98
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,600
Remove your hood.

99
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,080
Don't you know the rules?

100
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,760
Do it now.

101
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,160
And your cap.

102
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,000
I think I've come to the wrong place.

103
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,320
I'm so sorry.

104
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,400
Just carry on.

105
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,760
Dou Dou.

106
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,560
[-What did he just call me?]
-You can't seem to speak properly.

107
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,520
You've just extracted your teeth?

108
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,000
[He's having face blindness again.]

109
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,080
Really?

110
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,850
I'm sure my dentist

111
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,040
-isn't good enough.
-[Really?]

112
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,120
[Say it again.]

113
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,120
Maybe.

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,320
So you should focus in class

115
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,880
and be a good dentist in the future.

116
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,260
[What does he want?]

117
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,000
[He knows I'm not Dou Dou.]

118
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,480
[I know you're not her.]

119
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,440
Return to your seat.

120
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,400
[There's no escape now.]

121
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,040
[You think you can just leave?]

122
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,760
Are you just going to stand here?

123
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's continue the roll call.

124
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,070

[Zhengxin Building]

126
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,500
there will be changes

127
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,600
in the oral cavity.

128
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,880
-When the resonant cavity is damaged,
[-The time]

129
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,080
[seems to last forever.]

130
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,190
the voice will become unclear

131
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,240
and even incomprehensible.

132
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,920
[The effects of maxillofacial defects]

133
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,640
The patient will suffer
tremendously mentally.

134
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,040
[You're making me feel the same.]

135
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,520
Excuse me, I want to go out.

136
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,280
For patients with minor cleft lip,

137
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,400
we'll usually use segmented or secondary,

138
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,080
or even alginate impression.

139
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,440

No one can leave my class now

145
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,120

I'll check on you after class.

-The preparation of the mould
[-How do I take notes]

[-with just a magazine?]
-and choosing the mould.

154
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,640
The upper jaw impression tray should be

155
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,680
about 3 mm wider than
the upper alveolar ridge.

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,240
[-You two are so kind to me.]
-The height of the surrounding edge

of about 2 mm from
the mucosal fold.

You may leave.

170
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,280
You knew I'm not Dou Dou.

Why are you here?

174
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
You should know this.

175
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,480
Isn't it a norm to help others

176
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,880
mark their attendance?

177
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,840
I've never done this when I was a student.

178
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,240
You think you're helping her

179
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,960
but it's the opposite.

180
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,680
It's not as serious as you said, right?

181
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
A bad doctor

182
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,040
is a bane to the patients.

183
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,360
Fine.

184
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,920
It was my fault.

185
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,320

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,520
Are you seeing someone else?

371
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,800
No.

372
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,920
Then why are you hiding from me?

373
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,960
It's just your imagination.

374
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,600
Give me your phone.

375
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,040
Wait.

376
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,840
This isn't nice.

377
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,120
I want my privacy.

378
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,720
The boyfriend of a girl from my cafe

379
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,200
hits the bull's-eye.

380
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,120
There are secrets in a phone.

381
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,280
Fine.

382
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,840
So you've been hanging out with your pals

383
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,560
for over a week?

384
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,400
Why have you been avoiding me?

385
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,640
I just feel exhausted.

386
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,000
I need a break.

387
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,480
But we just get together not too long ago.

388
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,200
Yes.

389
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,200
I think you've changed

390
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,440
since we get together.

391
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,760
-What do you mean?
-You used to be cool towards me.

392
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,600
You merely replied me with an
emoji when I texted you on WeChat.

393
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,340
[Zhang Teng: Had your meal?]

394
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,340
[Zhang Teng: What's up, dear.]

395
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,340
[Zhang Teng: Finished your work?]

396
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,520
Even worse, you could totally ignore me.

397
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,420
[Zhang Teng: Why are
you ignoring me? Busy?]

398
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,120
How I wished to get

399
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,800
a better response from you.

400
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,120
So I was on fire.

401
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,000
Then what?

402
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,760
Then we finally get together.

403
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,320
And you've changed.

404
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,680
Now whenever I text you,

405
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,840
you tend to give me multiple replies.

406
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,100
[Ma Yi Yi: Why are you ignoring me?]

407
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,560
You'll even send me several types of emoji

408
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,460
[Ma Yi Yi: What's up.]

409
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,740
[Ma Yi Yi: How about
having dinner together?]

410
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,680
just to check up on me.

411
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,460
[Ma Yi Yi: Why are you silent?]

412
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,440
And you do it in various fanciful ways.

413
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,600
So you mean

414
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,360
I'm too clingy.

415
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,840
You're tired with me.

416
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,200
You can say that.

417
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,960
Fine.

418
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,360
I'll change.

419
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,040
I'll give you more space.

420
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,800
Are you happy now?

421
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,000
It's actually my problem, Yi Yi.

422
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,800
I shouldn't have

423
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,080
got together so soon.

424
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,170
What do you want then?

425
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,280
I don't understand.

426
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,560
Don't you think it's best

427
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,800
to be ambiguous in a relationship?

428
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,040
In fact, I really
enjoyed the time when I was

429
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,000
smitten with you.

430
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,680
Hello, dear. What are you reading?

431
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,400
-It's a story between two lovers.
-Next order.

432
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,640
It's so romantic.

433
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
She likes your novel.

434
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,160
The male character is simply my dream guy.

435
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,560
How I wish you were half as good as him.

436
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,800
The story isn't true.

437
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,710
They always dream of
falling in love with men.

438
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,750
-You should read this.
-Come on.

439
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,190
Have you done this before?

440
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,950
Enjoy your meal.

441
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,270
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

442
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,910
Let's begin.

443
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,510
How's your drink?

444
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,870
Your debut novel is a success.

445
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,270
You should let your mother know

446
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,990
lest she thinks you're unambitious.

447
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,710
Just forget it. I've wrote it for fun.

448
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,070
I think I'll forever

449
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,830
do nothing more than this.

450
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,070
If she knows about this,

451
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,110
she'll want me

452
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,590
to be a famous writer.

453
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,270
Then I'll have sleepless nights.

454
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,530
-Are you okay?
-It was just a breakup.

455
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,430
It's been hours already.
Get over it, okay?

456
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,990
I'm just stunned.

457
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,550
-What actually happened?
-He said...

458
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,430
It was my fault, not yours!

459
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,470
I just wanted to take a break
from a relationship.

460
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,030
It's not wrong to be clingy.

461
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,590
I just lost my feelings for you.

462
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,350
Don't cry.

463
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,070
Hello...

464
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,430
The girls are a handful.

465
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,430
I could neither be
truthful nor avoid them.

466
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,470
Deng Hao Ran.

467
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,430
Do you also think

468
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,470
that the best part of a relationship

469
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,990
is when you're smitten with someone?

470
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,950
Brilliant.

471
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,350
Whose wise words are those?

472
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,270
I couldnâ€™t think of such words.

473
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,150
I was right about Deng Hao Ran
and Zhang Teng being alike.

474
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,030
-I'll help you teach him a lesson.
-He deserves it.

475
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,110
-Take that!
-I'm your older brother.

476
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,190
Mind your manners.

477
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,990
But my mother has divorced your dad.

478
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,070
Hang on.

479
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,110
What if I treat you to a meal?

480
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,990
My dear brother.

481
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,510
Good girl.

482
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,670
Let's go.

483
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,270
Let's celebrate Ma Yi Yi's
breakup with Zhang Teng.

484
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,670
What do you prefer?

485
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,270
Hot pot or Thai food?

486
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,590
Sorry.

487
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,950
I'm trying to lose weight.

488
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,670
Really?

489
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,550
You have your chance.

490
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,710
I'll go with my buddies then.

491
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,430
-Go for it.
-Excuse me.

492
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,470
I'm trying to lose weight
but not on a diet.

493
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,830
Let's check it out.

494
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,390
Let's try this new vegan restaurant.

495
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,950
It's got two Michelin stars.

496
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,390
I can't wait to go.

497
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,460
Come on.

498
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,990
You all are just good for nothing.

499
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,230
Mr. Deng.

500
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,910
Your mobile app is making a good profit.

501
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,870
How could you not treat us to a meal?

502
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,470
You're so stingy.

503
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,110
Tissue paper.

504
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,150
You're not asking me
to treat you to a meal.

505
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,430
You've been actually
asking me to do so weekly.

506
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,070
Enough said, let's go.

507
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,470
-Let's go!
-Thanks!

508
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,790
Thanks, boss.

509
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,910
Let's go get changed.

510
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,990
-Hurry up!
-Dou Dou!

511
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,350
We're going for a meal.

512
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,510
Just take it from here.

513
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,460
[Convenience Store]

514
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,900
[Hot Pot]

515
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,230
I wonder why the guys we've met are alike.

516
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,810
We have Deng Hao Ran, Zhang Teng

517
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,030
-and...
-And Ai Jing Chu.

518
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,310
Don't cry, you'll be fine.

519
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,470
Can I drink this?

520
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,590
Sure.

521
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,830
But you can't use it as
an ice pack after that.

522
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,150
Zeng Li.

523
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,190
Zeng Li.

524
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,270
What's with you?

525
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,430
I don't think Ai Jing Chu is a bad guy.

526
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,390
He really cares for
his students and patients.

527
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,230
I think he's a responsible person.

528
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,630
Many guys like this are
successful in their career.

529
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,550
How do we make ourselves look good

530
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,190
without money?

531
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,710
Thanks.

532
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,610
You haven't seen him for two days.

533
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,670
You miss him already?

534
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,390
Beware lest you end up
following Dou Dou's footsteps.

535
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,990
You should really explore the
career as a writer, Zeng Li.

536
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,150
Why are some of us
lost in our life?

537
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,310
We tend to meet men

538
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,510
who are either playboys or two-timers.

539
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,950
Are you girls criticising the
men while I was away just now?

540
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,670
Where's my soup?

541
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,510
Why's there nothing left?

542
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,750
I should ask you to leave.

543
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,670
Then I'll go have my meal
at a cheap BBQ restaurant.

544
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,670
We have good intentions. Don't you get it?

545
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,790
A playful and selfish man like you

546
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,710
should opt for vegan food instead of meat.

547
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,830
It'll detox your body.

548
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,870
-I could do a good deed, too.
-Thanks.

549
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,830
You're welcome.

550
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,370
I want you to explain to
me with your experiences.

551
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,400
Why when a woman gets older,
she tends to meet disloyal men?

552
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:01,830
Really?

553
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,910
You tend to meet such men, right?

554
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,430
What are you doing?

555
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,420
I'm so sorry.

556
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,610
I wanted to kick him.

557
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,910
I got the wrong person.

558
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,870
I'm so sorry.

559
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,350
It should be you.

560
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,110
Take that!

561
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,790
Serve you right.

562
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,950
Aren't there many young
interns at your hospital?

563
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,710
Find me and Zeng Li

564
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,870
a good man.

565
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,390
Of course, you should keep one
for yourself if you find any.

566
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,870
You two can have them all.

567
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,110
It's a hassle to get into a relationship.

568
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,310
I might as well focus on
my job or write a thesis.

569
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,610
-Don't you think so?
-No.

570
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,550
I agree.

571
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,830
Wu Ying is right.

572
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,990
You either face the reality
and not get into a relationship

573
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,470
or stop complaining and enjoy it.

574
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,550
I'm not in for a ever-lasting love

575
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,710
but just to experience it.

576
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,460
Nice.

577
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,190
I organised a gathering a while ago.

578
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,670
A guy fancied about a girl

579
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,910
and he went all out for her.

580
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,630
However, she rejected him.

581
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,270
He complained to me

582
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,550
that many girls play hard to get nowadays.

583
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,230
So,

584
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,350
we don't always get what we wish.

585
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,750
And we tend to blame
the other person for that.

586
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,550
Oh my.

587
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,910
I think he's got a point.

588
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,390
I feel the same, too.

589
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,390
-But I don't agree.
-So be it.

590
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,130
Now we have three votes against one.

591
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,350
What you said isn't valid.

592
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,350
Let's drink to it.

593
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,230
Fine, as you said so.

594
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,030
-Here.
-Serve you right.

595
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,190
You deserve it.

596
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,220
-Serve you right.
-Bless you.

597
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,550
What has it got to me with me?

598
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,150
Bless you, Deng Hao Ran.

599
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,510
-Deng Hao Ran.
-Hey...

600
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,070
-It's refilled.
-You're crazy, too.

601
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,390
-Let's begin.
-Deng Hao Ran.

602
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,390
He's so funny.

603
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,510
In repentance,

604
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,910
there is salvation.

605
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,950
It's so fun.

606
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,670
-We're cleansing your soul.
-This is Songkran.

607
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,790
It's raining!

608
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,390
Get some more water!

609
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,980
[Outpatient]

610
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,470
Mr. Ai.

611
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,670
Where's Zhou Wen?

612
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,990
She has taken a leave to attend

613
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:07,950
to personal matters.

614
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,470
So you're working alone today?

615
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,350
Yes. What's wrong with that?

616
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,870
Zhou Wen told me that it's
a hassle to install braces.

617
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,120
The glue tends to dry quickly.

618
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,710
It requires two persons to do it.

619
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,470
I can manage by myself.

620
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,230
We'll begin now.

621
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,270
Open your mouth.

622
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,400
You may get the glue on your mouth

623
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,790
if you remain like this.

624
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,190
Try to relax.

625
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,270
I can't see your
teeth if you do this.

626
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,830
How about a song to
make yourself relax?

627
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,470
Any preference?

628
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,830
I like Karen Mok's song.

629
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,750
I don't have it.

630
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,990
How about Jay Chou?

631
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,150
No.

632
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,630
Don't you use NetEase Music?

633
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,950
What's that?

634
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,710
Just forget it.

635
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,350
Any song will do.

636
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:14,430
Sure.

637
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,790
Mr. Ai.

638
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,670
What song is that?

639
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,390
It's the theme song of an anime.

640
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,510
How about this.

641
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,270
I'll tell you the story about this anime

642
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,550
while I install the braces.

643
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,870
Open your mouth.

644
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,910
The story is set in the year 2046.

645
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,350
In order to defend
against malevolent aliens,

646
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,190
the Space Defence Force
is recruiting everywhere.

647
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,790
Mikako, the heroine is enlisted.

648
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,990
A training through the universe begins.

649
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,750
Xiao Sheng, the hero who's
been having a crush on her,

650
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,630
always receives her greetings.

651
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,710
As they get further apart from each other,

652
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,710
it takes a longer time

653
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,910
to send messages.

654
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,430
Sometimes, it even takes up to two years.

655
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,390
Eight years later,

656
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,070
Xiao Sheng, who has
undying love for Mikako,

657
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,110
has finally joined the
Space Defence Force, too.

658
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,310
He suddenly gets the news

659
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,830
that eight years ago,

660
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,750
the fleet she belongs to

661
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,670
is annihilated.

662
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,210
Now Xiao Sheng suddenly
receives a message.

663
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,990
It was sent by Mikako eight years ago.

664
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,590
And she said.

665
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,030
Hello, Xiao Sheng. I know you're 24.

666
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,190

It was fast.

672
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,430
Is the story boring?

673
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,710
No.

674
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:29,070
It's quite a beautiful story.

It's okay.

You think too much.
It's just out of my way.
