that could've gone to someone else.

344
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,950
I think I made one too many mistakes

345
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,510
trying to shine brightly like the stars.

346
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,880
Have you heard?

347
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,330
You have to make up at least seven lies
in order to make one lie work.

348
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,340
Once I started lying,
it just never stopped.

349
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,030
A guy who studied in America.
A guy born from an affluent family.

350
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,190
And my birthday also became December 31st,

351
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,430
to make it seem like
it's a fate for me to win awards.

352
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,010
Did I ever tell you my birthday was faked?

353
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,230
My real birthday is February 27th. 0227.

354
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,010
That's the passcode to the penthouse.

355
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,750
You're right.
I put it there in case I forget.

356
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,400
In case I lose touch with who I really am.

357
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,430
But that's not important.

358
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,950
The truth is, I'm a hillbilly from Alaska

359
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,800
who doesn't know who my dad is.

360
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,750
Are you still looking for him?

361
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,770
All I know about him is

362
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,380
that ring you found for me last time.

363
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,030
Ji-hyang said he'll visit the group
who made that ring.

364
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,940
Then you might find him.

365
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,700
Maybe.

366
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,840
But I'm kind of scared too.

367
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,160
What if I fail to protect him,
just as I failed with Mom and In-hyung?

368
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,050
Don't be afraid.

369
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,420
I'm sure your mother knows
you didn't give up on protecting her.

370
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,360
And In-hyung too.

371
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,460
That's why I now have someone
I truly want to protect.

372
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,080
Are you staring because you don't know?

373
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,690
Anyway, I had a question.
Why do you like me?

374
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,810
I gave that a thought.

375
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,570
When you're here with me,

376
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,900
I don't feel anxious at all.
I'm completely in peace.

377
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,820
I'm kidding.
How can you like someone for a reason?

378
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,590
I just like you.

379
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,280
Goodness, it has been so long.

380
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,310
You must've been in a hurry, Mr. Bae.

381
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,430
You're still the same.

382
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,230
What are you trying to pull?

383
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,320
I'm not pulling anything.
Didn't I say I have an offer?

384
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,520
I know you.

385
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,430
Stop trying to deceive me,
and say what you have to say, kid.

386
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,250
"Kid"?

387
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,070
You kicked me out saying
I'm not one of yours.

388
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,250
What?

389
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,520
Hey, you're the one
who didn't want to stay home.

390
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,280
You're the one who felt belittled and left

391
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,610
when Joon started to get his break.

392
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,370
You need to wake up too.

393
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,050
Don't let that big boy Joon fool you,

394
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,170
making you go around
cleaning up after his mess.

395
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,920
You don't like
how he's still clinging onto his history.

396
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,330
Don't you simply want him
to do as you say and bring in money?

397
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,150
Think about it.

398
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,850
How many people do you think know

399
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,660
about Joon and In-hyung's history
in this industry?

400
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,580
It's just you and me.

401
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,450
So? Are you going to expose that or what?

402
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,230
You thought I was that simple
after years of working in this field?

403
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,340
Hear me out.

404
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,530
What will you and I get
from exposing their relationship?

405
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,980
If it gets out, it'll only drop the value
on Joon and In-hyung's reputation.

406
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,030
Let's merge our agencies.

407
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,940
Once they belong in the same agency,

408
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,620
all the rumors surrounding them
will come to a halt,

409
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,080
and you can keep my mouth shut too.

410
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,800
Man, you crazy kid.
Is this the so-called "offer"?

411
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,520
And do you think Joon's ancient history
could bring damage in any way?

412
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Stop being petty over the love life
he had before his debut

413
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,280
and save yourself from the humiliation.

414
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,880
Make sure you keep In-hyung under control.

415
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,050
Bye.

416
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,340
Mr. Bae, you shouldn't talk like that.

417
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,680
Why do you think
that's the only information I have?

418
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,530
All right, we're here.

419
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,080
-Get a good rest.
-Thanks.

420
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,870
And about this house.

421
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,720
I'm going to move out.

422
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,680
I was in a tight situation at first,
but I got paid by the show too.

423
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,100
-Wait, you can't.
-What?

424
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,430
You can't.
You'll make me anxious. Just stay.

425
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,730
Why would that make you anxious?
I feel more anxious to stay here.

426
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,530
I'll just shop for a place for now.

427
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,740
No, stop getting a weird idea,
and see you tomorrow on set.

428
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,150
You're staying, okay?

429
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,010
I'll think about it.

430
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,080
Drive safely.

431
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,700
No, don't get off.
I'm scared you might run into someone.

432
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,890
Bye.

433
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,270
Get a good rest.

434
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,130
Why did he come back?

435
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,810
You did your laundry.

436
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:01,110
Well, I didn't want you
to take this the wrong way.

437
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,190
I had some circumstances,
so I asked him to let me stay.

438
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,110
Do you remember what I asked of you
when I ran into you at the office?

439
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,370
I asked you to take caution
and make sure you don't cause him damage.

440
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,140
Yes, so

441
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,850
do you think I caused him any damage?

442
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,320
I understand that
a young man could date someone.

443
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,950
But if he's a big celebrity,
that isn't always the case.

444
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,500
Even the most insignificant relationship
could cause him big damage.

445
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,390
Insignificant.

446
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,180
You're being a bit too harsh.

447
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,370
Am I?

448
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,010
If I can be harsher, I'll do that.

449
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,900
Then what did you think it'd be like
to date a top star?

450
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,450
Do you want to see Joon crash down

451
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,600
at once?

452
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,480
Well, Joon is like that.

453
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,940
He can't stand to see someone
who's troubled,

454
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,400
just as he did for In-hyung.

455
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,650
Let me give you a piece of advice.

456
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,170
Why don't you date someone in your league?

457
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,920
I'll give you the benefit of doubt
and consider everything you said

458
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,100
as your concern about Who-joon.

459
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,990
You've known him much longer than I did,
but you trust him way less than I do.

460
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,270
Don't you think we're the ones
who can choose what this relationship is?

461
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,890
Do you think you two have
any choice in this?

462
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,260
Okay, fine.

463
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,490
Let's say Joon chooses you
and gives up on everything.

464
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,860
Do you think you two will be happy?

465
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,160
What about Joon? The public will
turn their back on him at once.

466
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,450
He'll have to deal with that,

467
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,370
and can you deal with him
when he's in that spot?

468
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,820
It seems like you know more about him now,

469
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:12,630
so I'll trust that you will make
the wisest decision and leave.

470
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,790
If I were you, I'd move out
as soon as tomorrow's shooting is over.

471
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,960
Do you know how dangerous it is
for you to live here?

472
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,810
Let me know if you need to find a place.

473
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,750
Goodbye.

474
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,080
My gosh.

475
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,630
Why are you sitting there like that?

476
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,900
What about you?
The studio said you left ages ago.

477
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,760
Don't be so worried. I went for a drive.

478
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,790
What is it?

479
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,389
Is something going on?

480
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,100
Joon, about that ring.

481
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,710
I went to the meeting,
but no one was in touch with him.

482
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,190
After they graduated,
they heard he was getting married.

483
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,739
Then they lost touch with him
once he moved abroad.

484
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,460
Do you think that was my mom?

485
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,000
That could be the case.
So I'm going to ask around a bit more.

486
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,699
I'm sure he had a close friend
among his alumni.

487
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,550
And right.

488
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:54,310
I got an old photo of him from them.

489
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,510
Right.

490
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,520
I was going to move out anyway.

491
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,870
I'll move out right away
as soon as tomorrow's shooting is over.

492
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,900
[Balance: 23,121,544 won]

493
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,860
With my severance pay
and the pay from the show,

494
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,940
I could probably find a studio, right?

495
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,800
[For lease]

496
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,190
[Mr. Joon]

497
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,700
I'll trust that you will make

498
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,040
the wisest decision and leave.

499
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,820
[Mr. Joon]

500
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,920
Okay.

501
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,520
Later.

502
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,120
I'll tell him later.

503
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,580
This is the last time I sit out here.

504
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,860
I won't have to hide anymore,
so it's for the better.

505
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,420
Goodbye, be well.

506
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,810
It's also my first time
feeling at home at an emergency exit.

507
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,870
-Hello.
-You're here.

508
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,980
-Hello.
-Hey.

509
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,390
Baby, is something going on?
You don't look so well.

510
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,110
Nothing's going on.

511
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,590
Look at this.

512
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,870
Let's see.

513
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,500

-Hello.
-Hey.

-My goodness.

Hold out a little longer, Geun-young.

538

What should we do today?
Do you want to do anything?

545
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,770
Well, there's nothing much
we can do at home now.

546
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,540
Should we go on a trip
before it gets colder?

547
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,810
Then let's leave.

548
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,490

-Yes.

00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,260
-This is nice.
-It's nice.

691
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,260
Aren't you glad we came out?

692
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,810
Now that we're facing the end,

693
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,600
could you two please be nice to each other
and try to look like a real couple?

694
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,090
Did we seem that distant?

695
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,260
I'm sure you're closer than before,

696
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,810
but you two aren't
in such a loving relationship.

697
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:05,790
Right?

698
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,740
Then what do we do now?

699
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:13,230
Well, what do couples do
when they're at the beach?

700
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,560
Let's figure something out.

701
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:27,090
Are you saying In-hyung is suing me?

702
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:39,450
Do you have to take things this far
to cut me off?

703
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,480
Were you that sick and tired of me?

704
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,750
This doesn't seem too special.

705
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,170
I guess couples feel happy
just to walk with one another.

706
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,490
I'm sure.

707
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,410
If it doesn't seem too special,

708
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,090
can they do something
and make this special?

709
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,170
I mean, no matter
how awful their relationship is,

710
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,900
if they're here now,
can't they be like a real couple?

711
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:11,750
You know, holding hands,

712
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,920
-then put arms around...
-Excuse me, you two! Can you hold hands?

713
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,910
-They did.
-They did.

714
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,130
It's okay.

715
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,370
I don't think I ever got to enjoy
the little things in life.

716
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,920
As I kept my eyes on you,

717
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:38,150
I realized fame and living a fancy life
isn't always a good thing.

718
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:42,550
I've always been confident that
I never had any regrets in that aspect.

719
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,670
Come to think about it,

720
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,750
I do have some regrets.

721
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,560
Everyone regrets.

722
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,800
Nobody is perfect.

723
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,530
That's why
I'm not going to do that anymore.

724
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,390
Someone told me not to be afraid,

725
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,020
that this too shall pass.

726
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,530
I'm hungry. Aren't you?

727
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,040
I've been hungry for a while.

728
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,360
You are, right?

729
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,700
Mr. Han, did you hear that?

730
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,720
How can you not feed us
while we're working?

731
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,840
Let's eat something.

732
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,430
Yes, I totally got that. Cut!

733
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,100
Cut!

734
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,390
-Let's go.
-Hurry up.

735
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:26,860
Do you have a jacket?

736
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,350
-You can use this.
-I'm fine.

737
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,630
-Put it on.
-No.

738
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,210
You'll catch a cold. Let's go.

739
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,880
-I'm fine, really.
-Keep it on.

740
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:34,560
I'm not a celebrity or anything.

The CEO of Spigen Entertainment is here.

745
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:45,910
Let him in.

746
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,100
Yes, sir.

747
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:53,430
What brings you to my office?

748
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,370
I had to discuss something,

749
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,300
and you wouldn't have come
even if I asked.

750
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:58,710
Please take a seat.

751
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,380
Is it Ms. Oh In-hyung's lawsuit?
What should I do?

752
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,760
Will you settle this?
Or should we continue?

753
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,130
It's obviously a breach of contract,

754
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,780
so is there a way to make her pay
a huge compensation?

755
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:20,090
As I mentioned before,
the contract doesn't state that.

756
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,340
I'm only your legal attorney,

757
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,580
not your troubleshooter.

758
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,070
Have you always been that uptight?

759
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:30,570
Sorry?

760
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,570
Let's put the lawsuit off for now.

761
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,860
It's not like I'm in a hurry.

762
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,320
-Okay.
-Oh, right.

763
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,490
What if someone gets sued for exposing
someone's history without evidence?

764
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,170
What happens in this case?

765
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,790
That happens from time to time
in the entertainment business.

766
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,300
Who's in question?

767
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,910
-You?
-No, not me.

768
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,320
I'll find some precedents.

[CEO Cho Hae-yoon]

770
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,990
What do those Roman numerals mean?

771

Pardon?

772
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,750
Oh, it's nothing.

773
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,570
It's just a personal keepsake.

774
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,160
Oh, I see.

775
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,010
-Here's your fish cake.
-Thank you.

776
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,840
Don't they seem a bit odd today?

777
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,540
I know it's the last time,
but why does she look at him so ardently?

778
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,090
Is it so heartbreaking
to see him order tteokbokki?

779
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,890
Why? Why are you staring at me?

780
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,460
Nothing, you look really pretty

There's a great tteokbokki place
in Dangjin, actually.

00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,750
The tteokbokki there is amazing.
We should go there sometime.

Dangjin? I haven't heard
of a place like that.

791
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,860
If you went there, it'd be famous by now.

792
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,500
What's amazing is this.

793
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,830
The owner lady there has no idea who I am.

794
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,340
No way, how can anyone not know
who you are?

795

I mean it. That's not important to her.

796
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,530
She's only invested in tteokbokki.
She's a master.

797
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,900
It must be a really good place.

798

But something is
definitely weird with them.

who had a photo among his friends,

in "Thank you."

-Nothing weird. Just trust me.
-No way.
