get involved with a woman.

178
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,810
-Don't let him do anything weird. Okay?
-Yes, sir.

179
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,800
Call some reporters
and patch up this mess.

180
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,130
So where's Joon?

181
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,630
Why are you here? Where is he?

182
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,520
Hello?

183
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,180
Yes. Hello.

184
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,770
Where have you been...

185
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,310
Are you okay?

186
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,930
You must've been worried sick.

187
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,510
What do you mean?

188
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,930
Nothing.

189
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,570
You looked as if you were worried.

190
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,180
Are you all right?

191
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,290
Don't ever do this again.

192
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,750
Do what?

193
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,250
Going around doing this alone?

194
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,770
Or leaking your song?

195
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,609
You knew

196
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,859
I was the one who leaked it, right?

197
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,440
It may seem like an excuse,

198
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,859
but once the song got leaked,

199
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:22,290
I hoped people would become
a little interested in who I am.

200
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,230
But in the end,
no one showed me any interest.

201
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,750
Don't take it that way.
You sang the song very well.

202
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,720
I guess it wasn't all that bad
since I got your attention.

203
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,850
I'm sorry.

204
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,510
I'm sorry for you and Geun-young.

205
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,890
I really had no idea
people would take it out on her.

206
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,830
I know.

207
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,440
I told her I was sorry,
then she got angry.

208
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,510
But she still seemed cool.

209
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,880
She had the guts to say what she wants.

210
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,520
I can't do that.

211
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,040
You used to be like that too.

212
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,640
Really?

213
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,230
I don't remember

214
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,530
what I was like before.

215
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:21,120
I guess only you remember
what I was like back then.

216
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,780
I haven't called Jae-joon.

217
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,490
Get well soon.

218
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,640
I got jealous of Geun-young.

219
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,170
She saved your name as "Punk."

220
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,620
But you saved me as "Stranger."

221
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,040
That's depressing.

222
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,830
I sent you that text before.

223
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,480
She took the wrong phone.

224
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,830
Really? Was it really Who-joon?

225
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,560
Definitely. And that anti-fan.

226
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,810
I thought I saw someone
who looks like her,

227
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,700
but I figured she just looks similar.

228
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,740
Then I saw someone
who looked like Who-joon.

229
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,660
It's tough to tell regular people apart,

230
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,640
but celebrities look very charismatic.

231
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,820
Chief.

232
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,770
I think I got us a big scoop.

233
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,970
[Jae-joon]

234
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,170
Geun-young, why are you here?

235
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,650
Something came up, so I had to come.

236
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,680
What brings you here?

237
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,330
You were with In-hyung?

238
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,540
The hospital called me, actually.

239
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,300
I was the last person to talk to her.

240
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,890
Why didn't you call me?

241
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,090
I was really out of it too.

242
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,020
You should hear me out first.

243
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,370
I don't know what In-hyung said,
but I need to see her now.

244
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,950
So please try to understand.

245
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,910
I don't get why everyone says
I should understand anything.

246
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,070
I don't want to
get between you two either.

247
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,150
So could you just go home and wait?

248
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,950
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

249
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,160
Wait, hey. Let me go in first, then.

250
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,920
I'll have to talk to her first, and...

251
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,680
She might be too surprised.

252
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,890
I got to meet everyone here.

253
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,830
How did you know about this?

254
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,330
The hospital called me first,

255
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,940
I think it's because I was the one
she talked to last.

256
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,430
I told you about that, right?

257
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,270
I didn't know what to do,
so I called Who-joon.

258
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,970
Geun-young, you should've called me first.

259
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,010
I was really flustered too.

260
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,410
And you happened to call me
right at that time.

261
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,340
Right?

262
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,100
You don't have to try so hard, Geun-young.

263
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,600
Things somehow ended up like this.

264
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,240
But I don't think
that's what's important right now.

265
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,600
"Somehow"?

266
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,720
[Stranger]

267
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,730
She's somehow your speed dial one.

268
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,280
This isn't important?

269
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,890
You just found out
your girlfriend is at the hospital.

270
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,430
Don't you get what's important?

271
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,100
Shouldn't you be worried about her first?

272
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,870
That sounds like
you think I don't worry about her.

273
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,410
Do you think you're the only one

274
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,830
who worries about her
and runs over at once?

275
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,190
That's enough, both of you.

276
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,520
What's going on?

277
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,110
People must've talked about you.
Reporters are in the lobby.

278
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,750
Sounds great.
Let's expose everything with this chance.

279
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,160
Do you really want that?

280
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,610
You should all leave.

281
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,970
I'm sure no one cares that I'm here.

282
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,260
In-hyung, just be quiet.

283
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,660
Ji-hyang, for now,

284
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,230
-please let Geun-young leave first.
-Then what?

285
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,590
Then how about this?

286
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,690
I wonder if she left all right.

287
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,320
Stop worrying about others.

288
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,340
You made me worry about her first.

289
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,920
It looks like
she left without any trouble.

290
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,000
Will you be okay?

291
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,460
I can just lie in bed,
eat when I get hungry,

292
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,180
and sleep when I get sleepy.

293
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,590
The easiest task in the world.

294
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,000
Worrying doesn't suit you.

295
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,450
You make me worried.

296
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,470
Hey, Reporter Choi.

297
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,980
Thanks a lot. I'll be there soon.

298
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,910
Okay.

299
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,940
Thanks, Geun-young.
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

300
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,020
Let's go. Time to talk to the reporters.

301
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,330
Okay.

302
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,770
Bye.

303
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,710
-There's Who-joon.
-Hey.

304
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,770
Who-joon, why were you here?

305
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,670
Who was hospitalized?

306
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,350
Ms. Lee Geun-young was just hospitalized.

307
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,910
She was highly stressed due
to the misunderstanding of the song leak.

308
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,480
She's under a lot of stress,
so she needs absolute rest at the moment.

309
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,630
Please go back.

310
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,770
Ms. Lee is the key suspect
for the leak of that song.

311
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,130
Are you saying it wasn't her?

312
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,140
No. I never took the song to the set,

313
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,990
and I never had her listen to it.

314
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,890
There was no reason for her to leak it,
and she had no means to.

315
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,490
We came to apologize to her

316
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,790
for getting criticized
and framed because of our affair.

317
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,630
We lifted the misunderstanding,

318
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,310
so please do not attack Ms. Lee

319
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,570
for this song leak scandal,
because she isn't responsible.

320
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,760
Please excuse us.

321
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,840
-Do you know who did it?
-Who's responsible?

322
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,350
-Share your opinion on this!
-Is there a possibility

323
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,610
-she'll be cut from the show?
-Do you have anything to say?

324
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,050
I thought you disappeared. But you didn't.

325
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,610
You hoped I'd disappear,

326
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,630
so were you startled to see me here?

327
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,550
If I knew you'd let me go,
then I would've disappeared.

328
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,150
No matter how much you try to disappear,

329
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,630
someone hears about you.

330
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,050
No matter how hard I try
to keep you separated,

331
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,350
you somehow end up
getting connected to somebody.

332
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,430
You've been
staying in touch with him like this?

333
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,420
"Stranger."

334
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,110
A number that I'm a stranger to?

335
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,060
We didn't stay in touch.

336
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,950
I just had his number on my phone.

337
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,830
Why? Why would you?
Why would you keep his number?

338
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,110
Right, if you left him as speed dial one,

339
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,280
did you think you would get in touch
with that someone before you die?

340
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,640
Aren't you sick
of having this conversation?

341
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,110
It's not like he cares.

342
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,440
Why? Because his heart
seems to belong to someone else?

343
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Because someone else seems
more important to him?

344
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,920
Are you offended?

345
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,380
That's enough!

346
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,490
What's enough? I've had enough of you!

347
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,170
Yes, we've had enough of this.
Let's terminate the contract,

348
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,130
and let's put an end
to our relationship too.

349
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,670
Put an end to it?

350
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,530
Hey, you only feel sorry for Joon,
don't you?

351
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,000
You were always like that.

352
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,790
You only take what you want from me.

353
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,240
Right, and I gave this another thought.

354
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,300
I can't let you go that easily.

355
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,660
So don't ever do anything rash like that.

356
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,760
As I said before,
no matter what you choose to do,

357
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,580
it'll be the wrong decision.

358
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,380
You!

359
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,640
My gosh, you throw these at me
even when I come in.

360
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,950
What the heck have you been doing?

361
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,240
Did you see the news? I patched it up.

362
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,950
Why were you at that hospital?

363
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,270
Are you In-hyung's guardian?

364
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,000
No, I said it's Geun-young.
You haven't read it.

365
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,540
How dare you try to deceive me?

366
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,480
I thought you'd come to yourself
and work hard once In-hyung is gone.

367
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,690
Will you get a grip
after she disappears from this industry?

368
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,710
Go ahead. And see what I'll do.

369
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,780
It's not like you did anything right.

370
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,970
Stop talking like that.

371
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,360
Stop treating us like objects
that'll disappear once you abandon us.

372
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,200
Right. Aren't you afraid
of being forgotten too?

373
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,490
That's what happens to entertainers.
Get it?

374
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,340
Those of you who whine and say

375
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,580
your life is too tough
and you have no freedom

376
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,100
will miss those days
once they're forgotten by everyone.

377
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,300
So pull yourself together.

378
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,550
One day, we'll realize what it's like

379
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,140
to truly keep oneself together.

380
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,670
That idiot.

381
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,370
Will I really miss everything
once I'm completely forgotten?

382
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,180
[Unknown Caller]

383
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,250
I know it's you, so speak.

384
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,540
I can't believe you called me
on this number.

385
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,350
[I should save your number too.]

386
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,140
You two kept in touch
by using a different number?

387
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,890
Why? Were you hoping
In-hyung would return to you?

388
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,180
Do you feel that unconfident
about your girlfriend?

389
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,710
I picked up what you abandoned,

390
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,610
then you'd pick up what I abandoned.

391
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,740
[If the world found out,
they'd have a good laugh.]

392
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,730
Let me make myself clear once again.
If you'll treat her like that, then...

393
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,020
Then what will you do?

394
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,970
I won't let you drag me around anymore.

395
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,210
I dragged you around?
You two did that to me to this day.

396
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,120
You need to stop this too.

397
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,550
I tried my best to understand you,
but if you'll be like this,

398
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,190
then there's no reason
for me to do that anymore.

399
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,790
I don't care if it's this number
or the other one,

400
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,030
but if I need you, I'll call you first.

401

-Wait. Stop the car.]

[-Stop it. Stop the car!
-Okay, I'll stop.]

404
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,120
[-Stop! Step on the brake!
-I am stepping on the brake.]

What was that?

408
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,570
You're still here.

409
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,240
Of course not.

410
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,440
It's really late. Let's go.
Let me walk you out.

411

What is this? Show me the final edit.

412
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,930
Don't you trust me? Let's go.

413
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,420
-How can I trust you?
-Let's go.

414
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,830
How would I trust you?

415
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,640
Goodness.

[Anti-fan hospitalized]

417
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,350
Okay. Let's just consider this
as the best decision for everyone.

418
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,880
But Geun-young, next time,
you need to learn to stay quiet.

419
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,170
Things can go well without you.

420
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,390
I'm bored, sleepy,
and I want to go home. Gosh.

421
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,450
Yes?

422
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,840
-Pizza delivery.
-Pizza?

423
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,670
Right, I never ordered pizza.

424
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,320
Then

425
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,900
did you order me?

426
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,340
How did you get in?
Are the reporters gone?

427
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,510
They all left when I did.

428
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,180
You must be hungry. Have some pizza.

429
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,790
I was so hungry. How did you
come up with such an endearing idea?

430
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,050
You can't just end it there.
You have to pet my head.

431

But I was craving tteokbokki.

-I...
-I chose the wrong menu, right?

434
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,940
Make a run? Really?

435
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,720
Okay. Let's get you changed.

437
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,510
Get changed. I won't look.

438

more about this place than you.

00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,230
You kept this room so hidden
just to play games?

Yes.

Nothing.

00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,580
You've done well today.

471
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,100
You must've been startled. I didn't know
Jae-joon would do that around you.

472
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,980
I'm sure he was flustered too.

473
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,480
Anyway, the three of you were
once so close.

474
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,320
We were once like that.

475
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,270
And we thought it'd last forever.

476
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,300
We thought we'd all make it

477
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,680
and become huge celebrities.

478
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,170
But you made a debut first?

479
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,820
I only made my debut,
but no one knew me at first.

480
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,210
I had no idea
the fake life that Young-suk scripted

481
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,610
would become so deeply loved by everyone.

482
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,790
You three were so close.

483
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,250
What happened?

484
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,850
Everything Young-suk wanted to do
became a big success,

485
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,790
so the agency
began to put all of their focus on me.

486
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,920
Then Jae-joon and In-hyung's debut

487
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,000
slowly got postponed.

488
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,860
They held out for a long time,

489
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,990
then Jae-joon said
he wanted to make an agency himself

490
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,500
and asked me to come with him.

491
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,490
But I

492
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,010
couldn't do that.

493
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,600
Why not?

494
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,910
I know. That's why
I'm asking you for an understanding.

495
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,430
Just a few days. I'll pay the rest
of the hospital fee in a few days.

496
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,990
What? Postpone the operation?

497
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,550
I thought the operation
needs to be done now.

498
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,760
Then do you expect me
to take my sick kid out of the hospital?

499
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,270
Hello? Hey.

500
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,000
He bet everything he had for everyone

501
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,510
even though
he couldn't pay for his kid's hospital.

502
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,910
I couldn't do that to him.

503
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,530
Why didn't you tell Jae-joon?

504
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,630
Then things wouldn't have
come down to this.

505
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,210
You should've told him.

506
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,810
They were already determined to leave.

507
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,190
I thought they'd feel like
I'm pressuring them not to go.

508
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,990
That's why I couldn't.

509
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,710
Do you think he did it on purpose?

510
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,630
Did Jae-joon hate you so much,
then end up with In-hyung...

511
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,990
I doubt it.

512
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,900
I'm sure things were tough for them too.

513
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,030
Then they probably depended on each other.

514
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,280
I suddenly had to go overseas a lot,

515
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,170
so it must've been hard for In-hyung.

516
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,180
What's wrong?

517
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:16,020
I think I felt too relaxed to be home.
I suddenly got sleepy.

518
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,830
I'll get to bed first.

00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,800
Right, I actually came home.

528
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,160
[With Joon, right?]

529
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:07,870
By any chance, is he there?

530
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,350
No, he left after dropping me off.

531
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,870
He's not home, and he can't be reached.

532
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,200
What do you mean, he can't be reached?

533
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:22,040
Well, I think Joon got abducted.

534
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,750
Abducted?

535
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,560
Mr. Seo.

536
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,580
Did you two have a drink last night?

537
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,830
A little. I'm sure he took the taxi.

538
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,170
I think I saw that on the CCTV footage.

539
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,750
But I can't see the license plate.

540
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,580
And this was his last text message.

541
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,070
[Universal Star, Joon!]

543
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,030
The police will find him, right?

544
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,670
I asked them
to keep the investigation private.

545
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,890
If they demand a ransom,
it means he was abducted.

546
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,490
But what's odd is that
his ransom hasn't been demanded.

547
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,090
Please contact us right away
when you hear anything.

548
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,420
We'll ask around a little more.

549
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,970
-Thank you.
-Please find him.

550
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:21,700
This is bad. I need to cancel
his schedule and keep people quiet.

551
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,420
Are you going to keep it a secret?

552
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,050
Yes, this is too big.

553
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,950
If we don't hear from him by tomorrow,
the search may turn public.

554
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,730
You should go home and get some rest.
I'll look around his house some more.

555
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,630
No, I'll come with you.

556
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,300
Okay. Let's go, then.

I hope we find him soon.

558
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,510
He said it's a fan, so...

559
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,280
Wait, this cap.

560
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,490
Were these caps sponsored?

561
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,990
No, it was sent to his home.

562
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,640
The sender was unknown,
so he wasn't very sure about this.

563
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,540
I think I've seen this cap before.

564
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,950
I've seen this cap among his fans.

565
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,140
What?

566
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,420
Ca. It's "ca."

567
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,780
"Ca"?

568
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,240

569
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,700
It got cut off at "ca".

Do you think this girl abducted him?

The one who was wearing this cap
wasn't a woman. One second.

577
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,780

this guy among Joon's fans.

and he did.]

as an avid fan among the fans.]

[A male fan for a male star.]

582
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,090
[And not many male fans always show up
at fan events and meetings.]

583
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,990
Why? Is the TV station
looking for a male fan?

584
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:10,070
Will they get to be on TV?
Can you just tell them I'm a guy?

585
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,920
No, it's not like that. Don't worry.

586

Well.

he works part-time as a courier]

Okay, Yu-ri. Thanks a lot.

he might be working in this company?

Grab the cap.

-What did they say?
-He went out to work today.

599
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,410
The police confirmed his house was empty.

600
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,560
We should look around his area.

Let's go.

602
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:59,130
Do you think he abducted him
for not wearing the cap?

603
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,990
Even so, how can he abduct him
over something like that?

604
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,820
The world is like that now.
Let's just hope nothing bad will happen.

605
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,750
I shouldn't have let him go yesterday.

This wouldn't have happened
if he didn't go out at that hour.

It's not your fault.

we wouldn't have found that courier.

you were to receive?

00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,200
What about my face?

702
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:59,900
You shocked me so much today
that I probably became three years older.

703
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,040
[The way you looked made me concerned,
so I didn't want to go.]

704
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,660
[Will you be home?]

705
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,910
[Let me make up with Ji-hyang first.]

706
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,820
[Jae-joon]

707
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:21,630
Hello?

708
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:26,870
What?

709
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,580
Are you still angry?

710
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,660
Do you really have
nothing else to say to me?

711
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:35,710
-Tell you what?
-About you and Geun-young.

712
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:39,940
Joon, you aren't obligated
to share your love life with me.

713
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,840
But you need to tell me
how you feel about her.

714
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,130
I don't know
how much I'm allowed to intervene.

715
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,580
I shouldn't make a mistake.

716
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,320
It's not like you were cautious before.

717
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,060
Not to you. I mean to Geun-young.

718
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,510
Things became awkward between us again.

719
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:03,910
I guess so.

720
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,280
I shouldn't have asked to see you.

721
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,700
It must be uncomfortable
to be here with me.

722
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,790
I'm sorry. That's not the case.

723
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,650
But it was a bit confusing.

724
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,450
I hope I'm not bothering you.

725
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:41,360
Do you do this for In-hyung?

726
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:46,550
You're such a nice guy. I wondered
why In-hyung always looked gloomy.

727
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,360
The Jae-joon I saw at the hospital,

728
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:56,360
was not the Jae-joon I knew.

729
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,210
I'm mistaken, right?

730
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,610
You weren't completely mistaken.

731
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:06,530
Do you want some soju?

732
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,600
This might sound funny,

733
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,330
but that's what I thought too.

734
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:24,300
Joon probably thought
I've been abusing In-hyung.

735
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:29,190
Then what about him?
Not only is he in my girlfriend's memory,

736
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,390
he even stayed in touch.

737
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,040
Is that something I should let go of?

738
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,950
But they said nothing is going on
between them now.

739
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:42,120
-You might have overreacted...
-Do you believe them?

740
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:45,110
Maybe this is why I liked you.

741
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,240
You trust what people say.

742
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,310
I thought you might trust me too.

743
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,390
But

744
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,640
you've changed a lot.

745
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,590
Like everyone else,

746
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,140
you only have your ears opened for Joon.

747
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,110
It's not like that.

748
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,650
Then,

749
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,930
can we continue to be friends?

750
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:26,910
I'm a very simple-minded person.

751
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,040
You three seem to have years of history,

752
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,030
so I don't want to get into that
without knowing the whole story.

753
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,010
I don't want to make any mistakes either.

754
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,180
I just wanted you to know that.

755
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,020
Okay.

756
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,880
I'm sorry you got involved in this mess.

757
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:52,390
Anyway, let's go. I'll take you home.

758
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,510
I'm a friend,
but I don't even know where you live.

759
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,760
Why should you know where I live?

760
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,840
No, that's not what I meant.
You need a chauffeur anyway.

761
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,180
Let's have our last glass,
then go home on our own.

762
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:06,560
-Okay. Right.
-Cheers.

763
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,360
Joon.

764
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,750
You're a universal star.
Try to be careful.

765
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,920
Be careful with what?
I'm going to get some rest at home.

766
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,100
And I'm going to Japan
early tomorrow morning.

767
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,140
Once I get back,
let's go see those men in that group.

768
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,510
Right, yes. Have a safe trip.

769
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,710
-Okay. Go home, then.
-Okay. Bye.

770
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,370
Gosh, my shoelaces came undone.

771
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,680
Okay, Ji-hyang. Bye!

772
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:13,350
Why are you here?
Ji-hyang will be worried.

773
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,210
I told you to stay home.
Where have you been? I was worried.

774
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:17,880
Do I have to report back on everything?

775
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,510
Yes, you do. On every single move.

776
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,930
Forget that. Get in the car.

777
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,040
Where are we going?

778
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,550
Just trust me and come.

779
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:28,090
Okay.

780
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,960
Are you sure you can travel this far?

781
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,120
You should've gotten some rest today.

782
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,800
Why can't I?
I meant to come here for some time,

783
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,170
but I couldn't for a while.

784
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,810
You said you had to make up with Ji-hyang.

785
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,670
You put him through so much all day.
You'll make him worried again.

786
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,430
I came out because of you.

787
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,730
You know,
it's great to get some air out here.

788
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,730
That's not what I meant.
Ji-hyang is going to be worried again.

789
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,470
Are you my mom?
Why do you nag at me so much?

790
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,970
Even my mom wasn't this bad.

791
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,210
I was just worried.

792
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,420
You were worried? How?

793
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,060
Did you cry when you heard I disappeared?

794
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:13,010
Cried? Why would I cry?

795
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:17,190
Anyway, I told you to go home.
Where have you been?

796
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:20,230
I just went out.

797
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:22,600
What? You're avoiding my question.

798
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:25,370
Are you my dad?
Why do you want to know everything?

799
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,350
Even my dad didn't pry this much.

800
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,480
You won't let anything go.

801
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,160
Anyway, can you actually catch fish here?

802
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,580
My gosh, you're full of complaints.

803
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:37,910
You have to wait a while
when you come out to fish.

804
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,590
It's the beauty of waiting.

805
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,740
I really don't get it.

806
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,900
There are millions of things
we need to wait for.

807
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,530
What else do you wait for?

808
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,510
We have lots of things to wait for.

809
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:50,890
Life is full of things to wait for.
A top star like you wouldn't know.

810
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,970
For example,
you wait for your promotion at work.

811
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,760
You wait to buy a house
after years of saving money.

812
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,630
And you wait for someone
who'd love you with all their heart...

813
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,960
Anyway, so you brought me here
to teach me the art of waiting?

814
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:14,120
So? Are you waiting for anything?

815
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,620
No.

816
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,640
Don't you know what today is?

817
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,770
What is it?

818
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:24,200
You make me feel awkward
if you look so hopeful.

819
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:27,320
It's not a big deal.
Episode three of our show gets aired.

820
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,820
What?

821
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,300
That's something
that I've never waited for.

822
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:35,730
I can't believe
this day came around again.

823
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,630
But still.
It's better than watching it alone.

824
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,580
You'll be stressed out watching it alone.
Let's watch it together.

825
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,160
I don't need to.

826
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,340
Okay.

827
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,830
[Three, two, one.]

828
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:56,760
[Now, shall we go, Geun-young?]

829
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:58,430
-This feels like yesterday.
-I'll be a gentle driver.

830
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,620
[Okay.]

831
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:02,570
Wait, this is that day.

832
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,370
[Geun-young, wait.
You're going a bit too fast.]

833
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:04,330
[Urgent]

834
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,000
[Wait. Stop the car.]

835
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:07,280
[-Wait. Slow down!
-Step on the brake.]

836
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,990
[-Step on the brake!
-The brake!]

837
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,280
[I am stepping on the brake.]

838
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,840
I can't believe this got on camera.

839
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,010
[Their lips got in an accident.]

840
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:18,450
That was just an accident!
How can they put this on air?

841
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,000
[Kiss]

842
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,860
[Did you get hurt?]

843
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,850
This will turn into huge trouble.

844
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,210
How can you laugh right now?
I'm about to be criticized again.

845
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,320
Well, you wouldn't know how I feel.

846
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:31,870
My gosh, Mr. Han, you're a loony!

847
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,190
I'm going to call him.

848
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,260
Stop that.

849
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,480
Geun-young.

850
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,640
This one's not an accident.
