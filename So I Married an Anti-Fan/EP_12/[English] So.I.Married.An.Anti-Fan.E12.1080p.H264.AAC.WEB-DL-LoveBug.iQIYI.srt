00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,690
Okay. We researched the things
couples want to do the most

178
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,980
when they're on a date at home.

179
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,240
So today, you're going to do nails

180
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,800
and resting on each other's lap.

181
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,460
Well, the timing is a little odd.

182
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,900
Things will get worse
if we do that at this moment.

183
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,620
We'll do a great job today
and make them root for us.

184
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,790
I knew it.
Who-joon is so good at show business.

185
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,370
Then let's get started right away.

186
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,100
-Get ready.
-Geun-young, you got this.

187
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,920
We'll get started right away.
Please get ready. Let's tidy up.

188
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,870
You already knew
they couldn't care less about anything.

189
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,670
Let's make it work.

190
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,520
It's okay.

191
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,650
Doing nails and what now?

192
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,100
No idea. Something like

193
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,590
lying on your lap or something.

194
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,300
I don't think that's a bad idea.

195
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,690
Gosh, this is nice.

196
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,210
Look at how well they get along.

197
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,800
Isn't this much sweeter than we expected?

198
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,990
-Right.
-What's with them?

199
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,750
Just a little harder.

200
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,770
-I was worried for nothing.
-That's good.

201
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,710
I knew they'd do well.

202
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,790
[Jealous? Then we can be sweet too.]

203
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,600
What is this? He told me to be here.

204
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,820
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
This is Mr. Cho, our CEO.

205
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,100
Cho Hae-yoon.

206
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,520
We never met, Mr. Cho.

207
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,810
I wondered who ordered me to come and go.

208
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,520
We looked it over.

209
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,870
She only has a year left
of her seven-year contract,

210
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,260
and the clauses on the termination
weren't worded strongly.

211
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,950
It looks like your initial contract
with her was a bit casual.

212
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,240
So you're saying it's my fault?

213
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,900
Whatever. So you're saying
I can't do anything about her leaving.

214
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,900
Of course, she'll have to pay a penalty.

215
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,090
But if she takes it to court,
it'll put us in a tight spot.

216
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,180
So you believe
I have nothing to earn from this business?

217
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,170
You already have been
earning nothing from your business.

218
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,000
That's why I'm telling you
to find another way.

219
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,330
It's not that we won't.

220
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,410
However, it won't do any good
for your agency to sue an artist

221
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,740
who only has a year left in her contract.

222
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,160
And I called you to figure that out.

223
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,920
The chairman called us,

224
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,340
and he told us
to do business that makes a profit.

225
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,370
Getting angry won't get you anything.

226
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,420
You know who I am,
yet you dare speak like that?

227
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,070
Do you think you'll still be a CEO
after talking like that to me?

228
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,160
You should discuss it with the chairman.
I have a meeting to attend.

229
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,110
What the heck is wrong with him?

230
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,050
Hello?

231
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,550
Is that so? When can I get it?

232
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,550
Where are you going?

233
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,720
Did Jae-joon tell you
to keep an eye on me?

234
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,790
Well, I'm sure you've been reporting back.

235
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,300
-Get in the car.
-I'm leaving that agency.

236
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,370
So pretend like you didn't see me.

237
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,800
Will you go around
handing out your profile on your own?

238
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,910
It won't make you look good.

239
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,510
I've been your manager for five years.

240
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,070
Do you think
I'm a guy who only reports to him?

241
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,840
Get in. You'll catch a cold.

242
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,480
Anyway, is that girl, Lee Geun-young,
really all right?

243
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,910
All the stories about your first love
and your song leak went away

244
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,510
after yesterday's episode, so that's good.

245
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,010
But something doesn't feel quite right.

246
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,610
You saw the show. It was an accident.

247
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,000
And if something didn't feel right
or felt eerie,

248
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,340
you should've called Director Han.
You didn't do anything until now.

249
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,360
But the chief producer called me
and said they had the highest rating,

250
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,120
so I had nothing else to say.

251
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,090
Ji-hyang, tell him to be more careful.

252
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,220
Think about how concerned we get
about his kissing scenes.

253
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,560
Yes, I'll talk to him.

254
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,460
Anyway, something funny happened.

255
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,890
People have been
sending that leaked song to each other,

256
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,960
[Shooting Star Entertainment Company]

257
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,140
and it apparently became a huge hit.

258
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,010
There's no official source,
so many made a demand on streaming sites.

259
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,440
Who-joon,
everything you do is a huge success.

260
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,610
Anyway, let's release that song.

261
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,010
But Mr. Bae, it was already leaked.

262
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,430
Why don't you make some edits...

263
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,320
Hey, it's not my first day at work.

264
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,560
I listened to the song, and it was fine.

265
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,940
There's no need to tweak around.

266
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,080
What's fine isn't the song,
but how it doesn't cost you any money.

267
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,330
Hey, it takes a lot of work to use money.

268
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,000
So who's the female singer?

269
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,520
Well, she's an indie singer.

270
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,420
It was already on the guide track,
so I don't know who she is.

271
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,640
That's even better.
There are lots of great indie singers now.

272
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,240
Let's blow it up with the media,
then make an official release.

273
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,360
We can show people who she is
when she performs.

274
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,180
-It's...
-I'll talk to the songwriter.

275
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,060
Who-joon, if anything,
you're one lucky guy.

276
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,920
When something bad happens,
something good stops it from blowing up.

277
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,310
Joon, what's your plan?

278
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,520
Just pretend like you didn't know.

279
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,430
It's not like we'll tell everyone
who she is.

280
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,070
It'll end up getting disclosed.

281
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,200
She was that desperate.

282
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,600
I wanted to do this one thing for her.

283
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,110
Don't worry about it, Ji-hyang.
Everything will be fine.

284
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,140
What happened to your trip to Japan?

285
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,790
Someone already came and retrieved it.

286
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,330
Someone took it? Who did?

287
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,450
I checked their information,

288
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,990
but they wouldn't pick up the phone.

289
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,190
I told others to look for them.

290
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,310
It seems like

291
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,300
it wants to go farther away from me.

292
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,650
We'll find it.

293
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,080
While we look for the ring,
let's meet those men first.

294
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,980
Okay. Please contact them.

295
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,900
Right, Ji-hyang.
I have another favor to ask of you.

296
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,740
I've only been eating out lately,
so I got sick of it.

297
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,630
-My gosh.
-Hey.

298
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,180
Thank you.

299
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,480
I'll take it up for you.

300
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,080
No, it's okay. You're a busy man.

301
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,930
Go take care of the song leak.

302
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,140
Anyway, I'm a bit worried.

303
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,310
About what?
Do you think I can't carry these upstairs?

304
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,200
Not you, but Geun-young.

305
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,930
I'm not sure if we should
keep letting her live there.

306
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,610
You should go.

307
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,250
-Okay, bye.
-Go home, then.

308
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,410
-Bye, Ji-hyang. Thanks.
-Get some rest.

309
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,590
Okay.

310
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,620
If he was going to come,
why didn't he say so?

311
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,400
Wait, what's all this?

312
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,240
You can't go out for a while,
so you'll be stuck at home.

313
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,230
-And?
-And what?

314
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,970
Are we going to cook?

315
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,380
Are we going to cook at home?

316
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,070
You probably haven't eaten.

317
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,610
And it's not mealtime yet.

318
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,540
Since many of your fans
already know about this place,

319
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,320
and I feel uncomfortable and anxious
whenever the crew comes here.

320
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,920
I should probably move out
before I get in trouble, right?

321
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,830
-Don't.
-Wait.

322
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,000
It'll be more convenient
for you to come and go without me.

323
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,520
How will it be more convenient?
It'd feel too empty here without you.

324
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:12,740
Think about it. You left your traces
on everything in this house.

325
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,120
I clean up the house every day.

326
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,330
I didn't leave any of my stuff outside,
and it's all in there.

327
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,000
No, you can't go.

328
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,950
Just stay here for now.

329
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,520
You've been having a tough time
ever since you met me.

330
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,780
You ended up getting ugly comments
and too much attention.

331
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,510
-So you know.
-Stay here.

332
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,830
I'll be good to you.

333
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,840
Great job.

334
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,450
Let me make you something.

335
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,130
What is it?

336
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,250
Get ready to be blown away.

337
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,520
-Hello.
-Hello.

338
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,070
Hello.

339
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,240
I'm Lee Won-ho,
the manager for Oh In-hyung, a rookie.

340
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,320
She's a rookie of our agency,
so if you have any new programs...

341
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,510
Ms. No.

342
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,830
Mr. Kim.

343
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,120
You're a big shot now.

344
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,540
Come on. A little, right?

345
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,120
You're still the same.

346
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,230
What are you staring at?

347
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,170
-Oh In-hyung.
-I'll do my best.

348
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,210
-Please give me a chance!
-Why can't that great girl get her break?

349
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,140
-Who's Oh In-hyung?
-Hello.

350
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,740
She's what this industry calls
an old rookie.

351
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,620
Right, Mr. Kim.
Aren't you doing an audition show?

352
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,010
-Hello.
-Yes. Isn't she at JJ's agency?

353
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,620
JJ's doing this audition,
but she wasn't on the list.

354
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,770
-What?
-But right.

355
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,550
We were told to only go with real rookies.

356
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,760
Hey, you've worked long enough
to know better.

357
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,060
She used to be a trainee with Who-joon.

358
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,390
-She can bring in lots of attention.
-Hello.

359
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,620
Really?

360
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,830
-Do you know their number?
-I'll find out.

361
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,420
Please do.

362
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,630
You must be a good cook.

363
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,540
But you're the type
who ends up making too much food.

364
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,260
A real cook is someone
who makes just about enough.

365
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,450
You didn't know, did you?

366
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,690
I have everything planned out.

367
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,760
Wait, you probably
have never thrown out food waste.

368
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,020
When you don't have
any leftover ingredients to throw out,

369
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,510
you truly feel proud...

370
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,200
Are we expecting company?

371
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,440
No, you should check.

372
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,200
This is scary.

373
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,000
Hey, what's going on?

374
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,340
What are you doing? Open up.

375
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,490
Hey!

376
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,530
-What's going on?
-Hey!

377
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,640
-Hello.
-Come on in!

378
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,500
-Hello.
-You didn't have to.

379
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,260
Thank you for coming.

380
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,720
Don't mention it.

381
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,100
I was going to quit my part-time job
if they didn't let me take the day off.

382
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,010
It's my honor to meet you.

383
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,120
We only passed each other by, but...

384
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,840
Yes, Shin-hyuk.

385
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,740
You know my name? It's such an honor.

386
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,470
I think that's enough greetings.
I was actually cooking.

387
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,320
-I see.
-You can cook?

388
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,130
It's nothing special.
You can take a look around.

389
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,430
-It's so huge.
-Take a seat.

390
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,100
Don't be like that.

391
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,440
-Over here.
-It looks great.

392
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,820
-I love it.
-My gosh, look at how big it is.

393
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,260
What is this?

394
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,440
Was that a surprise?

395
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,830
So? Wasn't that a bit touching?

396
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,480
Go hang out with them.

397
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,520
-I love the sofa too.
-It's so comfy.

398
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,320
I've seen this place on TV.

399
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,830
-Have you been well?
-Yes, I've been doing great.

400
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,560
-It's so uncanny to be here.
-Isn't it huge?

401
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,800
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

402
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,220
Thank you. It looks great.

403
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,970
I didn't think you'd actually invite us,
and you invited us here of all places.

404
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,430
What did you think of him?

405
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,410
I trusted you, sir.

406
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,600
Don't mention it.

407
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,850
"Sir"? Is he older than us?

408
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,440
He was 21 when he debuted in 2014,

409
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,330
so 6 years later, he's now 27.

410
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,840
I believe we're all the same age.

411
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,210
You know a lot about me.

412
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,700
I actually began to study law

413
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,640
thanks to you, Who-joon.

414
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,590
A top star can't trust just anybody.

415
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,430
I thought you'd need a friend
who'd understand you before the law.

416
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,860
So I decided to get into this
as I listened to your music.

417
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,110
Please pass your bar exam and help me out.

418
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,740
Thank you.

419
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,130
Shin-hyuk, you're a funny guy.

420
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,330
Is this house empty
when you two don't shoot?

421
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,290
Well, I think he stops by
from time to time.

422
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,190
-Yes.
-Who-joon, you need another drink.

423
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,650
Oh no.

424
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,150
-I'm sorry.
-Are you all right? Stay calm.

425
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,740
-Don't touch it.
-My gosh.

426
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,600
-Don't touch that.
-You okay? I didn't do that on purpose.

427
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,270
Don't touch it. You'll get hurt.

428
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,220
-It's fine as long as you aren't hurt.
-You should put these on.

429
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,710
Why do you have these here?

430
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,760
-These are his.
-What?

431
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,620
-Yes, these are mine.
-I see.

432
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,470
It's a bit short for me,

433
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,070
so it'll be perfect for you.

434
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,370
You should get changed.
It's too dangerous.

435
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,210
-I'm getting drunk.
-Just one more.

436
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,750
I want another drink too.

437
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,540
We seem to drink a lot whenever we meet.

438
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,080
Am I bothering with your studies?

439
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,940
It's all right. That's life.

440
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,070
I love the view here.

441
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,860
Seeing you here

442
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,070
makes you look like you live here.

443
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,350
I mean, there was a time
when we criticized him for his character.

444
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,400
So why is he so nice to you?

445
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,520
What?

446
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,290
I don't know.

447
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,730
This house. This life.

448
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,380
He's very different, isn't he?

449
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,790
Right.

450
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,120
His world is

451
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,560
completely different from mine.

452
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,450
So? Are you intimidated?

453
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,530
What? Hey, why would I be?

454
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,940
I know you.

455
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,270
-When times are tough...
-I'm good at being patient.

456
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,380
you don't just stay patient,

457
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,940
but you try to understand.

458
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,480
No one else may know,

459
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,420
but you know I do, right?

460
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,160
You didn't do anything wrong.

461
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,620
Come on, girl.

462
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,420
Gosh, whatever.
I'm going back for another drink.

463
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,960
Wait, I think that guy is
worth your patience.

464
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,070
What? Don't say that.

465
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,920
No? Let's go.

466
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,800
Great work.

467
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,190
Okay, then.

468
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,900
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

469
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,890
Bye, everyone. Thanks for coming.

470
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,610
Aren't you leaving?

471
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,090
-Me? I should go.
-She'll leave.

472
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,860
This is our set,

473
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,590
so we're going to clean up together.

474
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,740
I see. Then we should help.

475
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,060
No, let's go.

476
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,350
Let's just go home.

477
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,440
Who-joon, please stay healthy
until the day we meet again.

478
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,130
-All right. Go home safely.
-Thank you.

479
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,500
I'll take her home safely, so don't worry.

480
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,700
-Please do.
-Bye.

481
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,200
-Let's go.
-Yes, you should go.

482
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,610
-I won't go out.
-You'll be late.

483
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,370
-Bye!
-Bye, Shin-hyuk.

484
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,260
-Okay! Bye!
-Try to sober up.

485
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,190
-Make sure Mi-jung gets home.
-Just go.

486
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,750
-Bye!
-Bye, Who-joon!

487
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,000
I had a lot to drink.

488
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,960
You probably did.
They're all heavy drinkers.

489
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,210
Are you okay?

490
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,400
All done.

491
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,450
-Thanks.
-I should clean up after them.

492
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,520
It's not easy to have guests over.

493
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,410
So why did you do this?

494
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,950
I'm glad if you're glad.

495
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,260
Gosh, but I had so much fun
with my friends for once. Thanks.

496
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,970
You must be tired. Go home and sleep.
Aren't you leaving?

497
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,940
I had too much to drink,
so I have to sleep here.

498
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,240
But there's nowhere to sleep.

499
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,230
Where are you going to sleep?

500
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,660
Don't worry. There are lots of rooms here.

501
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,810
I can sleep on the second floor.

502
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,560
Anyway, do you still sleep there?

503
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,940
But there's a bedroom.

504
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:10,250
It's not even my house,
and I'm comfortable enough there.

505
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,970
Sleep in a bedroom, okay?

506
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,520
Goodnight.

507
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,200
Goodnight.

[Mr. Joon]

509
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,140
Going to sleep.

00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:55,889
[Mr. Joon]

515
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,850
[I should.]

516
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,000
[Goodnight.]

517
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,720
So cute.

She had a meeting today.

520
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,290
This is the CEO.

521
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,640
-Hello.
-You must be Ms. Lee.

522
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,930
Doing all right on the show?

523
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,310
Yes, I guess.

524
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,510
Please be good to Joon.

525
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,440
Make sure he keeps his reputation up.

526
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,030
Okay.

527
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,490
Then good luck with your meeting.

528
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,630
This way, please.

529

531
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,740
I'm sorry I asked you to come.

532
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,440
It's all right.
Things were quiet out front too.

533
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,220
I guess my popularity is all gone.
You're responsible.

534
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,410
Whatever.

535
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,610
He received an offer for an ad.

536
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,560
Again? Gosh, congrats.
You should treat me.

537
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,420
You and Joon will be
making an appearance together.

538
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,280
Me?

539
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,630
Who is this crazy advertiser?

540
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,810
She finally came to know herself
after reading "Socrates" again and again.

541
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,680
It's a company that worked with him
soon after he debuted.

542
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,880
I thought he might get cut off
after the last episode,

543
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,330
but they actually liked it.

544
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,490
What a loyal company.

545
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,910
Well, of course, they'd want him,

546
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,320
but why me?

547
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,220
You must've been troubled
through everything that has happened,

548
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,380
but you have a positive spin on the media.

549
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,940
It's difficult to create
a memorable character like you.

550
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,980
Also, your image is
the opposite of Joon's image,

551
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,780
so you'd be effective in marketing.

552
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,760
Really?

553
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,680
Since you're working alone, it might be
difficult to process the contract.

554
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:53,120
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to help you while working on his.

555
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,630
Right.

556
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,770
But if people begin to hate me
and start resenting me

557
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,410
once the ad gets out,
do I have to take responsibility?

558
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,710
Why should you?
That's my part. Don't worry.

559
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,710
You won't have to.
And something like that won't happen.

560
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,440
You can stay confident, Geun-young.

561
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,120
And I've never done anything of that sort.

562
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,630
It's not like
we're all born in front of cameras.

563
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,030
Also, you won't play a huge part,
so don't worry.

564
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,500
Did you look at her storyboard?
Will they make her do weird stuff?

565
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,370
Of course, I did.
It'll be great on her image.

566
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,860
Don't get off. Please. This is too much.

-I see.

It's not like that, Jae-joon.

Hey, In-hyung is signed with my agency.

How dare you fool me without a word?

575
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,500
If I told you, would you have said yes?

576
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,980
You're now pushing the blame on me,

577
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,220
just like you pushed In-hyung at me.

578
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,590
I really want to stop discussing
something like this with you.

579
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,770
Jae-joon, we were close enough
to help each other out like that.

580
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,390
And like I said,
I'll do everything as I want.

581
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,660
I see, if you were dying
to help her release a song,

582
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,790
why didn't you disclose her name
and that you two were exceptionally close?

583
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,380
You can't do that.

584
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,140
That's why I keep saying you're a coward.

585
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,780
The least you can do is
beg me to be good to her!

There's one more thing we have to do.
We'll talk on the way.

You got an ad gig. Once you do this,

is it tough for us to meet today?

You're right.

692
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:55,180
Anyway, when did you get your license?
Why can't you drive?

693
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,950
Wait, are you on your way
to make me practice?

694
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,390
Haven't you heard? Couples should
never teach each other how to drive.

695
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,980
People get into fights.

696
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,410
So where are we going?

697
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:14,800
I just wanted to show you
how well I can drive with one hand.

698
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,850
You came out to show that off?

699
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:27,030
Of course. Look how good I am.

700
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,320
Don't get off.

701
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,860
You want to take a walk here?

702
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,500
We've walked around together a lot too.

703
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,520
It was never a real walk.

704
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,320
You're right.

705
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,180
Why didn't you tell me before?

706
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,960
But I guess I can walk. Let's go.

707
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,080
I got you comfortable shoes.

708
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,520
Why did you get me these?
Stop getting me stuff.

709
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,580
I heard giving shoes is like
asking them to leave.

710
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,700
Exactly. You got me another pair.

711
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,380
You're practically begging me to run away.

712
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:21,810
No, if you run away
with the shoes I gave you last time,

713
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,350
you can come back in these.

714
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,640
People might think we had plastic surgery.

715
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,560
We have to run away if we run into my fan.

716
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,660
I see, that's why you put me in sneakers.

717
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,650
We're standing out.

718
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:46,670
Let's take these off.

719
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:50,500
Are you sure you'll be fine? But...

720
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,690
It's fine.

721
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,410
Your shoelaces came undone.

722
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,340
What are you doing? I'll do it. Get up.

723
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,770
From now on,
I'll always tie your shoelaces,

724
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,160
so hang tight to your senses

725
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,450
and just follow me.

726
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:11,970
I get it, so get up.

727
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,150
Can't you just adore me
when I say things like these?

728
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,900
You're adorable.

729
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,110
Let's go.

730
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,570
Oh, right. And that thing.

731
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:47,920
Can you change my name on your phone?

732
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,410
How can you call me a punk?

733
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,220
When did you see that?

734
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,560
That's what it says
on your social media page, "yam-a," punk.

735
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,450
-You saw that?
-I look at everything.

736
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:57,910
I'm your anti-fan.

737
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:01,160
Anyway, what does it mean?

738
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,390
-It's from my father's ring.
-What?

739
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,100
That's what it said
on the inside of his ring. "YAMA."

740
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:17,270
Then your father is...

741
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:20,350
I'm sure he's doing well
somewhere out there.

742
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,530
Don't look at me like that.
You were just curious.

743
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,610
And you've seen that ring too.

744
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,190
-I did?
-Yes.

745
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,350
The ring you picked up in Japan.

746
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,060
I was glad that I lost it,

747
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,690
but you, my fool, found it.

748
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,500
What? That's...

749
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,300
But I lost it again.

750
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:45,560
I went to get it back,
but someone else already picked it up.

751
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,790
Do you know what that ring is?

752
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,980
Yes.

753
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,280
It looks similar to the one
I picked up in Japan.

754
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,910
Wait, is it yours?

755
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,460
Did you lose it
when you were at the hotel?

756
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:01,970
Yes.

757
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:07,160
Wait, can you let me off here
for a second?

758
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,200
-What? Why?
-Quickly. Can you stop the car?

759
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:15,870
Wait.

760
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,560
What's going on?

761
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,670
You can go home first, okay?

762
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,820
What's happening?
You wanted to see me first.

763
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,320
There's no reason.

764
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,050
It's great to see you like this.

765
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:42,800
Hey, about that ring you lost.

766
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,970
Yes, I found it thanks to you.

767
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,620
I was going to thank you for that.

768
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,600
May I see it?

769
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:52,790
Sure.

770
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,710
Here.

771
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,540
What is this ring?

772
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,760
[YAMA]

773
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,000
Right, it's nothing special.

774
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,590
But it was a bit too nice
for me to lose it.

775
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,800
It would've been really bad
if it hadn't been for you.

776
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,670
What's wrong? Is something going on?

777
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,940
You know,

778
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:30,490
I still

779
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,850
wanted to understand you.

780
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,020
I wanted to be a good friend for you
to the end.

781
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,050
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

782
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,390
When I hated Who-joon,

783
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:47,260
you bashed him with me and took my side,

784
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,160
and it was honestly comforting,
so I was grateful.

785
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,390
Are you saying

786
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,660
you don't hate him anymore?

787
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,020
Geun-young, I already told you.
He's trying to fool you!

788
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,430
What about you?

789
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,300
When I fell for your lies,

790
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,760
how did it make you feel?

791
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:09,740
Did you have fun?

792
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:16,520
You knew whose ring this was
from the start.

793
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:20,700
Even if I still hate him,

794
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:26,150
I can't be a friend
who'll take part in something like this.

795
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,900
She hasn't even called. Where did she go?

796
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,440
Hey, where have you been?

797
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:32,060
I'm sorry, really.

798
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:34,000
What's wrong? What's going on?

799
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,220
This.

800
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:45,700
Why is this...

801
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,860
I was such a fool.

802
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,830
It's okay. What's going on?

803
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:59,700
This ring is
putting a lot of people in trouble.

804
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:02,340
Anyway, why did you go there
to get it back yourself?

805
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,570
You could've told me.

806
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,780
Of course, I should.
It came down to this because of me.

807
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:11,840
Don't do that from now on.
Don't try to do everything on your own.

808
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:13,420
I'm here for you.

809
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,760
Why? Why are you staring at me?
You'll poke a hole through me.

810
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,750
You suddenly became a different man.
It's scary.

811
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:26,840
Would you rather have me be a little edgy?

812
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,570
It'd make me feel at ease, actually.

813
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,600
Anyway, what could this mean? "YAMA."

[Jae-joon]

817
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,740
It has been a while.

818
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,670
Did you call to apologize?

819
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:45,870
What are you talking about?
You should apologize to me.

820
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:49,520
Hey, let's set the record straight.

821
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:54,010
Did you have to say In-hyung was
a trainee at Who-joon's agency?

822
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:56,380
[It won't do anyone good
if they get involved again, no?]

823
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,830
If you know that so well,
how can you let her sing a duet with Joon?

824
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,010
-What?
[-Gosh.]

825
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:04,210
You had no idea either.

826
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:08,350
You only adored him all the time,

827
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,210
but look at how ridiculous you've become.

828
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:15,350

about your beloved Joon,]

you know what will happen, don't you?

830
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:22,910
So you better keep him under control.

831
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,920
Hey, so the duet you mentioned...

832
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:30,130
You just...

833
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,810
Darn it, he hung up on me first too!

834
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,610
How did he know?

835
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:43,370

[Where are you?
He's going to your place right now.]

00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:51,860
No, I'll go visit him. I'm out anyway.

839
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:53,140
Okay.

840
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,720
I have to go.

You have to work at this hour?

842
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,030
Of course, do you see

843
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,580
how hard your boyfriend works
by day and night?

844
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,030
Boyfriend?

845
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:11,180
Wait, then do you go around
doing something like this

846
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:14,480
with someone who isn't your boyfriend?
Is that who you are?

847
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,500
You must be insane.

848
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:18,570
Go, now.

01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,240
Bye.

-Go back inside.
-Let me see you go.

852
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:34,150
Okay, then.

853
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:37,840
Let me get charged.

854
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:41,280
You should go. You'll be late.
