00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,290
You have to wake up, okay?

356
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,640
You're only starting to feel better.
Where are you going?

357
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,850
I feel suffocated to be locked up at home.

358
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,650
I'll go out for just a short while.

359
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,150

360
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,130
Come here.

361
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,640
It's cold.

362
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,470
Don't be late.

363
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,150
Okay. I'll be back soon.

364
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,340
All right.

365
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,770
Why did you get me these?

366
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,050
I heard giving shoes is like
asking them to leave.

367
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,810
You're practically begging me to run away.

368
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,200
No, if you run away
with the shoes I gave you last time,

369
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,790
you can come back in these.

Have you been well?

376
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,890
I've been all right.

377
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,490
What about you?

378
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,510
I'm the same.

379
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,110
How's Joon? Is he doing okay?

380
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,690
Well, I doubt he would be all right.

381
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,770
I think he's holding out pretty well.

382
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,510
So? Do you get along with him?

383
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,290
Remember those shoes?

384
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,890
The limited-edition shoes

385
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,870
that you threw out
in front of my restaurant.

386
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,910
How could I forget those shoes?

387
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,970
Those shoes are what got me here today.

388
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:18,420
Joon got mad at me saying
why I got you such huge shoes.

389
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,420
He knew about us?

390
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,370
He gave you a pair of shoes
as a present, right?

391
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,890
He asked me for your size
when he bought those.

392
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,530
Do they fit well?

393
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,200
He's up?

394
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:45,080
His frontal lobe was damaged
due to the shock from the accident.

395
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,410
His loss of speech

396
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,000
may be temporary.

397
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,850
Loss of speech?

398
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,980
Yes, let's keep an eye on him.

399
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,290
Loss of speech...

400
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,630
Why?

401
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,190
Why? Why did you get into my life?

402
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,730

408
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,000
Are you playing hwatu all alone?

409
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,030
No, I'm just playing with it.

410
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,000
Let's see. Yes. And then...

411
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,770
Right.

412
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,370
Joon told me this.

413
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,640
He said you're like December in hwatu.

414
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,190
Mom.

415
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,900
What are the cards for December?

416
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,450
December?

417
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,090
Let's see.

418
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,950
Yes, there they are. These cards.

419
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,400
What do they mean?

420
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,900
Tears.

421
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,620
December Rain is
a sad Bright card with no presence.

422
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,180
The youngest,
Double Junk is way more popular.

423
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,550
So? What about December?

424
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,520
Well, someone said
I'm like December cards of hwatu.

425
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,590
-A surprise, then.
-What?

426
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,510
-A surprise?
-Yes.

427
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,290
December Rain hides quietly,

428
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,510
then gets together with other Bright cards
and gives you scores, so it's a surprise.

429
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:07,290
If you let it slide,
you will end up paying the price.

430
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,850
You only miss it when it's gone,
so it's a rather sad Bright card.

431
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,110
So once this card comes out,
you don't feel comfortable leaving it,

432
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,360
so you'll only feel rest assured
once you take it.

433
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,790
What is this? This person
doesn't want others to have you.

434
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,090
But feels too much pressure
to take you. Wait.

435
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,900
Who is this?

436
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,270
-That scumbag.
-That scumbag.

437
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,610
-Who is it?
-Who is this guy?

438
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,030
Whatever.

439
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,800
Go back inside. It's cold.

440
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,350
You should stay one more day.

441
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,990
No, we can't stay away from home
for too long.

442
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,490
You're impossible.

443
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:46,090
So if your shooting is over,
when will you visit home again?

444
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,680
After I figure some things out.

445
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:50,890

and I'm signing up for English classes.

so you live doing whatever you want.

447

Yes, if all fails,

448
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,700
you can quit and come home.

449
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,290

I have my mom and dad here for me.

452

00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,170
Oh, and about that guy.

454

When people criticize someone,
the parents feel heartbroken.

wiring when people did that to you.

When I heard
all those bad things about you,

it didn't feel too great.

It's comforting to know you felt that way.

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,130
[Girin Hall]

533
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,810
You said you'll let me debut.

534
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,140
Let's go by the order, please.

535
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,430
I became a trainee first.

536
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,690
So what? Do you want to ruin his future?

537
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,030
It's a done deal.

538
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,520
This isn't your last chance.
Don't be like this.

539
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,360
Yes, not yet.

540
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,280
I guess he has nothing to say.

541
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,010
Transfer him to a quiet and scenic place
once he gets discharged.

542
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,660
All right.

543
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,200
Did you say you had a younger brother?

544
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,700
Yes, sir.

545
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,790
What kind of an older brother are you?

546
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:55,580
Me? I'm just a normal guy.

547
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,360
Just an older brother
who's not any special.

548
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,200
An older brother.

549
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,210
Do you think
he doesn't want to say anything?

550
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:20,530
He might have all kinds of things to say,
but he just can't.

551
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,840
The doctor said it might be temporary,

552
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,750
so let's give him some time.

553
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:30,870
I hope time passes by quickly.

554
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,650
In-hyung.

555
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,590
Don't feel so guilty anymore,
and go back to your place.

556
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,670
I'm sure that's what he'd want.

557
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:50,890
I should.

558
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,320
Back to my place.

559
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:09,460
I didn't get to show people
everything from the shooting,

560
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,350
but I'm satisfied with it.

561
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,800
You know,

562
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:18,260
you become satisfied way too quickly.

563
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:19,710
That's your problem.

564
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,510
I'm way too quick.

565
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,970
Goodness.

566
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,810
What's wrong?

567
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,020
-I'll be back.
-Yes, ma'am.

568
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,280
Are you not satisfied either?

569
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,790
But still.

570
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:46,290
Doesn't Who-joon seem different now
than when you two began?

571
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,960
Did you know things will become like this

572
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:55,080
from the beginning?

573
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,490
I told you to try reading
"Pride and Prejudice".

574
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:08,680
We all cover ourselves
with prideful wrapping paper.

575
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:14,400
The moment I saw that photo of him
getting hit with your shoe,

576
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:19,940
I kind of saw something similar
in both of you.

00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,740
[Two-faced Who-joon]

578
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,680
[Trash Bin]

579
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:49,380
[Mr. Han told me
to read "Pride and Prejudice."]

580
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,270
[The Pride and Prejudice...]

581
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:54,260
[Perhaps to him,
our beginning seemed to be]

582
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,420
[about Who-joon's Two Faces]

583
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:56,510
[revolving around]

584
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,780
[Who-joon's pride
and my prejudice on who he is.]

585
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,950
[Where do pride and prejudice begin?
I was confident of...]

586
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,790
[I'll remember the day we first met.
The streets, the moment.]

587
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,600
[And finally, I realized
deeming everyone as bad...]

588
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,810
[for having two sides is
our pride and prejudice.]

589
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,950
[The Pride and Prejudice
about Who-joon's Two Faces]

590
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,040
Wow, Geun-young. When did you write this?

591
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,370
You're such a loyal person.

592
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,620
Please publish it on "Wonder Woman."

593
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,370
That's about the only thing I can do
at the moment.

594
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:23,630
Anyway, so Who-joon didn't get you fired?

595
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,950
I ran into Mean Moon-hee
at the English academy.

596
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,530
She told me

597
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,730
I was going to be fired anyway.

598
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,770
Wait, Mean Moon-hee is
taking English lessons?

599
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,910
Your company will lay people off
by your proficiency in English.

600
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:43,870
Man, I can't believe Mean Moon-hee is
only trying to save herself again.

601
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,050
Su-hwan.

602
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,170
Please do this for me.

603
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,530
Don't worry. I'll have it published,
then I'll give it out to reporters.

604
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:57,810
I'll call you.

605
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:07,670
[This is the end to our story
of your pride and my prejudice.]

606

tunes into my story just this once.]

[One of our crew members
didn't know how to turn off the camera.]

611
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:49,910
[I retrieved it.]

[I'm the only one who saw it,
so don't worry.]

There are.

Why have I been crying so much

623

[Mr. Joon]

625
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,970
If you were going to cry like that,

626
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,630
why did you say you can wait well?

627
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,110
How did you...

628
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,040
I was worried that you were gone.
