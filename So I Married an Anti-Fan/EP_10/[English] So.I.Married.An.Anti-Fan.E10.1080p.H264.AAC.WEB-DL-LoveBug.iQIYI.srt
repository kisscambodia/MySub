00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,480
Her dad is the stationmaster
at Gimje Station,

181
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,330
and he registered her name there

182
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,050
because she ran away from home.

183
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,070
You ran away from home?

184
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,090
Why would you tell him that?

185
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,770
You're the president of a district,

186
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,760
so I figured
he should know what your situation is.

187
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,440
If you ran from home, you should go back.

188
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,810
Why would you be here?

189
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,510
Are you sure this will be okay?

190
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,940
She found this place on her own.
She isn't an ordinary kid.

191
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,390
Are you worried about me?

192
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,580
No.

193
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,610
About Ms. President.

194
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,420
An anti-fan like you
might end up rubbing off

195
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,830
on an avid fan like her.

196
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,530
Don't worry.
We're from two different bloodlines.

197
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,560
You just told me not to worry,

198
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,100
so I'll forget how you got pouty.

199
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,060
Whatever. I never pouted.

200
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,410
Why is he here this early?

201
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,160
Hey, get ready. We're going out.

202
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,920
-Yu-ri?
-Yes?

203
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,070
Good morning.

204
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,180
Yes, good morning. Get ready to go out.

205
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,550
Where are we going?

206
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,380
What? Oh, we're all going for a drive.

207
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,660
It's 8 a.m. right now.

208
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,000
Is time more important than me?

209
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,490
No.

210
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,180
Yu-ri, bring your backpack too.

211
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,980
I need that for the drive?

212
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,840
You're a student,
so you'll look great with a backpack.

213
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,040
-Go on and get it.
-Okay.

214
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,000
What are you doing? Get ready.

215
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,320
It's eight right now,

216
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,360
so we'll be there by 11:30 a.m.

217
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,640
Right. You drive.

218
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,320
You saw me behind the wheel.

219
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,300
Exactly. That's why you should drive.

220
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,710
Practice makes perfect.

221
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,260
Wait, are you just tired?

222
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,770
Then do I get to sit in the back with you?

223
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,620
You can do it!

224
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,780
Anyway, are we not going to eat anything?

225
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,110
We haven't had breakfast.

226
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,790
Yu-ri, be quiet. I have to focus.

227
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,730
She was really weird last night,

228
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,710
so I couldn't ask her for dinner either.

229
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,560
Really?

230
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,740
Okay, then. Let's eat something.
I'm hungry.

231
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,500
Let's stop by at a rest area.

232
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,040
I want potatoes, lots of sugar.

233
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,710
I want a corn dog, lots of ketchup.

234
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,940
So they're asking me to get it.

235
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,460
-One corn dog, please.
-Okay.

236
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,270
We have ketchup and mustard over there.

237
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,940
Or you can use sugar.

238
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,790
Ketchup is fine.

Who-joon, did you do something bad to her?

241
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,319
Why? Does it look like I did something?

242
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,550
She didn't seem like a real anti-fan.

243
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,109
She didn't seem like
she'd hate someone for no reason.

244
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,630
Why? Did you decide to switch sides

245
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,790
after spending a few days with her?

246
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,630
No way.

247
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,540
How can I put this?

248
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,980
She seemed like someone who's
waiting to be found at the lost and found.

249
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,920
But then yesterday,

250
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,220
-She said that?
-Yes. That makes no sense.

Wow, they all recognized me
in that short while.

258
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,960
-That could've been bad.
-No one is around.

259

-Why? Everyone was looking.
-They're all staring.

-That could've been bad.
-No one was looking.

You might as well go home, then.

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,860
Who's this? Why is this man
holding my kid in his arms?

358
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,490
-You little jerk.
-Goodness.

359
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,160
Come on, Mom!

360
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,550
Hello, ma'am. You know me, right?
I'm Who-joon.

361
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,730
What is this?

362
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,680
He's the guy
who put you in trouble, right?

363
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,690
So he's that famous guy?

364
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,890
I'm sorry for making you worried.

365
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,070
Ms. Jang, we came in a hurry,
so this isn't much.

366
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,880
I'll send you something better
once we get to Seoul.

367
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,120
Do I have something on me?

368
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,390
You'll wear his face down
from staring at him.

369
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,700
I can't tell why you're so popular
by the way you look.

370
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,490
She's so straightforward.

371
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,700
Does it hurt a lot?

372
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,440
I guess she really hates me.

373
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,910
Did you see how she beat me in full swing?

374
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,070
I thought she was on a baseball team.

375
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,340
Anyway, she really doesn't know who I am?

376
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,040
Just because you're the national star,
did you really think everyone knows you?

377
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,270
It doesn't make any sense.

378
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,390
I was the most popular
on a survey taken by people in their 50s.

379
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,620
Wow, it's not easy to be like this guy.

380
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,740
You made a lot.

381
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,820
Are you giving him more food out of spite?

382
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,290
No, I just didn't know what he liked.

383
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,750
But no one in this world hates tteokbokki.

384
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,940
When I was younger,
my mother ran a tteokbokki place.

385
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,200
Her business
heroically went under with the review,

386
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,910
"It's tough for tteokbokki
to be this bad."

387
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,730
Is this the famous...

388
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,120
Yes, the famous tteokbokki
in downtown Dangjin.

389
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,210
Right? Everyone loves tteokbokki, right?

390
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,970
Yes, of course.

391
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,590
Oddly, Geun-young is the only girl I know
who doesn't like tteokbokki.

392
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,060
Don't worry. He loves it.
I'm sure he'll finish everything.

393
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,100
I see, I'm glad.

394
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,410
Look. The color already looks appetizing.

395
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,650
I really have no idea
why my tteokbokki place went under.

396
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,240
Try a bite first,

397
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,400
then give me your objective opinion.

398
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,250
Okay.

399
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,990
What? Right.

400
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,200
It's really good.

401
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,850
My gosh, you're more frank than you look.

402
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,730
Geun-young, you should eat up,
then go fetch your dad

403
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,150
before he buys something weird again.

404
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,190
At this rate, he might come home
with stars and the Moon.

405
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,740
He already bought stars and the Moon.

406
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,100
What?

407
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,450
Well, let me put this in a good way.

408
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,530
When you go to the Moon later,
you'll have a piece of land for yourself.

409
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,340
I can't believe this guy.

410
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,370
-Eat up.
-Yes, Ma'am.

411
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,160
This is spicy and sweet. What a meal.

412
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,800
Mom, make him some more.
That's hardly enough.

413
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,920
-Should I really?
-Yes, he loves tteokbokki.

414
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,280
I see.

415
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,740
I can't remember the last time
I had such a nice stroll.

416
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,900
Tell me about it. I always ran around
in a hurry ever since I met you.

417
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,370
That's because you always went around
causing trouble.

418
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,550
I never caused any trouble.
You're the one who gets weird ideas.

419
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,760
Weird ideas? Wait.

420
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,270
If this is about that day,
it's a misunderstanding.

421
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,700
It's okay.
I already forgot all about it too.

422
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,180
What are you doing? Are you going to run?

423
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,970
No, there are no people around,
so I thought we should walk a little.

424
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,510
Have you gone insane?

425
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,240
It'll start a rumor.
That's what it's like in the countryside.

426
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,150
Wait for me. Then can I do this?

427
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,790
Hey, what are you doing?

428
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,420
-Why?
-Come on.

They won't buy the product
at a reasonable price,

431
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,360
so my year's hard work
almost came to nothing.

432
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,490
-Exactly.
-It's really frustrating. What about you?

433
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,860

-Geun-young, you're here.
-Hey.

Wait, is that Geun-young's boyfriend?

440
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,270
-No, he's not.
-Hello.

441
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,940
Wait, he's that jerk on TV
who deserves to be beaten to death.

Yes, that's me. Hello, Mr. Lee.

-Hey, stop!

-What's with you?

-Stop that!
-Please calm down!

went off the charts because of him.

if she finds out that I bought stars.

So this is a secret from her, okay?

-Go.
-Yes, sir.

Right.

How far can you go with me on your back?

518
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,570
You won't go down
even before you go 100 meters, will you?

519
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,130
No, that won't happen.
I can go very far, Mr. Lee.

520

I have in Seoul, right?]

You have a face mask, right? Put it on.

526
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,240
You're worried about my bronchial tubes?

527
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,000
I'm awfully grateful.

528
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,900
Goodnight. I hope you make it.

529
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,730
Right, I think Mom said
she saw some rats in the drain.

530
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,280
Did she catch them? Or was it a snake?

531
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,450
What? Hey, Geun-young. Geun-young!

532
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,830
Rats?

533
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:40,510
It must be uncomfortable
trying to sleep on the floor.

534
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,190
Hey, you weren't asleep.

535
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,590
I didn't know we could still see
a night sky like this in Korea.

536
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,020
You're very sentimental.

537
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,730
By any chance, have ever been to Alaska?

538
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,890
I haven't even been to Japan.
Do you actually think I've been there?

539
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,520
Right.

540
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,360
You've heard of the name Benny, right?

541
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,530
Well, you've done
your share of research on me.

542
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,200
My real name is Benny.

543
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,050
I came from Alaska.

544
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,780
Oh, Alaska?

545
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,240
I didn't know that.

546
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:25,790
People think I'm an international student
who studied in the U.S.,

547
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,990
but after I graduated high school,

548
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,150
I left my single mother alone
and decided to come to Korea.

549
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,710
And now that I see
such a wonderful night sky,

550
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,820
I'm reminded of Alaska.

551
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,990
Do you miss her?

552
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,990
So you should come
and see your parents more often.

553
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,930
They must be lonely by themselves.

554
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,630
You suddenly talk
like you're such an elder.

555
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,830
I'm a year older than you.

556
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,290
What? You're the same age as me.

557
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,380
What? You lied about your age too?

558
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,810
Why do you have so many secrets?
What's true about you?

559
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,200
It's not like I wanted to lie about it.

560
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,240
At times,

561
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,050
I also get confused about who I am.

562
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,990
[These are his memories and love.]

563
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,430
[But why does this make my heart ache?]

564
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,140
[Who do I think I am?]

565
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,250
-My gosh! Goodness.
-My gosh.

566
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,090
What was that? A snake?

567
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,490
Where? Where is it?

568
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,680
Over there.

569
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,590
I knew I'd see a snake here.

570
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,390
This is bad. Come here.

571
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,950
Why are you sitting so close to me?

572
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,170
Is this one of your jokes again?

573
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,330
Am I a guy
who always jokes around with you?

574
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,250
If it's not a joke,

575
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,290
why do you keep doing this to me?

576
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,650
Well, I don't know when it began,

577
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,070
but I like you.

578
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,340
Geun-young, aren't you going to get up?
You must've been tired.

579
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,280
Goodness.

580
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,180
It's so great to sleep at home.

581
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,820
So? Did you get to bed early last night?

582
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,690
Yes, I fell asleep right away.

583
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,420
So where is he?

584
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,140
He's sweeping the yard.
It's a perfect job for him.

585
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,170
What? Sweeping the yard?

586
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,040
Why did you make him sweep the yard?

587
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,590
You're all very odd.

588
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,010
Plato is a perfect read for the morning.

589
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,020
You're finally up.

590
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,260
That's my dad's jacket.

591
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,480
Oh, Ms. Jang let me borrow it
because it got colder.

592
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,310
Anyway, don't you think
she's discriminative?

593
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,940
She makes the guest wake up early,

594
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,450
but left her daughter to sleep in.

595
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,250
I like how consistent she is.

596
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,530
You didn't have to do it.

597
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,550
You never do what you don't want to do.

598
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,020
She said she won't let me eat
if I don't do this.

599
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,490
It's cold. Go back inside.

600
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,320
What is this?
Is today a holiday? Is this a party?

601
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,160
You never make these for me.

602
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,860
A guy should eat this much
and be stronger.

603
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,460
-No one eats this much these days.
-Should I take some off?

604
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,360
No, ma'am. Thank you.

605
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,280
Right.

606
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,660
You should eat first, Father.

607
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,150
Why am I your father?

608
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,340
Then how should I address you?

609
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,200
I thought it'd be impolite
to call you Mr. Lee.

610
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,820
I think he's right.
Father sounds better than Mr. Lee.

611
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,420
-Eat up.
-Don't address me. Just don't.

612
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,900
All right, now. Let's eat.

613
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,660
-Here.
-Thank you.

614
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,290
Let's see.

615
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,090
Eat the green onion.

616
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,660
-The crab shell.
-Right.

617
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,290
Father gave me some green onion.

618
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,090
-Green onion and chicken.
-Goodness.

619
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,290
-He's so witty.
-That's good.

620
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,120
I keep calling In-hyung,

621
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,460
but she won't pick up.

622
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,670
You said she isn't home either.

623
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,260
I'm sorry.

624
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,430
You're her manager,
yet you don't know where she is?

625
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,870
Go look everywhere
and see if you can find her.

626
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,450
Yes, sir.

627
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,750
Darn it.

628
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,110
How did I do?

629
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,610
Great.

630
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,990
[Jae-joon]

631
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,900
[Jae-joon]

632
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,640
They didn't think it was bad.

633
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,280
Then may I listen again?

634
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,470
Sure.

635
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,160
I need to take this call.

636
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,900
[Who-joon's single]

637
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,930
[Who-joon's single]

638
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,040
Make sure you eat well.

639
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,820
I packed some sesame oil too,
so don't let it leak.

640
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,140
You didn't have to.

641
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,220
If you want some, take hers.
I packed enough for two.

642
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:07,060
Wait, aren't people on TV
too picky to eat something like this?

643
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,610
No way, I love it.

644
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,730
Especially your tteokbokki.

645
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,320
I only let you off
because you aren't my kid.

646
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,110
Don't you ever let my daughter
get involved in something unfair.

647
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,530
-All right.
-Okay.

648
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,910
If you be good to her,
I might make something for you again.

649
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,590
If you get my daughter in trouble,
I'll break the antenna off the TV station,

650
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,970
as well as your two legs.

651
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,250
I'll remember that, Father.

652
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,200
Thank you, Father.
I'll come back for more tteokbokki.

653
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,530
-Who says you can?
-Me.

654
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:02,190
Your mother is such a loving woman.
I still feel full.

655
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,760
It's not that she's loving.

656
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:09,540
I think she fed you a lot
to avenge me since you were so mean.

657
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,150
No way. You don't give someone
that much fish fillet and meat

658
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,650
for someone you hate.

659
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,770
In the end, she fell for me too.

660
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,140
I'm starting to get jealous of you.

661
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,000
How can you be so confident?

662
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,260
You should have some of that confidence.
You deserve to.

663
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,820
People in your village have
a high level of trust in you.

664
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:33,260
I was afraid you were an outcast
even at here,

665
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,510
but I was the mean one. I got scared.
It's a whole village of anti-fans.

666
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,920
Why is the car slowing down?

667
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,610
-Are we out of gas?
-No way. One second.

668
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,240
We need to call for help.

669
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,610
Wait, I can't.

670
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,540
Can you move your feet?

671
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,450
I know the button is
somewhere around here.

672
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,020
-Is it over here?
-Should I get off?

673
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,650
No, you can stay.

674
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,330
I think it was somewhere back here.

675
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,620
-That one?
-Is that it?

676
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,860
Can you move your hand?

677
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,130
It was somewhere around here.

678
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,330
Somewhere around here.

679
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,820
Why?

680
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,280
-You did that on purpose.
-I saw the button here somewhere.

681
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:37,450
-I need to take another look.
-You're really sly.

682
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,150
My gosh.

683
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,450
Yes, I'm on the highway now.

684
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,560
So where exactly are you?

685
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,890
So you were out of gas.

686
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,440
You weren't looking for anything.

687
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,480
Things could've got worse
if something else was wrong.

688
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,900
Wait, isn't this situation

689
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:59,540
the same as the mistake
Ji-hyang made long ago?

690
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,730
That one?

691
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,540
He told you about that?

692
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,520
That was unnecessary.

693
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,520
Why? After he told me that,

694
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:15,470
I thought you were
a better person than I thought.

695
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,400
So you went and gave that fan a ride?

696
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,480
You should've told me.

697
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,120
You know, I was being nice to a fan.

698
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,860
Goodness, what a nice celebrity you are.

00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:19,770
It wasn't her!

878
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,250
See? Isn't that much better?

879
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,850
Do you sometimes shout out like this
when you get frustrated?

880
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,770
But it's not as good
when you do this alone.

881
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,970
You have to do it with someone.

882
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,590
Well, I guess

883
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,520
you can do this with me from now on.

884
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,350
I'm hungry now that I feel better.

885
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,470
Do you want to eat something?

886
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:00,120
Okay. I was too concerned about you
that I didn't eat anything today.

887
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,310
Let's go.

888
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,030
Thank you.

889
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,720
Don't cry, you crybaby.

890
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,690
Someone's calling you.

891
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,670
No, I'm not picking up.

892
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,740
Come on, pick it up.

893
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:35,540
Who's calling at this hour?

894
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,420
[Stranger]

895
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,440
What are you doing? Pick it up.

896
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:47,950
Okay.

897
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:51,030
One second.

898
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,730
-What is...
[-Are you Oh In-hyung's guardian?]

899
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,360
[This is the hospital.]
