you were concerned that I know.

[Come back.]

695
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,060
[I guess you can still hold out.]

696
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,820
It was you.

697
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,650
It felt like I abandoned you,

698
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:21,990
so I was very sorry.

699
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,980
I think I know what to do now.

700
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,370
Joon.

701
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:18,790
Are you sure about this?

702
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,020
This is the way to protect
everyone I love.

703
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,440
In-hyung, Jae-joon,

704
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,690
and above all,

705
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,090
Geun-young, who's tormented
just because she loves me.

706
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,170
Okay. Let's go inside.

707
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,810
Did you have to take things that far?

708
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:15,070
Why do you think it was me?

709
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,530
Because that's who you are.

710
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,540
And what makes you so confident before me?

711
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,760
At the very least,

712
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:40,100
both Joon and I
aren't cowardly like you are.

713
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,040
Cowardly?

714
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,780
Yet Joon wasn't cowardly
for abandoning you and leaving?

715
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,650
You started dating me
even though you like him.

716
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,690
So why did you get involved with my life?

717
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,860
Why?

718
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:59,460
Why? Why did you get into my life?

719
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,060
[Who-joon Holds
an Urgent Press Conference]

720
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,740
[I stand before you today to apologize
to everyone from the bottom of my heart.]

721
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:29,300
[I've always received
much more love than I deserved.]

722
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:33,480
But I'm not anybody special
like you thought I was.

723
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,420
I'm not a musical genius
who studied in the U.S.

724
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,600
or a son of an affluent family
who's highly involved in charity works.

725
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,290
All these charming aspects of my life

726
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,520
were lies created
to make Who-joon seem special.

727
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:57,680
[I deeply apologize to everyone
who showed me so much love]

728
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:57,590
["Who-joon Holds
an Urgent Press Conference"]

729
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,030
with all of their hearts.

730
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,640
If it hadn't been for you...

731
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,820
Everything is over.

732
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,000
You knew better than anyone

733
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,230
how desperate I've been.

734
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,590
Do you feel better

735
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,720
now that I crashed down?

736
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:50,650
It's over.

737
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:54,870
I'll disappear from your life.

738
00:58:58,220 --> 00:58:59,320
No.

739
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:04,470
I don't believe a single word you say.

740
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,330
How about this?

741
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,080
In-hyung.

742
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:22,730
And I know many people are interested
in my relationship with Ms. Oh In-hyung.

743
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,230
Yes, we had a special relationship.

744
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,100
But she became a victim
to many misunderstandings and rumors

745
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,560
that she used me for her success.

746
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,850
I hope Ms. Oh will not suffer

747
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,620
from any speculations or rumors.

748
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:45,650
I came a long way with the wings I got
thanks to those lies.

749
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:51,280
I realized I had nowhere to return to
with the wings made of lies.

750
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:55,330
I admit to everything as reported,
and I will gladly accept any decisions

751
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,360
you make at your disposal.

752
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:25,960

and Oh In-hyung's accident?]
