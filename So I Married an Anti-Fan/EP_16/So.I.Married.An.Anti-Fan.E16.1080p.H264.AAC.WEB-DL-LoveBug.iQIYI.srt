going to join him too.

529
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,590
This is a gift for you.
Should I put it over there?

530
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,950
-Yes, okay.
-Okay.

531
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,150
We'll take a tour around.

532
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:25,590
What's going on?

533
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:28,750
She acted as if she'd kill him
if he comes back.

534
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,010
She'd be so wasted when she called us out,

535
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,640
but now this. Goodness.

536
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,970
So what about you two?

537
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,250
What are you talking about?

538
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,350
Looking great!

539
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,770
-Congrats!
-You two look wonderful!

540
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,380
Is Ji-hyang not here yet?

541
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,800
-No, I don't think so.
-I see.

542
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,260
And now, we'll have someone
come out and sing

543
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,760
for this beautiful newlywed couple.

544
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,670
We prepared a very special event
just for the bride.

545
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,870
Do you want to find out?
A big hand, please!

546
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,500
Hey, this is Joon's song.

547
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,810
♫ If I just stared at you,
only to turn around in regret ♫

548
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:44,080
♫ Then what would have happened? ♫

549
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:49,620
♫ Would I be in a different world ♫

550
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,760
♫ With someone else who isn't you? ♫

551
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,680
♫ I can't even imagine ♫

552
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,860
♫ Having someone else by my side ♫

553
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,990
♫ When it rains, I'll be your umbrella ♫

554
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,830
♫ When the sun burns, I'll be your shade ♫

555
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,860
♫ You and I walk side by side ♫

556
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:21,080
♫ Things can't get any better than this ♫

557
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,380
♫ The things I couldn't say to you ♫

558
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:27,200
Now, look at them
as if you're all jealous.

559
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,470
-Okay.
-Okay.

560
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,860
-Kiss, kiss.
-Kiss, kiss.

561
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:34,630
-Kiss, kiss.
-Kiss, kiss.

562
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,090
-Kiss, kiss.
-Kiss, kiss.

563
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,740
Who's going to take the bouquet?

564
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:44,930
Right.

565
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,490
Geun-young.

566
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:49,950
Me?

567
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,930
No, I'm not taking it.

568
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,830
-Come on, go.
-Take it!

569
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,520
Did I keep you waiting?

570
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,430
How did you make it here?

571
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,760
Surprise!

572
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,390
-It's Who-joon.
-My gosh!

573
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,930
-No way.
-My gosh.

574
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:37,990
-This is huge.
-He's here.

575
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,580
My gosh.

576
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,910
I ended up taking the bouquet.

577
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:44,810
Who-joon!

578
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:49,650
You're so handsome!

579
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,930
My gosh.

580
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:03,910
[The next song is a song
that became a huge hit on the internet.]

581
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,840
[The song drew attention]

582
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,850

by the world-renowned star, Who-joon.]

-Thank you, thank you.

00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,880
Fish cake?

586
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:45,710
You can have it.

587
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,180
No, it's yours.

588
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,880
I like the soup better.

589
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,480
It's because you don't know
how you're supposed to drink soju.

590
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,160
Then you'll have to teach me.

591
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,890
Hey, really?

592
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,600
[Open this door]

593

What's going on?

594
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,900
The three of you are here,

595
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,190
but you only ordered two servings.

596
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,450
-Mr. Bae!
-My gosh!

597
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,210
I got some more for you.

598
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,090

599
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,580

601
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,600
This is...

602
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,310
produced by Joon.

603
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,480
What a relief.

604
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:22,900
Thank you, Jae-joon.

605
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,870

-Over here.
-Finger hearts, please.

610

-Thank you!
-Look over here!

611
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,340
-I have no makeup on.
-And you look even better.

612
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:19,840
-I was lying.
-What?

613
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:21,770
Where are we going?

614
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:23,660
Where should we go?
Or should we stay home?

615
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,200
No, my house is a mess.

616
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,490
Then Han River?

617
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,680
Sounds great.

618

Your hands are cold.

Hello?

620
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:32,260
You didn't even call on the day
your boyfriend goes on a business trip.

621
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:35,380
[I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was already time.]

-Hey, Ms. Reporter.

623

No, Ms. Writer.

624
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,960
You're awfully indifferent about Who-joon
just because you aren't a reporter now.

625
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,500
You got me.

626
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,830
You're coming back tomorrow, right?

627
