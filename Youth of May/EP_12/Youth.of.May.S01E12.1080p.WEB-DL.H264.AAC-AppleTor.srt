1
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:14,246
Your mind keeps going back
to May of that year.

2
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:16,947
That's not strange at all.

3
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,687
If you lose your favorite umbrella,

4
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:26,856
you think of it whenever it rains.

5
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,106
It feels even worse...

6
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,407
if the season
you lost your loved one...

7
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,877
comes back every year.

8
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:52,487
It's only natural...

9
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:58,157
that our minds return to that day...

10
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:00,256
as if it were yesterday.

11
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:06,996
Sir, I'm sorry to disturb you
during a session.

12
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,687
Hello.

13
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:30,386
Did you get the text message?

14
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,297
They found her.

15
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,976
(Episode 12, The First May)

16
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,736
Don't kill me.

17
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:22,206
Let me live.

18
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:28,486
Over here! There's a kid here!

19
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:46,997
My goodness. Don't.

20
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:48,837
Don't look at what I'm writing.

21
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:52,437
The writing's so small
that I can't even see it.

22
00:02:53,536 --> 00:02:56,446
We're going to read it
out to each other anyway.

23
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:57,976
What's the point
in writing so small?

24
00:02:57,976 --> 00:03:00,317
Can't we skip the prayer?

25
00:03:00,317 --> 00:03:02,347
Marriage vows are enough.

26
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:07,187
We have no officiator or guests.

27
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,187
And we didn't prepare
outfits, wedding gifts, or anything.

28
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,897
We should exchange something
to commemorate our marriage.

29
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:14,997
I'm useless at writing essays.

30
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:17,897
I didn't tell you to write an essay.

31
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:20,036
Just write what you want.

32
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:21,397
I bet it'll all come true.

33
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:25,206
The Lord will take pity on us
because we're penniless.

34
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:29,177
Why aren't you
writing out your prayer?

35
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,147
I memorized mine already.

36
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:33,747
There's a prayer I say every day.

37
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,587
What is it about?

38
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,657
If I die,

39
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:45,326
I want you to be buried with me.

40
00:03:46,157 --> 00:03:47,696
As in buried alive with you?

41
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:48,927
Pray for something else.

42
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,837
You said the prayers will come true.

43
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:54,497
Then you can pray
that you won't be buried alive.

44
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:57,136
Let's see whose prayer
is more effective.

45
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:14,956
What are you doing in my office?

46
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:29,266
We got a tip that
your son is closely connected...

47
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:33,206
to the main suspect
of this incident.

48
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,846
I think you are mistaken.

49
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:39,317
The suspect only said...

50
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:42,547
Stop. You can defend yourself
during the investigation.

51
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,787
An inspector...

52
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:48,156
should always stay objective.

53
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:50,956
Until the investigation is over,

54
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,756
I will take charge
of the steering wheel.

55
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:12,817
Next, the bride and groom
will say their vows.

56
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,547
The groom may go first.

57
00:05:15,846 --> 00:05:16,886
Okay!

58
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:22,727
I, Hwang Hee Tae,

59
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,727
accept Kim Myeong Hee as my wife.

60
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:28,427
Forever, with love and respect,

61
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:30,627
I will cherish her.

62
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:34,266
I solemnly swear before the Lord.

63
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:39,607
Does the bride, Kim Myeong Hee,

64
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,377
who's known to be terrible
with words,

65
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:42,506
swear the same?

66
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:43,877
Yes.

67
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,446
Your voice isn't loud enough!

68
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:48,346
Yes!

69
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:50,146
Very well.

70
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:54,357
Finally, the bride and groom
will exchange prayers.

71
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:56,727
I heard that the bride...

72
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:59,297
was tormented
by the agony of creation.

73
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:02,026
Shall we hear your prayer?

74
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:04,966
The groom can go first
since he memorized his prayer.

75
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,206
Okay, then.

76
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:21,477
Lord.

77
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:25,216
Whatever hardship may befall us,

78
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:28,326
we will not let go of these hands
we finally get to hold.

79
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:30,057
I pray we can overcome the hardship.

80
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:34,656
More than anything,
I pray you give me...

81
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:37,667
worse pains instead of Myeong Hee.

82
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:43,167
I pray sincerely in the Lord's name.

83
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:46,377
Amen.

84
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,247
Amen.

85
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:02,927
Darn it. My prayer's sloppy.

86
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,896
You said you'd pray
that I be buried alive.

87
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,107
- I, Kim Myeong Hee,
- Myeong Hee!

88
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:21,846
Myeong Hee.

89
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,977
Just now, your father...

90
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:40,026
Myeong Hee.

91
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:54,237
No.

92
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:57,206
It's not my father.

93
00:07:57,506 --> 00:08:00,646
Hee Tae. Look at that.

94
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:03,516
My father isn't that short.

95
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:47,057
Father.

96
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:50,797
Father. Open your eyes.

97
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,067
Stop teasing me and open your eyes.

98
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,567
Why are you lying here
on the cold ground?

99
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:01,637
Father. Father, wake up.

100
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,547
Open your eyes right now!

101
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:11,986
You can't... You can't do this.

102
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:15,826
To the end...

103
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:19,956
Why must you give me a hard time
to the very end?

104
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:27,137
No, no, Father.
I can't let you go like this.

105
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:28,537
Father.

106
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:32,206
Father. Let's go home.

107
00:09:32,736 --> 00:09:35,246
Let's go home, Father.

108
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:46,287
Father.

109
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:48,417
Father...

110
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:52,897
(Kim Sung Wook, 18)

111
00:09:52,897 --> 00:09:54,856
(We are looking for our son.)

112
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:56,096
So does this mean...

113
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,466
our son hasn't died...

114
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:01,667
but has been arrested?

115
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:06,177
Oh, dear. Honey, he's alive.

116
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,846
But didn't you say
you were arrested with him?

117
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,917
How were you released?

118
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,287
I was... Well...

119
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:36,167
Soo Chan.

120
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:40,507
If it's because you feel guilty...

121
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,576
Three days.

122
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,446
The world I believed in...

123
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:47,147
crumbled in just three days.

124
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,986
I was dragged away
and treated like an animal.

125
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,787
When I was released alone,
thanks to Mr. Hwang,

126
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,356
and lied down in my bed,

127
00:10:56,226 --> 00:10:57,986
do you know what I thought?

128
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,336
I felt comfortable.

129
00:11:08,637 --> 00:11:09,966
I didn't even know...

130
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:12,437
if the people who were arrested
with me were dead or alive.

131
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:15,576
But I felt so cozy and comfortable.

132
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,246
That's why...

133
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:23,647
I feel ashamed.

134
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:27,057
I'm ashamed of lying down, eating,

135
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:30,356
and even wearing this kind of suit
and breathing this air.

136
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,826
I feel like a total coward.

137
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,397
I feel ashamed to death.

138
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,267
Soo Chan.

139
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:48,846
We may not be able
to change anything,

140
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:51,976
but there are things we can do.

141
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:11,897
I'll go...

142
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,297
look for a way to contact Naju...

143
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:16,407
and ask about the funeral procedure.

144
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,106
You stay here...

145
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:25,047
beside your father.

146
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:30,887
I'll take care of
all the necessary arrangements.

147
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:41,726
(From Kim Hyun Chul,
To Kim Myeong Hee)

148
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:51,807
(Regular savings account)

149
00:12:56,177 --> 00:12:59,576
(Current Balance)

150
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:25,106
This is the account where I saved
all the money you've sent me.

151
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:28,876
It's under your name,

152
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:32,976
so you can take your seal
and withdraw it anytime.

153
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:37,817
Myeong Soo said this to me one day.

154
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,787
That the runner who runs
way in the front...

155
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,187
does nothing but block the wind
for the others.

156
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:46,856
He said it was your loss
if you stood in the front...

157
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:47,956
from the beginning.

158
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:54,267
Perhaps, I lived my life...

159
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,807
- Let's go and...
- always in the front,

160
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:58,836
blocking the wind
with my whole body.

161
00:13:59,437 --> 00:14:01,576
I was that runner
who was in the front.

162
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:09,486
I was afraid you'd be hit
by the wind like me.

163
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:12,887
What if your wings were hurt
from the hardships of this world?

164
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,216
I hoped you wouldn't stand
in the front like me...

165
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:16,986
and always tried...

166
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:18,897
Father, I didn't do anything wrong.

167
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:21,096
to hold you back.

168
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,326
But your wings...

169
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:28,437
were strong enough to endure
any kind of wind.

170
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,907
If I just let you be,

171
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:33,937
you would have ridden the wind...

172
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,076
and flew up high into the sky.

173
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,047
Since everything that happened
wasn't your fault,

174
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:44,346
just leave it behind with me.

175
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,517
And from now on,

176
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:50,027
let your wings carry you...

177
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:51,887
freely...

178
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:54,996
wherever you want to go.

179
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,307
She's currently at Sangmugwan
with your son.

180
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:11,976
Don't send our own men.

181
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,376
Use one of our spies in the militia
to get rid of her.

182
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,746
Make it look like
an internal conflict broke out...

183
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:18,246
and do it near
the government building.

184
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:19,817
And make sure...

185
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:23,226
you kill her in front of my son.

186
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,927
I'll do that, sir.

187
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:28,657
Oh, she had a little kid with her.

188
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:29,897
What shall I do about him?

189
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,937
Get rid of him too
if the timing is right...

190
00:15:35,397 --> 00:15:36,437
What do you want?

191
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,476
The housekeeper...

192
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:47,746
asked if you're going to eat.

193
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:51,517
I'm working right now.

194
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:53,157
Tell her I'll eat later.

195
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:55,086
Okay.

196
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,866
Eat up now.

197
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:11,706
Here. Try it.

198
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:14,336
Hurry up and eat.

199
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,267
Excuse me.

200
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,966
Are you Kim Myeong Hee?

201
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,076
Yes.

202
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:49,647
I have an urgent message for you.

203
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:56,746
Mr. Hwang Hee Tae asked for you
to come outside immediately.

204
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:02,427
(Message from Hwang Hee Tae,
Come to the service center now.)

205
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,086
Hee Tae asked for me?

206
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,927
Do you know why?

207
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:07,496
I'm just delivering the message.

208
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:11,396
Since it's the service center,

209
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:13,866
I guess it's about the funeral.

210
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:30,086
(Divorce Agreement)

211
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:31,146
Divorce?

212
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,017
Are you insane?

213
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:36,156
I'm as sane as I can be.

214
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:44,166
I won't put up with this nonsense.

215
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:49,067
I'll mail you the papers again.

216
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,836
If you want to talk to me,
contact Attorney Choi from now on.

217
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,106
Jung Tae...

218
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:56,406
will go with me.

219
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,517
If you're going to leave, go alone.

220
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,186
I'll never let you have custody.

221
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,757
Then let's ask Jung Tae to choose
who he'll live with.

222
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,426
What? Choose?

223
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:17,596
Jung Tae, come downstairs.

224
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:22,666
You better stop crossing the line.

225
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,037
Jung Tae. Hwang Jung Tae!

226
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:29,076
Ma'am. Your son...

227
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:31,176
left urgently a while ago.

228
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:38,646
What do you want?

229
00:18:54,396 --> 00:18:55,596
Excuse me.

230
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:59,136
Did you see a woman sitting there?

231
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:03,507
Did you miss each other?

232
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,416
She left as soon as
she received the message.

233
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:08,547
What message?

234
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:12,116
You sent her a message
to come to the service center.

235
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:27,666
Ms. Kim Myeong Hee?
Are you here to see Hwang Hee Tae?

236
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:30,166
Yes. What is going on?

237
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,666
The militia...

238
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:33,477
got the long-distance calls
working again.

239
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:34,777
Let me show you the way.

240
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:38,146
Go straight ahead
and turn right, okay?

241
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:00,436
What in the world?

242
00:20:00,537 --> 00:20:02,537
Let go! Let go, you little brat!

243
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:04,537
- I can't.
- Jung Tae!

244
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,906
- Hey, let go.
- Myeong Hee, run!

245
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,676
- Let go!
- Don't do that.

246
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:10,846
I said, let go!

247
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:14,176
Jung Tae!

248
00:20:41,277 --> 00:20:44,576
- Jung Tae.
- Jung Tae. Jung Tae!

249
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,747
Who did this?
Who said you could shoot the kid?

250
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:53,186
- Who said you could shoot my son?
- Is it your doing again?

251
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:55,817
Is this what you did
for your family?

252
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:58,487
What have you done now?

253
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,896
- Jung Tae.
- Don't come any closer!

254
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:06,096
Don't you lay a finger on my son.

255
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:12,537
Hee Tae.

256
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,146
- Did you bring your car?
- Yes.

257
00:21:17,146 --> 00:21:18,477
Let's take him
to the hospital first.

258
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:21,076
Jung Tae. Jung Tae, can you hear me?

259
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:22,277
Can you get up?

260
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,457
Jung Tae.

261
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:30,186
Jung Tae. Jung Tae...

262
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:58,346
The orphan is not me but you.

263
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:03,227
No one will choose you
to be their family.

264
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:25,576
Soo Ryeon, get the cart.

265
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,646
Load them all.

266
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:46,197
I have another rat
in my storeroom now.

267
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,936
Father.

268
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:54,676
Did you two decide...

269
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:56,247
to consider me a living corpse now?

270
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,676
Father, I can explain. Right now...

271
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:04,487
It was my idea.

272
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,757
When I was little,

273
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:11,926
you said this to me all the time.

274
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,757
"It's pointless to prosper alone."

275
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:18,497
"We should grow together
with the City of Gwangju."

276
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:21,967
I admired you for that,

277
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:25,166
and it really made me proud
of our company, Changhwa Industrial.

278
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:30,376
If you ask me,

279
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:35,277
I think it's time, Father.

280
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:49,997
What can you possibly do
with a cartful of supplies?

281
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:51,626
Open all our storerooms.

282
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,136
Take everything we have.

283
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:57,106
Father.

284
00:24:27,497 --> 00:24:29,666
Where's my sister?

285
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:30,936
You're awake.

286
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,307
Your sister went to see Hee Tae
for a second.

287
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:44,947
My goodness.
You still can't reach Mr. Park?

288
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,416
The phone lines are cut off,
and the roads are blocked.

289
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,856
There's no way we can reach someone
outside the city.

290
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:52,626
Then will she be cremated
right away?

291
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:54,197
There won't even be a funeral?

292
00:24:54,197 --> 00:24:55,757
What can we do?

293
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:58,767
Dead bodies are still pouring in.

294
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:01,567
We can't keep her here much longer.

295
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,336
Poor woman.

296
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:07,737
She can't even see her family
one last time.

297
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:09,977
I feel so sorry for her.

298
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:11,146
Mother.

299
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:13,447
Grandma.

300
00:25:23,787 --> 00:25:26,457
Excuse me.
Do you still have the map?

301
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:28,856
- What?
- The map...

302
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:30,666
you gave my father the other day.

303
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,767
The map? What do you need it for?

304
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,896
Excuse me.
Can I report a missing person here?

305
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:38,166
- No, not here.
- Okay.

306
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:39,477
Just a second.

307
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:43,307
Why don't you try
at the provincial government office?

308
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:44,977
Okay. Thank you.

309
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:54,386
Shouldn't you be there
when Jung Tae comes out of surgery?

310
00:25:54,717 --> 00:25:56,626
The doctor said he'd pull through.

311
00:25:56,626 --> 00:25:57,987
Once your father...

312
00:25:58,086 --> 00:25:59,227
Myeong Hee.

313
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:01,656
Myeong Soo...

314
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,366
Myeong Soo has gone missing.

315
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:08,997
What?

316
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:21,676
I think he went this way.

317
00:26:23,346 --> 00:26:26,416
But I'll go and check that way too,
just in case.

318
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,487
Stay away from this area.

319
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:33,326
There are soldiers everywhere.

320
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:48,977
- Myeong Soo.
- Myeong Soo.

321
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:52,576
- Kim Myeong Soo.
- Kim Myeong Soo.

322
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:56,247
- Myeong Soo.
- Myeong Soo.

323
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,386
- Myeong Soo.
- Kim Myeong Soo.

324
00:27:00,616 --> 00:27:02,217
Gosh, where did he go?

325
00:27:03,057 --> 00:27:04,227
Myeong Hee.

326
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,537
The road splits here.

327
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:25,176
I'll check this way.
You go that way.

328
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:27,416
Wait, you can't go that way.

329
00:27:27,876 --> 00:27:30,017
It's the area Sun Min said
we should stay away from.

330
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:32,017
But it's not marked
on Myeong Soo's map.

331
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,557
We don't know where he may be.

332
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:35,957
Then I'll go that way.

333
00:27:36,057 --> 00:27:37,586
You go this way.

334
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,767
Did you already forget
my wedding prayer?

335
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:49,537
I'll never leave you behind
and put myself in danger.

336
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:54,977
I'll just go have a quick look
and see if he's there.

337
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:01,517
Five minutes.

338
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:04,717
We'll meet here again
in five minutes.

339
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,876
Five minutes, okay?

340
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:30,707
I'll see you here in five minutes.

341
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:33,277
Okay?

342
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:43,727
I'm sorry.

343
00:28:47,197 --> 00:28:48,757
He's my family too.

344
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:01,237
See you later.

345
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,517
Myeong Soo.

346
00:29:07,717 --> 00:29:08,876
Kim Myeong Soo.

347
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:20,934
Hands up.

348
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:39,813
Search thoroughly.

349
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:03,743
Go ahead and wait for me in Naju.

350
00:31:04,073 --> 00:31:06,273
I'll be there soon.

351
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,674
I don't want to.

352
00:31:09,543 --> 00:31:10,983
I'm not going alone.

353
00:31:11,184 --> 00:31:12,414
Kim Myeong Soo.

354
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:15,053
Father promised he'd come back,
but he didn't.

355
00:31:16,053 --> 00:31:19,283
Come with me.
Please come with me, Myeong Hee.

356
00:31:21,854 --> 00:31:24,223
It's more dangerous
if you stay with me.

357
00:31:24,894 --> 00:31:27,834
I'm a nurse,
so no one will attack me.

358
00:31:28,063 --> 00:31:31,233
I'll explain to the soldiers
and catch up with you.

359
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:35,273
On the count of three,
run as fast as you can to Naju.

360
00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:38,404
- Do you understand?
- No.

361
00:31:39,174 --> 00:31:40,674
I don't want to.

362
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:42,313
Little bear.

363
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:44,884
Listen to me.

364
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:47,854
I'll catch up with you soon.

365
00:31:56,253 --> 00:31:57,364
I promise.

366
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:01,463
Are you sure?

367
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:04,364
Are you sure
you'll catch up with me?

368
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:10,473
When I make a promise,
I never break it.

369

You know that, right?

370
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:47,144
On the count of three,
run as fast as you can.

371
00:32:49,213 --> 00:32:50,313
One.

372
00:32:52,283 --> 00:32:53,354
Two.

373
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:56,114
Three, go.

374
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:15,473
What are you doing? Go get that boy!

375
00:33:16,404 --> 00:33:18,674
I'll... I'll go get him.

376
00:33:21,844 --> 00:33:23,844
That stupid moron.
There he goes again.

377
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:49,404
No.

378
00:34:04,184 --> 00:34:06,894
Run. Now!

379
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,924
What are you waiting for? Run! Now!

380
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:55,403
What's with this punk?

381
00:34:55,903 --> 00:34:57,403
He's a medical student
at Seoul National University.

382
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:59,403
Why is a student from SNU here?

383
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:02,874
I'm from Gwangju.

384
00:35:03,544 --> 00:35:05,513
I'm visiting my family.

385
00:35:07,454 --> 00:35:08,584
Hey.

386
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,584
Cut it out.

387
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:13,394
You came here to lead a rebellion,
didn't you?

388
00:35:14,193 --> 00:35:15,524
That's not true.

389
00:35:15,894 --> 00:35:18,124
I'm really from Gwangju.

390
00:35:18,124 --> 00:35:19,863
Check my ID card.

391
00:35:19,863 --> 00:35:20,894
Hey.

392
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:23,863
Just shoot him.

393
00:35:56,394 --> 00:35:57,564

394
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:08,374
Yes, it's you.

395
00:36:08,943 --> 00:36:10,613
The one who went to SNU
with top marks.

396
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:11,843
Hwang Hee Tae.

397
00:36:11,843 --> 00:36:13,144
You know him?

398
00:36:13,144 --> 00:36:14,814
He's from my neighborhood.

399
00:36:15,414 --> 00:36:17,024
I'm from Gwangju.

400
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:21,124
Get up.

401
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:28,863
Where are you going?

402
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:32,363
The order is to shoot any rebel
to death immediately.

403
00:36:36,303 --> 00:36:39,443
Why don't we arrest him first
to be sure?

404
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,073
We'll take him with us
and question him thoroughly.

405
00:36:50,723 --> 00:36:51,883
That way.

406
00:37:03,964 --> 00:37:05,934
If you want to live, keep walking.

407
00:37:06,464 --> 00:37:07,874
Don't look back.

408
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:17,144
Hey, did you go through her pockets?

409
00:37:18,484 --> 00:37:20,184
I'll do it now.

410
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:22,414

that reveals her identity.

411
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:16,334

My brother, Myeong Soo...

414
00:38:27,714 --> 00:38:29,314
Is he alive?

They sang in perfect harmony.

419
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:37,243
Yes. It must be the clear air.

420
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:39,644
Sure. Leave one with me.

421
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:42,573
We're down to the last entry
of MBC's University Song Festival.

423

Representing Seoul,
it's the band "Sharp."

424
00:41:46,513 --> 00:41:49,484
- Yonsei University...
- They're all pretty good this year.

425
00:41:49,484 --> 00:41:51,754
- Engineering student...
- Who do you think will win?

426
00:41:51,754 --> 00:41:55,093
I bet the med students will win.

427
00:41:55,093 --> 00:41:57,693
- Do you?
- They were very good.

428
00:41:57,693 --> 00:41:59,763
- Did you like that song?
- Contestant number 18.

I only let you off
because you're a woman.

439

Do you have a death wish?

440

- Oh, no.
- What should we do?

00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:37,223
I'm not obligated to do something
that isn't a nurse's duty.

that he wants to tell me in person?

with Hwang Hee Tae.

545
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:15,370
Lord,

546
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:18,140
if something unexpected happens...

547
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:21,410
and we have to let go
of each other's hands,

548
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,080
please don't let the sorrow...

549
00:54:24,149 --> 00:54:27,249
overwhelm the lives
of those left behind.

550
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:31,790
Even if the tears we shed...

551
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,729
fill up to our chins,

552
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,359
please don't let us drown...

553
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,669
and give us the power and courage...

554
00:54:43,269 --> 00:54:46,640
to swim safely throughout this life.

555
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:16,299
(As always...)

556
00:55:16,299 --> 00:55:18,299
As always, May has come.

557
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,140
This year is the 41st May...

558
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:24,910
since I lost you, Myeong Hee.

559
00:55:33,649 --> 00:55:35,350
All this time,

560
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,060
my life felt like swimming
during a rising tide.

561
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,260
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't move forward,

562
00:55:45,899 --> 00:55:48,370
and I even tried
to let myself drown.

563
00:56:02,649 --> 00:56:04,410
But when I woke up,

564
00:56:06,019 --> 00:56:07,879
that tide had pushed me back...

565
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,749
to that May inside my heart.

566
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,990
It felt so cruel
that I lived in resentment.

567
00:56:28,169 --> 00:56:30,169
For a very long time,

568
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,140
I lived in regret...

569
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,879
and thought about
what could've been.

570
00:56:35,149 --> 00:56:38,680
If I hadn't gone to Gwangju
in May of that year,

571
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:43,390
if I hadn't met you in Gwangju,

572
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:48,330
if I hadn't let go of your hand
in those woods,

573
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:51,359
would you still be alive?

574
00:56:52,729 --> 00:56:53,930
But...

575
00:56:54,629 --> 00:56:58,439
on this 41st May
when you've finally returned,

576
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,810
I now realize that I was the one
who chose to do all of that.

577
00:57:04,979 --> 00:57:06,839
In May of that year,

578
00:57:07,209 --> 00:57:09,350
I chose to go to Gwangju...

579
00:57:11,479 --> 00:57:14,950
and chose to love you
with all my heart.

580
00:57:16,419 --> 00:57:18,390
I prayed every day...

581
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:21,430
that worse pains in life...

582
00:57:21,629 --> 00:57:23,689
would come to me instead of you.

583
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:30,530
If I had been the one to die
in the crossroads of life and death,

584
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,640
and you had lived,

585
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:36,709
you would've experienced
the tides...

586
00:57:36,709 --> 00:57:38,939
that I had experienced
all this time.

587
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,850
The life of the one
who was left behind.

588
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,149
Hence, I've finally realized...

589
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,249
that what I experienced
all this time...

590
00:57:51,019 --> 00:57:53,419
was the Lord's way
of answering my prayer.

591
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,260
Those lonely and painful 41 years...

592
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:00,299
were merely...

593
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,629
my love for you.

594
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:25,019
(To Grandpa Myeong Hee)

595
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,430
The remaining years of my life...

596
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,030
will be an answer to your prayer.

597
00:58:34,999 --> 00:58:36,530
No matter how many more times...

598
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:39,569
the rising tide pushes me
back to that May,

599
00:58:40,939 --> 00:58:43,010
I have you here now.

600
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:46,080
Until we meet again,

601
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:49,310
I will swim against the tide
with all my might.

602
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:38,760
2021. The first May.
From Hwang Hee Tae.

603
00:59:40,129 --> 00:59:46,370
(Thank you for watching
Youth of May.)

604
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:51,169
(Youth of May)

605
00:59:52,709 --> 00:59:56,379
