00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,680
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:24,233
Take your necklace off.

3
00:00:40,313 --> 00:00:42,713
In Bum. In Bum!

4
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:44,283
In Bum!

5
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,522
Are you okay?

6
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:56,363
What happened?

7
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:04,232
Mom. Mom?

8
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:10,242
This is the same as that time.

9
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:30,263
I...

10
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:33,102
killed my son.

11
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:38,302
I killed him.

12
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:44,272
The unrested spirit
didn't choose to leave behind.

13
00:01:45,643 --> 00:01:48,113
She's keeping him from leaving.

14
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:02,533
Ma'am.

15
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:08,173
It's time to let him go.

16
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:15,343
It's my fault.

17
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,322
The sun has been up for ages.

18
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,963
How can you get up this late
and still want to eat?

19
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:40,162
Hey, I'm trying to eat.

20
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:42,333
How dare you glare at me?
You're guilty as charged.

21
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:44,873
It's not like I don't want to get a job.

22
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:47,273
I'm frustrated too.

23
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:49,642
You need to go make money!

24
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:52,642
You'll realize how precious money is
once you start making it.

25
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:54,642
It's always money!

26
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:59,153
Fine. I'll go out and make money.

27
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,583
Gosh. As if.

28
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,922
Yes, go make some money.

29
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:09,933
Don't even think of coming home
until you make some!

30
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:13,063
Only if I didn't
let him go like that...

31
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:14,362
Why is he making a scene this early?

32
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:19,973
Chang Hwa wouldn't have died.

33
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,612
I didn't even...

34
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:30,183
let him eat his breakfast in peace.

35
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:32,382
I didn't know...

36
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:36,723
that would be the last time I see him.

37
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:43,732
I killed my own son.

38
00:03:53,873 --> 00:03:55,112
No.

39
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:01,553
Your son...

40
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:06,123
didn't die because of you.

41
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,352
No.

42
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:13,023
Only if I held him back,

43
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:17,333
only if he didn't go out on that day,

44
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:19,862
he wouldn't have died.

45
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:24,172
I killed him.

46
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,713
It was an accident.

47
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:35,883
It could happen to anybody.

48
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:42,622
It wasn't your fault.

49
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:48,992
My son. My poor Chang Hwa.

50
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:57,133
My poor son.

51
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:11,953
Chang Hwa, my poor son.

52
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:30,073
Chang Hwa!

53
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:40,682
No, my son...

54
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,083
(Changhwa Restaurant)

55
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:52,023
What happened?

56
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:54,862
Why couldn't you finish
the exorcism ritual?

57
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,362
Great job today. You may go.

58
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:59,562
(Daebak Realty)

59
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:17,513
I killed my own son.

60
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:02,792
Mom.

61
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:05,362
Mom.

62
00:07:07,932 --> 00:07:09,102
Mom!

63
00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:12,872
No, right?

64
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,912
It's not me that's
holding you back, is it?

65
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:22,182
That can't be right.

66
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:25,552
I tried doing everything to let you go.

67
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:28,752
No, that can't be right.

68
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,223
How can I be the one stopping her?

69
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,432
My obsession,

70
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:38,093
my regret,

71
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:40,862
and my guilt...

72
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:45,302
have been holding you back?

73
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,643
No.

74
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:54,412
No!

75
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:01,523
I...

76
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:04,552
I killed mom with my two hands,

77
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:10,432
and I'm also the one
who has been stopping her from leaving?

78
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,723
Please give me a little more time, Mom.

79
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:42,333
I need to vanish.

80
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:48,102
Once I disappear,

81
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:52,303
everything will be over then.

82
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:08,223
I've definitely hit the jackpot.

83
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:12,868
But whom should I make a deal with
to get a hefty amount of money?

84
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:15,278
The chairman...

85
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:18,138
will die of shock
if this gets revealed.

86
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:20,878
Should I demand to get
my nightclub back?

87
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,947
No. He can always take it again.

88
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:27,148
Fine. I'll just ask him for cash.

89
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:29,817
It'll be my severance pay.
I'll ask for a huge amount.

90
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:32,388
A humongous amount of cash.

91
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:37,028
He never lets anyone live
if they ever find his weakness.

92
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:39,368
You of all people should know that.

93
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:42,238
That does make sense.

94
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:46,168
Yes. I'll play it safe.

95
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,138
I'll go to our poor In Bum...

96
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:52,148
and ask for just this much.

97
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:54,608
A teeny bit of money.

98
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,918
That's so little, though. Darn it.

99
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:59,648
Boss, must you only choose one of them?

100
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:01,118
What do you mean?

101
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:05,457
You could get a huge load
if you add them together.

102
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:07,227
You son of a gun.

103
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:09,297
You're a genius.

104
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:48,998
Hello, Ms. Hong.

105
00:10:50,597 --> 00:10:51,597
Hey.

106
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:54,868
You're up already?
You should sleep more.

107
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,908
What are you doing here?

108
00:10:58,677 --> 00:11:01,148
Changhwa Restaurant closed,
so we had to move out.

109
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:02,148
So?

110
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:04,547
Let us stay here
only until we find a place.

111
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:05,587
No.

112
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:08,217
- What?
- You're out of business anyway.

113
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:10,557
Be nice and let us use
your spacious house.

114
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:13,158
We'll only stay here until you move out.

115
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:15,498
Two days.

116
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:18,197
Look for a place in the meantime.

117
00:11:18,197 --> 00:11:21,368
Come on. That's too short.

118
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:23,597
As someone who runs a realty,
you should know.

119
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:27,337
Ten days sound nice.

120
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:34,248
Okay. One week.

121
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:35,447
- No more bargaining.
- Sounds good.

122
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:45,528
Did she just give her permission?

123
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:48,658
I expected her to grab us
by the collar and kick us out.

124
00:11:58,268 --> 00:11:59,307
Ms. Hong.

125
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:02,738
I have a question.

126
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:09,278
What is it?

127
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:10,618
Where's the hammer?

128
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:14,888
It's in the toolbox next to the fridge.

129
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,628
I want to cook some ramyeon
but can't seem to find any pots.

130
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:23,827
Look for one.

131
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,368
We're out of coffee.

132
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,638
Do you have any in the house?

133
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:34,668
No.

134
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:39,547
I bought some snacks.
Do you want to eat with us?

135
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:43,347
Where are you going?

136
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:47,317
Wait up.

137
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:51,988
Don't follow me.

138
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,557
I want to take a walk alone.

139
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:55,597
I also want to take a walk.

140
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,998
You guys are distracting me too much.

141
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:01,727
- Give me some alone time.
- No.

142
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:06,608
How can I leave you alone
when you look so unstable?

143
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:24,158
My grandfather passed away...

144
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:26,758
the year I was born.

145
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:29,498
The year after that,

146
00:13:30,297 --> 00:13:32,498
my parents died in a car accident.

147
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:35,967
When I was seven, my uncle died.

148
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:39,868
My grandmother...

149
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:42,577
blamed it all on me.

150
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:46,748
She said...

151
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:49,547
I had brought misfortune
upon my family.

152
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:52,217
That's ludicrous.

153
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:55,248
You're right.

154
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:57,217
It was ludicrous.

155
00:13:57,957 --> 00:13:59,158
When I was little,

156
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:02,158
I despised her for saying that.

157
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:05,128
But now, I understand.

158
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:08,467
I get why she said that.

159
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:11,697
When we encounter...

160
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:14,837
an unfathomable tragedy,

161
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:19,408
we tend to look for someone
we can resent and blame.

162
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:23,148
That's because it's easier...

163
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:27,317
to blame someone than to deal
with the tragedy itself.

164
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:32,288
Ms. Hong,

165
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:35,327
I hope you don't make
the same mistake my grandmother did.

166
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:40,067
Don't blame someone who's innocent.

167
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:44,567
Even more so if it's yourself.

168
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:50,238
It's not your fault.

169
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:51,707
So...

170
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:55,717
don't think about disappearing.

171
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:08,087
(Changhwa Restaurant)

172
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:26,278
Is Chang Hwa eating well?

173
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:29,278
Yes.

174
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:38,418
Is he enjoying the kimchi stew?

175
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:42,628
It was his favorite.

176
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:45,528
He is.

177
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:53,238
Chang Hwa.

178
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:56,738
My harsh words...

179
00:15:57,077 --> 00:16:00,108
must've hurt you badly.

180
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:05,278
I'm sorry. Okay?

181
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:10,918
This is the last meal...

182
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:20,268
I'm making for you.

183
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,738
I hope you enjoy it...

184
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:35,148
and find peace.

185
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:30,398
Did the unrested spirit really eat
the food?

186
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,037
No.

187
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:37,737
Then how did he leave?

188
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:40,048
No one was possessed.

189
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:43,078
Her deep-seated grudge...

190
00:17:43,918 --> 00:17:45,787
was what kept him here.

191
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:47,548
Her deep-seated grudge?

192
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:50,287
The guilt she felt for her son's death,

193
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:53,058
regret, and obsession.

194
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,727
Feeding him for the last time...

195
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:00,767
helped her let go of her grudge.

196
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:06,668
I don't think her feelings...

197
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:10,308
kept him here.

198
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:12,507
Perhaps,

199
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:15,777
they both couldn't let go.

200
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:17,578
It wasn't an obsession.

201
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,487
They were just worried about each other.

202
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:24,658

He's inside.
Let me check the money first.

if I cut ties with people
whenever things go wrong,

258
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:54,487
I would have no one left around me.

259

You didn't have to kill her.

292

for failing to protect my daughter.

asked me to look after you
before she left,

307
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,777

to protect you.

I mean it.

370
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:50,126
I kept it...

371
00:32:50,255 --> 00:32:52,356
in my inner pocket all along.

372
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:53,755

373
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:56,666
This is driving me insane too!

374
00:32:57,196 --> 00:32:59,866

Do you know what that meant to me?

378
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:08,745
It was the last evidence.

379

- You idiot!

You two conned me too.

384
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:26,055

now that they're finally quiet.

that memorandum is gone?

The In Bum I know...

404
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:58,616
is a guy who is persistent
to an extent that he seems reckless.

405

from a detective I've been working with.

415
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:05,375
We found Do Hak Sung's
paper company in Manila.

416
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:07,846
It'll take us a while...

417
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:10,746
to locate the person
who gets the money laundered here.

418
00:37:10,786 --> 00:37:12,955
He bribes people
with the laundered money,

419
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:14,286
then those who got bribed...

420
00:37:14,286 --> 00:37:15,985
hand him inside information
and watch his back,

421
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,355
then they get bribed again.

422
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:19,855
While this is all happening,
the weak and the poor are...

423
00:37:19,855 --> 00:37:21,926
suffering from all the damage.

424
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:25,196
If they did a proper investigation
of the fire 20 years ago,

Are you out of business? Why?

442
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:53,746
I see.
Is it because Chang Hwa came back?

You'll be getting a lump sum.

Didn't Chang Hwa tell you about me?

445

I gave him your number
and told him to call you.

Did he miss his parents?

453
00:39:20,407 --> 00:39:23,677
When you gave him the note,
did he say he'd come back?

454
00:39:23,677 --> 00:39:25,116
Hold on.

455
00:39:26,186 --> 00:39:27,416

Sure. That's not a problem.

550
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:27,567
We should grab a meal sometime.

551
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,177
Goodbye, sir.

553
00:46:34,107 --> 00:46:35,576
Have you called Assemblyman Han?

554
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:38,016
He's abroad and won't pick up.

555
00:46:38,817 --> 00:46:40,616
These darn scumbags.

556
00:46:40,987 --> 00:46:43,616
How dare they ignore me
after gladly receiving my money?

557
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:46,627
Darn it.

558

- Cheers!

This beer I'm having
after catching Do Hak Sung...

560
00:46:55,326 --> 00:46:56,467
sure tastes sweet.

561
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:58,467
I'm going to get drunk tonight.

562
00:47:08,177 --> 00:47:09,346
I called him.

563
00:47:10,476 --> 00:47:12,947
I thought he could join the party as well.

564
00:47:16,886 --> 00:47:19,956
Don't be a nuisance
by standing there and come sit.

565
00:47:21,127 --> 00:47:22,927
Okay. Thank you.

566
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:27,096
Hello.

567
00:47:29,567 --> 00:47:30,636
Thanks.

568
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:34,366
You're so kindhearted.

569
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,136

570
00:47:37,936 --> 00:47:40,306

571

I'm the one who caught him.

572
00:47:42,147 --> 00:47:43,416
Don't you know how good I am?

573
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,786

574
00:47:53,157 --> 00:47:55,496
What? What is this fancy smell?

575
00:47:57,157 --> 00:48:00,567
Yes. This is good.
It's perfect with beer.

576
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:03,337
Of course. It's my favorite snack
to have while drinking.

577
00:48:03,866 --> 00:48:05,096
Pour it on the plate.

578
00:48:12,107 --> 00:48:14,078
This isn't some snack. It's a dish.

579
00:48:19,957 --> 00:48:22,627
Soo Jung wanted me to tell you guys
that she misses you.

580
00:48:22,627 --> 00:48:25,257
I miss her too. Ask her to come
see us when she's on her day off.

581
00:48:25,357 --> 00:48:28,357
She stays at her dorm and studies
on her days off.

582
00:48:30,998 --> 00:48:32,968
Ms. Hong. We haven't had
a get-together for a while.

583
00:48:32,968 --> 00:48:34,138
Why don't you make a toast?

584
00:48:34,138 --> 00:48:36,308
This is a small get-together. Why...

585

It'll be helpful.

589

- Keep that in mind.
- Hey.

590
00:48:48,078 --> 00:48:49,087
Please.

591
00:48:51,788 --> 00:48:53,687
- I should just punch you.
- This is good.

592

She's so pretty.

596
00:49:05,297 --> 00:49:06,968
- I don't believe it.
- She's so pretty.

597
00:49:16,607 --> 00:49:20,248
Do Hak Sung will be punished
for his crimes this time, right?

598
00:49:21,248 --> 00:49:22,718
It won't be easy.

599
00:49:23,248 --> 00:49:25,018
A lot of people will want to protect him.

600
00:49:26,487 --> 00:49:29,328
But since we started this,
we should see it through.

601
00:49:31,658 --> 00:49:32,797
It's nice.

602
00:49:33,558 --> 00:49:34,598
What's nice?

603
00:49:35,257 --> 00:49:36,468
The weather is nice.

604
00:49:36,797 --> 00:49:38,198

(Kind, Present, and Swift Police)

606
00:49:52,578 --> 00:49:54,647
I did instigate him to start a fire...

607
00:49:55,248 --> 00:49:56,547
two decades ago.

608
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:02,357
Back then, I was young and eager
and didn't know any better.

609
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:06,627
But I really don't know anything
about Oh Sung Sik's death.

610
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:09,368
Secretary Choi said she'd handle it,
so I entrusted her with it.

611
00:50:09,928 --> 00:50:12,127
I had no idea
that she would kill him.

612
00:50:15,868 --> 00:50:17,908
Then, the paper company in Manila...

613
00:50:18,837 --> 00:50:21,707
was set up by Secretary Choi
without your permission?

614
00:50:22,078 --> 00:50:23,277
Oh, that?

615
00:50:23,277 --> 00:50:26,118
I'm looking into that
with my legal team.

616
00:50:26,218 --> 00:50:28,578
It looks like Secretary Choi
embezzled the money.

617
00:50:29,618 --> 00:50:32,187
Seriously. You can't trust anyone
in this world.

Ms. Choi Sun Mi.

619
00:50:40,158 --> 00:50:43,498
Why would you go this far
to show your loyalty to Do Hak Sung?

620
00:50:44,698 --> 00:50:46,297
Do you think you owe him...

621
00:50:46,297 --> 00:50:49,268
for paying your tuition
and living expenses...

622
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:51,138
when you were
financially struggling?

623
00:50:53,707 --> 00:50:57,078
He didn't help you
out of the goodness of his heart.

624
00:50:57,547 --> 00:51:00,518
He needed someone
to do his dirty work.

625
00:51:00,678 --> 00:51:03,288
So he took advantage
of your financial struggles.

626
00:51:03,288 --> 00:51:05,348
I don't care if he's using me or not.

627
00:51:07,487 --> 00:51:10,687
Even my parents abandoned me,
but he was the only one...

628
00:51:11,388 --> 00:51:12,897
who was willing to help me.

629
00:51:12,897 --> 00:51:15,198
Once you're no longer of use to him,

630
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:17,797
he will abandon you

631
00:51:17,797 --> 00:51:19,337

I saw Ms. Hong giving
her business card to your secretary.

she's going to betray us, right?
