1
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:16,820
We'll arrest everyone on the list
before the night is over.

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,519
We must find out
who is behind all this,

3
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:21,589
so round them all up.

4
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:25,790
Every disaster is preceded
by warning signs.

5
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,339
Spies from the North...

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,039
have infiltrated Gwangju
to incite a coup.

7
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:40,538
If you encounter anyone...

8
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,939
who seems to defy the government,
arrest them immediately. Understand?

9
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,279
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

10
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,850
Just like you can smell gas
before an earthquake,

11
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,850
and just like animals ascend
the mountains before a tsunami.

12
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:59,660
- Stop right there!
- The strange, ominous feeling...

13
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,759
that only those who are sensitive
can pick up.

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,020
Because I grew up with anxiety,

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,289
I was always sensitive and alert.

16
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,720
And now that I had someone
to protect,

17
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,390
I had to be more alert
to sense such warnings.

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,839
Why are you praying
first thing in the morning?

19
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,839
I prayed...

20
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,350
that you wouldn't snore.

21
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,380
Liar.

22
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,520
Did I snore?

23
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,759
Sleep some more.
The sun hasn't come up yet.

24
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,311
Why are you changing the subject?
I asked you if I snored.

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,869
You didn't snore.

26
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,069
Come here.

27
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,119
(Episode 9,
Warning Signs of a Disaster)

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,789
Lads. Get your act together, okay?

29
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,319
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

30
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,030
Oh, boy.

31
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,829
I was wondering why it was so quiet
for a few days.

32
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,729
I guess
we'll cry our eyes out again.

33
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,869
If they want us to do this,

34
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,769
shouldn't they at least give us
some gas masks?

35
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:50,900
Goodness.

36
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,210
I'd like to report a missing person.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,048
Oh, no. Is your child missing?

38
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,149
How old?

39
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,090
No, it's an adult. Age 26.

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,870
(Electronics Store)

41
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:30,009
I had caught you red-handed...

42
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,710
What?

43
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,109
No, it's nothing.

44
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:38,720
Okay, so the missing person
is 26 years old.

45
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,949
Is it a female?

46
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,220
No, a male.

47
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,729
Oh, a male? Okay.

48
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,500
Then what is your relationship
with him?

49
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,269
- Is he your boyfriend?
- Sorry?

50
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:58,600
No, he's my friend.

51
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,370
I see, a friend.

52
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,710
Oh, no.
Has your friend gone missing?

53
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,680
You must be worried.

54
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,018
By any chance, did you receive...

55
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:11,319
any accident reports last night?

56
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,289
No, not really.

57
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,220
Hold on.
Can you give me your number?

58
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,430
But...

59
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,530
what do you need my number for?

60
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,359
We need to know the number
of the person making the report.

61
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,330
I'll call you right away
if we receive news of an accident.

62
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,900
So...

63
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,840
Can you write down a number
where I can reach you?

64
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:38,640
It's standard procedure.

65
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,210
Okay.

66
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,089
The Government held
an emergency meeting...

67
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,918
at 21:30 last night...

68
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,788
and decided to enforce
martial law nationwide as of 24:00.

69
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:55,059
What is he talking about?

70
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,428
- The government spokesperson...
- Enforce martial law nationwide?

71
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:59,368
Commented at 23:30 last night...

72
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:01,270
Didn't you read the paper yet?

73
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,498
They decided to enforce martial law
nationwide last night.

74
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:04,998
On these grounds,

75
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:08,538
starting 24:00, May 17, 1980,

76
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:10,979
the emergency martial law
is in effect nationwide.

77
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,779
Considering the current situation...

78
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,919
Wait a minute, ma'am...

79
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:19,019
- The entire nation is deemed...
- What the?

80
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,118
To be in a state of emergency,
and as of 24:00, May 17,

81
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:24,219
- the emergency martial law...
- Come on, what's this?

82
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,489
Is in effect nationwide.

83
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,809
Myeong Hee.

84
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:43,009
Before we go,
let's drop by Hye Gun's.

85
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,080
I need to get some stuff.

86
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,780
Then why don't we split up
and meet back here?

87
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,780
Why do you want to split up?

88
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,248
Where are you going?

89
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,919
I want to go see Myeong Soo.

90
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,019
I just want to say goodbye.

91
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,689
No. Let me go with you.

92
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,289
What if you come with me
and bump into Jung Tae?

93
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:01,789
Then I'll stay hidden somewhere.

94
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,830
It's just that I had a bad dream.

95
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,428
My gosh.

96
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,475
Didn't you say you want to leave
as soon as possible?

97
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:10,139
We'll be able to save time
and leave earlier if we split up.

98
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,309
So let's go about our business
and meet back here, okay?

99
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,410
Okay then.

100
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,989
Isn't Soo Ryeon answering yet?

101
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:35,330
No.

102
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:38,799
I heard there was a huge protest
in Seoul last time.

103
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,600
What if something happened to her?

104
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,298
Come on, I bet she's just busy.

105
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:48,109
They're probably looking around
real hard to find a new house.

106
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,009
Then shall I send your aunt
to check on her?

107
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,549
Gosh, they're not babies.

108
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:56,919
They're probably doing just fine.

109
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,090
I'll tell her to call you
once I get in touch with her.

110
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:02,689
So go to your room
and get some rest.

111
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,390
Okay.

112
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,400
Hye Gun, I came to get my guitar...

113
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:29,080
Hye Gun. Jung Hye Gun!

114
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,489
You...

115
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:20,629
Hwang Hee Tae?

116
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,668
Hye Gun told me to come over
last night...

117
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,340
and we were supposed to meet here.

118
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,249
But when I came,
this place was totally empty.

119
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,979
The door wasn't locked,
and the chairs were all busted up.

120
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,590
They enforced martial law
nationwide last night.

121
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,569
The martial law was in effect
the whole time anyway.

122
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,859
Are you stupid?

123
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,069
This means that
the new military regime...

124
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,200
is on the verge of starting a coup.

125
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,939
I know.
But what does that have to do...

126
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,409
with Hye Gun's disappearance?

127
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,350
I'm afraid
the Defense Security Command...

128
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,850
is behind this.

129
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
So...

130
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,920
- I was thinking...
- No.

131
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,689
What? I didn't say anything yet.

132
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,960
It's obvious.

133
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,459
You want me to ask my father...

134
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,960
if Hye Gun was taken, right?

135
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,600
Do you still not know
what kind of man my father is?

136
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,169
If I ask him, he won't stay still...

137
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,210
and make matters ten times worse.

138
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,840
Things will turn more dangerous
if I get involved.

139
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,550
Then...

140
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,920
what will you do now?

141
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,790
You said
Myeong Hee will be in danger...

142
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,019
if she gets involved with you.

143
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,259
That's why Myeong Hee and I
are leaving today.

144
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:55,529
What? Where to?

145
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,729
Anywhere.

146
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,560
As long as it isn't Gwangju.

147
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:02,899
If you're going to keep fighting,
go do it in Seoul.

148
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:06,369
If you're thinking of staying here,
wear a hat at least.

149
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,680
Sun Min?

150
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,979
Where's Hye Gun?
Did he not come home?

151
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,629
Myeong Hee.

152
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,060
Hey, little bear.

153
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,028
Don't you have training today?

154
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:37,440
We're human beings too, you know.
We need our rest on Sundays.

155
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:39,739
What brings you here suddenly?

156
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,180
Myeong Soo.

157
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,409
I...

158
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,580
will be leaving Gwangju for a while.

159
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,979
What? Why?

160
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,249
Where are you going?

161
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:56,119
When are you coming back?

162
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,959
I'll call the training camp later...

163
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,460
Are you going abroad?

164
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,229
You said you weren't going
last time.

165
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,899
Goodness, I'm not going abroad.

166
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:11,399
I promised I'd go see you
compete at the Nationals.

167
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,170
I always keep my promise
no matter what.

168
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,879
You know that, right?

169
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,580
Are you going alone?

170
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,279
I'm going with a friend.

171
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,889
That's good enough for me.

172
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,590
Promise you'll come
to the Nationals.

173
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,320
You promised.

174
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,790
Goodness.

175
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,608
We need to take a detour
because of the protest.

176
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:49,608
Passengers headed
to Geumnam-ro or Gwangju Station...

177
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,878
- need to get off at this stop.
- Those darn demonstrations.

178
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,079
Don't they even get tired of it?

179
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,179
Darn it.

180
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,479
- Wait a minute.
- What's going on?

181
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,389
What's happening?

182
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,960
Drag off all the college students!

183
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,269
Hey, come here.

184
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,209
I'm not a college student.
I'll show you my ID.

185
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,339
Come with me.

186
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,179
Let me go!
I'm not a college student!

187
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,909
You brat, how dare you?

188
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,310
Do you think this is a joke?

189
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:29,779
You little...

190
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,600
Who are you?

191
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,810
What are you doing? Go after them!

192
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:40,820
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

193
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,389
No. I'm okay.

194
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,259
What on earth is going on?

195
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,550
I don't know.
I heard something about martial law.

196
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,259
The situation seems pretty serious.

197
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,898
Let's head to the station.

198
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,059
We'll be okay if we stay
off the streets and go around.

199
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:01,310
Hee Tae.

200
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:04,080
- Hee Tae...
- What? Why?

201
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,149
Darn, what is this?

202
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,619
I said I'm okay.

203
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,229
Hey, Myeong Hee.
What brings you here?

204
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,560
- Hello.
- It's me again.

205
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,570
Myeong Hee, what are you doing here?
You're off today.

206
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,039
I'm here as a guardian.

207
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,269
What?

208
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,869
Who is this gentleman
being protected by you?

209
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,080
He has a guitar. Is he a singer?

210
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,608
His head is busted,
so maybe he's a college student.

211
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:41,950
He's my boyfriend.

212
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,479
Your boyfriend?

213
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,450
Is he really your boyfriend?

214
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,720
Yes. So please hurry up
and take a look at him.

215
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,190
Well, okay. Please have a seat.

216
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:01,970
Let me take a look at your wound.

217
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,170
Well...

218
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:09,909
He doesn't need any stitches,
but he may need a CT scan.

219
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,138
How long will a CT scan take?

220
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:14,248
You'll have to wait
until this evening.

221
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:17,249
We have so many patients
with head wounds.

222
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,649
Then I'll just leave
after you disinfect my wound.

223
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,290
Come on. Are you a doctor?

224
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,259
Give me that.

225
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,729
Myeong Hee's boyfriend,
Mr. Hwang Hee Tae...

226
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:30,100
Hwang Hee Tae?

227
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,970
Your name sounds familiar.
Hwang Hee Tae... Hwang...

228
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,199
It's from the banner!

229
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,469
Are you that Hwang Hee Tae
who went to SNU with top marks?

230
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,408
My gosh.
So you are a doctor, after all.

231
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,408
As per Dr. Hwang's self-diagnosis,
just disinfect his wound.

232
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:46,878
Please do a CT scan too. We'll wait.

233
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,210
Myeong Hee.

234
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,749
- Get ready for a CT scan.
- Yes, doctor.

235
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,659
Is this the CT Scan Room?

236
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,659
How many patients are waiting...

237
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,799
Myeong Hee, I'm really fine.

238
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,459
It's just a little scratch.

239
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,470
But that scratch is on your head.

240
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:08,970
You need to get a CT scan, at least.

241
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:13,569
Fine. Then let's get out
of Gwangju first.

242
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,878
I'll get a CT done
as soon as we get to another city.

243
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,239
We're at a hospital right now.
What's the point?

244
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,778
We're not going anywhere
until you get tested.

245
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,149
Myeong Hee. Seriously...

246
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,450
Seriously what?

247
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,389
What's with that face?

248
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,659
If you're unhappy about something,
just tell me...

249
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,430
Stay still, you little punk.

250
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,840
All right. Let me ask you once more.

251
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:50,479
Who is behind
the recent torch protest?

252
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,379
I already told you.

253
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:56,249
College students...

254
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,278
It was all college students
who came out voluntarily...

255
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,350
Are you kidding me?

256
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,859
I know there is someone
behind you all.

257
00:17:08,389 --> 00:17:11,000
He made you start a rebellion,
didn't he?

258
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,100
What are you talking about?

259
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,510
I've never even met such a person.

260
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,679
Are you still enjoying this?

261
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:29,179
Hey.

262
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:31,050
Dip him.

263
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,749
No! I'm sorry!

264
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,888
- Get up, you punk.
- Please don't!

265
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,888
- Get off me.
- I'm sorry!

266
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,888
Please don't do this!

267
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,459
Go on in.

268
00:17:42,389 --> 00:17:44,000
Go on in, you little...

269
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,639
Gosh.

270
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,919
Here.

271
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:08,790
Go ahead and eat.

272
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,060
You didn't even eat your dinner.

273
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:14,260
Thank you.

274
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,659
If I go home,

275
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,100
my father would probably prepare
a feast for me.

276
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,869
Are you from around here?

277
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:31,540
I was born and raised here.

278
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,249
Anyway, I wonder how those spies
crossed the border.

279
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,889
And why did they have to crawl
all the way down here to Gwangju?

280
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:49,159
By the way, Corporal Lee...

281
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:54,070
How do we tell rebels apart
from ordinary students?

282
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,468
Do you want to skip dinner
tomorrow too?

283
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:01,310
Just follow the orders.

284
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,379
I'm sorry, sir.

285
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,949
The problem with smart ones is...

286
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:10,179
that they think too much.

287
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:19,559
You don't have to stay here with me.

288
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,359
Forget it.
The test results aren't out yet.

289
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,359
I'm really fine.

290
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:25,830
Come on.

291
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,770
Thank you for waiting.

292
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,339
Here you go.
Since you're a top student,

293
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,439
I'm sure I don't have to explain
anything to you.

294
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,310
Doctor.

295
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,740
Take it easy. I was just joking.

296
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,949
It's a concussion.

297
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,849
Luckily,
there's no internal bleeding.

298
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,119
Are you still feeling dizzy
and nauseous?

299
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:48,618
Not anymore. I'm totally fine now.

300
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:51,290
Come on.
Don't shake your head like that.

301
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,859
Okay. Well then...

302
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,070
- What's that sound?
- It's curfew.

303
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,139
What? There's still a few hours
until curfew.

304
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:04,468
Didn't you know?

305
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,829
With the martial law expanded,
the curfew has been moved up.

306
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:10,339
Hold on. What do we do then?

307
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,279
What else?
You're stuck here until morning.

308
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,708
- What?
- What?

309
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:17,878
Don't go wandering out after curfew
and get hit in the head.

310
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:20,719
You can sleep in the lobby
or in an empty treatment room.

311
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,219
Now if you please,
I need you to empty that bed.

312
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,459
Gosh.

313
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,510
I've never met anyone
as stubborn as you.

314
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,718
I've never seen a grown man...

315
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:54,289
throw a tantrum like you either.

316
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,990
I didn't do that.

317
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,059
If only we had gone straight
to the train station when I said...

318
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,499
Then you would've thrown up
on a moving train...

319
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,129
from that concussion you have.

320
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,629
Exactly.

321
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,339
If we'd stayed together
this morning,

322
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,569
I wouldn't have had a concussion
in the first place.

323
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,269
So what?
Are you saying it's all my fault?

324
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,840
No, that's not it.

325
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,750
I don't like your tone.

326
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,948
Whatever.
Just hurry up and lie down.

327
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,580
Come on.

328
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,419
I'll go and check
if there are any extra beds.

329
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,020
Hold on.

330
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,530
Why do you need an extra bed?
We can share the same bed.

331
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,929
Have you lost your mind?
We can't do that.

332
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,300
What are you talking about?
Last night...

333
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:43,770
- Gosh.
- You're embarrassing me.

334
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,599
Keep it down.

335
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,269
Last night, we shared a bed...

336
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,939
even smaller than this one. So what?

337
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,678
Fine. You sleep in this bed.

338
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:57,019
- I'll go find an extra bed.
- Come on.

339
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,749
Forget it. I'll go.

340
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,449
You're a patient right now.

341
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,059
Stop talking and lie down.

342
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,629
- I can help you.
- Just lie down.

343
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,909
What a stubborn woman.

344
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,149
I like that.

345
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:33,388
Hello?

346
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:35,389
Soo Chan, it's me.

347
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:39,290
Soo Ryeon.
Why is it so hard to reach you?

348
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,300
I'm sorry. I've been a little busy.

349
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,199
How's Father? Is he feeling better?

350
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:54,939
Yes, he just took his medicine
and fell asleep.

351
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,840
What about you? Is everything okay?

352
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,609
I'm good.
Is everything okay with you?

353
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:05,719
I heard there was chaos
in Gwangju today.

354
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,219
Hello?

355
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,889
Lee Soo Ryeon.
Where are you right now?

356
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,830
Where else?
I'm at my place in Seoul.

357
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,368
Then hang up.
I'll call you back at your place.

358
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,600
No, you can't.

359
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:26,500
Hee Tae is asleep.

360
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,270
He's a light sleeper.

361
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:30,878
I'm going to bed now.

362
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:33,480
I'll call you tomorrow. Good night.

363
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,310
Hey, Soo Ryeon.

364
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,109
Gosh.

365
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,350
What's wrong? Did it break earlier?

366
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,119
No, it's just a little scratch.

367
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,030
I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?

368
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:28,199
I had a dream.

369
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:30,899
What's wrong? Was it a nightmare?

370
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:35,829
It was about what we saw earlier
in the day.

371
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:42,149
Why do you think
the soldiers did that?

372
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:55,859
Myeong Hee,
let me tell you a secret.

373
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:01,000
I've been struck by lightning,
a long time ago.

374
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:02,899
What?

375
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,100
- Really?
- Yes.

376
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,608
I went under an awning
to take cover from the rain,

377
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,340
and it hit my elbow like this.

378
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,740
Crazy, right?

379
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:15,108
I couldn't believe it either.

380
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:17,879
So all I did was study
how lightning works for a while.

381
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,050
But the reason was simple.

382
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:22,619
I was...

383
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,820
right next to a payphone,
that's why.

384
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,188
So I still...

385
00:25:27,189 --> 00:25:29,389
try to avoid being close
to payphones whenever it rains.

386
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,660
Same goes for what happened today.

387
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,639
It's like being struck by lightning.

388
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,340
We just...

389
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:43,879
happened to be standing
next to a payphone.

390
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,619
Everything will be fine
once we leave Gwangju tomorrow.

391
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,060
But what if it's like this
everywhere else?

392
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:03,699
Don't worry.

393
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,929
My intuition is always on point.

394
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,570
I'm almost like a human canary.

395
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:16,669
Okay, Mr. Human Canary.

396
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,510
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,580
Try playing the guitar...

398
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,080
and see if it sounds okay.

399
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,649
Okay. But in return,

400
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,789
we must go to the station
as soon as we wake up.

401
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,090
Don't be stubborn.

402
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,629
Let's see.

403
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:37,688
(Changsoo Bed and Breakfast)

404
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:38,989
Attention.

405
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,089
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

406
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,229
It's supposed to rain
in the afternoon,

407
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,158
so the training session
will be replaced by indoor practice.

408
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:47,230
- No!
- Darn it.

409
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,230
Be quiet.

410
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,269
We were stuck in our rooms
all day yesterday.

411
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,915
Do we have to practice indoors
again today?

412
00:27:56,939 --> 00:27:58,879
You heard him.
It's supposed to rain later.

413
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:02,949
Then we can go out for a run
before it starts raining.

414
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:05,379
I feel all cooped up.

415
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,319
Things are getting tense
in the downtown area of Gwangju.

416
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,520
We'll be okay.

417
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,959
Make sure you lock it well.

418
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,100
- My gosh.
- Why are they taking them?

419
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:23,939
- Look at that!
- They're dragging him!

420
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,669
- My gosh!
- Oh, no!

421
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,340
- What are they doing?
- Did you see that?

422
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,049
It's gutsy of you
to gather around like this.

423
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,309
All of you, be on your way.

424
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,349
Officer.

425
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,519
You saw that too!
How could you not stop them?

426
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,188
The police can't stop them.

427
00:28:41,189 --> 00:28:42,349
So please, just go home.

428
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,989
Are soldiers above the law?

429
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,628
- Move aside.
- You'll get everyone killed!

430
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:48,730
Go home already.

431
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:00,100
Hey, let's just go to the bakery
and come back quickly.

432
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,070
The class won't start until later.

433
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:03,709
Didn't you hear
what the teacher said?

434
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,209
The teacher told us not to go
anywhere near downtown.

435
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,009
That just means
we shouldn't protest.

436
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,879
- Did you actually believe it?
- Hey, come on.

437
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,290
Why are you doing this to me?

438
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,429
Hey, isn't that the director?

439
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:29,399
My gosh. It is him.

440
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:33,139
Don't hit innocent people!

441
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:37,310
- Don't hit him!
- Stop this now!

442
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,679
Don't hit our teacher!

443
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,189
What? What is going on?

444
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,490
Hey, let's go. Come on.

445
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:43,839
(Emergency Room)

446
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:46,809
Myeong Hee.

447
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,419
What do you think you're doing?

448
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,918
You promised you'd leave with me
in the morning.

449
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,759
The hospital is full of patients,
and we're running out of beds.

450
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,959
You saw it yourself.

451
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,398
I did. That's why I'm saying this.

452
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,929
Can't you see?
This isn't a normal situation.

453
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,699
No, it isn't.

454
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,168
Are you telling me
to leave my patients behind?

455
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:14,139
Yes, let's just go.

456
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,909
Hee Tae.

457
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,979
You might be disappointed in me,
but I can't help it.

458
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,439
For me, our safety comes first.

459
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,250
I do understand.

460
00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:24,980
But can't you wait
until the worst is over?

461
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,989
No. We must leave immediately.

462
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,949
Don't you understand
what's going on here?

463
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,490
Why are you two
just standing around?

464
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:35,289
Even interns
from other departments...

465
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,128
and students are helping out.

466
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,328
I wonder why Mr. Hwang,

467
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,460
the top student
with a medical license, isn't.

468
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:44,440
If you want to help out,
put it on and step inside.

469
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,669
If you don't want to,
give it to Myeong Hee and leave.

470
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:49,639
Only medical staff are allowed
in the Emergency Room.

471
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:55,409
- I can't leave right now.
- Myeong Hee!

472
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,629
Seven o'clock.

473
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,859
What?

474
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:14,259
We're leaving
at seven o'clock sharp.

475
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,629
I'll carry you out on my shoulders
if I must.

476
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,339
Gosh, I can't believe this.

477
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,210
The one who loves more always loses.

478
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:25,908
Hee Tae, you can stay
in the treatment room if you feel...

479
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:27,210
Seven o'clock, okay?

480
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,918
Yes.

481
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:39,059
Then we'll proceed as planned.

482
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,329
Pardon? The martial law?

483
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,760
No, that's no problem.

484
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,569
It's not going to have much impact
on the general public.

485
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:51,139
We'll proceed as planned.

486
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,709
Man, this is bad.

487
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,609
What if they barge in here too?

488
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,339
Aren't you going for lunch?

489
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,349
Why? Is everything okay?

490
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,020
The thing is...

491
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,020
There's a big ruckus outside
because of the martial law.

492
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,158
If you're worried,

493
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:18,899
you can leave early today.

494
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:22,429
Well, that's not why
we brought it up.

495
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,638
Goodness. Just go home.

496
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,599
Your family must be waiting for you
at home.

497
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,240
I'll also head home
as soon as I wrap things up.

498
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,680
Come on!

499
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,859
Hey, what are you doing here?

500
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,300
He's my little brother.

501
00:33:55,829 --> 00:33:57,569
You said you were going
to the academy.

502
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,099
I'll take him.

503
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,079
You wench!

504
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,020
All of you, on your knees.
And hands behind the back.

505
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,549

- My goodness.

00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,398
When will you be here?

509
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,530
- In 5 minutes, sir.
- 5 minutes?

510
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,729
Why are you standing around?
Get them!

511
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:34,039
Go get them.

512
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,069
I'll watch these punks.

513
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,280
Keep your head down!

514
00:34:49,749 --> 00:34:51,089
They're gone. Get up.

515
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,419
Hey, look at me.

516
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,260
Mr. Officer.

517
00:34:58,399 --> 00:34:59,729
Everyone, get up.

518
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,669
It's okay. It's all right.

519
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,029
There are a lot of soldiers
over there,

520
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,470
so go this way.

521

What are you waiting for? Run!

522
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,309
- Really?
- Yes, it's okay.

523
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,809
Come on. Let's go.

524
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,410
- Go, hurry.
- Come on.

525
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,080
Let's get out of here.

526
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:19,280
- Will you be okay though?
- Yes, just go.

You said you were in Seoul
last night.

Did you come back to Gwangju
with Hee Tae after that?

Yes, this morning.

00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,689
You're lying again!

533
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,459
Do you think I'm an idiot?

534
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,970
You said I could come back
if things don't work out.

535
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,399
That's why I came back.

536
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:15,010
When I said you could come back,

537
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,639
I didn't mean...

538
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,180
you could join the protest
and take part in that ruckus.

539
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:20,879
I didn't join the protest,

540
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,549
nor did I take part in the ruckus.

541
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,649
You didn't?

542
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,978
You were being chased by soldiers,
covered in blood.

543
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,088
Are you still going to deny it?

544
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:31,458
Soo Chan,
this isn't a normal situation.

545
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:33,159
I saw the soldiers dragging a kid...

546
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,760
barely old enough to be
in middle school.

547
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:38,458
Would you have done nothing
if you'd seen it?

548
00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:40,430
Are you okay with them dragging you?

549
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,970
What would you have done
if you'd run into Mr. Hwang, not me?

550
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,669
You're still scared of him,
knowing what's going on?

551
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:51,338
Why? Are you afraid
he'd hurt your business?

552
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:53,339
No! I'm afraid he'd hurt you.

553
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:01,120
Mother said this one thing to me
in her final moments.

554
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,490
She asked me to look after you
in her place.

555
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:08,430
I can just close the business
if things go wrong.

556
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,120
But if something happens to you...

557
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:12,259
Father is bedridden too,

558
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,999
so if something bad
happens to you...

559
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,740
How would I live?

560
00:37:26,439 --> 00:37:28,810
Let's go home, okay?

561
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,149
If this is an abnormal situation
like you said,

562
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,819
let's stay home
until things calm down...

563
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:40,060
and try to look for another way.

564
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:42,129
Okay?

565
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,700
You can look...

566
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,999
for another way.

567
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:50,569
I'm not going home.

568
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,069
Soo Ryeon.

569
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,280
Even if you throw yourself
into that mayhem,

570
00:38:00,939 --> 00:38:02,950
nothing's going to change.

571
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,149
I may not be able
to change anything,

572
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,990
but there are things I can do.

573
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,289
Tell Father...

574
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,359
that I'm...

575
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,669
in Seoul.

576
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,539
Soo Ryeon.

577
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:30,709
If you walk out that door now,

578
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:34,979
I'll no longer think of you
as my family.

579
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:53,999
Mr. Hwang.

580
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,398
Dress the wound...

581
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,800
and use this to triage the patient.

582
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:58,100
- Pardon?
- Take this.

583
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,268
Write down the patient's symptoms,

584
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:02,109
name, and age, and stick it on him.

585
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:04,539
If the patient can't be identified,
just make up a name.

586
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,739
If anyone needs emergency surgery,
tell us right away.

587
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,780
Wait.

588
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,009
I haven't even completed
my internship yet.

589
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,049
Why would you trust me with this?

590
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,249
You said you passed the exam.

591
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:14,890
- It's the same as the practical.
- But...

592
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,918
he's not a simulated patient.

593
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,148
Just do it.

594
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:20,160
I'm sure you're better
than that fool over there.

595
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:30,199
(Cho Young Hoon, 22, Head trauma)

596
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,240
Coming through! Make way.

597
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,470
A new patient!

598
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,410
Doctor! Hurry!

599
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,539
Please treat him right away.

600
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:38,839
Hee Tae.

601
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,850
- This looks like a stab wound.
- A stab wound?

602
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,579
He's been stabbed with a bayonet.

603
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,220
The other patients waiting outside
all have stab wounds.

604
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:51,450
Excuse me. Move aside please.

605
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,495
Myeong Hee,
get a saline drip started...

606
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,560
and call Surgery.

607
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:56,228
- I'll see if we can book an OR now.
- Okay.

608
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:57,959
Sorry, excuse me.

609
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,268
(Emergency Room, Nurse's Station)

610
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:05,168
Send them to the OR in this order.

611
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,869
- For this, just suture the wounds.
- Okay.

612
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,410
Excuse me, doctor.

613
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,970
When will Kim Bong Seok
get his surgery?

614
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,608
Kim Bong Seok...

615
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:14,378
Oh, we booked his surgery just now.

616
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:17,148
Really? Thank you so much.

617
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:19,850
Doctor, we need to book
an emergency surgery.

618
00:40:20,749 --> 00:40:22,288
A stab wound of the femoral artery.

619
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,319
What? What are you saying?

620
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,060
Who are you to change the order?

621
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,960
I'm sorry, but we must prioritize
emergency surgeries...

622
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,099
- My gosh!
- My son needs urgent care too.

623
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,560
He needs to undergo surgery
immediately!

624
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,029
This patient will die
if he doesn't undergo surgery now.

625
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,299
Sir, please let go of this and...

626
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,639
Who do you think you are?
The Almighty?

627
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,039
Are you the Almighty?

628
00:40:43,169 --> 00:40:44,768
Who are you to decide
who should go first?

629
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:48,239
If my son dies
because he can't get surgery now...

630
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,249
Will you take responsibility for it
if he dies?

631
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,418
Will you take responsibility
for his death?

632
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:54,550
Goodness, calm down!

633
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,288
This will only delay
your son's surgery.

634
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,358
I'm sorry, doctor.

635
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:00,288
Hee Tae, we've finished
triaging all the patients,

636
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:01,830
so go back to ambulatory care.

637
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,858
- Let's go.
- Thank you, doctor.

638
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:05,030
Goodness.

639
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,330
Ms. Kim Bo Yeon?

640
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:39,729
I'll disinfect your wound
and stitch it up for you.

641
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:41,160
Hee Tae.

642
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:43,629
Jin A.

643
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:52,538
Who knew I'd get to see you...

644
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:55,050
in your white coat?

645
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,180
I see this brilliant light
radiating from you.

646
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,050
Is this what they call an aura?

647
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,660
Keep your mouth shut, will you?

648
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:09,728
It's done,

649
00:42:09,729 --> 00:42:11,830
but you'll have to wait a little
for the CT scan.

650
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:14,530
My, look at the precise stitches!

651
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,399
It almost looks like
you used a sewing machine.

652
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,810
Jin A, are you all right?
No injuries?

653
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,108
I'm totally fine.

654
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:25,780
I'm very nimble,
unlike this slow turtle here.

655
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,249
They hit you on the head too.
I heard it.

656
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,879
They hit you on the head?

657
00:42:33,419 --> 00:42:34,878
It's nothing serious.

658
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,319
Just like a teacher's finger flick
when you doze off in class.

659
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,560
Let me have a look.

660
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,899
Keep your eyes on my finger.

661
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,309
My gosh, what is this?

662
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,640
You crazy fool!

663
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:00,108
Your friend is dying here...

664
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:01,556
and you get excited enough
to get a nosebleed?

665
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,910
Do you have a death wish?

666
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,179
Hee Tae, this isn't because
I'm overexcited or anything...

667
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,890
You should get checked out
by a doctor too.

668
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,120
Myeong Hee is over there,
so go register with her. Okay?

669
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,529
Mr. Hwang, you need to stitch up
these patients too.

670
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,990
Oh, okay.

671
00:43:17,689 --> 00:43:20,129
- Get yourself checked out.
- Okay.

672
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,700
What? You little...

673
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:29,769
Gosh, what should we do?

674
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:32,809
- What is going on?
- Why? Is something wrong?

675
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,509
I went to the supermarket...

676
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,849
that opened over there
for some side dishes.

677
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,619
The owner of that place
is from Gwangju.

678
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,649
He said Gwangju is
in a state of chaos right now.

679
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,249
Gwangju?

680
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:46,890
What do you mean, chaos?

681
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:51,030
He said soldiers have taken over
the streets of Gwangju.

682
00:43:51,189 --> 00:43:53,330
It's as if a war has broken out.

683
00:43:53,629 --> 00:43:55,330
That's plain nonsense.

684
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,739
If a war breaks out,
it would be on the front lines.

685
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,838
Why would it be in Gwangju?

686
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,268
Who knows?

687
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:04,639
Anyhow, he said soldiers
are beating young people up...

688
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,109
and arresting them.
It's a total mess.

689
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,019
Bo Yeon? It's time for your CT scan.

690
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,649
Where's Jin A?

691
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:19,160
She went to call my family.

692
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,459
Did she register to see a doctor?

693
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:38,438
(Cashier)

694
00:44:38,439 --> 00:44:40,510
(Registration)

695
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,209
Excuse me.

696
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,149
Hey, In Young.

697
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,349
Is there another payphone
besides that?

698
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:50,748
Oh, there's one in the Annex.

699
00:44:50,749 --> 00:44:53,289
- It's through that corridor.
- Thanks.

700
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,660
I told her to see a doctor.
She just doesn't listen.

701
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:03,769
Goodness, that stubborn girl...

702
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:12,410
Jin A!

703
00:45:16,879 --> 00:45:19,780
Jin A. Jin A!

704
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:44,970
Hello?

705
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,410
Is anyone there?

706
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:05,398
Hee Tae. Please save Seok Chul.

707
00:46:05,399 --> 00:46:08,600
Please save her.

708
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,510
Jin A, what is your dream?

709
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:19,640
My dream is to become
a radio producer.

710
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,108
Can you show me around Seoul
this summer break?

711
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:24,079
Show me TBC's broadcasting station
and your university too!

712
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,819
It's a Teacher's Day present.

713
00:46:26,419 --> 00:46:28,850
Write a song that will win
the University Song Festival.

714
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:38,359
Hee Tae.

715
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,300
Please save her. You must save her.

716
00:47:34,749 --> 00:47:37,620
In Young. Did you see Hee Tae?

717
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,189
He went to the Annex
to make a phone call.

718
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,211
Why wouldn't he just use the phone
at the nurse's station?

719
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:03,709
Please.

720
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,649
Jin A, please.

721
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:13,200
You said you wanted to go
to the TBC broadcasting station.

722
00:48:14,189 --> 00:48:16,060
Please come back.

723
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,399
Hello?

724
00:48:23,729 --> 00:48:25,499
Can anyone help me?

725
00:48:26,399 --> 00:48:27,700
Hee Tae!

726
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:32,580
Myeong Hee. Please go and get help.

727
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,649
Jin A, please.

728
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,580
Please come back, please.

729
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:53,229
Jin A. Can you hear me? Jin A.

730
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,189
Hang in there a little longer.

731
00:49:30,169 --> 00:49:31,430
Be careful.

732
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,180
- Here, Sun Min.
- Okay.

733
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,180
(Yushin remnants, step down!)

734
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:43,780
Sir, are you okay?

735
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,719
Hang in there.

736
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,479
Oh, dear.

737
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:57,729
Hey!

738
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,800
Mister!

739
00:50:04,629 --> 00:50:07,100
Mister. Hey!

740
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,410
Name...

741
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:10,870
What?

742
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,410
Your name...

743
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,149
Wait here.

744
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:26,289
I didn't get to...

745
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,370
Mister. Hey!

746
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,910
I had caught you red-handed...

747
00:50:47,939 --> 00:50:49,050
What?

748
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,349
No, it's nothing.

749
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:55,280
Can you write down a number
where I can reach you?

750
00:50:56,419 --> 00:50:58,220
Hey, look at me.

751
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,889
Mr. Officer.

752
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,830
- Will you be okay though?
- Yes, just go.

753
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:33,019
Mr. Officer.

754
00:51:36,689 --> 00:51:38,229
Mr. Officer.

755
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:39,999
Mr. Officer!

756
00:51:43,069 --> 00:51:45,700
Mr. Officer!

757
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:56,208
Please don't do this.

758
00:51:56,209 --> 00:51:59,350
Do what? We didn't do anything.

759
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:01,620
I know.

760
00:52:01,979 --> 00:52:03,419
Stop it.

761
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:06,919
She's just a young student.

762
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,128
Why are you harassing her?

763
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:10,358
Who are you?

764
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:11,990
Just let her go.

765
00:52:12,089 --> 00:52:14,359
I can vouch for her...

766
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,060
Hee Tae.

767
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:48,859
The surgery went well,
and her vitals are stable.

768
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,830
She just went up
to the recovery room.

769
00:53:01,339 --> 00:53:03,379
Thank you so much.

770
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:08,720
If the CPR had been any later,
she wouldn't have made it.

771
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:10,919
You...

772
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,919
saved Jin A.

773
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:31,838
We're already short of beds.

774
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,338
Patients are lying on mats
in the lobby.

775
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:34,938
There's no way
we can accept more patients.

776
00:53:34,939 --> 00:53:38,450
But we couldn't refuse to accept
patients in this situation.

777
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:39,649
Deputy Director.

778
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:42,318
More than half of the patients
are unidentified.

779
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,949
With their medical bills aside,

780
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,889
the military might suspect
we teamed up with the protestors...

781
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,490
and attack the hospital.

782
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:51,759
What kind of hospital
refuses to accept patients?

783
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,830
Deputy Director.

784
00:53:55,129 --> 00:53:57,169
Close the main gate
and continue to accept patients.

785
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,469
The soldiers might see,
so turn off all the lights...

786
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,550
except in the operating rooms
and the emergency room.

787
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:07,539
(Gwangju Pyeonghwa Hospital)

788
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,019
Eat even if you're not hungry.

789
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,530
You haven't eaten all day.

790
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,859
I guess...

791
00:54:29,669 --> 00:54:31,629
you really do have good intuition.

792
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,800
I saw Jin A earlier,

793
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:36,970
and we even talked a little too.

794
00:54:38,569 --> 00:54:40,740
But I didn't even notice
she was hurt,

795
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,780
let alone see any warning signs.

796
00:54:43,749 --> 00:54:45,350
She looked the same as usual to me.

797
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,819
See? I'm a human canary.

798
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:57,689
I'm sorry.

799
00:54:58,689 --> 00:54:59,800
For what?

800
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,100
I shouldn't have been so stubborn.

801
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,240
I put you through so much.

802
00:55:08,269 --> 00:55:10,109
If I had believed your hunch...

803
00:55:11,069 --> 00:55:13,539
and left with you
either yesterday or today,

804
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,609
you wouldn't have had to
go through this.

805
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,149
Thanks to your stubbornness,

806
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:26,490
Jin A lived.

807
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,669
By nature,

808
00:55:39,939 --> 00:55:41,939
I avoid risks before they happen.

809
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:44,809
You're a person...

810
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,930
who remains where you are
even when lightning strikes.

811
00:55:48,709 --> 00:55:50,350
Anyway, thanks to you,

812
00:55:50,979 --> 00:55:52,979
for the first time in my life,
I didn't run away...

813
00:55:54,379 --> 00:55:57,120
and could be there
when Jin A collapsed.

814
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,060
That means...

815
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,990
your stubbornness saved Jin A.

816
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,740
It's time.

817
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,039
Shall we head to the station now?

818
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,560
Let me tell you something
as the human canary.

819
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,760
Getting more patients
with stab wounds...

820
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:38,689
is not a good sign at all.

821
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,100
Let's wait until the worst is over.

822
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,569
Just until Jin A wakes up.

823
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,149
Will that really be okay?

824
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,220
I don't know.

825
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,580
Maybe getting struck by lightning
made me reckless.

826
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:23,939
We had a belief that we could handle
anything together.

827
00:57:25,439 --> 00:57:27,010
And that inexplicable belief...

828
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,649
trumped all warning signs.

829
00:57:33,879 --> 00:57:35,580
But little did we know...

830
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,089
Welcome, sir.

831
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,990
The lightning was also...

832
00:57:43,689 --> 00:57:45,260
nothing more than a warning sign.

833
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,100
What was actually coming
toward us was...

834
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:54,200
a tremendous storm.

835
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,709
Lights off.

836
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,350
In the face of the storm,

837
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:09,180
the only thing we could do was...

838
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,789
hold each other's hands
so that we wouldn't lose each other.

839
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,470
(Youth of May)

840
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,918
How many times must I tell you?

841
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,349
Don't step in unless you're told to.

842
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,788
- I get it. Stop nagging.
- "Stop nagging?"

843
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,560
A person collapsed here.

844
00:58:51,459 --> 00:58:53,358
I have to go.
I have to go there right now.

845
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:54,858
Are you out of your mind?
The soldiers are firing.

846
00:58:54,859 --> 00:58:56,498
That's Myeong Soo's shoe.

847
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,099
You want to wage war
against armed soldiers?

848
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,799
They're massacring civilians.

849
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,300
Why must we remain immaculate?

850
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,870
Hee Tae, you were right.

851
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,140
I'm a hypocrite.
