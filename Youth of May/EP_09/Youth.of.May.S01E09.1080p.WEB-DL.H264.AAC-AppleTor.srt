1
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:16,138
We'll arrest everyone on the list
before the night is over.

2
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:18,837
We must find out
who is behind all this,

3
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,907
so round them all up.

4
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:25,108
Every disaster is preceded
by warning signs.

5
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:34,657
Spies from the North...

6
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:37,357
have infiltrated Gwangju
to incite a coup.

7
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:39,857
If you encounter anyone...

8
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:42,258
who seems to defy the government,
arrest them immediately. Understand?

9
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:43,597
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

10
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:46,168
Just like you can smell gas
before an earthquake,

11
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:49,168
and just like animals ascend
the mountains before a tsunami.

12
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:58,978
- Stop right there!
- The strange, ominous feeling...

13
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:02,077
that only those who are sensitive
can pick up.

14
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:23,338
Because I grew up with anxiety,

15
00:01:24,198 --> 00:01:26,607
I was always sensitive and alert.

16
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:30,038
And now that I had someone
to protect,

17
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:33,708
I had to be more alert
to sense such warnings.

18
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:44,157
Why are you praying
first thing in the morning?

19
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:49,157
I prayed...

20
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:53,668
that you wouldn't snore.

21
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:56,698
Liar.

22
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,838
Did I snore?

23
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:07,077
Sleep some more.
The sun hasn't come up yet.

24
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:10,377
Why are you changing the subject?
I asked you if I snored.

25
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:12,187
You didn't snore.

26
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,387
Come here.

27
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:32,438
(Episode 9,
Warning Signs of a Disaster)

28
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:35,107
Lads. Get your act together, okay?

29
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:36,637
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

30
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:38,348
Oh, boy.

31
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:41,147
I was wondering why it was so quiet
for a few days.

32
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:43,047
I guess
we'll cry our eyes out again.

33
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:47,188
If they want us to do this,

34
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:49,087
shouldn't they at least give us
some gas masks?

35
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:50,218
Goodness.

36
00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:57,528
I'd like to report a missing person.

37
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,367
Oh, no. Is your child missing?

38
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:01,468
How old?

39
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:05,408
No, it's an adult. Age 26.

40
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:23,188
(Electronics Store)

41
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:29,327
I had caught you red-handed...

42
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:31,028
What?

43
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,427
No, it's nothing.

44
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:38,038
Okay, so the missing person
is 26 years old.

45
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:39,267
Is it a female?

46
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:41,538
No, a male.

47
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:46,047
Oh, a male? Okay.

48
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:49,818
Then what is your relationship
with him?

49
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:52,587
- Is he your boyfriend?
- Sorry?

50
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:57,918
No, he's my friend.

51
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:00,688
I see, a friend.

52
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:03,028
Oh, no.
Has your friend gone missing?

53
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:04,998
You must be worried.

54
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:08,337
By any chance, did you receive...

55
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:10,637
any accident reports last night?

56
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:13,607
No, not really.

57
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:17,538
Hold on.
Can you give me your number?

58
00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:19,748
But...

59
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:21,848
what do you need my number for?

60
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,677
We need to know the number
of the person making the report.

61
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:27,648
I'll call you right away
if we receive news of an accident.

62
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:29,218
So...

63
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:34,158
Can you write down a number
where I can reach you?

64
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:37,958
It's standard procedure.

65
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:40,528
Okay.

66
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:45,408
The Government held
an emergency meeting...

67
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:47,237
at 21:30 last night...

68
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:53,107
and decided to enforce
martial law nationwide as of 24:00.

69
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:54,377
What is he talking about?

70
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:56,747
- The government spokesperson...
- Enforce martial law nationwide?

71
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,687
commented at 23:30 last night...

72
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:00,588
Didn't you read the paper yet?

73
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:02,817
They decided to enforce martial law
nationwide last night.

74
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:04,317
On these grounds,

75
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:07,857
starting 24:00, May 17, 1980,

76
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:10,297
the emergency martial law
is in effect nationwide.

77
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:13,098
Considering the current situation...

78
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:15,237
Wait a minute, ma'am...

79
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:18,338
- The entire nation is deemed...
- What the?

80
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:21,437
to be in a state of emergency,
and as of 24:00, May 17,

81
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:23,538
- the emergency martial law...
- Come on, what's this?

82
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:24,807
is in effect nationwide.

83
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:39,127
Myeong Hee.

84
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:42,328
Before we go,
let's drop by Hye Gun's.

85
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:43,398
I need to get some stuff.

86
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:46,098
Then why don't we split up
and meet back here?

87
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:48,098
Why do you want to split up?

88
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:49,567
Where are you going?

89
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,237
I want to go see Myeong Soo.

90
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,338
I just want to say goodbye.

91
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:55,007
No. Let me go with you.

92
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,607
What if you come with me
and bump into Jung Tae?

93
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,107
Then I'll stay hidden somewhere.

94
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:03,148
It's just that I had a bad dream.

95
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:04,747
My gosh.

96
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:06,648
Didn't you say you want to leave
as soon as possible?

97
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:09,458
We'll be able to save time
and leave earlier if we split up.

98
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,627
So let's go about our business
and meet back here, okay?

99
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:17,728
Okay then.

100
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,307
Isn't Soo Ryeon answering yet?

101
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:34,648
No.

102
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:38,117
I heard there was a huge protest
in Seoul last time.

103
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:40,918
What if something happened to her?

104
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:44,617
Come on, I bet she's just busy.

105
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:47,427
They're probably looking around
real hard to find a new house.

106
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:51,328
Then shall I send your aunt
to check on her?

107
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,867
Gosh, they're not babies.

108
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:56,237
They're probably doing just fine.

109
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:59,408
I'll tell her to call you
once I get in touch with her.

110
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:02,007
So go to your room
and get some rest.

111
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:04,708
Okay.

112
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:15,718
Hye Gun, I came to get my guitar...

113
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:28,398
Hye Gun. Jung Hye Gun!

114
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,807
You...

115
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:19,947
Hwang Hee Tae?

116
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:26,987
Hye Gun told me to come over
last night...

117
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:29,658
and we were supposed to meet here.

118
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:33,567
But when I came,
this place was totally empty.

119
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:37,297
The door wasn't locked,
and the chairs were all busted up.

120
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,908
They enforced martial law
nationwide last night.

121
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:47,408
The martial law was in effect
the whole time anyway.

122
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:50,177
Are you stupid?

123
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:52,388
This means that
the new military regime...

124
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:54,518
is on the verge of starting a coup.

125
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,258
I know.
But what does that have to do...

126
00:08:57,258 --> 00:08:58,727
with Hye Gun's disappearance?

127
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:03,457
I'm afraid
the Defense Security Command...

128
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:06,168
is behind this.

129
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:11,638
So...

130
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:14,238
- I was thinking...
- No.

131
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:19,008
What? I didn't say anything yet.

132
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:20,278
It's obvious.

133
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:21,778
You want me to ask my father...

134
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,278
if Hye Gun was taken, right?

135
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,918
Do you still not know
what kind of man my father is?

136
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,488
If I ask him, he won't stay still...

137
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,528
and make matters ten times worse.

138
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:35,158
Things will turn more dangerous
if I get involved.

139
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:41,868
Then...

140
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,238
what will you do now?

141
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,108
You said
Myeong Hee will be in danger...

142
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:47,337
if she gets involved with you.

143
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:51,577
That's why Myeong Hee and I
are leaving today.

144
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:54,847
What? Where to?

145
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:56,047
Anywhere.

146
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:57,878
As long as it isn't Gwangju.

147
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:02,217
If you're going to keep fighting,
go do it in Seoul.

148
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:05,687
If you're thinking of staying here,
wear a hat at least.

149
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:12,998
Sun Min?

150
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:17,297
Where's Hye Gun?
Did he not come home?

151
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:25,947
Myeong Hee.

152
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:31,378
Hey, little bear.

153
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:33,347
Don't you have training today?

154
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:36,758
We're human beings too, you know.
We need our rest on Sundays.

155
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:39,057
What brings you here suddenly?

156
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:42,498
Myeong Soo.

157
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:44,727
I...

158
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:48,898
will be leaving Gwangju for a while.

159
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:51,297
What? Why?

160
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:53,567
Where are you going?

161
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,437
When are you coming back?

162
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:58,278
I'll call the training camp later...

163
00:10:58,278 --> 00:10:59,778
Are you going abroad?

164
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:03,547
You said you weren't going
last time.

165
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:07,217
Goodness, I'm not going abroad.

166
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:10,717
I promised I'd go see you
compete at the Nationals.

167
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:14,488
I always keep my promise
no matter what.

168
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:16,197
You know that, right?

169
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:19,898
Are you going alone?

170
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:22,597
I'm going with a friend.

171
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:25,207
That's good enough for me.

172
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,908
Promise you'll come
to the Nationals.

173
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:29,638
You promised.

174
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:32,108
Goodness.

175
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:46,927
We need to take a detour
because of the protest.

176
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:48,927
Passengers headed
to Geumnam-ro or Gwangju Station...

177
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:52,197
- need to get off at this stop.
- Those darn demonstrations.

178
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:54,398
Don't they even get tired of it?

179
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:55,498
Darn it.

180
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:57,797
- Wait a minute.
- What's going on?

181
00:11:58,638 --> 00:11:59,707
What's happening?

182
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:03,278
Drag off all the college students!

183
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:15,587
Hey, come here.

184
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:19,528
I'm not a college student.
I'll show you my ID.

185
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:20,658
Come with me.

186
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,498
Let me go!
I'm not a college student!

187
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:24,227
You brat, how dare you?

188
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:26,628
Do you think this is a joke?

189
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:29,097
You little...

190
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:48,918
Who are you?

191
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:32,128
What are you doing? Go after them!

192
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:40,138
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

193
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:43,707
No. I'm okay.

194
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:46,577
What on earth is going on?

195
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:49,817
I don't know.
I heard something about martial law.

196
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:51,577
The situation seems pretty serious.

197
00:13:52,118 --> 00:13:53,217
Let's head to the station.

198
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:55,317
We'll be okay if we stay
off the streets and go around.

199
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:00,628
Hee Tae.

200
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,398
- Hee Tae...
- What? Why?

201
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,467
Darn, what is this?

202
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:14,937
I said I'm okay.

203
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:19,547
Hey, Myeong Hee.
What brings you here?

204
00:14:21,447 --> 00:14:23,878
- Hello.
- It's me again.

205
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:28,888
Myeong Hee, what are you doing here?
You're off today.

206
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:30,358
I'm here as a guardian.

207
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:31,587
What?

208
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:35,187
Who is this gentleman
being protected by you?

209
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:37,398
He has a guitar. Is he a singer?

210
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,927
His head is busted,
so maybe he's a college student.

211
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:41,268
He's my boyfriend.

212
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:43,797
Your boyfriend?

213
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:46,768
Is he really your boyfriend?

214
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:51,038
Yes. So please hurry up
and take a look at him.

215
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:54,508
Well, okay. Please have a seat.

216
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:01,288
Let me take a look at your wound.

217
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:05,488
Well...

218
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:09,227
He doesn't need any stitches,
but he may need a CT scan.

219
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,457
How long will a CT scan take?

220
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,567
You'll have to wait
until this evening.

221
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:16,567
We have so many patients
with head wounds.

222
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:19,967
Then I'll just leave
after you disinfect my wound.

223
00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:22,608
Come on. Are you a doctor?

224
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:24,577
Give me that.

225
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,047
Myeong Hee's boyfriend,
Mr. Hwang Hee Tae...

226
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:29,418
Hwang Hee Tae?

227
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:33,288
Your name sounds familiar.
Hwang Hee Tae... Hwang...

228
00:15:34,148 --> 00:15:35,518
It's from the banner!

229
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,788
Are you that Hwang Hee Tae
who went to SNU with top marks?

230
00:15:37,788 --> 00:15:40,727
My gosh.
So you are a doctor, after all.

231
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:43,727
As per Dr. Hwang's self-diagnosis,
just disinfect his wound.

232
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:46,197
Please do a CT scan too. We'll wait.

233
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:47,528
Myeong Hee.

234
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:51,067
- Get ready for a CT scan.
- Yes, doctor.

235
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:57,977
Is this the CT Scan Room?

236
00:15:58,138 --> 00:15:59,977
How many patients are waiting...

237
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:03,118
Myeong Hee, I'm really fine.

238
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:04,778
It's just a little scratch.

239
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:06,788
But that scratch is on your head.

240
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:08,288
You need to get a CT scan, at least.

241
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:12,888
Fine. Then let's get out
of Gwangju first.

242
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,197
I'll get a CT done
as soon as we get to another city.

243
00:16:16,197 --> 00:16:18,557
We're at a hospital right now.
What's the point?

244
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:20,097
We're not going anywhere
until you get tested.

245
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:22,467
Myeong Hee. Seriously...

246
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:24,768
Seriously what?

247
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:27,707
What's with that face?

248
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:30,977
If you're unhappy about something,
just tell me...

249
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:40,748
Stay still, you little punk.

250
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:46,158
All right. Let me ask you once more.

251
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:49,797
Who is behind
the recent torch protest?

252
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:52,697
I already told you.

253
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:55,567
College students...

254
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:58,597
It was all college students
who came out voluntarily...

255
00:16:58,597 --> 00:16:59,668
Are you kidding me?

256
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:07,177
I know there is someone
behind you all.

257
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:10,318
He made you start a rebellion,
didn't he?

258
00:17:10,717 --> 00:17:12,418
What are you talking about?

259
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:20,828
I've never even met such a person.

260
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:24,997
Are you still enjoying this?

261
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:28,497
Hey.

262
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:30,368
Dip him.

263
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:33,068
No! I'm sorry!

264
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:35,207
- Get up, you punk.
- Please don't!

265
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:37,207
- Get off me.
- I'm sorry!

266
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:39,207
Please don't do this!

267
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:40,777
Go on in.

268
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:43,318
Go on in, you little...

269
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:55,957
Gosh.

270
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,237
Here.

271
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:08,108
Go ahead and eat.

272
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,378
You didn't even eat your dinner.

273
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,578
Thank you.

274
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:17,977
If I go home,

275
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,418
my father would probably prepare
a feast for me.

276
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,187
Are you from around here?

277
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:30,858
I was born and raised here.

278
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:38,568
Anyway, I wonder how those spies
crossed the border.

279
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:42,207
And why did they have to crawl
all the way down here to Gwangju?

280
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:48,477
By the way, Corporal Lee...

281
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:53,388
How do we tell rebels apart
from ordinary students?

282
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:58,787
Do you want to skip dinner
tomorrow too?

283
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,628
Just follow the orders.

284
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:03,697
I'm sorry, sir.

285
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,267
The problem with smart ones is...

286
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:09,497
that they think too much.

287
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:18,878
You don't have to stay here with me.

288
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:21,677
Forget it.
The test results aren't out yet.

289
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:23,677
I'm really fine.

290
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:25,148
Come on.

291
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:29,088
Thank you for waiting.

292
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:31,658
Here you go.
Since you're a top student,

293
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:33,757
I'm sure I don't have to explain
anything to you.

294
00:19:34,187 --> 00:19:35,628
Doctor.

295
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:38,058
Take it easy. I was just joking.

296
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:40,267
It's a concussion.

297
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:42,168
Luckily,
there's no internal bleeding.

298
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,437
Are you still feeling dizzy
and nauseous?

299
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:47,937
Not anymore. I'm totally fine now.

300
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,608
Come on.
Don't shake your head like that.

301
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:53,177
Okay. Well then...

302
00:19:57,148 --> 00:19:59,388
- What's that sound?
- It's curfew.

303
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:02,457
What? There's still a few hours
until curfew.

304
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:03,787
Didn't you know?

305
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:06,128
With the martial law expanded,
the curfew has been moved up.

306
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:09,658
Hold on. What do we do then?

307
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:12,598
What else?
You're stuck here until morning.

308
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:14,027
- What?
- What?

309
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:17,197
Don't go wandering out after curfew
and get hit in the head.

310
00:20:17,197 --> 00:20:20,037
You can sleep in the lobby
or in an empty treatment room.

311
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:22,537
Now if you please,
I need you to empty that bed.

312
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:24,777
Gosh.

313
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:48,828
I've never met anyone
as stubborn as you.

314
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:51,037
I've never seen a grown man...

315
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:53,608
throw a tantrum like you either.

316
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:55,308
I didn't do that.

317
00:20:57,638 --> 00:21:00,378
If only we had gone straight
to the train station when I said...

318
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:02,818
Then you would've thrown up
on a moving train...

319
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:04,447
from that concussion you have.

320
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:06,947
Exactly.

321
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:09,658
If we'd stayed together
this morning,

322
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:11,888
I wouldn't have had a concussion
in the first place.

323
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:14,588
So what?
Are you saying it's all my fault?

324
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:16,158
No, that's not it.

325
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:19,068
I don't like your tone.

326
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:23,267
Whatever.
Just hurry up and lie down.

327
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:24,898
Come on.

328
00:21:25,638 --> 00:21:28,737
I'll go and check
if there are any extra beds.

329
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:30,338
Hold on.

330
00:21:30,408 --> 00:21:32,848
Why do you need an extra bed?
We can share the same bed.

331
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:37,247
Have you lost your mind?
We can't do that.

332
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:39,618
What are you talking about?
Last night...

333
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:43,088
- Gosh.
- You're embarrassing me.

334
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:44,918
Keep it down.

335
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:47,588
Last night, we shared a bed...

336
00:21:47,588 --> 00:21:50,257
even smaller than this one. So what?

337
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,997
Fine. You sleep in this bed.

338
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:56,338
- I'll go find an extra bed.
- Come on.

339
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:59,068
Forget it. I'll go.

340
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,767
You're a patient right now.

341
00:22:01,338 --> 00:22:03,378
Stop talking and lie down.

342
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:05,947
- I can help you.
- Just lie down.

343
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:23,227
What a stubborn woman.

344
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:27,467
I like that.

345
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,707
Hello?

346
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:34,707
Soo Chan, it's me.

347
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,608
Soo Ryeon.
Why is it so hard to reach you?

348
00:22:39,578 --> 00:22:42,618
I'm sorry. I've been a little busy.

349
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:46,517
How's Father? Is he feeling better?

350
00:22:50,757 --> 00:22:54,257
Yes, he just took his medicine
and fell asleep.

351
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:57,158
What about you? Is everything okay?

352
00:22:58,598 --> 00:23:01,927
I'm good.
Is everything okay with you?

353
00:23:02,537 --> 00:23:05,037
I heard there was chaos
in Gwangju today.

354
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,537
Hello?

355
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:13,207
Lee Soo Ryeon.
Where are you right now?

356
00:23:14,408 --> 00:23:18,148
Where else?
I'm at my place in Seoul.

357
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:21,687
Then hang up.
I'll call you back at your place.

358
00:23:21,687 --> 00:23:23,918
No, you can't.

359
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:25,818
Hee Tae is asleep.

360
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,588
He's a light sleeper.

361
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,197
I'm going to bed now.

362
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:32,798
I'll call you tomorrow. Good night.

363
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:34,628
Hey, Soo Ryeon.

364
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:00,427
Gosh.

365
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:14,668
What's wrong? Did it break earlier?

366
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:17,437
No, it's just a little scratch.

367
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:23,348
I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?

368
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:27,517
I had a dream.

369
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:30,217
What's wrong? Was it a nightmare?

370
00:24:33,427 --> 00:24:35,058
It was about what we saw earlier
in the day.

371
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,467
Why do you think
the soldiers did that?

372
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:55,177
Myeong Hee,
let me tell you a secret.

373
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,318
I've been struck by lightning,
a long time ago.

374
00:25:01,187 --> 00:25:02,217
What?

375
00:25:02,787 --> 00:25:04,418
- Really?
- Yes.

376
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:06,927
I went under an awning
to take cover from the rain,

377
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:08,658
and it hit my elbow like this.

378
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:11,058
Crazy, right?

379
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,427
I couldn't believe it either.

380
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:17,197
So all I did was study
how lightning works for a while.

381
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:20,368
But the reason was simple.

382
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:21,937
I was...

383
00:25:23,078 --> 00:25:25,138
right next to a payphone,
that's why.

384
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:26,507
So I still...

385
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:28,507
try to avoid being close
to payphones whenever it rains.

386
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:33,848
Same goes for what happened today.

387
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:36,957
It's like being struck by lightning.

388
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:39,658
We just...

389
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:43,197
happened to be standing
next to a payphone.

390
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,937
Everything will be fine
once we leave Gwangju tomorrow.

391
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:56,378
But what if it's like this
everywhere else?

392
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,017
Don't worry.

393
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:06,247
My intuition is always on point.

394
00:26:07,388 --> 00:26:10,888
I'm almost like a human canary.

395
00:26:14,427 --> 00:26:15,987
Okay, Mr. Human Canary.

396
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:17,828
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:26:18,158 --> 00:26:19,898
Try playing the guitar...

398
00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:21,398
and see if it sounds okay.

399
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:24,967
Okay. But in return,

400
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:27,108
we must go to the station
as soon as we wake up.

401
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:28,408
Don't be stubborn.

402
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:37,947
Let's see.

403
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:37,007
(Changsoo Bed and Breakfast)

404
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:38,308
Attention.

405
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:39,408
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

406
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,548
It's supposed to rain
in the afternoon,

407
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:44,477
so the training session
will be replaced by indoor practice.

408
00:27:44,477 --> 00:27:46,548
- No!
- Darn it.

409
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:48,548
Be quiet.

410
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:54,588
We were stuck in our rooms
all day yesterday.

411
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:56,128
Do we have to practice indoors
again today?

412
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,197
You heard him.
It's supposed to rain later.

413
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,267
Then we can go out for a run
before it starts raining.

414
00:28:02,937 --> 00:28:04,697
I feel all cooped up.

415
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:09,638
Things are getting tense
in the downtown area of Gwangju.

416
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:10,838
We'll be okay.

417
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:12,277
Make sure you lock it well.

418
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:20,418
- My gosh.
- Why are they taking them?

419
00:28:20,987 --> 00:28:23,257
- Look at that!
- They're dragging him!

420
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:25,987
- My gosh!
- Oh, no!

421
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:28,658
- What are they doing?
- Did you see that?

422
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:34,368
It's gutsy of you
to gather around like this.

423
00:28:34,368 --> 00:28:35,628
All of you, be on your way.

424
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:36,668
Officer.

425
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:38,838
You saw that too!
How could you not stop them?

426
00:28:38,838 --> 00:28:40,507
The police can't stop them.

427
00:28:40,507 --> 00:28:41,668
So please, just go home.

428
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:44,308
Are soldiers above the law?

429
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:46,947
- Move aside.
- You'll get everyone killed!

430
00:28:46,947 --> 00:28:48,048
Go home already.

431
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:59,418
Hey, let's just go to the bakery
and come back quickly.

432
00:28:59,628 --> 00:29:01,388
The class won't start until later.

433
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,027
Didn't you hear
what the teacher said?

434
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:05,527
The teacher told us not to go
anywhere near downtown.

435
00:29:05,658 --> 00:29:08,328
That just means
we shouldn't protest.

436
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:11,197
- Did you actually believe it?
- Hey, come on.

437
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:18,608
Why are you doing this to me?

438
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:24,747
Hey, isn't that the director?

439
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:28,717
My gosh. It is him.

440
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:32,457
Don't hit innocent people!

441
00:29:34,457 --> 00:29:36,628
- Don't hit him!
- Stop this now!

442
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:38,997
Don't hit our teacher!

443
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:47,507
What? What is going on?

444
00:29:48,068 --> 00:29:50,808
Hey, let's go. Come on.

445
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:51,233
(Emergency Room)

446
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:54,203
Myeong Hee.

447
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:04,813
What do you think you're doing?

448
00:31:04,944 --> 00:31:07,313
You promised you'd leave with me
in the morning.

449
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:10,154
The hospital is full of patients,
and we're running out of beds.

450
00:31:10,154 --> 00:31:11,354
You saw it yourself.

451
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:12,793
I did. That's why I'm saying this.

452
00:31:12,793 --> 00:31:15,324
Can't you see?
This isn't a normal situation.

453
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:17,094
No, it isn't.

454
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:19,563
Are you telling me
to leave my patients behind?

455
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:21,533
Yes, let's just go.

456
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:23,303
Hee Tae.

457
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:25,374
You might be disappointed in me,
but I can't help it.

458
00:31:25,374 --> 00:31:27,834
For me, our safety comes first.

459
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:29,644
I do understand.

460
00:31:29,773 --> 00:31:32,374
But can't you wait
until the worst is over?

461
00:31:33,914 --> 00:31:35,384
No. We must leave immediately.

462
00:31:35,384 --> 00:31:37,344
Don't you understand
what's going on here?

463
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:39,884
Why are you two
just standing around?

464
00:31:40,513 --> 00:31:42,684
Even interns
from other departments...

465
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:44,523
and students are helping out.

466
00:31:44,523 --> 00:31:45,723
I wonder why Mr. Hwang,

467
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,854
the top student
with a medical license, isn't.

468
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:51,834
If you want to help out,
put it on and step inside.

469
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:54,063
If you don't want to,
give it to Myeong Hee and leave.

470
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:57,033
Only medical staff are allowed
in the Emergency Room.

471
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:02,803
- I can't leave right now.
- Myeong Hee!

472
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:17,023
Seven o'clock.

473
00:32:18,184 --> 00:32:19,253
What?

474
00:32:19,723 --> 00:32:21,654
We're leaving
at seven o'clock sharp.

475
00:32:21,654 --> 00:32:24,023
I'll carry you out on my shoulders
if I must.

476
00:32:24,624 --> 00:32:27,733
Gosh, I can't believe this.

477
00:32:28,394 --> 00:32:30,604
The one who loves more always loses.

478
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,303
Hee Tae, you can stay
in the treatment room if you feel...

479
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:34,604
Seven o'clock, okay?

480
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:44,313
Yes.

481
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:46,453
Then we'll proceed as planned.

482
00:32:47,553 --> 00:32:50,723
Pardon? The martial law?

483
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:54,154
No, that's no problem.

484
00:32:54,354 --> 00:32:56,963
It's not going to have much impact
on the general public.

485
00:32:57,063 --> 00:32:58,533
We'll proceed as planned.

486
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:02,104
Man, this is bad.

487
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:04,003
What if they barge in here too?

488
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:07,733
Aren't you going for lunch?

489
00:33:10,674 --> 00:33:12,743
Why? Is everything okay?

490
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:15,414
The thing is...

491
00:33:16,384 --> 00:33:19,414
There's a big ruckus outside
because of the martial law.

492
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:24,553
If you're worried,

493
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:26,293
you can leave early today.

494
00:33:26,493 --> 00:33:29,824
Well, that's not why
we brought it up.

495
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:32,033
Goodness. Just go home.

496
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,993
Your family must be waiting for you
at home.

497
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:37,634
I'll also head home
as soon as I wrap things up.

498
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:44,074
Come on!

499
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:57,253
Hey, what are you doing here?

500
00:34:00,993 --> 00:34:02,694
He's my little brother.

501
00:34:03,223 --> 00:34:04,963
You said you were going
to the academy.

502
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:07,493
I'll take him.

503
00:34:13,473 --> 00:34:14,473
You wench!

504
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:20,414
All of you, on your knees.
And hands behind the back.

505
00:34:20,844 --> 00:34:21,944

- My goodness.

508
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:32,793
When will you be here?

509
00:34:32,793 --> 00:34:34,924
- In 5 minutes, sir.
- 5 minutes?

510
00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:38,123
Why are you standing around?
Get them!

511
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:41,433
Go get them.

512
00:34:42,034 --> 00:34:43,463
I'll watch these punks.

513
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:49,674
Keep your head down!

514
00:34:57,143 --> 00:34:58,483
They're gone. Get up.

515
00:34:59,284 --> 00:35:00,813
Hey, look at me.

516
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:03,654
Mr. Officer.

517
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:07,123
Everyone, get up.

518
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:09,063
It's okay. It's all right.

519
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:11,424
There are a lot of soldiers
over there,

520
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:12,864
so go this way.

521
00:35:13,534 --> 00:35:15,433
What are you waiting for? Run!

522
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:16,704
- Really?
- Yes, it's okay.

523
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:18,204
Come on. Let's go.

524
00:35:18,204 --> 00:35:19,804
- Go, hurry.
- Come on.

525
00:35:20,304 --> 00:35:21,474
Let's get out of here.

526
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:26,674
- Will you be okay though?
- Yes, just go.

529
00:35:53,674 --> 00:35:55,474
You said you were in Seoul
last night.

530
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:00,744
Did you come back to Gwangju
with Hee Tae after that?

531

Yes, this morning.

532
00:36:04,744 --> 00:36:06,083
You're lying again!

533
00:36:09,054 --> 00:36:10,853
Do you think I'm an idiot?

534
00:36:14,324 --> 00:36:16,264
You said I could come back
if things don't work out.

535
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:18,793
That's why I came back.

536
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:22,404
When I said you could come back,

537
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,034
I didn't mean...

538
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:26,574
you could join the protest
and take part in that ruckus.

539
00:36:26,773 --> 00:36:28,273
I didn't join the protest,

540
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:29,944
nor did I take part in the ruckus.

541
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:31,043
You didn't?

542
00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:34,373
You were being chased by soldiers,
covered in blood.

543
00:36:34,373 --> 00:36:35,483
Are you still going to deny it?

544
00:36:35,483 --> 00:36:38,853
Soo Chan,
this isn't a normal situation.

545
00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:40,554
I saw the soldiers dragging a kid...

546
00:36:40,554 --> 00:36:41,983
barely old enough to be
in middle school.

547
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:45,853
Would you have done nothing
if you'd seen it?

548
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:47,824
Are you okay with them dragging you?

549
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:51,364
What would you have done
if you'd run into Mr. Hwang, not me?

550
00:36:53,634 --> 00:36:56,063
You're still scared of him,
knowing what's going on?

551
00:36:56,503 --> 00:36:58,733
Why? Are you afraid
he'd hurt your business?

552
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,733
No! I'm afraid he'd hurt you.

553
00:37:05,713 --> 00:37:08,514
Mother said this one thing to me
in her final moments.

554
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:11,884
She asked me to look after you
in her place.

555
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:15,824
I can just close the business
if things go wrong.

556
00:37:16,154 --> 00:37:17,324
But if something happens to you...

557
00:37:18,183 --> 00:37:19,654
Father is bedridden too,

558
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,393
so if something bad
happens to you...

559
00:37:25,594 --> 00:37:27,134
How would I live?

560
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,204
Let's go home, okay?

561
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:40,543
If this is an abnormal situation
like you said,

562
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,213
let's stay home
until things calm down...

563
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:47,454
and try to look for another way.

564
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:49,523
Okay?

565
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:54,094
You can look...

566
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:56,393
for another way.

567
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:57,963
I'm not going home.

568
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:01,463
Soo Ryeon.

569
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:06,674
Even if you throw yourself
into that mayhem,

570
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,344
nothing's going to change.

571
00:38:12,844 --> 00:38:14,543
I may not be able
to change anything,

572
00:38:18,114 --> 00:38:20,384
but there are things I can do.

573
00:38:23,454 --> 00:38:24,683
Tell Father...

574
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:26,753
that I'm...

575
00:38:27,654 --> 00:38:29,063
in Seoul.

576
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:32,933
Soo Ryeon.

577
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:38,103
If you walk out that door now,

578
00:38:40,273 --> 00:38:42,373
I'll no longer think of you
as my family.

579
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:01,393
Mr. Hwang.

580
00:39:01,594 --> 00:39:02,793
Dress the wound...

581
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:04,194
and use this to triage the patient.

582
00:39:04,393 --> 00:39:05,494
- Pardon?
- Take this.

583
00:39:06,264 --> 00:39:07,663
Write down the patient's symptoms,

584
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:09,503
name, and age, and stick it on him.

585
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:11,933
If the patient can't be identified,
just make up a name.

586
00:39:12,204 --> 00:39:14,134
If anyone needs emergency surgery,
tell us right away.

587
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:15,174
Wait.

588
00:39:15,844 --> 00:39:17,404
I haven't even completed
my internship yet.

589
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:18,444
Why would you trust me with this?

590
00:39:18,444 --> 00:39:19,643
You said you passed the exam.

591
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:22,284
- It's the same as the practical.
- But...

592
00:39:22,744 --> 00:39:24,313
he's not a simulated patient.

593
00:39:24,313 --> 00:39:25,543
Just do it.

594
00:39:25,543 --> 00:39:27,554
I'm sure you're better
than that fool over there.

595
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:37,594
(Cho Young Hoon, 22, Head trauma)

596
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:39,634
Coming through! Make way.

597
00:39:39,864 --> 00:39:40,864
A new patient!

598
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:42,804
Doctor! Hurry!

599
00:39:43,304 --> 00:39:44,933
Please treat him right away.

600
00:39:45,204 --> 00:39:46,233
Hee Tae.

601
00:39:46,704 --> 00:39:49,244
- This looks like a stab wound.
- A stab wound?

602
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:50,974
He's been stabbed with a bayonet.

603
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:53,614
The other patients waiting outside
all have stab wounds.

604
00:39:57,043 --> 00:39:58,844
Excuse me. Move aside please.

605
00:39:59,683 --> 00:40:00,884
Myeong Hee,
get a saline drip started...

606
00:40:00,913 --> 00:40:01,954
and call Surgery.

607
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,623
- I'll see if we can book an OR now.
- Okay.

608
00:40:03,623 --> 00:40:05,353
Sorry, excuse me.

609
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:10,663
(Emergency Room, Nurse's Station)

610
00:40:10,663 --> 00:40:12,563
Send them to the OR in this order.

611
00:40:12,563 --> 00:40:14,264
- For this, just suture the wounds.
- Okay.

612
00:40:14,264 --> 00:40:15,804
Excuse me, doctor.

613
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:18,364
When will Kim Bong Seok
get his surgery?

614
00:40:18,704 --> 00:40:20,003
Kim Bong Seok...

615
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,773
Oh, we booked his surgery just now.

616
00:40:21,773 --> 00:40:24,543
Really? Thank you so much.

617
00:40:24,543 --> 00:40:27,244
Doctor, we need to book
an emergency surgery.

618
00:40:28,143 --> 00:40:29,683
A stab wound of the femoral artery.

619
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:31,713
What? What are you saying?

620
00:40:32,114 --> 00:40:34,454
Who are you to change the order?

621
00:40:35,154 --> 00:40:37,224
I'm sorry, but we must prioritize
emergency surgeries...

622
00:40:37,554 --> 00:40:39,494
- My gosh!
- My son needs urgent care too.

623
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:41,954
He needs to undergo surgery
immediately!

624
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:44,424
This patient will die
if he doesn't undergo surgery now.

625
00:40:44,424 --> 00:40:46,694
Sir, please let go of this and...

626
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,034
Who do you think you are?
The Almighty?

627
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:50,433
Are you the Almighty?

628
00:40:50,563 --> 00:40:52,163
Who are you to decide
who should go first?

629
00:40:52,163 --> 00:40:55,634
If my son dies
because he can't get surgery now...

630
00:40:55,634 --> 00:40:57,643
Will you take responsibility for it
if he dies?

631
00:40:57,844 --> 00:40:59,813
Will you take responsibility
for his death?

632
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:01,944
Goodness, calm down!

633
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:04,683
This will only delay
your son's surgery.

634
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:05,753
I'm sorry, doctor.

635
00:41:05,753 --> 00:41:07,683
Hee Tae, we've finished
triaging all the patients,

636
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:09,224
so go back to ambulatory care.

637
00:41:09,824 --> 00:41:11,253
- Let's go.
- Thank you, doctor.

638
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:12,424
Goodness.

639
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:43,724
Ms. Kim Bo Yeon?

640
00:41:44,483 --> 00:41:47,123
I'll disinfect your wound
and stitch it up for you.

641
00:41:47,393 --> 00:41:48,554
Hee Tae.

642
00:41:50,023 --> 00:41:51,023
Jin A.

643
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,933
Who knew I'd get to see you...

644
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:02,444
in your white coat?

645
00:42:03,444 --> 00:42:06,574
I see this brilliant light
radiating from you.

646
00:42:06,744 --> 00:42:08,444
Is this what they call an aura?

647
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,054
Keep your mouth shut, will you?

648
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:17,123
It's done,

649
00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:19,224
but you'll have to wait a little
for the CT scan.

650
00:42:19,393 --> 00:42:21,924
My, look at the precise stitches!

651
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:24,793
It almost looks like
you used a sewing machine.

652
00:42:26,634 --> 00:42:29,204
Jin A, are you all right?
No injuries?

653
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:30,503
I'm totally fine.

654
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:33,174
I'm very nimble,
unlike this slow turtle here.

655
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:36,643
They hit you on the head too.
I heard it.

656
00:42:38,944 --> 00:42:40,273
They hit you on the head?

657
00:42:40,813 --> 00:42:42,273
It's nothing serious.

658
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:44,713
Just like a teacher's finger flick
when you doze off in class.

659
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:46,954
Let me have a look.

660
00:42:54,094 --> 00:42:55,293
Keep your eyes on my finger.

661
00:43:02,764 --> 00:43:04,704
My gosh, what is this?

662
00:43:04,704 --> 00:43:06,034
You crazy fool!

663
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:07,503
Your friend is dying here...

664
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:08,933
and you get excited enough
to get a nosebleed?

665
00:43:08,974 --> 00:43:10,304
Do you have a death wish?

666
00:43:11,074 --> 00:43:14,574
Hee Tae, this isn't because
I'm overexcited or anything...

667
00:43:14,574 --> 00:43:16,284
You should get checked out
by a doctor too.

668
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:20,514
Myeong Hee is over there,
so go register with her. Okay?

669
00:43:21,114 --> 00:43:22,924
Mr. Hwang, you need to stitch up
these patients too.

670
00:43:22,924 --> 00:43:24,384
Oh, okay.

671
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,523
- Get yourself checked out.
- Okay.

672
00:43:32,364 --> 00:43:34,094
What? You little...

673
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:37,163
Gosh, what should we do?

674
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:40,204
- What is going on?
- Why? Is something wrong?

675
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:41,904
I went to the supermarket...

676
00:43:41,904 --> 00:43:44,244
that opened over there
for some side dishes.

677
00:43:44,244 --> 00:43:46,014
The owner of that place
is from Gwangju.

678
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:49,043
He said Gwangju is
in a state of chaos right now.

679
00:43:50,514 --> 00:43:51,643
Gwangju?

680
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,284
What do you mean, chaos?

681
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:58,424
He said soldiers have taken over
the streets of Gwangju.

682
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,724
It's as if a war has broken out.

683
00:44:01,023 --> 00:44:02,724
That's plain nonsense.

684
00:44:04,094 --> 00:44:06,134
If a war breaks out,
it would be on the front lines.

685
00:44:06,134 --> 00:44:07,233
Why would it be in Gwangju?

686
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:08,663
Who knows?

687
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:12,034
Anyhow, he said soldiers
are beating young people up...

688
00:44:12,034 --> 00:44:14,503
and arresting them.
It's a total mess.

689
00:44:17,674 --> 00:44:20,413
Bo Yeon? It's time for your CT scan.

690
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:24,043
Where's Jin A?

691
00:44:24,313 --> 00:44:26,554
She went to call my family.

692
00:44:28,284 --> 00:44:29,853
Did she register to see a doctor?

693
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:45,833
(Cashier)

694
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:47,904
(Registration)

695
00:44:50,244 --> 00:44:51,603
Excuse me.

696
00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:53,543
Hey, In Young.

697
00:44:53,574 --> 00:44:55,744
Is there another payphone
besides that?

698
00:44:55,744 --> 00:44:58,143
Oh, there's one in the Annex.

699
00:44:58,143 --> 00:45:00,683
- It's through that corridor.
- Thanks.

700
00:45:05,384 --> 00:45:08,054
I told her to see a doctor.
She just doesn't listen.

701
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,163
Goodness, that stubborn girl...

702
00:45:18,663 --> 00:45:19,804
Jin A!

703
00:45:24,273 --> 00:45:27,174
Jin A. Jin A!

704
00:45:51,003 --> 00:45:52,364
Hello?

705
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:54,804
Is anyone there?

706
00:46:10,023 --> 00:46:12,793
Hee Tae. Please save Seok Chul.

707
00:46:12,793 --> 00:46:15,994
Please save her.

708
00:46:23,304 --> 00:46:24,904
Jin A, what is your dream?

709
00:46:25,103 --> 00:46:27,034
My dream is to become
a radio producer.

710
00:46:27,174 --> 00:46:28,503
Can you show me around Seoul
this summer break?

711
00:46:28,503 --> 00:46:31,474
Show me TBC's broadcasting station
and your university too!

712
00:46:31,474 --> 00:46:33,213
It's a Teacher's Day present.

713
00:46:33,813 --> 00:46:36,244
Write a song that will win
the University Song Festival.

714
00:46:44,483 --> 00:46:45,753
Hee Tae.

715
00:46:46,194 --> 00:46:49,694
Please save her. You must save her.

716
00:47:42,143 --> 00:47:45,014
In Young. Did you see Hee Tae?

717
00:47:45,944 --> 00:47:48,583
He went to the Annex
to make a phone call.

718
00:47:50,324 --> 00:47:52,424
Why wouldn't he just use the phone
at the nurse's station?

719
00:48:09,873 --> 00:48:11,103
Please.

720
00:48:13,444 --> 00:48:15,043
Jin A, please.

721
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:20,454
You said you wanted to go
to the TBC broadcasting station.

722
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:23,454
Please come back.

723
00:48:28,554 --> 00:48:29,793
Hello?

724
00:48:31,123 --> 00:48:32,893
Can anyone help me?

725
00:48:33,793 --> 00:48:35,094
Hee Tae!

726
00:48:35,764 --> 00:48:39,974
Myeong Hee. Please go and get help.

727
00:48:42,634 --> 00:48:44,043
Jin A, please.

728
00:48:44,944 --> 00:48:46,974
Please come back, please.

729
00:48:57,384 --> 00:49:00,623
Jin A. Can you hear me? Jin A.

730
00:49:29,014 --> 00:49:30,583
Hang in there a little longer.

731
00:49:37,563 --> 00:49:38,824
Be careful.

732
00:49:44,864 --> 00:49:46,574
- Here, Sun Min.
- Okay.

733
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:48,574
(Yushin remnants, step down!)

734
00:49:49,003 --> 00:49:51,174
Sir, are you okay?

735
00:49:51,474 --> 00:49:53,114
Hang in there.

736
00:49:53,114 --> 00:49:54,873
Oh, dear.

737
00:50:03,924 --> 00:50:05,123
Hey!

738
00:50:06,054 --> 00:50:07,194
Mister!

739
00:50:12,023 --> 00:50:14,494
Mister. Hey!

740
00:50:15,393 --> 00:50:16,804
Name...

741
00:50:16,904 --> 00:50:18,264
What?

742
00:50:18,304 --> 00:50:19,804
Your name...

743
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:23,543
Wait here.

744
00:50:32,413 --> 00:50:33,683
I didn't get to...

745
00:50:42,324 --> 00:50:44,764
Mister. Hey!

746
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:54,304
I had caught you red-handed...

747
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,444
What?

748
00:50:57,074 --> 00:50:58,744
No, it's nothing.

749
00:50:58,744 --> 00:51:02,674
Can you write down a number
where I can reach you?

750
00:51:03,813 --> 00:51:05,614
Hey, look at me.

751
00:51:06,614 --> 00:51:08,284
Mr. Officer.

752
00:51:08,284 --> 00:51:11,224
- Will you be okay though?
- Yes, just go.

753
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:40,413
Mr. Officer.

754
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:45,623
Mr. Officer.

755
00:51:45,683 --> 00:51:47,393
Mr. Officer!

756
00:51:50,463 --> 00:51:53,094
Mr. Officer!

757
00:52:01,773 --> 00:52:03,603
Please don't do this.

758
00:52:03,603 --> 00:52:06,744
Do what? We didn't do anything.

759
00:52:07,643 --> 00:52:09,014
I know.

760
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:10,813
Stop it.

761
00:52:11,683 --> 00:52:14,313
She's just a young student.

762
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:16,523
Why are you harassing her?

763
00:52:16,523 --> 00:52:17,753
Who are you?

764
00:52:17,753 --> 00:52:19,384
Just let her go.

765
00:52:19,483 --> 00:52:21,753
I can vouch for her...

766
00:52:47,154 --> 00:52:48,454
Hee Tae.

767
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:56,253
The surgery went well,
and her vitals are stable.

768
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:58,224
She just went up
to the recovery room.

769
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:10,773
Thank you so much.

770
00:53:12,543 --> 00:53:16,114
If the CPR had been any later,
she wouldn't have made it.

771
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,313
You...

772
00:53:19,514 --> 00:53:21,313
saved Jin A.

773
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:39,233
We're already short of beds.

774
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:40,733
Patients are lying on mats
in the lobby.

775
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:42,333
There's no way
we can accept more patients.

776
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:45,844
But we couldn't refuse to accept
patients in this situation.

777
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:47,043
Deputy Director.

778
00:53:47,213 --> 00:53:49,713
More than half of the patients
are unidentified.

779
00:53:49,713 --> 00:53:51,344
With their medical bills aside,

780
00:53:51,344 --> 00:53:53,284
the military might suspect
we teamed up with the protestors...

781
00:53:53,284 --> 00:53:54,884
and attack the hospital.

782
00:53:56,784 --> 00:53:59,154
What kind of hospital
refuses to accept patients?

783
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:00,224
Deputy Director.

784
00:54:02,523 --> 00:54:04,224
Close the main gate
and continue to accept patients.

785
00:54:05,824 --> 00:54:07,864
The soldiers might see,
so turn off all the lights...

786
00:54:07,864 --> 00:54:09,034
except in the operating rooms
and the emergency room.

787
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:14,933
(Gwangju Pyeonghwa Hospital)

788
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:28,413
Eat even if you're not hungry.

789
00:54:29,114 --> 00:54:30,924
You haven't eaten all day.

790
00:54:34,994 --> 00:54:36,253
I guess...

791
00:54:37,063 --> 00:54:39,023
you really do have good intuition.

792
00:54:40,563 --> 00:54:42,194
I saw Jin A earlier,

793
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:44,364
and we even talked a little too.

794
00:54:45,963 --> 00:54:48,134
But I didn't even notice
she was hurt,

795
00:54:48,404 --> 00:54:50,174
let alone see any warning signs.

796
00:54:51,143 --> 00:54:52,744
She looked the same as usual to me.

797
00:54:54,974 --> 00:54:58,213
See? I'm a human canary.

798
00:55:03,724 --> 00:55:05,083
I'm sorry.

799
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,194
For what?

800
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:10,494
I shouldn't have been so stubborn.

801
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:13,634
I put you through so much.

802
00:55:15,663 --> 00:55:17,503
If I had believed your hunch...

803
00:55:18,463 --> 00:55:20,933
and left with you
either yesterday or today,

804
00:55:23,674 --> 00:55:26,003
you wouldn't have had to
go through this.

805
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:31,543
Thanks to your stubbornness,

806
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:33,884
Jin A lived.

807
00:55:45,694 --> 00:55:47,063
By nature,

808
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:49,333
I avoid risks before they happen.

809
00:55:51,003 --> 00:55:52,204
You're a person...

810
00:55:52,204 --> 00:55:53,904
who remains where you are
even when lightning strikes.

811
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,744
Anyway, thanks to you,

812
00:55:58,373 --> 00:56:00,373
for the first time in my life,
I didn't run away...

813
00:56:01,773 --> 00:56:04,514
and could be there
when Jin A collapsed.

814
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:08,454
That means...

815
00:56:09,514 --> 00:56:11,384
your stubbornness saved Jin A.

816
00:56:18,494 --> 00:56:20,134
It's time.

817
00:56:20,634 --> 00:56:22,433
Shall we head to the station now?

818
00:56:37,244 --> 00:56:39,954
Let me tell you something
as the human canary.

819
00:56:41,384 --> 00:56:43,154
Getting more patients
with stab wounds...

820
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:46,083
is not a good sign at all.

821
00:56:52,963 --> 00:56:54,494
Let's wait until the worst is over.

822
00:56:57,507 --> 00:56:58,836
Just until Jin A wakes up.

823
00:57:03,204 --> 00:57:04,543
Will that really be okay?

824
00:57:07,371 --> 00:57:08,541
I don't know.

825
00:57:08,974 --> 00:57:10,944
Maybe getting struck by lightning
made me reckless.

826
00:57:28,433 --> 00:57:31,333
We had a belief that we could handle
anything together.

827
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:34,404
And that inexplicable belief...

828
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:37,043
trumped all warning signs.

829
00:57:41,273 --> 00:57:42,974
But little did we know...

830
00:57:46,384 --> 00:57:47,483
Welcome, sir.

831
00:57:49,154 --> 00:57:50,384
The lightning was also...

832
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:52,654
nothing more than a warning sign.

833
00:57:56,554 --> 00:57:58,494
What was actually coming
toward us was...

834
00:57:59,724 --> 00:58:01,594
a tremendous storm.

835
00:58:07,804 --> 00:58:09,103
Lights off.

836
00:58:12,074 --> 00:58:13,744
In the face of the storm,

837
00:58:14,713 --> 00:58:16,574
the only thing we could do was...

838
00:58:18,344 --> 00:58:21,183
hold each other's hands
so that we wouldn't lose each other.

839
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:33,864
(Youth of May)

840
00:58:48,074 --> 00:58:49,313
How many times must I tell you?

841
00:58:49,313 --> 00:58:50,744
Don't step in unless you're told to.

842
00:58:50,744 --> 00:58:53,183
- I get it. Stop nagging.
- "Stop nagging?"

843
00:58:53,183 --> 00:58:54,954
A person collapsed here.

844
00:58:58,853 --> 00:59:00,753
I have to go.
I have to go there right now.

845
00:59:00,753 --> 00:59:02,253
Are you out of your mind?
The soldiers are firing.

846
00:59:02,253 --> 00:59:03,893
That's Myeong Soo's shoe.

847
00:59:03,893 --> 00:59:05,494
You want to wage war
against armed soldiers?

848
00:59:05,494 --> 00:59:07,194
They're massacring civilians.

849
00:59:07,194 --> 00:59:08,694
Why must we remain immaculate?

850
00:59:09,433 --> 00:59:11,264
Hee Tae, you were right.

851
00:59:12,134 --> 00:59:13,534
I'm a hypocrite.
