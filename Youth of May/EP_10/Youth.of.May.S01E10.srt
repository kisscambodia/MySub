1
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,709
So why do you keep provoking them?

2
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:17,320
They think you're the bad guy.

3
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,889
I don't care what they think.

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,630
The more I think about it,
the more baffled I get.

5
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:30,630
There are plenty of seniors.
How dare they order you to protest?

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,269
They're obviously trying
to dump it all on you...

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,150
because they don't want
to be dragged to Namsan.

8
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,840
It's my choice.

9
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:40,170
No one put me up to it.

10
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,209
Sure. Whatever, Mr. Fighter.

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,649
Everything you do bothers me.

12
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:53,190
And what's with this lame taste
in music?

13
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:57,060
You told me to request a song
I wanted to listen to.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,660
Why must you nitpick
about everything?

15
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:01,959
We really don't see eye to eye.

16
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,230
You say that all the time.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,469
Why did you team up with me then?

18
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:09,500
What do you think?

19
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:13,349
Probably because you couldn't find
anyone else to write lyrics.

20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,880
I'm sorry, but there are many people
who can do that.

21
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:18,979
Then what?

22
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,249
- Because I'm a nice person?
- You're saying that about yourself?

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,479
Have you gone mad?

24
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:30,020
That's what everyone else says.
They say I'm nice.

25
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,229
And that's why they all like me.

26
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,699
My goodness.

27
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,270
Kim Kyung Soo.

28
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,740
Don't be delusional.

29
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,569
You're not a good person.

30
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,990
You punks.
Do you think you're on a picnic now?

31
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,830
Hurry up! You're all so slow.

32
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,220
Hee Tae, the ambulance is arriving.

33
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,549
Oh, okay.

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,130
(Episode 10,
Goodness, Hypocrisy, Utmost Effort)

35
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,698
The martial law army headquarters...

36
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,768
Can't you write it properly?
What is this?

37
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,009
Do you have an accurate count?

38
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,940
Yes, I think so.

39
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,690
What are you doing here?

40
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,819
I thought you moved to Seoul
to get married.

41
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,129
I'll just get the medical supplies
and leave.

42
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,199
Don't mind me.

43
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,329
Why? Did your father-in-law
send you here to spy on us?

44
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,340
What?

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,698
Am I wrong?

46
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,470
Are you the Grim Reaper
or something?

47
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,440
Everyone who met up with you
has disappeared.

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,949
Did Hye Gun also go missing
after meeting up with you?

49
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,850
It was me, not her.

50
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,489
Hye Gun met with me
before he went missing.

51
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,319
Does that make me
the Grim Reaper too?

52
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,329
Why are you taking it out on her?

53
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,529
That's because her fiance is...

54
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,199
She moved out.

55
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,199
What?

56
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:57,639
She moved out.
Look at her. Can't you tell?

57
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:01,109
Both she and I have been helping
the victims for days, nonstop.

58
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,478
So don't waste your energy
attacking someone...

59
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,279
who's working toward the same goal
as you are.

60
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,499
Boo Yong, that thing...

61
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:24,260
Did you finish it?

62
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:28,700
What's with this handwriting?
Make the letters bigger.

63
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:32,640
Keep your head down, please.

64
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,368
- This will be quick.
- This is only his second day here,

65
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:37,710
but he's better at intubation
than Dr. Song,

66
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,478
who's been an intern
for half a year.

67
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,308
He already got the hang of it.

68
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:42,549
I know.

69
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,789
He passed the exam
with the highest score, you know.

70
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,650
Don't blatantly stare at him.
Let's just take a quick glance.

71
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:03,869
Does anyone have a moment to spare?

72
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:06,470
Please go take care of Kim Duk Bae.

73
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,779
Kim Duk Bae? The delirious patient?

74
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,909
The one who beats up everyone?

75
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,549
That's right.
He's just not getting better.

76
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,478
Give him more sedatives.

77
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,320
- And take this urinary bag...
- What?

78
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,090
- Attach this urinary bag too.
- Goodness.

79
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:22,460
Here.

80
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,299
I'll do it.

81
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,799
Really?

82
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,369
Myeong Hee, what are you doing?

83
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,070
What?

84
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:43,709
We have to admit the new patient.

85
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,309
The ambulance is arriving now.
It's an emergency patient.

86
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,379
We'll be right back.

87
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,179
Wait...

88
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,320
Clearly, he's already made himself
at home here.

89
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,160
- No one's coming?
- I'm coming.

90
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:04,229
How many times must I tell you?
Don't step in unless you're told to.

91
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,329
Why would you volunteer
to do the difficult tasks?

92
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,128
Why should that matter?

93
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:09,869
I just want to do the things
that I can do.

94
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,069
Does it mean other people...

95
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,785
avoid it because
they don't know how to work?

96
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:17,509
See? They keep forcing
everything on you...

97
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,780
since they know you'll say yes.

98
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,350
You do all the hard work too.

99
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,478
You covered the windows
with mattresses yesterday...

100
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,349
Do you think I did that
because I wanted to?

101
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,631
When bullets were literally
flying in through the windows?

102
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,890
I did it
because you were about to do it.

103
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,858
If I didn't,
you would've done it instead.

104
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,530
- I get it. Stop nagging.
- "Stop nagging?"

105
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,599
I'm saying this for your sake.

106
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,330
Wait, a patient has arrived.

107
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,439
(Emergency Medical Center)

108
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:49,679
The patient is 18,

109
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,630
and he's been shot in the hand
and lower abdomen.

110
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,879
He's been shot?

111
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:01,819
Let's prepare for surgery
right away.

112
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
Prepare plenty of blood
for transfusion.

113
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,629
Darn it.

114
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,329
Those darn punks.

115
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,998
Now they're even shooting civilians
with the guns meant to protect them?

116
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:18,799
Can you believe this?

117
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:22,210
What did the kid do to deserve this?

118
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,279
Jung Tae,
can't you come sleep at home?

119
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,390
I can give you a ride
back and forth.

120
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,219
I'm really okay.

121
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,488
No one has gone home.

122
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,619
They're all sleeping here.

123
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:39,928
I'm just so worried.

124
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:41,989
And your father may ask
to see you soon.

125
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,900
He never asks to see me.

126
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,369
What?

127
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,270
Anyway, I won't go.
I'm going to stay here.

128
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,379
Yes, ma'am.

129
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,020
Our training is being carried out...

130
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,119
strictly within the training camp.

131
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,020
No one is taking
a single step out of here.

132
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,119
So don't worry about Jung Tae.

133
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,390
Please call me if something happens.

134
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,059
Yes, of course.

135
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,999
Okay, goodbye.

136
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:21,929
Yes?

137
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,470
We're training strictly within
the training camp.

138
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:29,079
(Emergency Room, Nurse's Station)

139
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
What did they say?
Is Myeong Soo okay?

140
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,849
They're staying
strictly inside the training camp,

141
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,979
so he said not to worry.

142
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:42,789
If you're concerned,
shall we bring him here?

143
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,790
I'll go get him.

144
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:47,380
It's better for him to stay there
instead of seeing what goes on here.

145
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:49,629
It's safer too.

146
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,239
That punk.

147
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,420
You think you're so darn fast?

148
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,129
Are you crazy?

149
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,659
Soo Gon, get out of here now!

150
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,399
- You darn...
- Sergeant Hong!

151
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:27,998
Don't come any closer!

152
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,099
If you do, I'll kill this jerk!

153
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,508
You crazy punk.
Private Kim, what are you doing?

154
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:34,869
Shoot him now! Shoot him!

155
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm going to kill you!

156
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,180
Shoot him!

157
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,076
Due to the military's excessive use
of force,

158
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,769
hundreds of innocent civilians
have been injured.

159
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:02,800
Someone even died yesterday.

160
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,238
We must make
the troops withdraw immediately.

161
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,970
Withdrawing suddenly like this
won't solve anything.

162
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,908
What?

163
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:13,108
Do you think they were dispatched
for no reason?

164
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:14,810
It's more important to suppress
the mob...

165
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,420
that's causing this whole frenzy.

166
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,789
Whose side are you on right now?

167
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,290
We're gathered here
to sort this situation out.

168
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,920
We're not here to take sides.

169
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:29,229
Or perhaps, Father,

170
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,999
are you here
to represent one side in particular?

171
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:35,429
Please watch your mouth.

172
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,499
You're the ones
who should watch your mouths.

173
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,408
- What? What did you say?
- Did I say something wrong?

174
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:41,710
How could you say that
to an assemblyman?

175
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,950
These are the minutes from
today's emergency committee meeting.

176
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,119
Did you participate in the meeting
and write this yourself?

177
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,350
No, sir.

178
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:58,189
The officials who were present
at the meeting wrote them...

179
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,259
Mr. Hwang.

180
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,989
We are...

181
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,899
in positions
that require some legwork.

182
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,999
How will you control the situation
if you sit behind a desk...

183
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,470
and simply receive reports?

184
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,940
This really...

185
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,570
troubles me.

186
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,738
I mean it's safe to say
that the martial law...

187
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:17,840
has been expanded
mainly because of Gwangju.

188
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,580
I'll make sure to participate
in future meetings myself.

189
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,239
You loaded the bullets backwards.

190
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,169
- Did you do this on purpose?
- I'm sorry, sir.

191
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,839
Hey. Did you join this place
to protect the commies?

192
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,109
How can you call yourself a soldier?

193
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,450
Answer me, you punk.

194
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,779
How dare you load your bullets
backwards?

195
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,690
You stupid punk.
I can't believe you.

196
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,889
You're a darn disgrace.

197
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:22,940
Corporal Lee.

198
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,810
I'm sorry
about what happened earlier.

199
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,008
I just couldn't get myself
to shoot...

200
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,009
Do you think I fired that shot
because I wanted to?

201
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,019
Hey, Kim Kyung Soo.

202
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:37,820
Do you think that makes you
a nice person?

203
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,430
This is the army.

204
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,859
If you don't shoot, I have to.

205
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,069
Can you call yourself nice...

206
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,390
if you force things on others
to keep your own hands clean?

207
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,310
That's what you call being selfish.

208
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:56,009
I'm sorry, sir.

209
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:04,699
If you don't want to shoot anyone,
arrest them as quickly as you can,

210
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:07,519
before someone else shoots.

211
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,969
What on earth is that sound?
I've been hearing it all day.

212
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,680
Don't worry. It's probably nothing.

213
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,779
Chang Geun,
it's time to take your medicine.

214
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:39,619
Did Soo Chan really go to work
this morning?

215
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:41,920
Why?

216
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:43,969
Is he not answering the phone
at the office?

217
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,259
Did you actually see Soo Chan leave?

218
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,430
Tell me. What is going on?

219
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:53,769
Chang Geun.

220
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,440
You need to calm down first.

221
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,239
Tell me! What happened to Soo Chan?

222
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:15,950
Sir.

223
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:17,920
Sir.

224
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,960
Over here. A person has collapsed.

225
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,600
A man has collapsed. Please...

226
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,499
- My gosh.
- Who told you to move?

227
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,040
Do you want to die?

228
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,909
Get back in your position.

229
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,599
What are you all looking at?

230
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,950
Eyes down!

231
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,850
Take him away.

232
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,359
Sir...

233
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,509
Hey. Get back in your position,
you punk.

234
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,950
What? Who was arrested?

235
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,279
Soo Ryeon's older brother.

236
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:17,119
I'm not sure,

237
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,420
but can you check
if he's really been arrested?

238
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,119
What a hassle.

239
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,290
Tell them I'll check.

240
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,060
But what is going on?

241
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:30,128
People are calling all day,
asking me to find people.

242
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,430
There's no need for you to know.

243
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,100
Just keep to the house for now.

244
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,840
By the way...

245
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,149
Has Hee Tae called?

246
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:53,519
No.

247
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,220
You should check on him first.

248
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,620
Don't sit back and do nothing
just because he doesn't call first.

249
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,129
He never asks to see me.

250
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:10,570
Why aren't you asking
about Jung Tae?

251
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,520
Why are you asking me that
out of the blue?

252
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,909
Jung Tae is your son too.

253
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,450
You haven't seen him in days.
Aren't you worried about him?

254
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,149
Do you think I have the time
to worry about the kid?

255
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,239
That's enough of your nonsense.
Just give me that.

256
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,869
I finally got in touch with Mr. Lee.

257
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:44,700
He'll be here early in the morning.

258
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,769
That's a relief.

259
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:55,310
Once he gets here,
let's leave immediately.

260
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,979
Immediately?

261
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:04,220
Our plan was to stay here
until Mr. Lee comes to get Jin A.

262
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,530
What's with that face?

263
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,030
It's not like that.

264
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,469
Then what is it?

265
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:19,869
If something is bothering you,
just tell me.

266
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:22,609
It's just that...

267
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,939
if we leave,

268
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:28,080
the others will have to do
more work.

269
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:31,080
That's what I was worried about.

270
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,629
What? Were you thinking
that I'm a pushover?

271
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:45,500
No way.

272
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,100
I was thinking
you are such a good person.

273
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:52,469
But listen, Myeong Hee.

274
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,040
If you really want to be good,
you must put yourself first.

275
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,109
If you put others before yourself,

276
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,810
that's hypocrisy, I think.

277
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,780
Don't people normally call that
a sacrifice?

278
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,659
They would normally.

279
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,990
But...

280
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:15,459
to someone who loves you,
it's hypocrisy.

281
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,340
So for now,
let's put you and me first.

282
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,979
We'll be training indoors
again today.

283
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,179
Get ready and come out
as quickly as you can.

284
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,820
Gosh, I feel so cooped up.

285
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,530
Why can't we go out?

286
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:50,800
It's my birthday today,
and I'm stuck indoors all day.

287
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:54,330
Oh, my.
Is it your birthday today, Sung Il?

288
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:56,939
Gosh, then we should celebrate.

289
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,609
You said
you love comic books, right?

290
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,270
Should we go borrow some comics?

291
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:04,439
If we can't even train outside,
how can we go to the rental store?

292
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,849
My gosh.
We have two fast runners here.

293
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,570
You two can rush over there
and borrow some.

294
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,480
Gather around. I have a plan.

295
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,260
I'm going grocery shopping.

296
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,159
See you.

297
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:35,369
Excuse me, Coach.

298
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:39,280
Do you have any digestive medicine?

299
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:41,479
I think I have an upset stomach.

300
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,719
You have an upset stomach?
You, Jin Kyu?

301
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:48,050
- Then let me prick your fingers.
- What?

302
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:52,459
I think some medicine will do.

303
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:54,589
Medicine won't do any good.

304
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,959
Pricking all ten fingers
is the best remedy.

305
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,899
You still can't reach them?

306
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:37,839
You can't make
any long-distance calls?

307
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,540
It's just Gwangju
that's out of reach.

308
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:44,179
This won't do
I'll have to go there myself.

309
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,750
Go where? To Gwangju?

310
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:48,879
By yourself?

311
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:52,320
I've heard some terrible rumors.

312
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,290
That's why I should go there.

313
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,520
(From Kim Hyun Chul,
To Kim Myeong Hee)

314
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,030
I hope everything's fine.

315
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,398
Hyun Chul, where are you going?

316
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,269
Mother, I have to make
a quick trip to Gwangju.

317
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,570
Don't go. Stay with me.

318
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,780
Mother, have a seat for a second.

319
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:24,279
I'll come back as soon as I know
the kids are fine.

320
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,379
Don't worry and stay put, okay?

321
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,500
My goodness,
you look so beautiful, Mother.

322
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,540
See you later.

323
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:46,039
You don't have to come out.

324
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,669
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

325
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,918
Hey, let's get a box
of Choco Pies too.

326
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,118
We'll pretend it's a cake.

327
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,689
Is it your birthday?
You're not the one paying...

328
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:24,378
My goodness. You should stop.

329
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:27,409
What if the man dies or something?
You're going too far.

330
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,149
Round up everyone here!

331
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,628
End the martial law!

332
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:43,529
- End the martial law!

333
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,329

- Denounce media corruption!

335

End the unlawful firearms training!

336
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,299
- End the unlawful training!
- End the unlawful training!

337
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,108
- This is a democratic nation!
- This is a democratic nation!

338
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:56,979
- End the martial law!

339
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,938

- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

341
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:02,549
Denounce media corruption!

342
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,448
- Denounce media corruption!
- Denounce media corruption!

343
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,718
- Take your positions!
- End the unlawful training!

344
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,589
- End the unlawful training!
- End the unlawful training!

345
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,319
Denounce media corruption!

346
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,188
- Denounce media corruption!
- Denounce media corruption!

347
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:14,989
- This is a democratic nation!
- This is a democratic nation!

348
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,959
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

349
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,830
And halt!

350
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,099
- Until Mount Baekdu is worn away
- Until Mount Baekdu is worn away

351
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,178
- And the East Sea runs dry
- And the East Sea runs dry

352
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:34,549
- May the Lord protect
- May the Lord protect

353
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,519
- And preserve our country
- And preserve our country

354
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,789
- Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea
- Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea

355
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,490
- Aim!
- Such a splendid land

356
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,879
What's that sound?

357
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,129
(Release all arrested students!)

358
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:15,379
(Release all arrested students!)

359
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,669
Run. Run, now!

360
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,449
Come on, run!

361
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:16,779
I told you all to leave!

362
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,879
There aren't any tickets.
No tickets at all.

363
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:22,709
Goodness, why is everyone
gathered around here?

364
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,350
What do you mean?

365
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,218
There aren't any bus tickets?

366
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,648
My goodness.
All the Gwangju-bound buses...

367
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:31,859
aren't running at the moment.

368
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:35,029
Then how can I get to Gwangju?

369
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,759
I guess you'd have to walk.

370
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,628
No vehicle is allowed to enter.

371
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:39,958
You don't have any tickets left?

372
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:43,129
Goodness, no.
There are absolutely no tickets.

373
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:45,270
What do I do?

374
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,139
Excuse me. If you have an extra map,
may I borrow it?

375
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,679
You'll actually walk there?

376
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,108
Everyone's trying to flee
Gwangju now.

377
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:55,580
Why would you go there?

378
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:00,590
It'll take him over three months
to get there with that limp.

379
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:03,618
My gosh...
I'm looking for Lee Jin A.

380
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:05,119
Lee Jin A. Jin A...

381
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,260
Excuse me...

382
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,159
Myeong Hee.

383
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,040
Jin A...

384
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,770
Oh, dear.

385
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,879
Jin A.

386
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,820
Jin A, Daddy is here.

387
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,689
Jin A.

388
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,290
Open your eyes, please.

389
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,899
She regained her consciousness
in the morning.

390
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:46,560
She's just asleep now
because of the drugs.

391
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,070
So don't worry.

392
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,600
Thankfully, the surgery went well.

393
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:55,010
Yes, Myeong Hee told me everything.

394
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,109
Thank you, Mr. Hwang.

395
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,409
I didn't really do anything.

396
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:06,619
It would've been really dangerous
if it weren't for Hee Tae here.

397
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:09,949
He saved her life.

398
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,369
Thank you, Mr. Hwang.

399
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,709
My gosh... Thank you so much
for saving Jin A's life.

400
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,480
Oh, Myeong Hee.

401
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,119
Go to the ER
and say goodbye to everyone.

402
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,719
I'll go see Seok Chul and join you.

403
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,290
Sure. Take your time.

404
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,459
Myeong Hee.

405
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,800
I forgot to say this earlier
because I was so frazzled.

406
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,409
On my way here, I saw the protest.

407
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,668
And the soldiers were beating up
the protesters...

408
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:05,139
and even firing their guns.
It was utter chaos.

409
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,349
You didn't know what was going on,
so you must've been shocked.

410
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,619
I sure was shocked,
but that's not important. Your...

411
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,820
Your brother.
Is he still in Gwangju?

412
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,359
My brother? Why do you ask?

413
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,159
I can't stop thinking...

414
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,169
that I saw your little brother
in that mayhem.

415
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:36,908
The kid looked
just like your brother.

416
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:40,109
He was wearing a tracksuit
like your brother always does.

417
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,948
Gosh. But I couldn't go up to him...

418
00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:48,689
because I was dodging bullets
in that chaos.

419
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,399
Please... No...

420
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,409
Goodness, the phone's been ringing
off the hook.

421
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,050
Hello, we're training
strictly within the training camp.

422
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,590
You'd like to speak to him?

423
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,520
Just a moment, please.

424
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,189
Hey, Digestive Drink.
Your sister's on the phone for you.

425
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,500
Kim Myeong Soo.

426
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,570
What's going on?

427
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:37,669
Where is Myeong Soo?

428
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,570
It hurts so much...

429
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,638
Doctor, please hurry.

430
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:46,080
(Emergency Room)

431
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,418
What happened?

432
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:25,948
Why are there so many patients
with gunshot wounds?

433
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:28,249
The troops opened fire on civilians.

434
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,590
The soldiers shot them?

435
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,489
Are these all the victims?

436
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,259
No, the victims lying in the streets
would fill an entire truck.

437
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,559
We're already so short-staffed.

438
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,198
But we were told
they'd even shoot ambulances,

439
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:41,029
so no one wants to go out there.

440
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,070
What? They'll shoot ambulances?

441
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,000
They even shoot little kids.
They obviously don't care.

442
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,310
Let's go out there and help.

443
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:52,939
We can't let people
die in the streets.

444
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:54,510
Let's take our cars...

445
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,350
and pick up the injured.

446
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,280
Who wants to come with me?

447
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,329
Goodness, please help her.

448
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:14,429
- Doctor, will my son be okay?
- Of course.

449
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,230
Have you lost your mind?
Where do you think you're going?

450
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,140
I'm going to get patients.

451
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,669
There are people
with gunshot wounds everywhere.

452
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,568
They're not the only people
out there.

453
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,278
There are soldiers everywhere too.

454
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,199
Are you saying
we should just sit back and watch?

455
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,179
Someone has to go there.

456
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,249
But why does that someone
have to be you?

457
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,220
Do you have two lives?

458
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,319
I have to go.

459
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:41,430
Stop being so righteous!

460
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,329
Don't tell me what to do!

461
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:03,410
What do you think you're doing?
Get out.

462
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:05,779
I'm not getting out until you do.

463
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:08,420
Get out. You don't have to do this.

464
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,890
Don't tell me what to do.

465
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:17,430
Mr. Hwang, are you coming with us?

466
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,829
Yes.

467
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,940
(The 61st Preliminaries
of the National Sports Festival)

468
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,910
Man, I can't believe this.

469
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,950
Doctor, this way.

470
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,559
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

471
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,289
Myeong Hee,
I'll carry her on my back.

472
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:52,900
Careful, easy.

473
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,078
Let's go.
Get in the ambulance! Hurry!

474
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,180
Myeong Hee, get in. Hurry.

475
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,220
Get in. Hurry up.

476
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,268
If you leave it tangled,

477
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:34,539
it's your loss,

478
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,578
whether it's your shoelaces
or training.

479
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:40,110
Isn't running fast
the most important thing to you?

480
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,599
Where are you going?

481
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,999
Get in the car.
Let's get out of here.

482
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,769
Hee Tae, I hear a kid crying
from over there.

483
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,369
Have you gone mad?
The soldiers are shooting at us.

484
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,869
I must go. I have to go check!

485
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,340
Kim Myeong Hee!

486
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,409
What if it's Myeong Soo?

487
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,679
Why would he be here now?

488
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,348
Mr. Lee said he saw Myeong Soo.

489
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:24,829
He saw him here looking all lost
when the soldiers were firing.

490
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,559
That's Myeong Soo's shoe.

491
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,170
Myeong Hee. Myeong Hee!

492
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,880
Darn it. Who's that wench?

493
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,679
I got this. I'll go get her, sir.

494
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,119
Hey!

495
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,730
Myeong Soo.

496
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,860
Myeong Soo...

497
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,419
If you don't want to shoot anyone,
arrest them as quickly as you can,

498
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,760
before someone else shoots.

499
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,510
Kim Kyung Soo.

500
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,289
Hee Tae.

501
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,500
Myeong Hee, what are you doing?
Get in the car! Mr. Hwang!

502
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,779
Myeong Hee, let's go.

503
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,809
Come on, Myeong Hee.

504
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,079
- Get in, Myeong Hee.
- Quick!

505
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,340
Myeong Hee.

506
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:57,340
Myeong Hee!

507
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,229
Goodness. How will you find them...

508
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,789
in this mayhem?

509
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:19,900
Please fix a meal for the kids
if I'm late.

510
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,099
You rascals!

511
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:28,670
Coach, the North Korean army...

512
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:31,940
The North Korean army
has invaded our country!

513
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,539
What?

514
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,289
Be careful.

515
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,289
Go.

516
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:03,010
Are you two all right?

517
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,639
Your brother called earlier.

518
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,349
He says he's back
at the training camp safe and sound.

519
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,289
Stop. What brings you here?

520
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,960
Good day, sir.

521
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,589
I have some urgent business
in Gwangju.

522
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,699
Civilians are not allowed to pass.
Please go back.

523
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:02,329
Sir.

524
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:05,469
I'm a vendor at Yangdong Market.

525
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:08,170
My kids are in Gwangju
at the moment.

526
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:10,539
Please let me through.

527
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,860
One per person, okay?

528
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,119
Those who have served in the army
get first dibs.

529
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,530
Come forward.

530
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,570
Hey.

531
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:40,840
Where did you guys get the guns?

532
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:42,819
We got them
from the Reserve Forces' armory.

533
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,779
What are you planning to do
with the guns?

534
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,010
You want to wage war
against armed soldiers?

535
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:49,510
Then what?

536
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:51,699
Are we supposed to do nothing
and just let them shoot?

537
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,289
Did you not see the flyers
they distributed today?

538
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,389
They're trying to make us
look like mere rioters.

539
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,089
Why give them a reason...

540
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,129
They're massacring civilians.

541
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,630
Why must we remain immaculate?

542
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:06,399
Is it lawful for soldiers
to shoot innocent civilians?

543
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,929
And is going against it unlawful?

544
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:09,730
What is the law to begin with?

545
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:13,099
The law was made
so the people could be protected.

546
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,639
You do what you need to do.

547
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,780
I'm going to do
what I think is right.

548
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,678
Those who have served in the army
get first dibs.

549
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:26,920
Come forward.

550
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,119
Are you sure it's Lee Soo Chan?

551
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,429
Don't bother. I'll handle it myself.

552
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,860
Okay, keep me updated.

553
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,769
What was that call about?

554
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,539
Oh, that.

555
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:51,139
The rioters robbed another armory.

556
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,179
Things are going according to plan.

557
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,526
(Head of Anti-communist
Investigation, Hwang Ki Nam)

558
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,880
Why do you look so worried?

559
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:00,780
Is it because of your son?

560
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,590
My son? What do you mean?

561
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:06,619
Well...

562
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:09,690
Your son was arrested in the past...

563
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,530
while helping commies.

564
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,269
Oh, that...

565
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,170
If you're referring to his arrest
for treating a suspect,

566
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,839
it was just a misunderstanding
that happened...

567
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,280
because my son is a medical student.

568
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,539
They released him right away.

569
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:32,250
So he was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

570
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:34,920
Then I'm relieved.

571
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,190
But you know...

572
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,360
Your son.

573
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,530
Where is he now?

574
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:50,469
He recently moved to Seoul
with his fiancee.

575
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,570
Oh, he's in Seoul now?

576
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:55,309
Are you sure?

577
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:01,710
Sir, are you here
to keep an eye on me?

578
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,320
I'm saying this just in case.

579
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:12,658
Make sure your son stays away
from trouble.

580
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:15,489
If he's caught in the wrong place
again at this critical time,

581
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:17,559
it'll definitely look suspicious.

582
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:57,269
This punk...

583
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,349
Myeong Hee.

584
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,409
Hee Tae, you were right.

585
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:48,750
I'm a hypocrite.

586
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:55,829
Earlier, in that alleyway...

587
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,059
the moment I checked the face
of that injured kid,

588
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,969
I felt relieved,

589
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,940
because it wasn't Myeong Soo.

590
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,239
He was probably someone's son...

591
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:13,210
and someone's little brother too.

592
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,980
But at that moment, I felt relieved.

593
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,329
Is that wrong?

594
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,599
I feel relieved too...

595
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,160
whenever I see that
you're not the one who's been hurt.

596
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:42,769
Is it wrong to hope
for someone you love...

597
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,409
to be safe?

598
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:48,510
If that's the case,
I'll just be a bad person then.

599
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,219
Nice people always tend to regret
their wrongdoings.

600
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:04,260
Bad people feel nothing at all.

601
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,130
A real hypocrite...

602
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:13,139
never thinks of him or herself
as a hypocrite.

603
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:17,570
I didn't tell you
about Myeong Soo...

604
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:21,110
on purpose.

605
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,079
In case you wouldn't let me go.

606
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:26,880
You did the right thing.

607
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,289
If I knew it was
because of Myeong Soo,

608
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,119
I would've never let you go.

609
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,989
I would've gone alone.

610
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,630
Is it okay for you to be in danger
but not me?

611
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,969
Well, I have nothing left.

612
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,369
Even if something happens to me,

613
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:54,280
you'll have Myeong Soo...

614
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:56,409
and your parents.

615
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,780
But if I lose you,
I'll have nothing left.

616
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,260
So from now on,
just leave it to me...

617
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,090
when it comes to doing
dangerous things.

618
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm not telling you what to do.
I'm asking you sincerely.

619
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:45,099
Come on, no need to worry.
I'm just feeling a bit cold.

620
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,940
What's going on out there?

621
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:57,340
Did the North Korean Army
really invade us?

622
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:59,840
It's not the North Korean army.

623
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,510
It's our own army.

624
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,218
I'm telling you,
it's the North Korean army.

625
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:09,550
Why would our soldiers
shoot our own people?

626
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,659
Why did the soldiers
suddenly turn bad?

627
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:16,788
Guys, don't you remember
"Mazinger Z?"

628
00:48:16,789 --> 00:48:20,460
The real villain was Dr. Hell,
who tried to conquer the world.

629
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,098
There's probably a real villain...

630
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,969
who's controlling the soldiers
like his puppets.

631
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:35,380
Take that punk away.

632
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,780
Let's get going.

633
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,289
- Hey, you!
- Come over here!

634
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,489
- Come here!
- Follow me.

635
00:48:49,889 --> 00:48:52,800
- Let go of me!
- Take him away.

636
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:05,940
Then...

637
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,809
Who's the real villain?

638
00:49:08,909 --> 00:49:11,079
What is he trying to conquer?

639
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,050
I can't stand
this childish nonsense.

640
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:38,780
Mr. Hwang.

641
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,079
So I've come to help you after all.

642
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,989
I won't help you twice,
so be careful.

643
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:52,760
By the way,

644
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:56,130
do you know where your sister is?

645
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,789
I can't reach her.

646
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,769
There's a car waiting outside,

647
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:11,369
so don't go outside
and take care of yourself for now.

648
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,179
Sir.

649
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:18,050
Please release the others too.

650
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:22,420
They're all innocent people
who were dragged here. Please.

651
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:26,219
At least the injured, or the kids...

652
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:36,130
Stop blabbering
and just live a quiet life.

653
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,328
I'm holding myself back...

654
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:40,840
from throwing your whole family
in prison.

655
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,690
Stop moving around, you punks.

656
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,229
Private Kim Kyung Soo...

657
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:08,460
still doesn't want to fire
his weapon.

658
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,369
Open your eyes.
You should see this yourself.

659
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,840
See how much they're suffering
because of you.

660
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,050
What do you think?
Do you think you can shoot now?

661
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:30,789
I knew it.

662
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,920
You don't care
if your comrades die or not.

663
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,130
All you care about
are those hopeless rebels.

664
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:48,139
Get back up, you punk.

665
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,769
Kim Kyung Soo.

666
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,480
You're not a good person.

667
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,449
There's no such thing
as a good person to begin with.

668
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:01,219
It's all about making
the best choice for each moment.

669
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:04,550
But...

670
00:52:06,219 --> 00:52:08,730
at least you don't force others
to make that choice for you.

671
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:11,530
That doesn't make you a good person.

672
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,429
It just means you're strong.

673
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,969
I like you
because you're a strong person.

674
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,940
She was a nurse.

675
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:30,750
What?

676
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,519
I can't shoot someone
who isn't a rebel.

677
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,909
Myeong Hee, what are you doing?
Get in the car! Mr. Hwang!

678
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,949
Come on!

679
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,590
Seok Chul is alive.

680
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,300
She's in Gwangju right now.

681
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,209
You don't have to give us a ride.

682
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,909
I'm just dropping you off
on my way to get more blood.

683
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:08,179
That's the least I can do
for a comrade...

684
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:09,959
that shared a near-death experience
with me.

685
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:11,779
Shall I drop you off at the station?

686
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,619
Oh, how about...

687
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,550
we go see Myeong Soo
before going to the station?

688
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:20,590
Can we?

689
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:23,860
You'll feel reassured
once you see that he's okay.

690
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,929
You should give him back
his shoes too.

691
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:30,199
Goodness, all this romance
is making me cringe.

692
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:33,139
Then what?
Where shall I drop you off?

693
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:36,210
- It's near the terminal...
- Myeong Hee.

694
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,380
What are you doing here?

695
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,489
Just come with me.
Myeong Soo is waiting too.

696
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,158
Oh, we were headed
to his camp right now...

697
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:56,690
Let's go back to Naju.

698
00:54:57,389 --> 00:54:59,598
We should get out of this place
right now.

699
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:00,960
Just take Myeong Soo with you.

700
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:03,429
- I can take care of myself.
- Kim Myeong Hee!

701
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,049
I'll go help Dr. Yoo for a bit.

702
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,749
No, you don't have to.

703
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,819
My, I'm relieved.
We're short-handed here.

704
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,449
I'll go start the ambulance.

705
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,889
I'll leave you to talk.

706
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:35,929
(Gwangju Pyeonghwa Hospital)

707
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,030
How can a father and daughter
be so icy to each other?

708
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,730
It won't be easy for you
once you get married.

709
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,800
Now I know how she turned out
so hard-boiled.

710
00:56:13,769 --> 00:56:15,339
"Hard-boiled?" No way.

711
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,139
She's as soft as tofu.
It worries me.

712
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:21,079
You must be blinded by love.

713
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:22,879
And there's nothing
you can do about that.

714
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:29,820
Anyway, how did the other hospital
get so much blood?

715
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:31,119
Through donations.

716
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:34,190
They got that much
from employee donations?

717
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:35,929
No, from the citizens.

718
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,189
They made announcements
about a blood shortage,

719
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:40,429
and people are still lining up
to donate their blood.

720
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,150
Why? Is it a piece you like?

721
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,650
Not me. My friend likes it.

722
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:06,559
What in the world?

723
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:28,710
(Gwangju Pyeonghwa Hospital)

724
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:32,210
How many times must I tell you?
I'm not going.

725
00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:36,949
Why? Did he ask you
to stay with him?

726
00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:39,159
Does he want to marry you?

727
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,789
Stay out of my life.

728
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,730
What about his parents?

729
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:46,699
Do they even know
you two are dating?

730
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,460
If he can't even introduce you
to them,

731
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:49,829
how can you trust him?

732
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,440
You're going to regret this.
Come with me to Naju.

733
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:57,010
Don't say that.
You don't understand.

734
00:57:58,539 --> 00:57:59,710
Ms. Kim!

735
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:04,909
Dr. Yoo and Mr. Hwang...

736
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,389
(Youth of May)

737
00:58:31,539 --> 00:58:33,238
What are you talking about?
The two left together.

738
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:34,808
But there was only one person there.

739
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:37,479
He might be dying somewhere.

740
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,078
And there's nothing I can do.

741
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:41,448
They say they found Hee Tae
and are keeping him there.

742
00:58:41,449 --> 00:58:42,749
Did they really say that?

743
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,649
He's going to ruin your life
in the end.

744
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,919
He's not the one who ruined my life.
It's you.

745
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,960
I'll kill everyone in your family.

746
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,928
Hee Tae might die.

747
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:54,959
What are you talking about?

748
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,400
I'll stay right here
even if lightning strikes...

749
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,670
so that Hee Tae can find me.
