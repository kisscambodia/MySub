00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,079
(Gwangju Station)

2
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:15,849
The police are investigating
an unidentified skeleton...

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,450
found at a construction site
in Gwangju this morning.

4
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:22,018
The police have sent the skeleton...

5
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,419
to the National Forensic Service...

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,990
for DNA analysis
in order to identify the victim.

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,629
Those in the political circles
are saying...

8
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:30,799
the skeleton may belong...

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,268
to one of the victims
of the Gwangju Uprising...

10
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:35,469
and that the blood sample may need
to be compared with the families...

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,110
of those who disappeared
during the Gwangju Uprising.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,839
Who's he? Another relative
of a missing person?

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,550
No. He's an informant.

14
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:49,349
- An informant?
- Yes.

15
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,519
(Video Survey Room A)

16
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,580
Father.

17
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,949
Why are you out here
instead of coming inside?

18
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,480
I didn't even know you were coming.

19
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:00,289
I'm fine.

20
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:04,390
You're not hurt, are you?

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,329
No. Shall I go and get my bag?

22
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,730
No, no.
You wait here a little longer.

23
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,329
I'll go get your sister.

24
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,969
Can't I come with you?

25
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:17,838
It's dangerous outside.
Stay here and don't go anywhere.

26
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:20,209
I won't be too long, okay?

27
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,350
Aren't you Jung Tae's mother?
Why aren't you coming inside?

28
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,649
Would you mind
getting Jung Tae for me?

29
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,450
Okay.

30
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,790
- See you soon, Father.
- Sure.

31
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:37,820
Go on.

32
00:02:57,309 --> 00:03:01,679
(Episode 11, Mudeung Stadium)

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,850
If he can't even introduce you
to them,

34
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,050
how can you trust him?

35
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,350
You're going to regret this.
Come with me to Naju.

36
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,959
Don't say that.
You don't understand.

37
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:12,290
Ms. Kim!

38
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,330
Dr. Yoo and Mr. Hwang...

39
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:20,869
They were in a hit-and-run.

40
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,610
(Emergency Room)

41
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,910
(Gwangju)

42
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:42,359
Where's the other one?
Is he on his way?

43
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,660
There was only one patient.

44
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,029
What are you talking about?
The two left together.

45
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,329
There's another person.

46
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,529
But there was only one person there!

47
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:50,959
Hurry.

48
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,200
Dr. Yoo.

49
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:00,610
Dr. Yoo.

50
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,950
Dr. Yoo. Are you all right?

51
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,450
Are you awake?

52
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,688
Myeong Hee.

53
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:18,059
Dr. Yoo. Hee Tae.
What happened to him?

54
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,959
He wasn't at the site.

55
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:23,030
The punks who hit us took him.

56
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,230
They took him?

57
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,699
They drove right into our car,

58
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,410
then took Hee Tae who had fainted.

59
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,540
They loaded him
into their car and left.

60
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,050
(How to Use)

61
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,960
Myeong Hee.

62
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,559
Here you are.

63
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:55,389
I thought you'd left with Hee Tae...

64
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:02,499
Soo Ryeon.

65
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,509
Hee Tae...

66
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:08,840
What about him?

67
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,280
Myeong Hee, what happened? Tell me.

68
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,350
Myeong Hee.

69
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,110
Are you awake?

70
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,509
I know I'm not one to talk,

71
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,639
but you, Father...

72
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,679
You're quite something yourself.

73
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,948
(The Lord will keep your going out
and your coming in, )

74
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,509
(from this time forth,
and forevermore.)

75
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:10,840
Leave for Seoul in 10 minutes.

76
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:13,568
There are no buses or trains.

77
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:14,910
You'll go by car.

78
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,540
Treatment...

79
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:19,650
can wait until you're in Seoul.

80
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,980
Where's Lee Soo Ryeon?

81
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,550
I don't know.

82
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,089
Then we'll say
she disappeared in Seoul...

83
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,759
and her whereabouts are unknown.

84
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:32,789
What are you trying to do?

85
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,689
You were never in Gwangju.

86
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,498
You can brainwash me all you like,

87
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,600
but that won't change the fact
that I was in Gwangju.

88
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,678
Then I can destroy all evidence
that you were here.

89
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,210
For example...

90
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,850
That brat who's at the hospital.

91
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:09,030
The doctors, nurses,
and patients there...

92
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,959
So many people saw me.

93
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,229
Will you blow up the hospital
or something?

94
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,970
That's not a bad idea.

95
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,868
I can wipe out the building...

96
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:19,739
and blame it on the spies.

97
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,340
Why? Do you not like that?

98
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,979
Then how about we say...

99
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,249
we killed the spies
that infiltrated the hospital?

100
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,689
I must have become
your Achilles' heel.

101
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,488
This is when
you should be your busiest,

102
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:43,160
and you're trying so hard
to erase my existence.

103
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,499
My being in Gwangju...

104
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,699
seems to be a huge threat to you.

105
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,770
Am I wrong?

106
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,150
Let me go.

107
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:04,780
If you let me go,
not only will I leave Gwangju,

108
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,319
but I'll disappear from your life
for good.

109
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,420
Just as I expected.

110
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,489
You're very smart,

111
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,489
but you're bad at reading
someone's mind.

112
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:21,499
Once you think you know
your opponent's moves and get cocky,

113
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,840
it's practically the same
as exposing your next move.

114
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:33,850
You've lost.

115
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,150
Just stay here
until the situation comes to an end.

116
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:56,569
Myeong Hee.

117
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,639
I requested the search team...

118
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,938
to look for him extra carefully.

119
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:02,209
Doesn't the search team...

120
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:05,809
only look for dead people?

121
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:09,520
What are you talking about? No way.

122
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,449
They're even finding fugitives
that are on the run.

123
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:17,490
I'm sure he was dragged away
after being hit by the car.

124
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,359
His father is probably behind it.

125
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,770
If Hwang Ki Nam is really behind it,

126
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,500
he probably wasn't taken
to Defense Security Command.

127
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,068
So you should calm down...

128
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,109
There's nothing I can do.

129
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,780
He probably bled a lot.

130
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,250
He might be dying somewhere
right this moment.

131
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,620
But there's nothing I can do.

132
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,290
Myeong Hee.

133
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:50,319
Pull yourself together.

134
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,490
Why isn't there anything you can do?

135
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,959
You need to wait for Hwang Hee Tae.

136
00:09:57,859 --> 00:09:58,900
You just...

137
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:02,030
want me to wait like this?

138
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,939
I'm certain Hwang Hee Tae
will come back.

139
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:08,140
So until then,

140
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,609
you must stay strong. Okay?

141
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,280
Hee Tae.

142
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,620
You don't have to leave us
on purpose.

143
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,290
I'll just drop by
the hospital nearby.

144
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,290
I have nothing to say to my father.

145
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,130
Can you not go and just stay here?

146
00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:35,199
I'll be right back, so wait for me.

147
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:43,679
Myeong Hee.

148
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,410
Kim Myeong Hee.

149
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,078
Come with me now.

150
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,948
We must go before it's too late.

151
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,149
Myeong Soo and your mother
are waiting for you too...

152
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,689
I'm headed to the hospital.

153
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,359
What are you talking about?
Why the hospital?

154
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,390
Why would you go back there?

155
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,000
He said he'd come back
to the hospital.

156
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:06,829
I'll wait for him there.

157
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,500
You just take Myeong Soo and leave.

158
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,270
What are you talking about?

159
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,769
What kind of father in this world...

160
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,109
would leave his daughter
in this kind of dangerous place?

161
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:21,449
I can't leave him behind either.

162
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:34,030
Oh, goodness.

163
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,098
Oh, dear. My gosh, what happened?

164
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:44,499
My poor baby.

165
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,808
My poor baby, what happened to you?

166
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:50,438
My goodness.

167
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:52,109
Oh, dear.

168
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,279
My poor baby. I can't believe it.

169
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,819
Soo Chan has arrived safely
thanks to you.

170
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,219
We're indebted to you yet again.

171
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,058
Thank you so much, Mr. Hwang.

172
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,530
No need to thank me.

173
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,399
Let's each take care
of our own children from now on.

174
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,328
Yes. I promise something like this
will never happen again.

175
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:14,869
We were unfortunate this time...

176
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,439
I'm not talking about your son,
but your daughter.

177
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,339
Sorry?

178
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,369
Soo Ryeon is in Seoul...

179
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,410
She's in Gwangju right now.

180
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,510
I've found my son
and he's with me now.

181
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,050
So you should look carefully
for your daughter as well.

182
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:38,818
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

183
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:41,688
As of this moment,
Operation Choongjung...

184
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:44,160
will change its focus from
suppression to total lockdown.

185
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:47,999
Barricade all roads
leading out of Gwangju,

186
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,870
in order to stop the rebels
from escaping.

187
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,910
Any rebel that disobeys orders
is to be shot immediately.

188
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:05,849
They really had...

189
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,189
the eyes of a hunting dog
that even kills humans.

190
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,719
- What?
- You know...

191
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,790
those soldiers from the other unit
that passed by.

192
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,599
I don't know
if it's because of my insecurity,

193
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,099
but they really seemed like
they actually killed people.

194
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,750
Will we be able to go back there?

195
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,559
Will we be able to...

196
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,429
return to Gwangju?

197
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,179
Hello, ma'am.

198
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,809
You must be working really hard.

199
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,209
Soo Chan.

200
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,920
Are you hurt? What happened?

201
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,219
Well, it's...

202
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:15,520
Don't worry about it.

203
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,089
The thing is...

204
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:20,689
I came here to ask you something.

205
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,130
What is it?

206
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:28,130
Soo Ryeon and Hee Tae...

207
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,500
are back in Gwangju.

208
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:38,979
So you knew.

209
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:40,679
Then...

210
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:43,719
do you know where Soo Ryeon is?

211
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,219
- Well...
- Please tell me if you know.

212
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:51,819
I must find Soo Ryeon
before Mr. Hwang hurts her.

213
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,989
I heard that he found Hee Tae
and has him now.

214
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,999
So it's only a matter of time
before he finds Soo Ryeon.

215
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,530
Did he really say that?

216
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,599
He said he has Hee Tae with him?

217
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:05,939
(Gwangju Pyeonghwa Hospital)

218
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:08,969
(Gwangju Pyeonghwa Hospital)

219
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,979
You're really going to stay here...

220
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:15,109
until Hee Tae returns?

221
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:24,490
Mr. Hwang took Hee Tae.

222
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,260
You know what that means, right?

223
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,229
It means if you keep staying here,

224
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,459
you don't know
when you'll fall in danger too.

225
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm worried about you...

226
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:38,339
as much as Soo Ryeon, Myeong Hee.

227
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:45,910
When I was young,

228
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,478
whenever my dad took me
to the market,

229
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,250
there's something he always said.

230
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,089
He told me to stay put
and not go anywhere...

231
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,920
if I let go of his hand
and got lost.

232
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,889
He told me I'd go missing
if we both wandered around...

233
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,130
looking for each other.

234
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
He told me to stay put...

235
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:08,699
until he found me.

236
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,380
I'll stay right here
even if lightning strikes...

237
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:20,109
so that Hee Tae can find me.

238
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,589
Myeong Hee.

239
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,829
This is what I liked so much
about you.

240
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,500
You were always brave and strong.

241
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,640
Be careful.

242
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,979
And call me anytime
if you need my help.

243
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,979
Okay.

244
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,710
Jung Tae. Are you up?

245
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,049
Come downstairs to eat.

246
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,849
Your father will be home soon.

247
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,780
Didn't I tell you not to stomp
on the stairs?

248
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,010
Haven't you even washed up yet?

249
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,779
I'm not hungry.

250
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,918
Even if you're not hungry,

251
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:38,078
your father is coming home
for the first time in days.

252
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,220
You should eat with him.

253
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:41,849
Go wash up.

254
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,440
Never open this door again.

255
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:18,020
Have you lost your mind?

256
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,550
What's going on in our house?

257
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,430
Like I said,
I'm doing this for my family.

258
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,430
For your family?

259
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,259
But the person locked up in there
is your own child.

260
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,669
No. What's in there is
a ticking time bomb.

261
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,500
Just like your father.

262
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,440
Thanks to your mighty father,

263
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:44,180
we've been stuck in this countryside
for ten years now.

264
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:47,378
It's my first chance in ten years.
Do you understand?

265
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,980
I can't be hugging a bomb
just because we're family.

266
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,250
I won't make
that stupid mistake again.

267
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,229
(Male, 29)

268
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,375
(Navy trousers, purple shirt,
brown jacket, brown shoes)

269
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:11,899
(Deceased)

270
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,639
Lee Soo Ryeon.

271
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,849
Soo Chan.

272
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,050
I did suspect that.

273
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:31,490
Now that Hwang Hee Tae
has been taken away,

274
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,690
it should be my turn next.

275
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,260
But Hwang Ki Nam is a threat...

276
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,869
to every single person here.

277
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,668
I can't go back home...

278
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,699
just to save myself.

279
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,940
What about Father?

280
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:50,469
I'm not asking you
to come back home for good.

281
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,750
But shouldn't you at least
go and see Father once?

282
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,750
If I see him right now,

283
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,290
I won't be able to leave home again.

284
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:06,020
Soo Ryeon. Now I understand...

285
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,490
why you must do this.

286
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:11,128
But must you really
turn your back on your family?

287
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,930
- In a situation like this...
- All these posters...

288
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,240
were put up by people
with missing family members.

289
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,309
Without even knowing
whether they're dead or alive,

290
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:24,480
they cut out pictures of them
and made these posters.

291
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,588
(Kim Sung Wook, 18)

292
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:38,889
At least everyone in our family
is alive...

293
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,159
and we know that.

294
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,800
We should be grateful...

295
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:49,569
Soo Chan.

296
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:04,220
I heard everything from Soo Ryeon.

297
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:08,819
Judging from how you look,

298
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,159
you must not be sleeping or eating.

299
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,290
Do you think this will make people
praise you for your loyalty?

300
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,700
I can't sleep even if I lay in bed.

301
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,470
And I don't feel hungry.

302
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:22,628
Don't worry too much.

303
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:26,240
I doubt even the evil Hwang Ki Nam
could harm his own child.

304
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,838
He would do anything.

305
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,138
Still, they're father and son.

306
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:35,550
What kind of parent would kill
his own child?

307
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,450
What are you talking about?

308
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:49,790
You... Do you have any idea
what his father,

309
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,960
Hwang Ki Nam, is like?

310
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,930
I do.

311
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,540
You do?

312
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:05,439
And you still dated his son?

313
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,550
Hee Tae didn't do anything.

314
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,519
His only fault is
that he's his father's son.

315
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,649
That's precisely the problem.

316
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,789
Do you think
he'll be any different...

317
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,719
from his savage father?

318
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,790
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

319
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,059
After being stigmatized
all your life yourself,

320
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,800
how could you say
the same thing as Hwang Ki Nam?

321
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:37,838
Follow me.
Come with me to Naju right now.

322
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,510
Let go of me. Let go!

323
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,578
You should stop here.

324
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:45,550
He's going to ruin your life
in the end.

325
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,119
He's not the one who ruined my life.
It's you.

326
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,629
- How could you...
- Stop it, both of you!

327
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:02,869
Stop fighting.

328
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,599
Please stop.

329
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,089
(Emergency Room)

330
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:18,079
Don't waste your energy.

331
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,010
No one outside can hear you anyway.

332
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,849
The people in this house
will hear me, at least.

333
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,690
Isn't that why you came?

334
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,439
Don't you want to know
what's happening outside?

335
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,859
The martial law army has retreated,

336
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,859
so everyone's celebrating.

337
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,169
They have no idea
it means isolation, not liberation.

338
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,369
Gwangju is now
a rat trapped in a cage.

339
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,409
They'll slowly bleed to death
unless they surrender.

340
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,980
Just like you.

341
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,889
I finally understand.

342
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,930
My mother said
she'd rather let her lungs rot...

343
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,069
than receive treatment
with your money.

344
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,169
I think I understand her now.

345
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,119
I don't understand why both you
and the morons outside...

346
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:39,290
are so stupid.

347
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:42,260
As long as you keep quiet
and behave,

348
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,629
you'll be let go sooner or later.

349
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,399
What's the point of being let go?

350
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,440
You'll just lock me up again
when you feel anxious.

351
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:53,598
That's not the same as being let go.

352
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,609
I'm just on a longer leash.

353
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,180
I am not your pet dog.

354
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,450
So...

355
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,379
stop interfering with my life.

356
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,690
I cannot do that.

357
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,319
I have already paid the price.

358
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:15,159
Oh, that's too bad.

359
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,159
I don't think I can go on
playing the good son.

360
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:23,940
I think I should start
with protesting.

361
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,940
I was already arrested before.

362
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,270
The repentant Head of Anti-communist
Investigation's son?

363
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,180
That would paint a pretty picture.

364
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:36,878
Or should I go for
disguised employment?

365
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,349
Teach students at night...

366
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,619
You should know
when to stop fighting back.

367
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,559
You're not the only person
who can ruin my life.

368
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:53,099
So stop interfering with my life.

369
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:56,770
You were an orphan
and I took you in.

370
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,500
Yet, you forget your place
and act up?

371
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:01,939
Why am I an orphan...

372
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,480
when my father is
alive and well right here?

373
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,149
Don't get the wrong idea.

374
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:15,190
I chose you to be my son.

375
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,520
If not for my selection,
you are an orphan.

376
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,430
The orphan
who begged for funeral expenses.

377
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,800
The corpses in the street
at least have families to get them.

378
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:30,030
No one will look for you...

379
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,899
as you bleed to death in here.

380
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,770
And then...

381
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,409
nothing will happen,

382
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:44,349
as if you never existed
in the first place.

383
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,690
The orphan...

384
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,760
is not me but you.

385
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,899
No one will choose you
to be their family.

386
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:05,970
Sir, there's an emergency call.
You must head back.

387
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,800
(Gwangju Pyeonghwa Hospital)

388
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,109
Father, when are we going back
to Naju?

389
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,059
Should we kidnap Myeong Hee?

390
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,489
You grab her arms,
and I'll grab her legs.

391
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,399
Then we could take her back to Naju.

392
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,369
It's no use taking
just her outer shell with us.

393
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,309
Her spirit will remain here.

394
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:18,809
What's with her anyway?

395
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:21,849
I understand she loves Hee Tae,

396
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:25,280
but shouldn't her family matter more
to her than anything?

397
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,530
Do you know who gave me this watch?

398
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,240
Isn't it something
Grandpa passed down to you?

399
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:50,608
No. Actually, it was passed down...

400
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,409
to my brother.

401
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:57,649
Then as he was leaving home,
he passed it down to me...

402
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,849
when I was just about your age.

403
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,349
Why did he leave home?

404
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:09,960
My brother...

405
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,030
also had something
that mattered more than his family,

406
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,129
just like your sister.

407
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,398
You never know what'll happen
when you grow up.

408
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,279
You might also find something
that matters more.

409
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,639
I don't think so.

410
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,710
To me, my family will always
matter more than anything.

411
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:34,389
Goodness. Come here, my boy.

412
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:41,889
What did you think
of Mudeung Stadium?

413
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,500
It was a lot bigger
than the schoolyard, right?

414
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,700
Of course, the schoolyard
can't compare with Mudeung Stadium.

415
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,409
It's the same thing.

416
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,510
Your family, of course,
matters to you.

417
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,750
But sometimes,
you find things in life that are...

418
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,649
much larger and more important,
like Mudeung Stadium.

419
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,629
It's not that your sister
doesn't care about her family.

420
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:20,970
But she can't come home yet
because of something more important.

421
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,339
Here.

422
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,919
Hello?

423
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,649
Jung Tae, is that you?
It's me, Myeong Soo.

424
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,959
Kim Myeong Soo.
Are you back in Naju?

425
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,598
No. I'm still in Gwangju,
because of my sister.

426
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,368
Your sister? What about her?

427
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,969
She's waiting for Hee Tae.

428
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,999
She won't step outside the hospital.

429
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,079
So I want to ask you.
Has Hee Tae come home?

430
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,710
Haven't you heard anything?

431
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,020
Hee Tae...

432
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,418
might die.

433
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:18,358
What? What are you talking about?

434
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:21,890
My father...
What he did to Hee Tae...

435
00:34:27,729 --> 00:34:30,069
Are you really not going to tell me
who that was?

436
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:32,399
Hwang Jung Tae.

437
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,669
Aren't you concerned?

438
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:39,539
- What?
- There's no sound...

439
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:41,749
coming from the study anymore.

440
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:44,850
What if Hee Tae is already dead?

441
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,649
If Father can do this
to his favorite son,

442
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,589
who knows if he'll lock me up too
in the future?

443
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,129
That's never going to happen,
Jung Tae.

444
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,970
Your father and Hee Tae just had
a small disagreement, that's all.

445
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:02,769
Mom.

446
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:06,370
Can't you let him go?

447
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:09,470
Father isn't home right now.

448
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,180
I can't.

449
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:18,819
Father will let him go
as soon as he calms down.

450
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,050
Don't worry, okay?

451
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,589
I...

452
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:29,629
I'm going back to the camp.

453
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,458
What? Don't you know how dangerous
it is out there now?

454
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:34,870
Any place...

455
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,640
would be less scary than home.

456
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,359
Wait.

457
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,569
Can I...

458
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:12,740
ask you for a favor?

459
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,010
Please...

460
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,080
call the hospital.

461
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,979
If Myeong Hee is still there,

462
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,519
please tell her that I'm safe...

463
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:32,089
and that she should go back to Naju.

464
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,859
I'm sorry...

465
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,600
but I can't do that for you.

466
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,168
That look won't do you any good.

467
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:45,870
You already know...

468
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,240
that there's nothing I can do
in this house.

469
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,939
The only thing I can give you...

470
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,350
is just a cup of water.

471
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:58,648
You must hate
and resent me for that...

472
00:36:58,649 --> 00:36:59,649
Mother.

473
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:04,220
I do not resent you.

474
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:07,930
I never hated you.

475
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,300
I understand how you feel.

476
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,640
I'll ask for something else then.

477
00:37:23,169 --> 00:37:24,810
Take Jung Tae...

478
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,109
and leave this house.

479
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,479
Jung Tae is still young.

480
00:37:56,569 --> 00:37:58,280
Hey, wake up.

481
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:00,209
Wake up, okay?

482
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,179
Pull yourself together.

483
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,310
You moron.

484
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,129
I'll kill...

485
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:25,069
everyone in your family.

486
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:29,769
Why?

487
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,979
10-33 Wolhyang-ri, Wolhyang-myeon,
Hampyeong-gun.

488
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,249
Your grandmother's place.

489
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,919
It's a desolate area,

490
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,749
and just perfect
for your ailing mother.

491
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:46,589
Unless she's there like your father
to look after your grandmother,

492
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,830
no one will know who lives there.

493
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,800
Naturally,

494
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:56,069
no one will know who dies there.

495
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,580
Jung Hye Gun.

496
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:12,350
Let's end this quickly.

497
00:39:13,379 --> 00:39:14,620
Isn't it tough on you?

498
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,260
Let's go and see your parents.

499
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,560
Hey. Say I'm taken by
Defense Security Command.

500
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:30,169
If I drop your name,
will your father get me out?

501
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,770
Will he?

502
00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:38,140
Give it a go.

503
00:39:38,379 --> 00:39:40,879
The moment you even say
one syllable of my name,

504
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,379
my father will kill you.

505
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:04,640
Father.

506
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,770
Hee Tae's father.

507
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:11,239
It's me.

508
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,439
Hee Tae's friend Hye Gun.

509
00:40:20,649 --> 00:40:22,850
What is this fool saying?

510
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,759
Sir. Why are you pretending
not to know me?

511
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,229
You said you'd let me off
if I mentioned Hee Tae.

512
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,559
It's me, sir.

513
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,629
I'm Hye Gun, Hee Tae's best friend.

514
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,799
Let go.

515
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:42,109
Darn you.

516
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,009
Let go of me. Let go, punk.

517
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,149
Darn you. What did you say?

518
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,879
You deserve to die.

519
00:40:53,649 --> 00:40:56,988
How dare you threaten me?

520
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:00,020
Who said you could say that to me?

521
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,329
Just die.

522
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,129
Die already. Just die.

523
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,790
Dr. Yoo was discharged.

524
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,718
His family came and took him home.

525
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:34,189
- Goodness, he went home?
- Yes.

526
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,628
That's great.

527
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:38,000
I was worried he was badly hurt.

528
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,640
Hey.

529
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:48,810
Does Mr. Hwang have no family?

530
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,710
Pardon?

531
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,979
I mean, he went missing...

532
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,379
but no one is asking
or looking for him.

533
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,680
Does he have no one else?

534
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,218
The militia got us medical supplies.

535
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:07,059
If you need anything for the ER,
come and get it.

536
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,930
- That is just great.
- It is.

537
00:42:09,689 --> 00:42:11,060
I'll go and get it.

538
00:42:49,029 --> 00:42:52,200
I look forward to May every year.

539
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:02,379
Why are you working on your own
and tiring yourself out?

540
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:17,409
You see, sir,

541
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,819
I left my spot
only to go to the toilet, but...

542
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:36,370
It was you.

543
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,109
You did it.

544
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,779
Jung Tae, go to your room.

545
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,149
Hwang Jung Tae, go, now.

546
00:46:47,899 --> 00:46:49,969
No, don't get up.

547
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:55,109
Oh, dear.

548
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,969
(Regular savings account)

549
00:47:17,899 --> 00:47:21,239
That's the money I saved
to send Myeong Hee to college.

550
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,040
And I also saved the money
she sent me all this time.

551
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,108
I know it's not much,

552
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:30,580
but it'll be enough
to get you two settled.

553
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,648
You should give this
to Myeong Hee yourself...

554
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:38,259
No need. You can hold onto it.

555
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,290
Myeong Hee will just throw a fit
and refuse to take it.

556
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,399
Now, this money...

557
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:48,930
belongs to you both anyway.

558
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,810
Father.

559
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:03,410
Also...

560
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:12,759
Can you give this to her too?

561
00:48:20,129 --> 00:48:21,629
Although Myeong Hee...

562
00:48:22,029 --> 00:48:25,169
met a lousy father like me
and suffered all her life,

563
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,439
she is truly...

564
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:33,739
a precious child.

565
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:39,549
I hope you both forget
about the tragic past...

566
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,189
and cherish each other
and live happily.

567
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:47,919
We will.

568
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,140
Kim Myeong Soo.

569
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:39,640
Are you upset
because of your sister?

570
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:43,480
Whatever.

571
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,159
Have some of these.

572
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,160
- Oh, gosh. Thank you.
- No problem.

573
00:49:57,259 --> 00:49:58,859
You should thank her.

574
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,169
Okay. Go on and eat it.

575
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,370
Here. You can have the big one.

576
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,169
Go on. I already ate.

577
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,359
(Blood Donation)

578
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,069
Father.

579
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,540
I think I understand now.

580
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:52,620
Something as large and important
as Mudeung Stadium.

581
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:56,450
What did you say?

582
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:03,160
I like these rice balls.

583
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:04,930
What?

584
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:14,239
I'm glad you're here.

585
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:16,809
They already searched this place
last time,

586
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,679
so it'll be safe for the time being.

587
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,439
We'll just stay
until the lockdown is over.

588
00:51:22,509 --> 00:51:25,049
- Oh, this is...
- Right.

589
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,250
Hello, I'm Hwang Hee Tae.

590
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,689
So is this...

591
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,988
Yes, the one in the banner.

592
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:40,399
Is he the reason
you mentioned last time?

593
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,830
"Reason?"

594
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:45,069
Father, let's go inside.

595
00:51:56,609 --> 00:51:59,020
Can you really walk?

596
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,549
It's quite far, you know.

597
00:52:01,689 --> 00:52:05,419
We always used to walk
before there were buses.

598
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:12,859
I've marked the inspection points
guarded by the soldiers.

599
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,830
So please be careful.

600
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:18,569
Thank you.
It was a safe trip thanks to you.

601
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,100
Myeong Soo.

602
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:22,910
Here.

603
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:26,640
Thank you.

604
00:52:30,509 --> 00:52:32,719
Take care then. Let's go.

605
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,719
Be careful, sir!

606
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,799
Are you really not going to look?

607
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,568
Don't you want to know
what's inside the envelope?

608
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:52,899
I don't want to know.
Stop talking and face forward.

609
00:52:55,069 --> 00:52:58,710
Gosh, you're truly blessed.
You're blessed with love.

610
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,649
If only I had a father like that,
I'd be the happiest guy on earth.

611
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,679
You're so spoiled, you know that?

612
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,918
Children who were raised
in happy families...

613
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,589
always turn out to be spoiled.

614
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,930
Why aren't you saying anything?

615
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:32,609
Even you aren't reacting
to my jokes now.

616
00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:35,039
I don't have anyone left
in this world anymore.

617
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,210
Don't...

618
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,549
Don't ever say that again.

619
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,790
What?

620
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,989
Don't say you don't have
anyone left.

621
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,790
Don't say it anymore.

622
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,830
I mean...

623
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:58,068
It's just that
you weren't saying anything,

624
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:59,640
so I was just joking...

625
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,710
Are you mad?

626
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:06,339
Yes, I'm mad because you said that.

627
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,548
The entire time I was waiting
for you,

628
00:54:09,549 --> 00:54:12,049
I kept thinking of the things
you said to me.

629
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,750
You said I have Myeong Soo
and my parents...

630
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:17,919
but you...

631
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,160
don't have anyone beside you
except for me.

632
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,528
- That was...
- The more I thought about it,

633
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:26,899
the angrier it made me.

634
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,468
You made it sound like
I'll be okay...

635
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:31,069
even if I don't have you.

636
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:35,100
- Myeong Hee.
- I'm not okay.

637
00:54:36,469 --> 00:54:38,439
If I lose you,

638
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,509
I don't have anything left either.

639
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:22,520
Myeong Hee.

640
00:55:23,649 --> 00:55:27,819
After my mother passed away,
do you know what I feared the most?

641
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,299
Blood. Being in pain.

642
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,969
Since I had no one left
to take care of me,

643
00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:43,839
I was worried I might die
alone and in pain.

644
00:55:45,169 --> 00:55:48,339
And I was worried no one
would notice even if I died.

645
00:55:51,649 --> 00:55:53,919
That's why I went to live
with my father's family.

646
00:55:56,149 --> 00:55:58,189
Even if they weren't my real family,

647
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,989
I thought it'd be better
than being alone.

648
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,299
But now, I don't need a family.

649
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,739
I have you.

650
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,549
I'll...

651
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,719
I'll be your family.

652
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,600
Let's get married.

653
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,339
Where is it?

654
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:53,938
Are we on the right path?

655
00:56:53,939 --> 00:56:56,210
Father, are you sure
we're on the right path?

656
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,409
I don't think this is the one
on the map.

657
00:56:58,410 --> 00:56:59,450
You think so?

658
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:02,449
That can't be right.
This has to be the right path.

659
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:03,789
Let me see.

660
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,688
Can you even read maps?

661
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:09,230
Come on.
I'm at least better at it than you.

662
00:57:09,489 --> 00:57:11,330
From here...

663
00:57:13,629 --> 00:57:14,700
This is...

664
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,870
- That way!
- Hurry!

665
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:28,609
You go that way!

666
00:57:29,049 --> 00:57:30,409
Go that way!

667
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,549
Turn off the flashlight.

668
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,620
Gosh.

669
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,989
Let's hide over there.

670
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:40,889
Hurry!

671
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:41,919
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

672
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:46,060
- Father.
- Quiet.

673
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,700
There's no one here, sir.

674
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,339
It's clear here too.

675
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,040
- Search thoroughly!
- Yes, sir.

676
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,310
It's clear here.

677
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,149
- Search everywhere!
- Yes, sir.

678
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:12,020
Myeong Soo.

679
00:58:13,419 --> 00:58:15,359
I'll go and talk to them.

680
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,629
Stay here...

681
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,500
and keep your eyes closed.

682
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:24,029
- No, Father.
- Keep it down.

683
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:29,040
Where did the punk go?

684
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:34,009
Son, listen.

685
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,649
Until I come back,

686
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,850
no matter what you hear,

687
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,689
never come out.

688
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,859
Do you understand?

689
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:10,770
