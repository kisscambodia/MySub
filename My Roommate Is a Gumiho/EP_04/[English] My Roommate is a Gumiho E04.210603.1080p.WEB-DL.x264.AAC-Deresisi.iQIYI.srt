You weren't answering your phone.

You must feel very troubled.

104
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,140
Don't you need someone
to keep a close eye on her?

105

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,320

-I'm a little late, sir.

108

-I wouldn't!
-I'm kidding.

110
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,250
But still, I think we need a curfew.

111
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,070
-A curfew?
-So that we won't be worried.

Right, yes.

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,250
Go down this way,
walk past the main library,

143
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,160
then take a right,
you'll see a huge building.

144
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,270
There are all kinds of snack bars

145
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,790
and you know, those,
vending machines and stuff.

146
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,220
So if you keep going down that way...

147

The act of exchanging information.
Conversing.

Psychological exchange.

171

There are many aspects to communication.

172

Fifty percent of this lecture
will be practical exercises.

173

"romantic relationship".

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,860
My gosh!

177
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,710
Two people will become a team,
and go on dates every week.

178
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,060
Then you'll each write a report
on how you communicated.

179
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,220
I randomly selected the pairs
before the class began.

180
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,900
Settle down. Here are the pairs.

181
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,220
Look for your partner.

[Yang Hye-sun, Do Jae-jin]

[Lee Dam, Gye Seon-woo]

185
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,730
Darn it.

186
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,480
It's as if fate is helping Seon-woo.

187
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,900
He'll end up winning the 100,000 won.

188
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,550
Seon-woo is much better, though.

189
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,780
Isn't she pretty?

190
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,220
-Lucky me.
-Seon-woo, one second.

191
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,810
Hey, Dam. Lee Dam.

192
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,310
I love your sneakers.

193
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,770
Can you buy those for about 100,000 won?

194
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,450
-You can go first.
-Should we?

195
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,030
Hurry up.

196
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,580
-What is it?
-Well.

197
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,870
It's about how we became partners.

198
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,290
If you're too busy,
we don't have to go on dates.

199
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,090
We can just set the story straight and--

200
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,550
I'm free whenever.

201
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,880
Speaking of which,
why don't we set a date?

202
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,550
How about Saturday?

203
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,190
Sure, I guess.

204
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,480
I'll text you with the time and place.

205
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,560
I'll text you between lunch and dinner

206
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,550
when it's not too early or too late.

207
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,490
[Sir, I somehow ended up
getting involved with that guy...]

208
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,310
I'll just tell him when I get home.

210
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,270
-Hi.
-Hi, Da-young.

211
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,210
-Hi.
-What's this?

Our club is promoting
healthy campus culture.

213
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,910
Will you sign this?

214
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,450
Okay. Let me have a read.

215
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,160
We need more people to know.

216
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,010
Hey, Tae-jin.

217
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,370
Did you see the exchange student?

218
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,270
Her shape is just...

219
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,950
It's not just her shape.
She looks like she belongs on TV.

220
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,490
-Exactly.
-So?

221
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,680
Should I hit on her?

222
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,820
Let's start a party.

223
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,150
She doesn't have friends,
so I'm sure she'll show up.

224
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,090
I don't know. She looked haughty.

225
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,230
She might be cold.

226
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,360
Why can't I seem to find a pretty girl?

227
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,220
What? You'll find some
if you take a good look around.

228
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,510
I don't think Dam is half-bad.

229
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,010
I'd say she's definitely an A.

230
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,260
Enough is enough.

231
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,130
-I wouldn't say she's an A.
-No?

232
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,420
Dam has a pretty face,

233
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,750
but she's missing that something.

234
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,910
-I'd say B plus.
-My gosh.

235
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,650
Hey, how can Dam be a B plus?

236
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,580
Forget her looks.

237
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,869
What about her personality?
And she's a weirdo.

238
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,150
Wait, Tae-jin.

239
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,829
You're still sulking
over how she turned you down.

240
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,060
What the heck are you saying?

241
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,950
I wouldn't take her even if she was free.

242
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,140
Hey.

243
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,780
What are you all doing?

244
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,869
I'm not an object.

245
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,690
What are you saying
about how I'm free or whatever?

246
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:34,859
Aren't you going to apologize?

247
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,880
For what?

248
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,970
We were just joking around.

249
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,350
Joking?

250
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,230
This is so absurd
that the situation is becoming a joke.

251
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,930
If you were taught well at home,

252
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,530
you wouldn't be here
judging people on their looks.

253
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,950
Shouldn't you know that by now?

254
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,430
If you don't know
what you should apologize for,

255
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,890
then don't.

256
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,850
I'll just consider that
you had no one to teach you at home.

257
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,560
What the heck?

258
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,910
Hey, Dam.

259
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,410
One second.

260
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,820
-Seok, let me have a word with him.
-Sure.

261
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,000
Hey.

262
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,820
I didn't say a word.

263
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,440
Yes, you really didn't.

264
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,340
Are you mad?

265
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,770
Hey, I'm talking to you.
You can't leave like this.

266
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,940
Just beat me until you feel better.
I'll take it.

267
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,140
Then put it out.

268
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,260
-What?
-Put your face out.

269
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,660
If you don't put it out in three,
I'll start beating you wherever.

270
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,170
One.

271
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,410
Two.

272
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,190
-Hey, wait.
-Three.

273
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,670
It's nothing for you to apologize.

274
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,560
But

275
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,210
I also don't think you should
just stand there and listen to that.

276
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,300
One second!

277
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,330
Thank you.

278
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,820
Thank you.

279
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,020
-Have you heard?
-What?

280
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,260
How our seniors graded Dam.

281
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,800
I did.

282
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,960
They said they wouldn't take her
even if she was free.

283
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,980
But I heard Seon-woo was there too.

284
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,060
Exactly. Why did she
flirt with him so much?

285
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,710
I guess Seon-woo hated her a lot too.

286
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,280
She was always with him
as if she became somebody.

287
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,800
-How embarrassing.
-People will hear you.

288
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,480
Excuse me.

289
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,460
This university is
much more interesting than I thought.

290
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,390
I got paired up for a class

291
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
to discuss what it's like
to be in a romantic relationship.

292
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,260
I'm about to go on a date
with a guy 700 years younger.

293
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,280
I shouldn't have sent you there.

294
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,180
If I knew you'd call me this often,

295
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,810
I wouldn't have agreed.

296
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,230
The real interesting story begins now.

297
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,220
The kid you live with
got paired up with the Tiger boy.

298
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,680
Was his name Gye Seon-woo?

299
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,610
There's no need to report back
on every detail.

300
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,340
What I wanted from you is
to keep Miss Dam safe,

301
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,840
not to pry on her private life.

302
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,830
Just make sure you look after her
so that nothing bad happens.

303
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,290
[Then is this considered dangerous?]

304
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,890
She looked as if
she was about to cry any minute.

305
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,290
Are you sure you have zero interest
in her private life?

306
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,420
Not at all.

307
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,940
So if this isn't about the Marble,

308
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,740
don't meddle with her.

309
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,370
Look at this.

310
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,280
-Isn't that hilarious?
-Exactly.

311
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,820
-Look.
-This is insane.

312
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,060
Tae-jin.

313
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,430
Tae-jin.

314
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,690
Where did you find this information?

315
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,580
On Dikipedia, Mikipedia, or something.

316
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,310
-And some on an online forum.
-I know that one too.

317
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,580
Look at this.

318
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,250
We need accurate information
to analyze or reinterpret what we have.

319
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,490
Just work with it.
Stop picking a fight again.

320
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,860
Don't make me feel exhausted.

321
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,110
You're feeling exhausted
from lack of nicotine.

322
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,360
Let's go for a smoke, okay?

323
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,160
We can't work with this information.

324
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,580
Let's find some more stuff.

325
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,480
Sure.

326
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,530
Hey, are you all right?

327
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,940
I heard the story.

328
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,350
What story?

329
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,370
Everyone in school already knows

330
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,100
how our seniors graded you on your looks.

331
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,020
I feel bad for you. It must be awkward
to be in seminars with them.

332
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,320
I don't want to talk about someone
who isn't here right now.

333
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,320
Trying to act all cool.

334
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,000
What did you say?

335
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,050
You heard that?

336
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,590
You meant for me to hear it.

337
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,930
I think your pretentiousness is absurd.

338
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,740
You pretended like
you don't care about guys

339
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,150
and you're that carefree,

340
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,570
but you suddenly became
very close with Seon-woo.

341
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,610
I really want to learn

342
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,420
how to act
as pretentiously innocent as you.

343
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,500
I agree. You should share your secret.

344
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,900
You two don't need to learn
how to be pretentious.

345
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,410
You're good at talking about people
behind their back,

346
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,130
then pretending like you're a friend

347
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,330
and you're worried about them.

348
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,510
What?

349
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,240
I heard you two talking about me.

350
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,310
For me, it was more uncomfortable

351
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,910

but if I don't do it, I won't be
the only one getting a bad grade.

529
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:26,590
So I'm going out,
but I'll try to make it short.

530
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,290
See you later then.

531
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,580
What if there's another way?

532
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,610
What?

533
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,830
I know a way

534
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,730
where you don't need to go out.

535
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,440
Hey. Seo-woo.

536
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,070
What the... Have you lost your mind?

537
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,790
Why are you screaming at my ears?

538
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,370
Your face is like an exam.

539
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,950
I hate it when it comes closer.

540
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,670
Whatever.

541
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,150
You took my sweater again, didn't you?
Where did you put it?

542
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,910
It's probably under my bed.

543
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,720
Buy your own, for goodness' sake.

544
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,410
Why should I buy it when you have it?

545
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,650
She didn't cancel the date.

546
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,680
Maybe she's not upset any more.

547
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,170
I found it. Iron it if you want.

548
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,320
Hey, wait.

549
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,190
Do you think this would go well with this?

550
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,090
Are you seeing a girl?

551
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,510
A new girlfriend? An ex-girlfriend?
A soon-to-be girlfriend?

552
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,130
Come on. Take a look.

553
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,030
Do they look weird together?

554
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,360
Who is this girl you care so much about?

555
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,360
In fact, you do have to care
a lot about your appearance.

556
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,100
So even though your tongue messes it
all up, your face can make up for...

557
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,740
Hey.

558
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,940
-Go.
-How dare you...

559
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,390
Sir, are you sure you're going to be okay?

560
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,670
Of course. This would make me

561
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,700
feel better too.

562
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,340
I'll go on the date for you,

563
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,290
so don't worry
and take a good rest at home.

564
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,010
Thanks.

565
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,670
By the way, do I really look like this?

566
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,940
I look somehow photoshopped much.

567
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,250
You're being nice to me.

568
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,450
You didn't want me to be scared
to see my own face.

569
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,400
I'll get going then.

570
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,430
Okay. Good luck.

571

Hey.

572

Hi.

[Wait. Today, she seems...]

574
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,960

575
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,800
Shall we go eat first?

576
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,760
I have a restaurant in mind.
How about we go there?

577
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,790
Is this the restaurant you had in mind?
A gamjatang restaurant?

578
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,740
Excuse me. I'd like to have more kimchi.

579
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,340
I heard this was the best restaurant
around school.

580
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:38,560
-Do you not like it?
-No, that's not what I mean.

581
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,190
Hey.

582
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,440
I'm sorry about earlier.

583
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,940
Like you said, I shouldn't let the guys

584
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,890
talk about your appearance.

585
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,900
Anyway, thank you
for not being angry at me anymore.

586
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,630
-I didn't say I'm not angry anymore.
-What?

only recently himself.]

-You came.
-Of course, I did. That's why I'm here.

608

Oh. Right.

609
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,640
You've been abroad for a long time,

610
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,880
so I thought you wouldn't know
much about Korea yet.

611
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,130
Since I've lived in Korea
for a longer time,

612
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,840
I planned our date today.

615
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,070
Yes. Obviously.

What type of man does Dam like?

706
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,280
Well, she seems to like
good-looking guys too,

707
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,340
but personality seems to matter the most.

708
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,130
In short, a nice type.

709
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:31,620
-A nice type?
-Yes. A nice and kind type.

710
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,240
[What's that? What should I do?]

711
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:57,660
Sir, why are you sleeping here?

712
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,080
Sir.

713
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:34,010
I feel bad

714
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,350
putting him through all this.

715
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,190
[No wonder why she's sick.]

716
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,950
[The Marble is stealing her energy.]

717
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,920
But I wasn't asking how she's doing.

718
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,900
I was asking why you're doing this.

719
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,510
What are you trying to say?

720
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:48,320
One mistake is enough.

721
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:57,560
When you said you started to live
with a human, I was worried

722
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:02,270
you might mess it up
because of your personal feelings.

723
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,530
In the end, the Marble will steal
all her energy

724
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:07,680
and she will either die
or be close to death.

725
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,570
And it will be torture for you
to watch that in front of you.

726
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:17,710
Still, I thought it might be okay.
Because you're Shin Woo-yeo.

727
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,500
But you seem to have started
to get attached to her.

728
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,370
Think about it.

729
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,750
Has it ever ended well

730
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:34,700
when we had feelings?

731
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,160
She's right.

732
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:20,150
Getting attached to her won't do any good.

733
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,450
Good morning, sir.

734
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:50,290
You looked really tired yesterday.
How do you feel?

735
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,050
I'm okay.

736
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,800
I'm sure it was hard.

737
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:59,180
Thank you and sorry.

738
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,880
Why aren't you saying anything?

739
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,670
Sorry. I was focusing on the book.

740
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,710
Maybe he's still tired.

741
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:31,250
Surprise. Let's eat this together.

742
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,510
I was thinking of getting ox blood,

743
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,710
but then I thought
we have been eating that too often.

744
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,530
So today, I got ourselves something sweet,
which is good for fatigue.

745
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,660
Look at the generous amount of cream.

746
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,950
Doesn't it look amazing?
Let's eat it together.

747
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:49,380
Miss Dam, as I said earlier,

748
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,890
I don't enjoy humans' food.

749
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,410
But we have been eating together...

750
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,540
Oh, okay.

751
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,660
Hi, sir. I'm going to school.

752
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:28,940
Okay.

753
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:44,860
[He seems to be avoiding me.]

754
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,400
[But why?]

755
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,780
[Did I do something wrong?]

756
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,860
What are you doing here?
I called you from over there.

757
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,090
What's up?

758
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,980
Hey, look.

759
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:05,540
If someone you've been getting along with
suddenly starts to avoid you,

760
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:06,950
what do you think the reason is?

761
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,020
Why? Is someone avoiding you?

762
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,020
-Is it Seon-woo?
-No, it's not him.

763
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:20,590
In which situation
did this person start to avoid you?

764
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,620
I'm not sure.

765
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,960
He seemed a little tired,

766
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,160
but other than that...

767
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:32,740
Well, if you haven't done anything wrong,

768
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,260
you might not be the reason
but that person himself.

769
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,970
I see.

770
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,160
I wonder why.

771
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,240
Do you have a crush on someone?

772
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,360
Crush? No way.

773
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,860
I don't know much about him yet,

774
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,420
and there hasn't been any occasion
where I started to like him.

775
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,350
Anyway, I don't have a crush on him.

776
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,480
Okay. Then why do you care so much?

777
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,500
What?

778
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:04,770
No reason. There's no reason.

779
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:19,770
[Gye Seon-woo]

780
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,640
[Have you written the report yet?]

781
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,140
[Do you want to do it together
to get the stories straight?]

782
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,490
I'm home.

783
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,760
Sir, I have a question.

784
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,340
It's about my senior
born in the Year of the Tiger.

785
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,240
He wants me to write the report
together with him.

786
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,310
If it makes you feel uncomfortable,
I'll say no--

787
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,560
Miss Dam, you don't need
my permission for that.

788
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,540
What?

789
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,330
But you were worried about it before.

790
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,630
Now you're doing the assignment together,
you can't avoid him forever.

791
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,610
I know you can take care of yourself

792
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,540
and stay away from him.

793
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:09,840
That's true, but...

794
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:13,280
You don't need to tell me everything
unless it's important.

795
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:15,740
We are nothing more than

796
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,860
two people who accidentally got involved

797
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,550
with each other.

798
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,630
I know we are.

799
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,290
When he gave me that, he was so sweet.

800
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,230
Why did he suddenly...

801
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,710
Maybe something happened during the date.

802
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,380
When he was with Seon-woo.

803
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:31,020
Why did we come to such a faraway place?

804
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,440
I heard they had great desserts here.
This place is--

805
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:35,950
Let's hurry and start the assignment.

806
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,800
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I ordered everything.

807
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:45,010
Shall we finish the assignment first?

808
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,670
First, let's talk about
what happened that day.

809
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,970
-We went to a gamjatang restaurant, right?
-Yes.

810
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:55,130
Did I eat well?

811
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:57,860
Did I look somewhat upset

812
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:00,280
or aloof?

813
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:01,470
Not at all.

814
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,930
You didn't eat as well as usual,

815
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:06,130
but you were pretty...

816
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:09,080
-What?
-What?

817
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,970
Never mind. You ate well.

818
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:20,790
By any chance, did you say something

819
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:23,340
that might offend me?

820
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:25,230
Why?

821
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,900
Did I make a mistake?

822
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:28,570
I don't think I said anything special.

823
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:29,850
No. Never mind.

824
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:33,550
What did we do after that?

825
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,580
-We went to see the movie.
-Right. We did.

826
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,090
How was I there?

827
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:41,990
You were all right.

828
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:44,850
We met Jae-jin and Hye-sun
and hung out with them all right.

829
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:49,390
Right. You're saying
we hung out all right,

830
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:51,850
and it means
there wasn't any special trouble.

831
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,390
By the way, you keep talking
like you weren't there.

832
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,760
What?

833
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,570
What do you mean?

834
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,670
[It looks like
nothing special has happened.]

835
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,910
[Then why...]

836
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,470
I can walk you home.

837
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,160
I'm good. See you at school.

838
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,630
Dam.

839
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,150
Can I ask you something?

840
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,320
What is it?

841
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:39,590
The man you were with at school
the other day...

842
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,440
Who is he?

843
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,830
Oh, he's...

844
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:49,710
Well, I know you said
you somehow got to know him,

845
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:53,540
but what exactly does that mean?

846
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:02,290
It's just like I said.

847
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:05,770
I accidentally happened to know him.

848
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:10,130
Nothing more, nothing less.

849
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:45,430
Miss Dam.

850
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:54,580
Sir.

851
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,000
Just like you said,

852
01:06:57,090 --> 01:07:00,040
I know we accidentally
got involved with each other.

853
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:03,120
So I know we don't need
to care about each other,

854
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,790
but you know what?

855
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,280
I can't do that.

856
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,630
I wish we can be like
we used to be. What should I do?

857
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,690
Miss Dam...

858
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,280
You said you feel comfortable
around me. You said I was okay.

859
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:20,060
You said the Marble wasn't the only reason
why you were nice to me.

860
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:22,260
How could a human change his mind like...

861
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,060
Do you think you can just change your mind
because you're not a human?

862
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,410
You can't just alienate me
when we were doing fine.

863
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:36,910
Miss Dam, I said that

864
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:41,570
because I concluded that it might be
better that I stay away from your life.

865
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:44,480
But it looks like
it rather concerned you more.

866
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:46,460
I'm sorry.

867
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,350
If you're sorry,

868
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,010
let's be like we used to be.

869
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,100
I'll come back and sit,

870
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:03,880
so talk to me and worry about me
like you used to do.

871
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,470
How was it

872
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,600
with your senior?

873
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:55,180
It was all right.

874
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,240
What's wrong?

875
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,160
Did he push you again?

876
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,370
No, he was nice to me.

877
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:11,020
He said he wouldn't do
anything I don't like.

878
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:14,279
I'm sure he did.

879
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:17,620
Because he has special feelings for you.

880
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:26,950
Actually, I'm not sure.

881
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:30,160
I doubt this is true,

882
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:34,250
but if, by any chance,
he has special feelings for me,

883
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,069
I think it's strange.

884
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:39,750
Why is it strange?

885
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,130
I'm just not sure

886
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:46,310
what it is

887
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,859
to like someone.

888
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:52,380
He doesn't know everything about me,

889
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:54,800
so how could he like me?

890
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,720
What if he expects something from me?

891
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:02,060
What if I can't meet his expectations?

892
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:04,220
Then what should I do?

893
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,920
"There is always"

894
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,920
"some madness in love",

895
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:21,330
as Friedrich Nietzsche wrote
in "Thus Spoke Zarathustra".

896
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:25,210
That you like someone means

897
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:30,570
that you are misunderstanding
that person in your own way.

898
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:34,670
So what I'm trying to say is

899
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:39,950
you could be Fermina Daza to someone,

900
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,070
and that's not a misunderstanding.

901
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:46,060
Fermina Daza?

902
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,800
She's a heroine from an old book.

903
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,550
"To him, she seemed so beautiful,
so seductive,"

904
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:02,210
"so different from ordinary people,"

905
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:05,600
"that he could not understand"

906
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,220
"why no one was as disturbed as he"

907
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:14,180
"by the clicking of her heels
on the paving stones,"

908
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,110
"why no one else's heart was wild"

909
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,800
"with the breeze stirred
by the sighs of her veils,"

910
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:27,290
"why everyone did not go mad
with the movements of her braid,"

911
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:30,590
"the flight of her hands,"

912
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,150
"the gold of her laughter."

913
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,890
"He could not understand"

914
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,750
"why anyone wouldn't
fall in love with her."

915
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:44,290
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

916
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:47,590
[Maybe I fell in love
with that breathtaking beauty.]

917
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:51,150
[This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to make Dam fall in love.]

918
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,340
[I like you.]

919
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,940
[Living in the same house,
I get attached to him.]

920
01:12:59,030 --> 01:13:01,670
Can we talk for a moment?

921
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:06,470
[Are you sure she's not different
from all the boring people you met?]

922
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:10,340
[Miss Dam, you always seem genuine.]

923
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:11,720
[And I like it.]
