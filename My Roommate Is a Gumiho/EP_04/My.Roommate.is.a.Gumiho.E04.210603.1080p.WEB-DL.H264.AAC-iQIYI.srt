"romantic relationship".

176
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,105
My gosh!

177
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,949
Two people will become a team,
and go on dates every week.

178
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,289
Then you'll each write a report
on how you communicated.

179
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,465
I randomly selected the pairs
before the class began.

180
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,139
Settle down. Here are the pairs.

181
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,370
Look for your partner.

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,975
Darn it.

186
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,719
It's as if fate is helping Seon-woo.

187
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,145
He'll end up winning the 100,000 won.

188
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,789
Seon-woo is much better, though.

189
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,025
Isn't she pretty?

190
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,465
- Lucky me.
- Seon-woo, one second.

191
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,055
Hey, Dam. Lee Dam.

192
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,549
I love your sneakers.

193
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,015
Can you buy those for about 100,000 won?

194
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,695
- You can go first.
- Should we?

195
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,275
Hurry up.

196
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,819
- What is it?
- Well.

197
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,109
It's about how we became partners.

198
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,529
If you're too busy,
we don't have to go on dates.

199
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,329
We can just set the story straight and--

200
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,795
I'm free whenever.

201
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,119
Speaking of which,
why don't we set a date?

202
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,795
How about Saturday?

203
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,429
Sure, I guess.

204
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,725
I'll text you with the time and place.

205
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,799
I'll text you between lunch and dinner

206
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,795
when it's not too early or too late.

207
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,735
[ Sir, I somehow ended up
getting involved with that guy... ]

208
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,555
I'll just tell him when I get home.

210
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,509
- Hi.
- Hi, Da-young.

00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,449
- Hi.
- What's this?

Our club is promoting

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,139
Will you sign this?

214
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,695
Okay. Let me have a read.

215
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,405
We need more people to know.

216
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,249
Hey, Tae-jin.

217
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,609
Did you see the exchange student?

218
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,499
Her shape is just...

219
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,189
It's not just her shape.
She looks like she belongs on TV.

220
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,735
- Exactly.
- So?

221
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,919
Should I hit on her?

222
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,065
Let's start a party.

223
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,389
She doesn't have friends,
so I'm sure she'll show up.

224
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,329
I don't know. She looked haughty.

225
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,475
She might be cold.

226
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,599
Why can't I seem to find a pretty girl?

227
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,465
What? You'll find some
if you take a good look around.

228
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,739
I don't think Dam is half-bad.

229
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,255
I'd say she's definitely an A.

230
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,505
Enough is enough.

231
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,369
- I wouldn't say she's an A.
- No?

232
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,659
Dam has a pretty face,

233
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,989
but she's missing that something.

234
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,155
- I'd say B plus.
- My gosh.

235
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,879
Hey, how can Dam be a B plus?

236
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,819
Forget her looks.

237
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,109
What about her personality?
And she's a weirdo.

238
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,379
Wait, Tae-jin.

239
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,069
You're still sulking
over how she turned you down.

240
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,299
What the heck are you saying?

241
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,189
I wouldn't take her even if she was free.

242
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,385
Hey.

243
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,025
What are you all doing?

244
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,109
I'm not an object.

245
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,935
What are you saying
about how I'm free or whatever?

246
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,104
Aren't you going to apologize?

247
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,125
For what?

248
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,215
We were just joking around.

249
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,595
Joking?

250
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,475
This is so absurd
that the situation is becoming a joke.

251
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,175
If you were taught well at home,

252
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,759
you wouldn't be here
judging people on their looks.

253
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,195
Shouldn't you know that by now?

254
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,675
If you don't know
what you should apologize for,

255
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,135
then don't.

256
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,095
I'll just consider that
you had no one to teach you at home.

257
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,805
What the heck?

258
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,155
Hey, Dam.

259
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,655
One second.

260
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,065
- Seok, let me have a word with him.
- Sure.

261
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,245
Hey.

262
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,065
I didn't say a word.

263
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,685
Yes, you really didn't.

264
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,585
Are you mad?

265
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,015
Hey, I'm talking to you.
You can't leave like this.

266
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,185
Just beat me until you feel better.
I'll take it.

267
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,385
Then put it out.

268
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,505
- What?
- Put your face out.

269
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,905
If you don't put it out in three,
I'll start beating you wherever.

270
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,415
One.

271
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,655
Two.

272
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,435
- Hey, wait.
- Three.

273
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,915
It's nothing for you to apologize.

274
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,805
But

275
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,455
I also don't think you should
just stand there and listen to that.

276
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,545
One second!

277
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,575
Thank you.

278
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,065
Thank you.

279
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,249
- Have you heard?
- What?

280
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,499
How our seniors graded Dam.

281
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,039
I did.

282
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,189
They said they wouldn't take her
even if she was free.

283
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,225
But I heard Seon-woo was there too.

284
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,305
Exactly. Why did she
flirt with him so much?

285
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,955
I guess Seon-woo hated her a lot too.

286
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,525
She was always with him
as if she became somebody.

287
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,045
- How embarrassing.
- People will hear you.

288
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,725
Excuse me.

289
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,689
This university is
much more interesting than I thought.

290
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,629
I got paired up for a class

291
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,845
to discuss what it's like
to be in a romantic relationship.

292
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,489
I'm about to go on a date
with a guy 700 years younger.

293
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,525
I shouldn't have sent you there.

294
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,419
If I knew you'd call me this often,

295
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,049
I wouldn't have agreed.

296
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,469
The real interesting story begins now.

297
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,465
The kid you live with
got paired up with the Tiger boy.

298
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,909
Was his name Gye Seon-woo?

299
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,855
There's no need to report back
on every detail.

300
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,579
What I wanted from you is
to keep Miss Dam safe,

301
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,069
not to pry on her private life.

302
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,075
Just make sure you look after her
so that nothing bad happens.

303
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,529
[ Then is this considered dangerous? ]

304
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,135
She looked as if
she was about to cry any minute.

305
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,535
Are you sure you have zero interest
in her private life?

306
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,665
Not at all.

307
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,185
So if this isn't about the Marble,

308
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,985
don't meddle with her.

309
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,615
Look at this.

310
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,519
- Isn't that hilarious?
- Exactly.

311
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,059
- Look.
- This is insane.

312
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,305
Tae-jin.

313
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,675
Tae-jin.

314
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,929
Where did you find this information?

315
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,825
On Dikipedia, Mikipedia, or something.

316
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,549
- And some on an online forum.
- I know that one too.

317
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,825
Look at this.

318
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,489
We need accurate information
to analyze or reinterpret what we have.

319
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,729
Just work with it.
Stop picking a fight again.

320
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,105
Don't make me feel exhausted.

321
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,349
You're feeling exhausted
from lack of nicotine.

322
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,605
Let's go for a smoke, okay?

323
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,389
We can't work with this information.

324
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,825
Let's find some more stuff.

325
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,725
Sure.

326
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,769
Hey, are you all right?

327
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,185
I heard the story.

328
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,589
What story?

329
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,609
Everyone in school already knows

330
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,345
how our seniors graded you on your looks.

331
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,249
I feel bad for you. It must be awkward
to be in seminars with them.

332
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,565
I don't want to talk about someone
who isn't here right now.

333
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,565
Trying to act all cool.

334
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,245
What did you say?

335
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,295
You heard that?

336
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,829
You meant for me to hear it.

337
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,159
I think your pretentiousness is absurd.

338
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,979
You pretended like
you don't care about guys

339
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,389
and you're that carefree,

340
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,815
but you suddenly became
very close with Seon-woo.

341
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,839
I really want to learn

342
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,659
how to act
as pretentiously innocent as you.

343
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,745
I agree. You should share your secret.

344
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,145
You two don't need to learn
how to be pretentious.

345
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,649
You're good at talking about people
behind their back,

346
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,359
then pretending like you're a friend

347
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,559
and you're worried about them.

348
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,755
What?

349
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,485
I heard you two talking about me.

350
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,555
For me, it was more uncomfortable

Have a safe trip home.

703
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,905
Dam is a little weird today.

704
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:20,345
She is. She keeps confusing us.

705
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,105
[ Wait. Are you seriously into Dam? ]

706
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:17,245
What type of man does Dam like?

707
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:21,409
Well, she seems to like
good-looking guys too,

708
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:23,485
but personality seems to matter the most.

709
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:27,275
In short, a nice type.

710
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,765
- A nice type?
- Yes. A nice and kind type.

711
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,385
[ What's that? What should I do? ]

712
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:57,805
Sir, why are you sleeping here?

713
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,225
Sir.

714
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,155
I feel bad

715
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,495
putting him through all this.

716
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,319
[ No wonder why she's sick. ]

717
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,095
[ The Marble is stealing her energy. ]

718
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:40,059
But I wasn't asking how she's doing.

719
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,045
I was asking why you're doing this.

720
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,655
What are you trying to say?

721
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,465
One mistake is enough.

722
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:57,705
When you said you started to live
with a human, I was worried

723
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:02,415
you might mess it up
because of your personal feelings.

724
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,659
In the end, the Marble will steal
all her energy

725
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,825
and she will either die
or be close to death.

726
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:12,715
And it will be torture for you
to watch that in front of you.

727
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,855
Still, I thought it might be okay.
Because you're Shin Woo-yeo.

728
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:21,645
But you seem to have started
to get attached to her.

729
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,515
Think about it.

730
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,895
Has it ever ended well

731
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,845
when we had feelings?

732
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,305
She's right.

733
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,295
Getting attached to her won't do any good.

734
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,595
Good morning, sir.

735
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,435
You looked really tired yesterday.
How do you feel?

736
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:52,195
I'm okay.

737
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,945
I'm sure it was hard.

738
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,325
Thank you and sorry.

739
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,025
Why aren't you saying anything?

740
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:11,815
Sorry. I was focusing on the book.

741
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,855
Maybe he's still tired.

742
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,395
Surprise. Let's eat this together.

743
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:34,649
I was thinking of getting ox blood,

744
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,849
but then I thought
we have been eating that too often.

745
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:39,675
So today, I got ourselves something sweet,
which is good for fatigue.

746
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,799
Look at the generous amount of cream.

747
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,095
Doesn't it look amazing?
Let's eat it together.

748
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,525
Miss Dam, as I said earlier,

749
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:52,035
I don't enjoy humans' food.

750
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,555
But we have been eating together...

751
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,685
Oh, okay.

752
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,805
Hi, sir. I'm going to school.

753
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,085
Okay.

754
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,005
[ He seems to be avoiding me. ]

755
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,545
[ But why? ]

756
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,925
[ Did I do something wrong? ]

757
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:58,989
What are you doing here?
I called you from over there.

758
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,235
What's up?

759
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,119
Hey, look.

760
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,679
If someone you've been getting along with
suddenly starts to avoid you,

761
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,095
what do you think the reason is?

762
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,165
Why? Is someone avoiding you?

763
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,165
- Is it Seon-woo?
- No, it's not him.

764
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:20,735
In which situation
did this person start to avoid you?

765
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,765
I'm not sure.

766
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:26,105
He seemed a little tired,

767
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,299
but other than that...

768
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:32,885
Well, if you haven't done anything wrong,

769
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:36,405
you might not be the reason
but that person himself.

770
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,115
I see.

771
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,305
I wonder why.

772
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,385
Do you have a crush on someone?

773
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,489
Crush? No way.

774
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,999
I don't know much about him yet,

775
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,549
and there hasn't been any occasion
where I started to like him.

776
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,489
Anyway, I don't have a crush on him.

777
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,625
Okay. Then why do you care so much?

778
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:00,645
What?

779
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,915
No reason. There's no reason.

780
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:19,820
[ Gye Seon-woo ]

781
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,769
[ Have you written the report yet? ]

782
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:18,285
[ Do you want to do it together
to get the stories straight? ]

783
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,635
I'm home.

784
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,905
Sir, I have a question.

785
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:45,485
It's about my senior
born in the Year of the Tiger.

786
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:48,385
He wants me to write the report
together with him.

787
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,449
If it makes you feel uncomfortable,
I'll say no--

788
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:53,705
Miss Dam, you don't need
my permission for that.

789
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:55,685
What?

790
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:59,469
But you were worried about it before.

791
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:02,769
Now you're doing the assignment together,
you can't avoid him forever.

792
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:04,749
I know you can take care of yourself

793
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,685
and stay away from him.

794
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,979
That's true, but...

795
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:13,425
You don't need to tell me everything
unless it's important.

796
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,885
We are nothing more than

797
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,005
two people who accidentally got involved

798
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:21,695
with each other.

799
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:50,775
I know we are.

800
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:02,435
When he gave me that, he was so sweet.

801
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:04,375
Why did he suddenly...

802
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,855
Maybe something happened during the date.

803
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,525
When he was with Seon-woo.

804
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,165
Why did we come to such a faraway place?

805
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,579
I heard they had great desserts here.
This place is--

806
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:36,095
Let's hurry and start the assignment.

807
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,945
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I ordered everything.

808
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,155
Shall we finish the assignment first?

809
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,799
First, let's talk about
what happened that day.

810
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:52,115
- We went to a gamjatang restaurant, right?
- Yes.

811
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,275
Did I eat well?

812
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,999
Did I look somewhat upset

813
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,419
or aloof?

814
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,609
Not at all.

815
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:04,075
You didn't eat as well as usual,

816
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,275
but you were pretty...

817
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:09,225
- What?
- What?

818
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,115
Never mind. You ate well.

819
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:20,919
By any chance, did you say something

820
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,485
that might offend me?

821
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,375
Why?

822
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:27,039
Did I make a mistake?

823
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,709
I don't think I said anything special.

824
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:29,995
No. Never mind.

825
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:33,679
What did we do after that?

826
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,725
- We went to see the movie.
- Right. We did.

827
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,235
How was I there?

828
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,135
You were all right.

829
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,995
We met Jae-jin and Hye-sun
and hung out with them all right.

830
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:49,535
Right. You're saying
we hung out all right,

831
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,995
and it means
there wasn't any special trouble.

832
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:57,535
By the way, you keep talking
like you weren't there.

833
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:58,905
What?

834
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,715
What do you mean?

835
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:05,815
[ It looks like
nothing special has happened. ]

836
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,055
[ Then why... ]

837
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,609
I can walk you home.

838
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:25,305
I'm good. See you at school.

839
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,775
Dam.

840
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,295
Can I ask you something?

841
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,465
What is it?

842
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,735
The man you were with at school
the other day...

843
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,585
Who is he?

844
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:44,975
Oh, he's...

845
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,855
Well, I know you said
you somehow got to know him,

846
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,685
but what exactly does that mean?

847
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,435
It's just like I said.

848
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,915
I accidentally happened to know him.

849
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:10,275
Nothing more, nothing less.

850
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,575
Miss Dam.

851
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,725
Sir.

852
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,139
Just like you said,

853
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:00,169
I know we accidentally
got involved with each other.

854
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:03,265
So I know we don't need
to care about each other,

855
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:04,935
but you know what?

856
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:09,425
I can't do that.

857
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:13,769
I wish we can be like
we used to be. What should I do?

858
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:14,829
Miss Dam...

859
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,419
You said you feel comfortable
around me. You said I was okay.

860
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:20,205
You said the Marble wasn't the only reason
why you were nice to me.

861
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,405
How could a human change his mind like...

862
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:28,205
Do you think you can just change your mind
because you're not a human?

863
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:31,555
You can't just alienate me
when we were doing fine.

864
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:37,055
Miss Dam, I said that

865
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:41,709
because I concluded that it might be
better that I stay away from your life.

866
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:44,625
But it looks like
it rather concerned you more.

867
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,605
I'm sorry.

868
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,495
If you're sorry,

869
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:53,155
let's be like we used to be.

870
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:00,245
I'll come back and sit,

871
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:04,025
so talk to me and worry about me
like you used to do.

872
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,615
How was it

873
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,745
with your senior?

874
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,325
It was all right.

875
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,385
What's wrong?

876
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:04,305
Did he push you again?

877
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,515
No, he was nice to me.

878
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,165
He said he wouldn't do
anything I don't like.

879
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,424
I'm sure he did.

880
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:17,765
Because he has special feelings for you.

881
01:09:22,869 --> 01:09:27,095
Actually, I'm not sure.

882
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,305
I doubt this is true,

883
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,395
but if, by any chance,
he has special feelings for me,

884
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,214
I think it's strange.

885
01:09:38,529 --> 01:09:39,895
Why is it strange?

886
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,275
I'm just not sure

887
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,455
what it is

888
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:49,004
to like someone.

889
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,525
He doesn't know everything about me,

890
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:54,945
so how could he like me?

891
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:58,865
What if he expects something from me?

892
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:02,205
What if I can't meet his expectations?

893
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,365
Then what should I do?

894
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,065
"There is always"

895
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,065
"some madness in love",

896
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:21,475
as Friedrich Nietzsche wrote
in "Thus Spoke Zarathustra".

897
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,355
That you like someone means

898
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:30,715
that you are misunderstanding
that person in your own way.

899
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:34,815
So what I'm trying to say is

900
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:40,095
you could be Fermina Daza to someone,

901
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:43,215
and that's not a misunderstanding.

902
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,205
Fermina Daza?

903
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:49,945
She's a heroine from an old book.

904
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:57,695
"To him, she seemed so beautiful,
so seductive,"

905
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,355
"so different from ordinary people,"

906
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,745
"that he could not understand"

907
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:10,365
"why no one was as disturbed as he"

908
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:14,325
"by the clicking of her heels
on the paving stones,"

909
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:19,255
"why no one else's heart was wild"

910
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,945
"with the breeze stirred
by the sighs of her veils,"

911
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,435
"why everyone did not go mad
with the movements of her braid,"

912
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:30,735
"the flight of her hands,"

913
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:34,295
"the gold of her laughter."

914
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:38,035
"He could not understand"

915
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:40,895
"why anyone wouldn't
fall in love with her."

916
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,435
[ My Roommate is a Gumiho ]

917
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,729
[ Maybe I fell in love
with that breathtaking beauty. ]

918
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:51,289
[ This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to make Dam fall in love. ]

919
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:52,485
[ I like you. ]

920
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:59,079
[ Living in the same house,
I get attached to him. ]

921
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,815
Can we talk for a moment?

922
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:06,599
[ Are you sure she's not different
from all the boring people you met? ]

923
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,485
[ Miss Dam, you always seem genuine. ]

924
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,865
[ And I like it. ]
