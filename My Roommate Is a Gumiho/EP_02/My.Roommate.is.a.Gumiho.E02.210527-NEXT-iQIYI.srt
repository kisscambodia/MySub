1
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,515
Do you think you can take it out?

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,495
I will try.

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,365
A human cannot hold
the Marble for long anyway.

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,145
How long can a human hold it then?

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,079
A year, at most.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,409
That means after one year of holding it,

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,095
it will be sorted out somehow.

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,985
Doesn't it?

9
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,345
Then what happens
if it's not taken out within a year?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,129
- You will die.
- What?

11
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,255
Miss Dam. You will die.

12
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,845
What are you talking about?

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,435
Why are you telling me this now?

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,115
What do you mean, I'm going to die?

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,505
Wait.

16
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,249
You don't have to worry.

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,205
I just wanted to share
the worst that could happen.

18
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,928
We still have a year of time,

19
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:28,045
so I'll try to find a way.

20
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,185
You should get some rest. Goodnight.

21
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,819
He sounds really optimistic.

22
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,805
Is it because this isn't your life?

23
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,235
Anyway, why didn't he say
he was going to teleport? So startling.

24
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,985
My gosh.

25
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,475
What are you doing out there?

26
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,925
I got depressed,
so I came out to get some air.

27
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,275
I see. Okay.

28
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,175
You must be busy trying to meet
your deadline, Mr. Gumiho.

29
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,575
There's a deadline on your manuscript
and my life.

30
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,339
- Hey, Miss Dam...
- Why did that pop right out?

31
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,099
I didn't even hit you that hard.

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,095
Don't you have any muscles?
Do you ever work out?

33
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,489
Miss Dam, what are you doing down there?

34
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,565
This sausage fell off.

35
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,059
All of a sudden?

36
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,095
I got hungry after taking a walk.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,549
You probably wonder
how I can want some snacks now,

38
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,995
but I may have less than 365 days
to enjoy late-night snacks.

39
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,155
I'm going to start stir-frying
to leave no regrets.

40
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,059
Right, Have you thought about

41
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,695
how you will take the Marble out?

42
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,179
Right, yes. Well...

43
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,455
I hope you think of something very soon.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,815
[ Episode 2 ]

45
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,095
Will I get to see
these fall colors next year?

46
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,505
[ I hated you campus lovebirds, ]

47
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,675
[ but I'll miss you a lot. ]

48
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,239
[ Jae-jin, my friend. I'll miss you, not! ]

49
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,505
[ It's all your fault.
You deserve a good beating! ]

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,855
Wait, are you crying?

51
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,615
Jin-ah has

52
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,339
a new boyfriend.

53
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,245
She just ended it with me
after two-timing me, and already has...

54
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,759
Be quiet.

55
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,205
That's just the end of your relationship,
but I'm facing the end of my life.

56
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,115
Your girlfriend abandoned you,
but fate has abandoned me.

57
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,769
I have no idea what you're saying,
but that sounds sad.

58
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,489
My heart aches.

59
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,165
This is all your fault!

60
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,155
Jin-ah loved fried chicken.

61
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,505
Fried chicken is also my favorite food.

62
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,295
Could I see this again next year?

63
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,425
Whatever.
It's not like chickens will go extinct.

64
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,465
What is this sudden turn of events?

65
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,489
I'll leave if I must,
but I won't leave with a piece of regret,

66
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,345
so I'm going to eat
every single piece I get.

67
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,485
Excuse me! One more seasoned chicken
and another glass of draft beer, please.

68
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,769
Dam, thanks.

69
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,409
Thanks for getting hammered with me.

70
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,235
Other people ignored me
when I reached out.

71
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,345
Hey, Jae-jin.

72
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,415
Yes?

73
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,365
You need to learn
how to deal with the feelings

74
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,485
after you break up with someone.

75
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,475
What will you do without me?

76
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,285
Why would you disappear?

77
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,735
And don't get so obsessed with women.

78
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,155
Be good to yourself.

79
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,975
You're a pretty great guy.

80
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,265
Really? I'm a pretty great guy?

81
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,379
- Say that one more time.
- Whatever.

82
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,915
- Just one more time.
- Whatever, you idiot. Get lost.

83
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,785
Get out of my life.

84
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,985
Bye.

85
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,805
That pathetic yet annoying kid.

86
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,195
I feel sick.

87
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,875
Did I have one too many drinks?

88
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,365
Marble!

89
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,135
The Marble popped out!

90
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,379
Mr. Gumiho! Hey, Mr. Gumiho!

91
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,795
Mr. Gumiho!

92
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,115
Hey, Mr. Gumiho! This is awesome!

93
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,575
I fell down
after hitting my chest a few times,

94
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,084
then the Marble popped out
from the impact.

95
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,755
What?

96
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,805
Look. I'm not going to die anymore.

97
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,515
This is...

98
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,885
This isn't the Marble.
I think it's a half-eaten candy.

99
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,215
What?

100
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,115
Marble!

101
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,705
The Marble popped out!

102
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,865
Hey kid, you're going to get sick.

103
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,295
Darn it. I thought I saved myself.

104
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,099
Hey, Miss Dam.

105
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,405
It's very dangerous for you to walk around
in this drunken state at this hour...

106
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,215
Are you all right, Miss Dam?

107
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,455
[ What is she looking at? ]

108
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,975
[ That's ]

109
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,319
[ the celadon made by the master ]

110
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,265
[ who made one of the national treasures. ]

111
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,535
What? Where did they go?

112
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,615
What's going on?

113
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,355
What?

114
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,845
Let's see.

115
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,005
Am I seeing things?
I must've had too much to drink.

116
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,685
I can't believe I used my power like this.

117
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,255
Goodness.

118
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,505
That was startling.

119
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,635
Miss Dam?

120
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,895
Miss Dam?

121
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,175
Mom... Mom.

122
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,145
Mom, what am I going to do now?

123
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,105
Mom, what am I going to do?

124
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,025
Excuse me, Mr. Gumiho.

125
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,995
- Did you get a good sleep?
- Yes.

126
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,919
I'm sorry about yesterday.

127
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,659
I'm not the type
who gets drunk and makes a scene...

128
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,565
Miss Dam, may I have a word with you?

129
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,505
Sure.

130
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,155
What is this?

131
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,129
I wrote up an agreement.

132
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,215
There are a few things
I need you to keep in your mind.

133
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,695
[ Shin Woo-yeo, Party A from hereon. ]

134
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,819
[ Lee Dam, Party B from hereon. ]

135
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,519
Party B is obligated
to keep Party A's Marble safe for a year,

136
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,849
and comply with the clauses below

137
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,535
to keep the Marble safe.

138
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,755
One, no contact with the opposite sex
born in the Year of the Tiger.

139
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,540
Two, quit drinking to stay in good health.

140
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,600
[ Liver, you did all the work.
P.S.: We never stayed dry. ]

141
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,855
Three, do not consume chickens.

142
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,499
Wait, what is this?

143
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,139
Nothing makes sense
starting with clause one.

144
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,439
I can't contact with the opposite sex
born in the Year of the Tiger,

145
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,475
but how would I know
which year they were born in?

146
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,729
Doesn't this basically mean
I cannot be in contact with any men?

147
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,799
- It does.
- What?

148
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,729
Then I can't kiss any guys

149
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,929
and do this or that with them?

150
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,159
This or that?

151
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,279
And I can't drink or eat chicken?

152
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,995
Then why would I want to live?

153
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,729
The Marble is very susceptible
to your condition.

154
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,619
You haven't been living a healthy life

155
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,599
due to excessive drinking.

156
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,449
So it'll be a good idea to quit drinking.

157
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,049
What about chicken?
Why can't I eat chicken?

158
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,305
Tigers are the natural enemy of foxes,
but chickens are fatal for gumihos.

159
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,965
From ancient times, chicken blood
was used to ward off bad luck.

160
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,725
So you better not eat it.

161
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,519
No, I think I should.

162
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,515
I had chicken yesterday,
and I was totally fine.

163
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,685
Are you sure?

164
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,529
Well, I felt a little sick,

165
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,849
but it was tolerable.

166
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,335
That's just the first time.
It can get more dangerous over time.

167
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,175
Gosh.

168
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,210
I mean, I could die in a year,

169
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,310
[ Agreement ]

170
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,695
but I have to spend
my remaining life feeling depressed?

171
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,005
Miss Dam.

172
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,615
I don't plan on letting you die.

173
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,525
So please trust me,
and let's focus on the things we can do.

174
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,419
I'll look for ways to retrieve the Marble,

175
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,715
and you can focus on keeping it safe.

176
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,325
I think that's the way for you to survive.

177
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,839
- Hey, Dam.
- What?

178
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,479
What happened at the club?
Where did you suddenly go?

179
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,429
Oh, something suddenly came up.

180
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,609
You left without a word?

181
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,629
- Yes.
- What?

182
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,689
My phone died, so I couldn't contact you.

183
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,815
Sorry. Did I keep you guys from partying?

184
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,579
That's not the case.
We had lots of fun partying.

185
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,649
I never get bored if I got some beats.

186
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,269
I got, got, got,

187
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,585
got, got, got, got...

188
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,789
That was loud.

189
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,815
Who the heck drives like that?

190
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,975
I think that's Seon-woo.

191
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,785
What? Gye Seon-woo?
From the class of 2017?

192
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,849
- The playboy?
- Yes.

193
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,245
The legend of the history department
who dated over 20 women, Seon-woo.

194
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,879
We're doing a group project together,
so I know him.

195
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,059
He returned to school.

196
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,214
I'm jealous.

197
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,085
Let's go eat.

198
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,535
Hey, wait for me.

199
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,140
[ I'm in class with Seon-woo. Lucky me! ]

200
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,109
It's already on Everyday Time.

201
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,129
"I'm in class with Seon-woo. Lucky me!"

202
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,765
Look, there are 300 comments.

203
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,619
Wow, look.

204
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,379
So what? He's a bad playboy

205
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,235
who makes women cry a river.

206
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,539
Doesn't that sound better than you,

207
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,045
who gets played on?

208
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,929
No.

209
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,009
I think it's better that I cry
than to make someone else cry.

210
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,029
I've been hurt a lot,

211
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,539
but I love how I never hurt anyone else.

212
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,209
What? Have you been going to church?

213
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,709
It's what Dam said yesterday.

214
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,045
She said I should be good to myself
because I'm a good guy.

215
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,339
Did you read a book
written by Monk Bopjong?

216
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,359
That's the alcohol talking.

217
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,479
Anyway, I finally realized this
after hearing that.

218
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,539
Before I try so hard to get loved,

219
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,949
I need to learn to love myself.

220
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,669
After I made that decision,

221
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,909
I realized how loveable I am.

222
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,319
- You are?
- Yes.

223
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,215
I looked myself in the mirror,

224
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,465
and my face looked so good.

225
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,479
Then when I grabbed the bus strap,

226
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,935
my biceps looked so hot.

227
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,879
Then I have a mid-low range voice,

228
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,475
which makes me sound so sweet.

229
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,035
So lame, so stop talking
before I shoot you.

230
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,685
I'm leaving. I have to go get some books.

231
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,259
Why? You aren't going to finish?

232
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,409
I'm full.

233
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,775
- Bye.
- Bye.

234
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,029
[ Okay. In order to survive, ]

235
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,195
[ I have to keep the Marble safe. ]

236
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,025
Excuse me.

237
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,665
[ Isn't he Gye Seon-woo? ]

238
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,545
[ The class of 2017,
born in the Year of the Tiger! ]

239
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,285
You dropped this.

240
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,099
I'm sorry, but could you

241
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,785
just leave it on the floor?

242
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,125
- What?
- Just leave it on the floor.

243
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,995
Thank you.

244
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,905
What's with her?

245
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,145
[ What? Cohabitation? ]

246
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,469
I get that the Marble
just rolled into that woman,

247
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,395
but how did you of all people
decide to live with a human woman?

248
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,625
Well, at first,
I thought it seemed interesting,

249
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,735
so I wanted to keep her by my side, and...

250
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,185
And? What?

251
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,335
Forget it.

252
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,675
Why won't you finish your story?

253
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,979
Why? Is she your type?

254
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,399
Did you finally meet your ideal type
who opened you up

255
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,345
after hundreds and hundreds of years?

256
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,635
Don't be so cheeky.

257
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,185
She's a human
who's still wet behind the ears.

258
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,445
Wet behind the ears? Like with blood?

259
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,875
What did you do to make her bleed?
Did you beat her?

260
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,185
It's a figure of speech.

261
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,989
It's used to express
when someone is very young,

262
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,245
a figure of speech.

263
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,765
I see. Is that so?

264
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,509
There are way too many things
I have to remember as a human.

265
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,375
I have to memorize idioms and neologisms.

266
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,889
And to order a croque monsieur,

267
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,745
I have to memorize English too.

268
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,765
That's French.

269
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,905
I can't believe how you managed
to be annoying for 700 years.

270
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,445
I'm sure it'll be very tough
for that human woman who lives with you.

271
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,419
Anyway, does she know she can end up dead

272
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,585
if the Marble keeps taking her energy?

273
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,115
I'm not going to let her die.

274
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,805
Okay. I'm glad you made that decision.

275
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,069
I hope you won't have to take the Marble
from her dead body

276
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,485
like back then.

277
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,405
Anyway,

278
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,955
there's something I'd like to ask.

279
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,365
- Dam!
- No, don't catch me!

280
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,389
Are you okay?

281
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,029
You're in the class of 2017.
Aren't you a tiger?

282
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,839
I was born early, so I'm a rabbit.

283
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,299
Early? You were born early in the year.

284
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,069
Thank you so much
for being born in the Year of the Rabbit.

285
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,985
I'm very glad that you're a rabbit.

286
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,795
Did you come to school drunk again?

287
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,039
- No.
- Anyway, have you heard?

288
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,399
We're doing a general assembly.

289
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,009
I can't be there.
I'm currently staying away from drinks--

290
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,809
- We're getting meat.
- I'm there.

291
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,879
I can go. I'll be there. I'm coming.

292
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,745
Okay. Go.

293
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,409
Yes!

[ Happiness isn't far away. ]

299
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,675
[ It's freaking far away. ]

300
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,289
Hey, don't people usually refer
to pork or beef as meat?

301
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,089
This is just chicken.

302
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,605
- Why? You're crazy for chicken.
- You do.

303
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,695
I am. So I'm about to go crazy.

304
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,585
- Jin-ah used to eat like that too.
- Cut it out.

305
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,845
[ Just one bite. May I have just one bite? ]

306
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,315
[ Just one piece of the wing
would be fine, right? ]

307
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,445
[ No, if I eat this, I might really die. ]

308
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,869
[ Forget it. There's no reason to live
if I can't eat chicken. ]

309
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,469
[ - I'll just eat it. ]
- Do you want to die?

310
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,589
[ No, I don't. I won't eat it. ]

311
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,939
No, everyone is waiting for you.

312
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,305
Gosh.

313
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,595
Hey, enough. I'm here.

314
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,129
- Seon-woo.
- Hello, Seon-woo.

315
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,905
- Hello.
- Hello.

316
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,539
Hello, Seon-woo.

317
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,129
- Hey, Seon-woo.
- Over here!

318
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,289
- Hello, Seon-woo.
- Hey!

319
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,359
- Why are you so late?
- Hey, Seon-woo.

320
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,509
- Have you been well?
- I thought you weren't coming.

321
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,019
- Hey, grab a drink.
- Grab a drink.

322
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,265
Here.

323
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,469
- A toast?
- Okay, let's make a toast.

324
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,365
- Okay.
- Cheers.

325
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,879
Hey, I can't do this. I'm leaving.

326
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,639
- Already? You haven't eaten.
- Hey.

327
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,885
Yes.

328
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:24,935
I have to leave.
Could you take a step aside?

329
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,529
You're leaving?
Let's grab a drink together.

330
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,985
Things are too loud over there.

331
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,499
Stay, Dam. You couldn't be here
even if you wanted to in your fourth year.

332
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,699
You should sit
just as our senior suggests.

333
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,915
Yes, we aren't that rude. Take a seat.

334
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,535
Goodness.

335
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,619
I'm sorry for the group project.

336
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,615
It's okay. Things can happen
right after you get discharged.

337
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,859
- Are you Jae-jin's friends?
- Yes, Choi Soo-kyung.

338
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,319
I'm pretty and the top of my class,

339
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,219
so people call me
the Kim Tae-hee of Seogwa University.

340
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,645
That's your nickname?
No one ever calls you...

341
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,235
- Aren't you going to drink?
- I have bad kidneys.

342
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,235
- Then some chicken...
- I love animals.

343
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,369
Lee Dam, are you insane?
What's this crazy talk?

344
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,175
- Shut up.
- Lee Dam?

345
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,299
Your name is one syllable? Dam?

346
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,935
Yes, right.

347
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,989
Do you know my name?

348
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,585
You're Gye Seon-woo.

349
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,515
Let's be acquaintances from now on.

350
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,785

635
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,095
This is a bronze dagger, right?

636
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,585
Gosh, this must be a white porcelain
from the Joseon Dynasty.

637

No way! Is that Shin Yun-bok's painting?

You were in the military too.

649

- Miss Dam.

652
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,459
Haven't I told you yet?
I major in history.

653
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,829
Some kids applied for this major
because of their grades,

654
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:47,955
but in my case,
it's because I love history.

655
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,255
I have always liked to watch
historic dramas since I was little.

656
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:54,815
Gosh.

657
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,755
I want to be a museum curator
after graduation.

658
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,265
But I'm not sure if I can live until then.

659
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,039
Anyway, this is really cool.

660
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,459
I have always wanted
to travel back in time like in TV series

if I could.

662
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:15,145
I'm so envious that you got to live
in so many eras.

663
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,945
How does it feel to live a long life?

664
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,745
Nothing. It doesn't feel anything.

665
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,905
Oh, there's a pipe too.

666
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:40,485
Have you used it yourself?

667
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,209
- Yes.
- Since when?

668
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,589
Since cigarettes were imported in 1592.

669
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,355
1592?

670
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,645
When Japan invaded Korea?

671
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,199
Have you been smoking cigarettes
for over 400 years then?

672
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,095
And I made you quit that?

673
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,309
Just keep on smoking.

674
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:02,185
What am I to stop
your 400-year-standing habit?

675
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,705
Actually, I thought it would be easy.

676
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,759
I thought it shouldn't be too hard

677
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,275
to change one habit.

678
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,219
But it turned out to be hard.

679
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,775
It made me realize that I might have made
unreasonable demands.

680
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,419
So I want to keep myself from smoking
during the contract period.

681
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,545
To share your pain.

682
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,705
I'm okay though.

683
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,749
So you have been smoking for 400 years.

684
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,645
Then how old are you?

685
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,035
I'm 22. Born in 1999,
the Year of the Rabbit.

- Relax.
- I mean...

688

Now I hear your actual age,
I realize how ancient you are.

689
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,389
As a matter of fact,
you've been scolding me so much

690
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,899
I felt like I was living
with a great grandpa.

691
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,309
But if you think about it,

692
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,485
you've lived longer than
my great great grandpa.

693
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,485
Now I get why you have been speaking
like a fossil...

694
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,075
Oh, it's a wind chime.

695
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,685
It's so pretty.

696
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:11,519
I have seen fish-shaped sails,

to recycle trash.

878
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:57,839
Right. Can we talk about
how we address each other?

879
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,795
I don't feel comfortable
calling you Mr. Gumiho all the time.

880
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,869
Since I call you by your name,
you can call my name too.

881
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,579
No, I can't do that.

882
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,005
You're 977 years older than me.

883
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:11,525
It's like I can't call
the king of a country by his name.

884
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:13,945
I think it's disrespectful.

885
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,025
How about Mr. Landlord?

886
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,175
Well, maybe it sounds like
you would push me to pay rent.

887
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,605
How about Mr. Ancestor?

888
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,635
Well, I guess it sounds like
you'd take food from an ancestral rite.

889
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:34,625
How about "sir"?

890
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:40,299
How about Oldmiho?
It's short for Old Gumiho.

891
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,935
"Sir" sounds good to me.

892
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,659
It's "sir" then.

893
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,475
Let's get inside, sir.

894
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,555
Sir.

895
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,115
"Sir"...

896
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,575
He's sweeter

897
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,345
and more caring than I thought.

898
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,195
And...

899
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:25,845
How does it feel to live a long life?

900
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,895
Nothing. It doesn't feel like anything.

901
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,805
He looks a bit lonely too.

902
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,375
Sir.

903
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:24,109
Why haven't you go to bed yet?

904
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,529
Well, I was doing my assignment
and I got sleepy,

905
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:28,245
so I came out to get some fresh air.

906
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,085
It's hard, right?

907
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,775
You seem tired, so I was worried.

908
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,965
Until now, I have been thinking
only about my situation,

909
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:55,079
but earlier when I visited the basement,

910
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,965
I realized how long you have been living.

911
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:03,755
For such a long time, you had one dream.

912
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,675
And it can all go down the drain,

913
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:10,535
so I can only imagine how hard it must be.

914
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:14,935
I feel a bit bad too,
because it feels like it's my fault.

915
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,675
Why would you feel bad?

916
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,565
Just because.

917
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:25,219
You know what? How about we try

918
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,909
to live through this day?

919
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:31,435
If we repeat that,
I believe good days will come in the end.

920
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:34,165
Let's tough it out together.

921
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:42,215
I'll go inside now.

922
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:44,805
Don't think too much.

923
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:36,155
[ Anyway, there's something
I'd like to ask. ]

924
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:39,715
Did you even want to become a human?

925
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:43,139
To be honest, after what happened,

926
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:46,494
I thought you gave up hope.

927
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,585
Who is she to turn you like this?

928
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:55,385
You already know
how to take the Marble out.

929
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,855
- Miss Dam.
- Yes?

930
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,655
Let me check one thing.

931
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,675
You can go back now.

932
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:45,985
Just think

933
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,815
all this was a dream.

934
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,905
I'll get going.

935
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:22,695
[ My Roommate is a Gumiho ]

936
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,465
If I say I want to be your boyfriend,
will you let me?

937
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,575
What do you think he's up to?

938
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:31,665
[ I think even Gye Seon-woo
can't get Lee Dam. ]

939
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:33,639
You. Aren't you leaving?

940
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,965
How can I help you?

941
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,899
- Go on a date with me.
- A date?

942
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,639
It may be just a simulation,
but I thought I should dress properly.

943
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,009
[ He's enchanting me. ]

944
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:44,549
[ He's indeed a fox. ]

945
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,235
Hold it in

946
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,385
and date her.

947
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:51,645
[ This might be the last chance you have. ]
