1
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,220
Do you think you can take it out?

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,200
I will try.

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,070
A human cannot hold
the Marble for long anyway.

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,850
How long can a human hold it then?

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,790
A year, at most.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,130
That means after one year of holding it,

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,800
it will be sorted out somehow.

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,690
Doesn't it?

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,050
Then what happens
if it's not taken out within a year?

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,840
-You will die.
-What?

11
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,960
Miss Dam. You will die.

12
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,550
What are you talking about?

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,140
Why are you telling me this now?

14
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,820
What do you mean, I'm going to die?

15
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,210
Wait.

16
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,970
You don't have to worry.

17
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,910
I just wanted to share
the worst that could happen.

18
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,640
We still have a year of time,

19
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:27,750
so I'll try to find a way.

20
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,890
You should get some rest. Goodnight.

21
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,530
He sounds really optimistic.

22
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,510
Is it because this isn't your life?

23
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,940
Anyway, why didn't he say
he was going to teleport? So startling.

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,690
My gosh.

25
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,180
What are you doing out there?

26
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,630
I got depressed,
so I came out to get some air.

27
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,980
I see. Okay.

28
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,880
You must be busy trying to meet
your deadline, Mr. Gumiho.

29
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,280
There's a deadline on your manuscript
and my life.

30
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,050
-Hey, Miss Dam...
-Why did that pop right out?

31
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,810
I didn't even hit you that hard.

32
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,800
Don't you have any muscles?
Do you ever work out?

33
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,200
Miss Dam, what are you doing down there?

34
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,270
This sausage fell off.

35
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,780
All of a sudden?

36
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,800
I got hungry after taking a walk.

37
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,260
You probably wonder
how I can want some snacks now,

38
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,700
but I may have less than 365 days
to enjoy late-night snacks.

39
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,860
I'm going to start stir-frying
to leave no regrets.

40
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,770
Right, Have you thought about

41
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,400
how you will take the Marble out?

42
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,890
Right, yes. Well...

43
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,160
I hope you think of something very soon.

44
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,520
[Episode 2]

45
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,800
Will I get to see
these fall colors next year?

46
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,210
[I hated you campus lovebirds,]

47
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,380
[but I'll miss you a lot.]

48
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,950
[Jae-jin, my friend. I'll miss you, not!]

49
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,210
[It's all your fault.
You deserve a good beating!]

50
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
Wait, are you crying?

51
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,320
Jin-ah has

52
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,050
a new boyfriend.

53
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,950
She just ended it with me
after two-timing me, and already has...

54
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,470
Be quiet.

55
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,910
That's just the end of your relationship,
but I'm facing the end of my life.

56
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,820
Your girlfriend abandoned you,
but fate has abandoned me.

57
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,490
I have no idea what you're saying,
but that sounds sad.

58
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,200
My heart aches.

59
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,870
This is all your fault!

60
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,860
Jin-ah loved fried chicken.

61
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,210
Fried chicken is also my favorite food.

62
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,000
Could I see this again next year?

63
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,130
Whatever.
It's not like chickens will go extinct.

64
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,170
What is this sudden turn of events?

65
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,210
I'll leave if I must,
but I won't leave with a piece of regret,

66
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,050
so I'm going to eat
every single piece I get.

67
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,190
Excuse me! One more seasoned chicken
and another glass of draft beer, please.

68
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,480
Dam, thanks.

69
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,120
Thanks for getting hammered with me.

70
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,940
Other people ignored me
when I reached out.

71
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,050
Hey, Jae-jin.

72
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,120
Yes?

73
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,070
You need to learn
how to deal with the feelings

74
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,190
after you break up with someone.

75
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,180
What will you do without me?

76
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,990
Why would you disappear?

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,440
And don't get so obsessed with women.

78
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,860
Be good to yourself.

79
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,680
You're a pretty great guy.

80
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,970
Really? I'm a pretty great guy?

81
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,100
-Say that one more time.
-Whatever.

82
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,620
-Just one more time.
-Whatever, you idiot. Get lost.

83
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,490
Get out of my life.

84
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,690
Bye.

85
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,510
That pathetic yet annoying kid.

86
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,900
I feel sick.

87
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,580
Did I have one too many drinks?

88
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,070
Marble!

89
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,840
The Marble popped out!

90
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,100
Mr. Gumiho! Hey, Mr. Gumiho!

91
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,500
Mr. Gumiho!

92
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,820
Hey, Mr. Gumiho! This is awesome!

93
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,280
I fell down
after hitting my chest a few times,

94
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,789
then the Marble popped out
from the impact.

95
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,460
What?

96
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,510
Look. I'm not going to die anymore.

97
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,220
This is...

98
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,590
This isn't the Marble.
I think it's a half-eaten candy.

99
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,920
What?

100
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,820
Marble!

101
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,410
The Marble popped out!

102
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,570
Hey kid, you're going to get sick.

103
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,000
Darn it. I thought I saved myself.

104
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,810
Hey, Miss Dam.

105
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,110
It's very dangerous for you to walk around
in this drunken state at this hour...

106
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,920
Are you all right, Miss Dam?

107
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,160
[What is she looking at?]

108
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,680
[That's]

109
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,030
[the celadon made by the master]

110
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,970
[who made one of the national treasures.]

111
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,240
What? Where did they go?

112
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,320
What's going on?

113
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,060
What?

114
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,550
Let's see.

115
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,860
Am I seeing things?
I must've had too much to drink.

116
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,540
I can't believe I used my power like this.

117
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,110
Goodness.

118
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,360
That was startling.

119
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,490
Miss Dam?

120
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,750
Miss Dam?

121
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,030
Mom... Mom.

122
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,000
Mom, what am I going to do now?

123
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,960
Mom, what am I going to do?

124
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,880
Excuse me, Mr. Gumiho.

125
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,850
-Did you get a good sleep?
-Yes.

126
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,780
I'm sorry about yesterday.

127
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,520
I'm not the type
who gets drunk and makes a scene...

128
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,420
Miss Dam, may I have a word with you?

129
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,360
Sure.

130
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,010
What is this?

131
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,990
I wrote up an agreement.

132
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,070
There are a few things
I need you to keep in your mind.

133
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,550
[Shin Woo-yeo, Party A from hereon.]

134
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,690
[Lee Dam, Party B from hereon.]

135
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,380
Party B is obligated
to keep Party A's Marble safe for a year,

136
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,710
and comply with the clauses below

137
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,390
to keep the Marble safe.

138
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,610
One, no contact with the opposite sex
born in the Year of the Tiger.

139
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,490
Two, quit drinking to stay in good health.

140
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,550
[Liver, you did all the work.
P.S.: We never stayed dry.]

141
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,710
Three, do not consume chickens.

142
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,360
Wait, what is this?

143
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,000
Nothing makes sense
starting with clause one.

144
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,300
I can't contact with the opposite sex
born in the Year of the Tiger,

145
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,330
but how would I know
which year they were born in?

146
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,590
Doesn't this basically mean
I cannot be in contact with any men?

147
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,660
-It does.
-What?

148
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,590
Then I can't kiss any guys

149
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,790
and do this or that with them?

150
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,030
This or that?

151
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,140
And I can't drink or eat chicken?

152
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,850
Then why would I want to live?

153
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,590
The Marble is very susceptible
to your condition.

154
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,480
You haven't been living a healthy life

155
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,460
due to excessive drinking.

156
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,310
So it'll be a good idea to quit drinking.

157
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,910
What about chicken?
Why can't I eat chicken?

158
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,160
Tigers are the natural enemy of foxes,
but chickens are fatal for gumihos.

159
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,820
From ancient times, chicken blood
was used to ward off bad luck.

160
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,580
So you better not eat it.

161
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,380
No, I think I should.

162
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,370
I had chicken yesterday,
and I was totally fine.

163
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,540
Are you sure?

164
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,390
Well, I felt a little sick,

165
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,710
but it was tolerable.

166
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,190
That's just the first time.
It can get more dangerous over time.

167
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,030
Gosh.

168
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,160
I mean, I could die in a year,

169
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,260
[Agreement]

170
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,550
but I have to spend
my remaining life feeling depressed?

171
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,860
Miss Dam.

172
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,470
I don't plan on letting you die.

173
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,380
So please trust me,
and let's focus on the things we can do.

174
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,280
I'll look for ways to retrieve the Marble,

175
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,570
and you can focus on keeping it safe.

176
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,180
I think that's the way for you to survive.

177
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,700
-Hey, Dam.
-What?

178
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,340
What happened at the club?
Where did you suddenly go?

179
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,290
Oh, something suddenly came up.

180
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,480
You left without a word?

181
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,490
-Yes.
-What?

182
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,560
My phone died, so I couldn't contact you.

183
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,670
Sorry. Did I keep you guys from partying?

184
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,440
That's not the case.
We had lots of fun partying.

185
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,510
I never get bored if I got some beats.

186
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,140
I got, got, got,

187
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,440
got, got, got, got...

188
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,650
That was loud.

189
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,670
Who the heck drives like that?

190
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,830
I think that's Seon-woo.

191
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,640
What? Gye Seon-woo?
From the class of 2017?

192
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,710
-The playboy?
-Yes.

193
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,100
The legend of the history department
who dated over 20 women, Seon-woo.

194
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,740
We're doing a group project together,
so I know him.

195
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,930
He returned to school.

196
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,069
I'm jealous.

197
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,940
Let's go eat.

198
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,390
Hey, wait for me.

199
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,090
[I'm in class with Seon-woo. Lucky me!]

200
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,970
It's already on Everyday Time.

201
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,990
"I'm in class with Seon-woo. Lucky me!"

202
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,620
Look, there are 300 comments.

203
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,480
Wow, look.

204
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,240
So what? He's a bad playboy

205
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,090
who makes women cry a river.

206
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,400
Doesn't that sound better than you,

207
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,900
who gets played on?

208
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,790
No.

209
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,870
I think it's better that I cry
than to make someone else cry.

210
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,890
I've been hurt a lot,

211
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,400
but I love how I never hurt anyone else.

212
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,070
What? Have you been going to church?

213
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,570
It's what Dam said yesterday.

214
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,900
She said I should be good to myself
because I'm a good guy.

215
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,200
Did you read a book
written by Monk Bopjong?

216
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,230
That's the alcohol talking.

217
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,340
Anyway, I finally realized this
after hearing that.

218
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,410
Before I try so hard to get loved,

219
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,810
I need to learn to love myself.

220
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,530
After I made that decision,

221
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,770
I realized how loveable I am.

222
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,180
-You are?
-Yes.

223
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,070
I looked myself in the mirror,

224
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,320
and my face looked so good.

225
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,340
Then when I grabbed the bus strap,

226
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,790
my biceps looked so hot.

227
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,740
Then I have a mid-low range voice,

228
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,330
which makes me sound so sweet.

229
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,890
So lame, so stop talking
before I shoot you.

230
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,540
I'm leaving. I have to go get some books.

231
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,130
Why? You aren't going to finish?

232
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,270
I'm full.

233
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,630
-Bye.
-Bye.

234
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,890
[Okay. In order to survive,]

235
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,050
[I have to keep the Marble safe.]

236
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,880
Excuse me.

237
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,520
[Isn't he Gye Seon-woo?]

238
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,400
[The class of 2017,
born in the Year of the Tiger!]

239
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,140
You dropped this.

240
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm sorry, but could you

241
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,640
just leave it on the floor?

242
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,980
-What?
-Just leave it on the floor.

243
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,850
Thank you.

244
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,760
What's with her?

245
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,000
[What? Cohabitation?]

246
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,340
I get that the Marble
just rolled into that woman,

247
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,250
but how did you of all people
decide to live with a human woman?

248
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,480
Well, at first,
I thought it seemed interesting,

249
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,590
so I wanted to keep her by my side, and...

250
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,040
And? What?

251
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,190
Forget it.

252
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,480
Why won't you finish your story?

253
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,640
Why? Is she your type?

254
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,060
Did you finally meet your ideal type
who opened you up

255
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,000
after hundreds and hundreds of years?

256
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,290
Don't be so cheeky.

257
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,840
She's a human
who's still wet behind the ears.

258
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,100
Wet behind the ears? Like with blood?

259
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,530
What did you do to make her bleed?
Did you beat her?

260
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,840
It's a figure of speech.

261
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,660
It's used to express
when someone is very young,

262
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,900
a figure of speech.

263
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,420
I see. Is that so?

264
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,170
There are way too many things
I have to remember as a human.

265
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,030
I have to memorize idioms and neologisms.

266
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,550
And to order a croque monsieur,

267
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,400
I have to memorize English too.

268
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,420
That's French.

269
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,560
I can't believe how you managed
to be annoying for 700 years.

270
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,100
I'm sure it'll be very tough
for that human woman who lives with you.

271
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,090
Anyway, does she know she can end up dead

272
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,240
if the Marble keeps taking her energy?

273
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,770
I'm not going to let her die.

274
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,460
Okay. I'm glad you made that decision.

275
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,730
I hope you won't have to take the Marble
from her dead body

276
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,140
like back then.

277
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,060
Anyway,

278
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,610
there's something I'd like to ask.

279
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,020
-Dam!
-No, don't catch me!

280
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,050
Are you okay?

281
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,690
You're in the class of 2017.
Aren't you a tiger?

282
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,500
I was born early, so I'm a rabbit.

283
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,960
Early? You were born early in the year.

284
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,730
Thank you so much
for being born in the Year of the Rabbit.

285
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,640
I'm very glad that you're a rabbit.

286
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,450
Did you come to school drunk again?

287
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,700
-No.
-Anyway, have you heard?

288
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,060
We're doing a general assembly.

289
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,670
I can't be there.
I'm currently staying away from drinks--

290
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,470
-We're getting meat.
-I'm there.

291
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,540
I can go. I'll be there. I'm coming.

292
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,400
Okay. Go.

293
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,070
Yes!

294
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,160
♫ Meat! Meat is my vitamin ♫

295
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,200
♫ Meat is my antidepressant ♫

296
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,410
♫ Meat, meat, meat, meat ♫

297
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,620
♫ Pork neck, pork belly ♫

298
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,850
[Happiness isn't far away.]

299
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,330
[It's freaking far away.]

300
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,950
Hey, don't people usually refer
to pork or beef as meat?

301
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,750
This is just chicken.

302
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,260
-Why? You're crazy for chicken.
-You do.

303
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,350
I am. So I'm about to go crazy.

304
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,240
-Jin-ah used to eat like that too.
-Cut it out.

305
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,500
[Just one bite. May I have just one bite?]

306
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,970
[Just one piece of the wing
would be fine, right?]

307
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,100
[No, if I eat this, I might really die.]

308
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,540
[Forget it. There's no reason to live
if I can't eat chicken.]

309
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,130
[-I'll just eat it.]
-Do you want to die?

310
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,260
[No, I don't. I won't eat it.]

311
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,600
No, everyone is waiting for you.

312
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,960
Gosh.

313
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,250
Hey, enough. I'm here.

314
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,790
-Seon-woo.
-Hello, Seon-woo.

315
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,560
-Hello.
-Hello.

316
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,200
Hello, Seon-woo.

317
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,800
-Hey, Seon-woo.
-Over here!

318
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,950
-Hello, Seon-woo.
-Hey!

319
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,020
-Why are you so late?
-Hey, Seon-woo.

320
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,180
-Have you been well?
-I thought you weren't coming.

321
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,680
-Hey, grab a drink.
-Grab a drink.

322
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,920
Here.

323
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,130
-A toast?
-Okay, let's make a toast.

324
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,020
-Okay.
-Cheers.

325
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,550
Hey, I can't do this. I'm leaving.

326
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,310
-Already? You haven't eaten.
-Hey.

327
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,540
Yes.

328
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,590
I have to leave.
Could you take a step aside?

329
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,190
You're leaving?
Let's grab a drink together.

330
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,640
Things are too loud over there.

331
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,160
Stay, Dam. You couldn't be here
even if you wanted to in your fourth year.

332
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,360
You should sit
just as our senior suggests.

333
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,570
Yes, we aren't that rude. Take a seat.

334
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,190
Goodness.

335
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,280
I'm sorry for the group project.

336
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:52,270
It's okay. Things can happen
right after you get discharged.

337
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,530
-Are you Jae-jin's friends?
-Yes, Choi Soo-kyung.

338
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,980
I'm pretty and the top of my class,

339
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,880
so people call me
the Kim Tae-hee of Seogwa University.

340
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,300
That's your nickname?
No one ever calls you...

341
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,890
-Aren't you going to drink?
-I have bad kidneys.

342
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,890
-Then some chicken...
-I love animals.

343
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,030
Lee Dam, are you insane?
What's this crazy talk?

344
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,830
-Shut up.
-Lee Dam?

345
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,960
Your name is one syllable? Dam?

346
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,590
Yes, right.

347
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,650
Do you know my name?

348
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,240
You're Gye Seon-woo.

349
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,170
Let's be acquaintances from now on.

350
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,440

[There’s no evidence found from
any CCTVs and dash cams and]

530
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,530
[there are no witnesses, which makes it
hard to guess the culprit’s whereabouts.]

531
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,690
[This is the biggest hallmark
of this incident.]

532

Hi.

[Hey, Dam.]

00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,370
Do you have some coins?

536
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,570
Could you get me a drink?

537
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,540
Okay. Sure.

538
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,160
I owe you 800 won. I'll pay it back.

539
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,140
It's okay. You can just forget about it.

540
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,240
By the way, why do you keep avoiding me?

541
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,620
What? When?

542
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,200
Let's say you didn't then.
Give me your phone.

543
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,740
Why?

544
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,590
Why do you think?

545
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,140
Why do you ask me?

546
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,740
Just to check the time.

547
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,560
Oh, time. It's three...

548
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,500

Hey, you are such a jerk.

and our personalities don't match?

556

-You think I'm an idiot?
-Yes.

a wrong name.]

going to such a prestigious school.

563
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,900

00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,500
I had waited two years for you
to come back from the army.

567
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,440
You just came back and you're saying
you want to break up. Are you crazy?

568
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,810
Who is it this time?

569
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,540

Why not?

590
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,020
Because I'm locked up here too.

591
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,090
What?

592
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,430
The doorknob broke down,

593
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,850
so I was trying to fix it with the drill.

594
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:24,530
I even put the wooden block there
to stop the door.

595
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,210
Why did it fall out then...

596
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,350
Did I kick it when I came inside?

597
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,580
Yes.

598
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:36,010
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

599
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,700
Did you think I locked you up on purpose?

600
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,600
What? No.

601
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:43,710
No way.

602
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:56,120
By the way, how do we get out of here?

603
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,600
I guess there's only one way.

604
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,860
Right.

605
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,470

if I could use your phone.

608
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,940
To call a repairman.

609
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,810
I thought you were going to teleport us.

610
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,010
We can't teleport here.

611
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,120
Why not? You did it just fine
a few days ago.

612
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,140
Teleporting causes a wave,

613
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,300
which can affect the things around you.

614
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,120
And I have many important things here.

615
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,350
I see.

616
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,400
Right.

617
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,460

broke down again.

620
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,520
And I think the light will go off soon...

621
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,590
The light went off too.

622
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,540
Okay. Please repair this too.

623
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,900
Okay. Bye.

624
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:08,060
There must be something over there
to light up this place.

625
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,420
Wait here.

626
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,030
Hold my hand.

627
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,860
-I'm good.
-Okay.

628
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,680
Is this a kerosene lamp?

629
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,420
What are all these?

630
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:08,120
Things that were naturally collected
over time.

631
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,010
My gosh.

632
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,750
This is a bronze dagger, right?

633
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,240
Gosh, this must be a white porcelain
from the Joseon Dynasty.

634
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,640
No way! Is that Shin Yun-bok's painting?

635
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,310
How do you have that?

636
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,470
I once worked as a trader
during the reign of Jeongjo.

637
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,280
Gosh, that's amazing.

638
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,920
What's that?

639
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,660
It's a sketch.

640
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:45,650
I once worked for the science department.

641
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,770
You were a scientist?
You were such an elite.

642
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,240
And what else have you done?

643
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,350
[During the reign of Seonjo,
I fought against Japanese,]

644
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,330
[leading the country to victory.]

645
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,340
You were in the military too.

646
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:09,850
That's why there are
swords and bows there.

647
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,490
-Gosh.
-Miss Dam.

648
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,570
You seem to be very interested
in history, unlike most young people.

649
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,120
Haven't I told you yet?
I major in history.

650
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:20,500
Some kids applied for this major
because of their grades,

651
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,610
but in my case,
it's because I love history.

652
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,910
I have always liked to watch
historic dramas since I was little.

653
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,470
Gosh.

654
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,410
I want to be a museum curator
after graduation.

655
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,920
But I'm not sure if I can live until then.

656
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,700
Anyway, this is really cool.

657
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,120
I have always wanted
to travel back in time like in TV series

658
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,150
if I could.

659
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,800
I'm so envious that you got to live
in so many eras.

660
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,600
How does it feel to live a long life?

661
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,400
Nothing. It doesn't feel anything.

662
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,560
Oh, there's a pipe too.

663
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,140
Have you used it yourself?

664
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,870
-Yes.
-Since when?

665
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,250
Since cigarettes were imported in 1592.

666
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,010
1592?

667
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,300
When Japan invaded Korea?

668
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,860
Have you been smoking cigarettes
for over 400 years then?

669
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:29,750
And I made you quit that?

670
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,980
Just keep on smoking.

671
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,840
What am I to stop
your 400-year-standing habit?

672
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,360
Actually, I thought it would be easy.

673
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,420
I thought it shouldn't be too hard

674
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,930
to change one habit.

675
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:47,880
But it turned out to be hard.

676
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:50,430
It made me realize that I might have made
unreasonable demands.

677
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,080
So I want to keep myself from smoking
during the contract period.

678
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:56,200
To share your pain.

679
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,360
I'm okay though.

680
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,410
So you have been smoking for 400 years.

681
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,300
Then how old are you?

682
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,690
I'm 22. Born in 1999,
the Year of the Rabbit.

683
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,460
I'm 999. Born in 1012, during the reign
of Hyeonjong of Goryeo.

684
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,090
-Relax.
-I mean...

685
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,910
Now I hear your actual age,
I realize how ancient you are.

686
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:21,060
As a matter of fact,
you've been scolding me so much

687
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,560
I felt like I was living
with a great grandpa.

688
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:24,970
But if you think about it,

689
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,140
you've lived longer than
my great great grandpa.

690
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:32,140
Now I get why you have been speaking
like a fossil...

691
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,730
Oh, it's a wind chime.

692
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,340
It's so pretty.

693
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,180
I have seen fish-shaped sails,

694
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,110
but I haven't seen
a leaf-shaped one like this.

695
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,020
You can have it if you like it.

696
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:55,240
Are you sure?

697
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,880
It looks at least a few hundred years old.

698
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,700
I bought it in Insa-dong. At 7,000 won.

699
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,970

[Spicy braised chicken]

702
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,410
It looks so tasty.

703
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:31,370
I'm just looking at it.

704
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,620
You quit cigarettes, which you have been
smoking for over 400 years.

705
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,780
And I've been eating chicken
for only 20 years.

706
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,670
I can hold it for one year.

709
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,520
What's all this?

710
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,720
You can't eat your favorite food, chicken,

711
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,790
and I felt bad
to put you through such pain.

712
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,860
So I made spicy stir-fried chicken
using duck.

713
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,540
Wait. Can you eat duck?

714
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,570
No, I can't.

715
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,820
I can't have enough of it!

716
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,450
Thanks for the food.

717
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:01,920
It looks tasty.

718
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:09,570
[Seriously? The flavor, seasoning,
and texture are all horrible.]

719
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,460
How does it taste?

720
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,880
Do you like it?

721
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,200
Yes.

722
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,640
It's tasty. It tastes really good.

723
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,550
-I made a lot of it. You can have it all.
-No, wait!

724
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,910
It's not tasty, right?

725
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,290
Well...

726
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,910
I'm sorry.
I appreciate your kindness though.

727
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,670
I'll go get something to eat.

728
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,080
Don't. I'm okay.

729
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:47,020
I don't want you to starve because of me.

730
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,340
I'll be right back.

731
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,330
But I'm really okay.

732
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,510
Maybe I should have tried to eat it.

733
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,960
It would have made me more patient.

734
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,550
I'll tell him we're having

Wait.

741
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:23,320
Is the reason
why he's being so persistent...

742
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,500
because he hates to own someone?

743
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:32,470

Right. I bought some pizza.
Is that okay with you?

No, it's not.

786
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,900
I think

787
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,190
greasy food like that can cause trouble

788
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,440
and diseases like obesity and esophagitis.

789
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,900
I should have asked you
before buying it then.

790
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,920
Is there anything else you want to eat?

791

You don't need to call me that.

813
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,730
You don't have
to give me 800 won back either.

814
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,710
This doesn't make up for it.

-Sure.

if the Marble is still there?

-Did something happen?
-It's just that

835
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,660
I felt like all my organs came out.

I was worried the Marble also...

Are you sure?

842
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:39,110
What about esophagitis and gastritis?

843
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,050
Actually, I gave it some thoughts.

844
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,940
You see, cars need oil to move.

845
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:45,930
I think humans need some oil too to move.

846
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:47,430

01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,570
I have one question.

851
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,900
For me? What is it?

852
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:13,080
Losing the Marble would be
a good thing for you.

853
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,320
Right. That's what I want.

854
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,350
Then why were you so relieved

855
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,160
when I said the Marble was still there?

856
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:23,550
I do wish the Marble is gone,

857
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,660
but I wish it happens safely.

858
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:29,050
I don't want the Marble
to go to the sewer.

859
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,810
I don't only care about my own life.

860
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,280
I care about the Marble
and your dream too.

861
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:35,830
I'm not that selfish.

862
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:44,800
Why don't you have some too?

863
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,540
I don't appease my hunger with human food.

864
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:50,570
Human food is like some sort of snack

865
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,860
I eat for pleasure from time to time.

866
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,020
Then why did you cook earlier?

867
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:57,340
I told you.

868
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:00,600
I made it because I felt bad
that I put you through the pain.

869
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,600
Then did you get these...

870
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,580
I got them for you.

871
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:11,340
Oh, I see.

872
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,730
This goes to plastic
and this goes to plastic bags. Right?

873
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,050
Yes.

874
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,820
From now on, I'll make sure
to recycle trash.

875
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,500
Right. Can we talk about
how we address each other?

876
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,450
I don't feel comfortable
calling you Mr. Gumiho all the time.

877
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:38,530
Since I call you by your name,
you can call my name too.

878
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,240
No, I can't do that.

879
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:42,660
You're 977 years older than me.

880
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,180
It's like I can't call
the king of a country by his name.

881
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,600
I think it's disrespectful.

882
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,680
How about Mr. Landlord?

883
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,830
Well, maybe it sounds like
you would push me to pay rent.

884
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,260
How about Mr. Ancestor?

885
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:06,290
Well, I guess it sounds like
you'd take food from an ancestral rite.

886
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,280
How about "sir"?

887
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,960
How about Oldmiho?
It's short for Old Gumiho.

888
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:16,590
"Sir" sounds good to me.

889
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,330
It's "sir" then.

890
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:22,130
Let's get inside, sir.

891
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:25,210
Sir.

892
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:28,770
"Sir"...

893
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,230
He's sweeter

894
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:55,000
and more caring than I thought.

895
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:56,850
And...

896
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,500
How does it feel to live a long life?

897
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:04,550
Nothing. It doesn't feel like anything.

898
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:08,460
He looks a bit lonely too.

899
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,030
Sir.

900
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,770
Why haven't you go to bed yet?

901
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:01,190
Well, I was doing my assignment
and I got sleepy,

902
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,900
so I came out to get some fresh air.

903
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,740
It's hard, right?

904
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:21,430
You seem tired, so I was worried.

905
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:26,620
Until now, I have been thinking
only about my situation,

906
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,740
but earlier when I visited the basement,

907
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:33,620
I realized how long you have been living.

908
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:38,410
For such a long time, you had one dream.

909
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:42,330
And it can all go down the drain,

910
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,190
so I can only imagine how hard it must be.

911
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,590
I feel a bit bad too,
because it feels like it's my fault.

912
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:53,330
Why would you feel bad?

913
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:55,220
Just because.

914
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,880
You know what? How about we try

915
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:02,570
to live through this day?

916
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:06,090
If we repeat that,
I believe good days will come in the end.

917
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,820
Let's tough it out together.

918
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:16,870
I'll go inside now.

919
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,460
Don't think too much.

920
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,810
[Anyway, there's something
I'd like to ask.]

921
01:08:11,649 --> 01:08:14,370
Did you even want to become a human?

922
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,810
To be honest, after what happened,

923
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:21,149
I thought you gave up hope.

924
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:25,240
Who is she to turn you like this?

925
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:30,040
You already know
how to take the Marble out.

926
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:40,510
-Miss Dam.
-Yes?

927
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,310
Let me check one thing.

928
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:16,330
You can go back now.

929
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,640
Just think

930
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,470
all this was a dream.

931
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,560
I'll get going.

932
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,350
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

933
01:10:57,570 --> 01:11:00,120
If I say I want to be your boyfriend,
will you let me?

934
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,230
What do you think he's up to?

935
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,320
[I think even Gye Seon-woo
can't get Lee Dam.]

936
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,300
You. Aren't you leaving?

937
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:09,620
How can I help you?

938
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,560
-Go on a date with me.
-A date?

939
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:15,300
It may be just a simulation,
but I thought I should dress properly.

940
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:17,680
[He's enchanting me.]

941
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,220
[He's indeed a fox.]

942
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,890
Hold it in

943
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:23,040
and date her.

944
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,300
[This might be the last chance you have.]
