00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,835
[ Are you sure you want this? ]

2
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,745
[ Even if she meets other people, ]

3
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,615
[ dates others, loves others, ]

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,665
[ and eventually
stays out of your life forever? ]

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,875
[ No. ]

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,665
[ I'm not sure. ]

7
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,490
[ Episode 9 ]

8
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,505
Dan, you should marry into my family.

9
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,699
You don't have a sister.

10
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,165
You can have my brother.

11
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,685
Stop talking nonsense.

12
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,829
Why are you here?

13
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,989
I was about to get off the taxi,

14
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,019
then my eyes met with Jae-gang's eyes
as he was coming back from work.

15
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,269
He said he'll kill me
if I ever come home hammered again.

16
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,639
So I stayed in the taxi
and came straight here.

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,809
I opened the door for him thinking
he was with you, but he was alone.

18
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,805
He insisted on having a drink with you,
but I managed to put him to sleep.

19
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,245
He said he needed the bed,
so he slept on mine without showering.

20
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,449
My brother, don't be so critical of me.

21
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,445
You'll be exactly like me
once you go to college.

22
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,565
My gosh, why are you cursing me?

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,589
Anyway, why were you late?

24
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,925
I fell asleep thinking you'd be back soon.

25
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:22,895
Oh, I was out taking a walk.

26
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,229
Goodness, why can't you come home earlier?

27
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,224
Think of your family who's waiting.

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,445
Hey, that's not for you to say
after that trouble you caused yesterday.

29
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,125
Trouble?

30
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,105
What trouble?

31
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,165
Really? I really broke Hye-sun's car?

32
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,055
I'm telling you.

33
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,299
Wait, and not only was that car expensive,

34
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,155
but Professor Shin was there too?

35
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,835
Yes.

36
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,735
Anyway, you should call Hye-sun.

37
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,135
Hey, how can you be so calm
when your friend is about to go bankrupt?

38
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,205
You're bust, not me.

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,155
Darn it, my life is over.

40
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,929
Dam, can you tell my brothers

41
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,839
that it was a pure accident
that I got hammered and broke that car?

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,159
They really adore you.

43
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,089
Stop pestering me. Go away.

44
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,249
Dam, you know that I love you, right?

45
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,415
I don't need your love.

46
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,405
Let's begin the class.

47
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,425
I didn't know Professor Shin was here.

48
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,545
Open up to page 201.
Today's subject is philosophy of history.

49
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,025
[ I like someone else. ]

50
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,219
[ Is it Jae-jin? ]

51
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,805
May I borrow a pencil?

52
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,405
Thank you so much.

53
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,925
[ He's her type?
But she could do much better. ]

54
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,225
[ I think I'm better than him. ]

55
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,015
We must continuously attempt
to observe human history as a whole.

56
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,129
[ Seogwa University ]

57
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,445
This is an effort to explain
the essence and meaning of history.

58
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,695
That's why the philosophy of history

59
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,475
has become important.

60
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,865
[ I should not be curious. ]

61
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,565
[ I'll watch over her for a short while, ]

62
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,554
[ then I must move out of her life. ]

63
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,554
[ There's nothing I can do, ]

64
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,465
[ nor should I try to do anything. ]

65
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,049
That's all for today's lecture.

66
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,005
- Thank you, Professor.
- Thank you, Professor.

67
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,889
Professor.

68
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,335
Are you coming to the history trip
with our department tomorrow?

69
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,485
I have an important meeting to attend.

70
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,009
You have to come with us
on our next trip, then.

71
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,055
- Are you going to meet with Hye-sun?
- Why is he meeting her?

72
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,975
Why do you look so uncomfortable?

73
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,495
I just feel really bad.

74
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,495
Was it that devastating
to run into your ex-girlfriend?

75
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,925
So much so that you drank up
every single drop of alcohol in Seoul?

76
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,705
Well, I guess.

77
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,095
How much was the estimate?

78
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,554
The estimate?

79
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,159
Oh, I threw that car away.

80
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,625
You threw it away?

81
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,875
I thought
I only broke the side-view mirror.

82
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,195
You're right.

83
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,615
But I never get anything fixed.

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,195
I see.

85
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,535
Then how much do I owe you?

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,185
[ Is she going to demand
I pay everything for her new car? ]

87
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,985
[ Then what do I say to my brothers? ]

88
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,799
[ It might be safer
for me to sell my kidney off. ]

89
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,605
- Jae-jin.
- Yes?

90
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,595
Don't get scared.
I won't ask you to pay me back.

91
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,865
What?

92
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,399
Just forget it.

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,795
I recently became fond of white cars,
so I got a new one with this chance.

94
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,009
But still, that's a little...

95
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,649
A little what? You don't have any money.

96
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,815
- How can you tell?
- By the way you look.

97
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,935
Right.

98
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,289
But still, let me chip in a little.

99
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,829
I'll ask my brothers

100
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,125
or work to make
a couple hundred thousand won.

101
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,579
It's great that
you're letting me off like this,

102
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,225
but I know I'd always feel sorry for this.

103
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,405
[ What an oddball. ]

104
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,025
[ Most people tend to run off
before I change my mind. ]

105
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,745
It's fine.

106
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,735
I don't need your pocket money.

107
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,095
I'm leaving.

108
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,645
See you at the history trip
or whatever tomorrow.

109
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,405
Wait, Hye-sun.

110
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,535
Can you come with me for a second?

111
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,945
To where?

112
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,975
Hey, Hye-sun.

113
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,929
Since you seem to have
all the money you could want,

114
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,129
I want to pay you back
by doing something else.

115
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,095
First off, I brought you a book
that might help you. Here.

116
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,304
Are you calling me stupid?

117
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,895
No, you aren't stupid at all.

118
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,725
I just wanted to do everything I can
to pay you back.

119
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,985
I'll be good to you
until the day I don't feel sorry.

120
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,539
Hello, Professor.
Please excuse my behavior from yesterday.

121
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,055
I'm sorry you had to see that.

122
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,425
Young man.

123
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,545
You shouldn't drink so much
and cause trouble to Dam...

124
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,835
And cause inconvenience
to people around you.

125
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,225
Yes, sir. I'll be careful from now on.

126
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,875
[ That's called jealousy. ]

127
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,889
Be honest with me.
You were jealous to see them together.

128
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,405
Did you lose your conscience
when you lost your Marble?

129
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,949
Not only did you fall for such a kid,

130
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,098
but you also got jealous of another kid.

131
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,835
You're far from
becoming a decent human in many ways.

132
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,025
What? What do you want?
What can you do anyway?

133
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,515
What I said is true.

134
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,175
You once said that

135
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,455
we never had a happy ending
whenever we started having feelings.

136
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,305
You're right.

137
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,265
I've seen that bad ending once before,

138
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,755
then I lived for a very long time
without showing affection to anybody.

139
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,765
Everything seemed futile since that day,

140
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,155
and I couldn't see any hope.

141
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,175
What's going on?
Why are you suddenly so sentimental?

142
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,715
You were in pain every time
you were in love.

143
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,765
So how did you
let yourself fall back in love?

144
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,595
What do you think about him?

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,289
Are you setting me up with him?
He's not my type.

146
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,299
You're insane.

147
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,935
I just want to know how he seems

148
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,355
compared to me.

149
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,945
In a nutshell, you want to know
which one of you two is better.

150
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,469
You're better.

151
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,399
Honestly speaking,
if you keep your mouth shut,

152
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,989
you'd usually be the hottest guy.

153
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,185
Really?

154
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,465
Hey, go buy yourself
something you want to eat.

155
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,635
If I wasn't your sister,
I'd date you right away.

156
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,195
You have huge eyes and a cute dimple too.

157
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,699
He can't be compared to you.

158
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,549
You didn't have to go that far.

159
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,745
Here.

160
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,425
So what happened?

161
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,119
Did someone say he's better?
Who's this crazy witch?

162
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,325
Cut it out before I take it back.

163
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,905
Yes, sir.

164
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,285
Please excuse me.

165
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,615
Well, yes. He's not even in my league.

166
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,655
How are things going with Seon-woo?

167
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,055
I set you up on a date with him.

168
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,019
Wasn't I right? Isn't he interested?

169
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,429
So? Are you going to date him?

170
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,159
Did you tell him about a close guy friend
that comes and sleeps over?

171
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,659
Shut your mouth, dummy.

172
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,815
That won't happen between us,
so mind your own.

173
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,379
What have you been printing?

174
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,739
It's for my presentation.

175
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,465
I have to give a presentation on the trip.

176
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,155

but you look so gloomy.

352
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,695
I'm concerned about something.

353
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,335
Concerned? What are you concerned about?

354
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,695
Yes.

355
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,045
Yes, I understand. Yes, Ms. TA.

356
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,669
There has been a change
in our next destination.

357
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,305
Why? Is there a problem?

358
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,979
There was a rockslide
near Songni Mountain,

359
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,655
so we can't make it to Beopju Temple.

360
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,615
Then where are we going?

361
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,859
- Take one for me too.
- All right!

362
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,529
- Stop that.
- I want one with Seon-woo too.

363
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,379
- Let's take a picture.
- Let's do that.

364
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,315
- Let's do it over there.
- Okay.

365
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,469
- Okay.
- Let's take one too, Seon-woo.

366
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,669
- All right.
- Okay!

367
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,785
Seon-woo, let's take a picture.

368
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,775
[ I had no idea he brought me here
to erase my memories, ]

369
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,395
[ so I wished
we could come back here together. ]

370
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,055
[ I must've looked ridiculous ]

371
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,385
[ as I wished for the impossible. ]

372
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,535
Why are you staring at her?
Do you like her that much?

373
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,249
I don't think her memories are erased.

374
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,635
Right, I'm sure her memories aren't...

375
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,675
What?

376
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,439
It's carved with many shapes
such as dragons, lotuses, and more.

377
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,695
When you touch it, it...

378
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,685
"Touch it"?

379
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,535
Right.

380
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,565
I meant that it's so exquisite
that it feels like I've touched it.

381
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,535
That's impossible.

382
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,185
If she knows everything,
there's no reason for her to pretend.

383
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,045
That's true, but...

384
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,255
Hye-sun, try this.

385
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,179
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

386
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,595
- Thanks.
- Don't.

387
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,579
- Gosh, it's so good.
- I'll do it.

388
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,119
No, it's okay. I will.

389
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,405
No, I'll do it.

390
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,479
Hey, what's going on between you two?

391
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,305
Do I smell love instead of pork belly?
Good luck!

392
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,679
- Seon-woo.
- Our meat is a mess too.

393
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,015
- It's completely burnt.
- Take a seat.

394
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,259
- A random game that we love.
- A random game that we love.

395
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,859
- Which game? Game, start.
- Which game? Game, start.

396
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,069
Hey, are you sharing your soju with me?

397
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,259
What? You're drunk.

398
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,329
No, are you sharing your soju with me?

399
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,909
You're so drunk.

400
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,459
- I'm not drunk.
- Don't drink too much.

401
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,115
I've had just enough. It wasn't that much.

402
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,575
Do you know what it's like to get drunk?

403
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,945
I'm not drunk.

404
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,675
Where are you going?

405
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,745
To get some air.

406
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,955
Hye-sun.

407
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,515
I have a question.

408
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,935
Why did you

409
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,365
speak casually with the professor?

410
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,039
I did? Did I do that?

411
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,059
Yes, you did.

412
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,015
She did, right? Didn't she?

413
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,269
Hey, Hye-sun used to live abroad,

414
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,549
so the Korean language isn't easy for her.

415
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,625
You're so drunk.

416
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,365
Come on out. Let's get some fresh air.

417
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,435
Come. I'll buy you ice cream.

418
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,695
Okay! Dam, I'll be back.

419
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,125
Hey, Hye-sun.

420
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,555
May I ask you a question?

421
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,365
What is it?

422
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,565
Well.

423
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,765
You said you and Professor Shin
got into an accident, right?

424
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,915
What happened?

425
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,315
It was just a minor collision.

426
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,265
I drove into his car
and caused the accident,

427
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,205
so I gave him a ride.

428
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,445
I see.

429
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,635
Why do you want to know?

430
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,115
No, it's nothing.

431
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,219
Where's my wallet?

432
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,759
- It's so cold.
- It's really gone.

433
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,869
Why do you always lose your wallet?

434
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,989
- It's really gone.
- Come on.

435
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,319
Guys, I'm tired. I should go.

436
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,345
Hey, Dam, wait.

437
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,275
I remember putting it in my bag.

438
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,665
You were right. She remembers everything.

439
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,935
She asked why we were together that night.

440
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,265
She's very concerned about you,

441
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,955
which means she must remember everything.

442
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,755
Then why is she...

443
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,345
If that really is the case,
I think I know why.

444
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,495
She must feel the same as I did back then.

445
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,999
Goodness.

446
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,305
[ In mourning ]

447
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,975
Oh no.

449

Please erase my memories.

450
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,075
Please, I ask of you.

451
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,325
I guess he passed as we expected.

452
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,805
Do you want me to erase everything?

453
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,235
No, just...

454
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,165
Just leave a little bit behind.

455
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,665
Just enough
so I wouldn't want to kill myself.

456
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,225
She probably didn't want to lose

457
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,885
all the memories she made with you,

458
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,925
so she is trying to hold onto
at least some of them.

459
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,785
Miss Dam.
Do you remember what I said then?

460
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,575
I said I had never had a family,

461
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,385
but I felt like I got one now.

462
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,175
I really meant what I said.

463
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,525
You won't remember a thing.

464
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,825
You just had a short dream.

465
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,235
As of now,

466
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,585

00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,075
[ Maybe he let me go ]

469
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,865
[ because he cared about me. ]

470
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,165
- Miss Dam.
- Yes?

471
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,085
Your memories aren't erased, are they?

472
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,475
I'm not sure what you mean.

473
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,575
You remember everything.

474
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,475
Why do you want to know that, sir?

475
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,245
Miss Dam?

476
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,115
Why do you want to know
if my memories have been erased or not?

477
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,569
Why are you doing this to me?

478
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:20,079
It's not like I borrowed your money
and never paid you back

479
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,595
or stole your money.

480
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,115
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

481
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,975
[ So she actually remembers me. ]

482
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,775
I told you I was a clingy person.

483
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,195
So why did you
have to show up like this and...

484
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,119
We need to talk, Miss Dam.

485
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,789
Don't do anything.

486
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,599
Don't talk to me.
Don't act like you know me.

487
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,089
Don't do anything.

488
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,265
You ended it without asking me.
So why are you doing this to me?

489
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,469
Stop worrying about me.

490
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,685
Stop grabbing my hand so randomly.

491
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,445
Because that makes my heart flutter.

492
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,495
What?

493
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,565
Whenever you do that,

494
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,905
my heart pounds like crazy.

495
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,449
Miss Dam.

496
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,789
Tell me, Sir.
Was I nothing but just a Marble carrier?

497
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,165
Was I?

498
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,035
Have you really never had
any feelings for me?

499
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,565
Miss Dam.

500
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,335
The reason why I don't say
what you want to hear

501
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,775
is not because I don't care about you.

502
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,305
It's because you don't deserve me.

503
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:50,855
You should be with someone
who is safer and more normal.

504
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,455
You are

505
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,795
too good for me.

506
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,925
I don't think I'm too good for you.

507
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,445
And I don't want to be calculative and all

508
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:05,995
because I'm not taking this lightly.

509
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:11,495
I like you.

510
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,865
And I want you to like me too.

511
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,555
[ A reckless and bold confession. ]

she has always been like this. ]

513
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,988
Now that we're on the subject,
I want an agreement too.

514
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,065
I'd like to make three requests.

515
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,934
[ She never hesitates and she's daring. ]

516
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,758
I'm 22. Born in 1999,
the Year of the Rabbit.

517
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:44,805
I'm 999. Born in 1012, during the reign
of Hyeonjong of Goryeo.

518
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,215
[ Living a thousand years, ]

519
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,405
[ I have seen, heard,
and touched many things, ]

520
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,275
[ but I have never felt anything. ]

521
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,649
[ Just like the sceneries out the window, ]

522
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:09,835
[ everything in my life passed by
so fast and hazily. ]

523
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,765
[ Then I met her, and for the first time, ]

524
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,125

on the flea market app.

romantic comedy dramas,

701
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,969

of the latest dating trend.

00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,245

Why sauna, all of a sudden?

00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,945
I saw on dramas

00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,295
that this is where many couples like to go
when they go on dates.

[ Sauna date is kind of outdated. ]

709

Why did you talk about magic
when we're coming to a sauna?

710
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:39,429
According to my research,
this is a perfect place...

711
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,645
because there are nine different rooms
made of nine different ingredients here

713
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,095
But there's one problem here.

Currently,

to do with your magic?

718

Sir, you're like Elsa.

723

I don't know who Ms. Elsa is,

it's a compliment.

Right. Let me show you something.
Don't be surprised.

726

"My Lovely Sam Soon".

730
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,925
It's quite a popular one.

731
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,835
It was aired in 2005.

732
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:02,915
Oh. Time really flies.

733
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,149
Well, you've been living

I understand
15 years feels like a second to you.

Is this the place you've always wanted
to go with me? A chicken restaurant?

Well...

You couldn't have chicken because of me,
