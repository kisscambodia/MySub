There are lots of awful crimes these days.

179
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,170
Right, crimes. You're right.

180
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,150
So while we're at it,

181
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,070
I think it might be better
if you avoid strangers from now on.

182
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,300
Sure.

183
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,280
If anything happens
and seems out of the ordinary,

184
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,610
please let me know.

185
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,040
I get worried.

186
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,310
You get worried?

187
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,300
Come on, sir. I'm not a kid.

188
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,190
Sir.

189
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,390
Ta-da.

190
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,590
I bought this.

191
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,220
["Goryeo, the Truths
and Misconceptions of History"]

192
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,930
[Shin Woo-yeo tells the story of Goryeo.]

193
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,850
-Why did you buy that?
-I wanted to have a read.

194
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,490
May I get your autograph?

195
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,000
I've never done that before.

196
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,780
It's a bit awkward.

197
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,820
I see.

198
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,010
[Shin Woo-yeo, to Miss Dam.]

199
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,280
Wait, is this me?

200
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,530
That looks worse than I actually do.

201
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,480
Then let me get you a new book.

202
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,710
No.

203
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,820
I'll just keep it.

204
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,230
You took the time to draw it.

205
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,080
[Soo-kyung]

206
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,220
[Here's the question and the summary
on the history of late Goryeo.]

207
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,550
[History of Late Goryeo,
for your eyes only]

208
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,260
Sir.

209
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,830
May I make use of you?

210
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,410
Make use of me?

211
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,830
Soo-kyung pointed out
a possible test subject for me,

212
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,649
discussing the background
for annotations of "Tripitaka Koreana."

213
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,560
I want to get a detailed explanation
from you, who lived through that time.

214
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,680
Annotations of "Tripitaka Koreana."

215
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:55,369
I have related products downstairs.

216
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,310
-Do you want to come with me?
-Sure.

217
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,600
As you know, the annotations were
created to supplement the first edition.

218
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,980
And that's called a sutra plaque.

219
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,400
It's a sort of a mark
to discern what's written

220
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,760
in the annotation.

221
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,310
It's like a table of contents.

222
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,180
I'm highly interested
in the Buddhist culture.

223
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,850
Sir, let's go on a trip
to a Buddhist temple after my midterm.

224
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,960
A trip?

225
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,850
Why not? Don't you like going on trips?

226
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,760
No, it's not that I hate it.

227
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,340
It's my first time.

228
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,800
You always say it's your first time.

229
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,780
Your first time living with someone.

230
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,500
Your first time having a family.

231
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,050
And your first time signing an autograph.
You always say that.

232
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,960
Did you only cultivate your morals
over 1,000 years?

233
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,640
What would you have done without me?

234
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,760
I wonder.

235
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,420
Then we have no choice
but to go on a trip.

236
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,320
I mean, I've been
worried about you lately.

237
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,520
You kept saying
all these mysterious things.

238
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,040
So I wondered if you'd adapt well
once you become a human,

239
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,430
but I think it might be
your lack of experience.

240
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,960
Since you can enlarge your experience
through this chance,

241
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,990
I'd like to go with you.

242
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,330
Okay, let's go on a trip.

243
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,270
Really?

244
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,070
Then promise me.

245
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,190
I promise.

246
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,930
It's hot here.

247
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,410
Sir, may I borrow this book?

248
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,330
[Book of Poetry]

249
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,740
[Temples with a nice atmosphere]

250
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,000
[Book of Poetry]

251
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,270
This must be a portrait.

252
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,240
Seo, hwa.

253
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,760
That sounds like a woman's name.

254
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,510
Jeong, da.

255
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,950
That means deep affection.

256
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,450
Excuse me, sir.

257
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,270
"Teuk, geup, jeong, da,
mong, jung, ji, yeon."

258
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,010
Does that mean the love was so special
that you miss someone even in your dreams?

259
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,260
You're right.

260
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,030
Who's Seo-hwa?

261
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,280
I found this portrait in the book,
so I ended up seeing it.

262
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,470
If you missed her even in your dreams,
I thought she could be your first love.

263
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,990
-Why was that in there?
-She was, wasn't she?

264
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,670
Her portrait and this letter.

265
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,790
She's obviously your first love. Right?

266
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,400
I guess that might be
the most appropriate expression.

267
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,160
First love.

268
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,160
Miss Dam.

269
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,490
Goodness, I'm sorry.

270
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,470
Thanks for showing your first love...

271
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,630
I mean, your book.

272
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,930
A portrait and a love letter?

273
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,020
He had lots
of romantic experiences, didn't he?

274
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,280
But wait.

275
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,850
He drew her so gorgeously
with every stroke of his brush.

276
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,280
[Shin Woo-yeo, to Miss Dam.]

277
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,720
But he did this for me.

278
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,530
Excuse me, sir.

279
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,540
I'm asking you without any intentions,

280
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,310
so this question is purely academic.

281
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,960
How did people date
back in the Joseon era?

282
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,910
Did you push a lady on the swing

283
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,580
just like Lee Mong-ryong and Chun-hyang?

284
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,970
I think so.

285
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,370
Then

286
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,340
did you buy her a norigae
out on the streets?

287
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,350
I've never done that, but I bought her
shoes decorated with flowers.

288
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,770
I see. You must've liked her a lot.

289
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,690
Well, I could see
how elegant and beautiful she was.

290
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,480
-She looks like her.
-Sorry?

291
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,850
No, never mind. Nothing.

292
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,870
Hey, can you stop making that noise?

293
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,460
You're making me lose focus.

294
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,950
There she is.

295
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,680
The highly sensitive Soo-kyung,
who shows up during the exam period.

296
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,530
My sensitivity and fierceness are

297
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,080
what made me the top student in our major.

298
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,140
I'm going out for two more cups

299
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,250
of instant coffee to wake up.

300
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,290
Goodness, she always overreacts.

301
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,670
-Hey.
-Fine. I'll eat quietly.

302
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,470
No, it's not that.

303
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,050
What does first love mean to men?

304
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,000
First love? All of a sudden?

305
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,630
I just got curious.

306
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,640
First love.

307
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,350
Those two words make you feel
so sentimental and painful.

308
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,030
I had my first love back in middle school.

309
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,230
We broke up
over the most heartrending reason.

310
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,420
She was terminally ill.

311
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,020
-Really?
-No, she lied to me.

312
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,490
It turns out
she two-timed me with a close friend.

313
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,910
Even though she made up
such an absurd lie,

314
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,910
I still couldn't forget her
just because she was my first love.

315
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,040
People say,

316
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,610
all men have one room in their hearts
they keep for life.

317
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,170
The room where they keep their first love
until the day they die.

318
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,780
So if he doesn't die,
she lives on in that room for life?

319
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,650
Precisely. She checks in,
but there is no check-out hour.

320
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,990
You may face a peak season
with other people you love,

321
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,240
but that room is always sold out.
No one can take it.

322
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,450
Goodness, you.

323
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,590
[Sir]

324
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,960
Hello, sir.

325
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,590
[What time will you be done today?]

326
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,350
Well, I don't think

327
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,080
you have to pick me up today.

328
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,130
No, nothing is going on.
I just wanted to walk a little.

329
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,920
Then let's walk together.

330
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,800
So why did you
suddenly want to walk today?

331
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,540
Just because. The weather was so nice.

332
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,990
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

333
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,050
Miss Dam?

334
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,640
Yes?

335
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,450
Let's go.

336
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,660
I said I'll buy you tteokbokki
with the bus fare I saved.

337
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,510
Let's go eat that now.

338
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,870
Is something wrong, Miss Dam?

339
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,670
What?

340
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,180
You don't seem very well.

341
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,420
No, it's nothing.

342
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,240
Anyway,

343
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,680
Jae-jin told me

344
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,760
that all men have a room in their hearts.

345
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,260
And in that room,

346
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,700
they keep their first love for life.

347
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,560
Is that true?

348
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,530
I'm not sure.

349
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,900
What about you?

350
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,600
She's suddenly come back to me
for a very long time.

351
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,730
[I feel like such a fool.]

352
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,160
[I hate myself for getting concerned
over something that happened]

353
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,530
[hundreds of years ago.]

354
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,680
What's going on? Why are you sighing?

355
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,270
Is that guy you asked out
troubling you again?

356
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,160
-What?
-I knew something was up

357
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,530
when you suddenly asked me
about men's first love.

358
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,820
Did his first love show up?

359
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,680
No, that's not the case.

360
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,440
Then just forget it.

361
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,290
You don't have to mind the past.

362
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,750
It's not like you can undo
what already happened.

363
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,000
I know that.

364
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,660
But I get jealous.

365
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,370
I hate how ridiculous I am,

366
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,390

What's wrong with me?

368
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,970
I think that's only natural.

369
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,770
There comes a moment in everyone's life
when they lose their usual pace.

370
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,810
It happens once you like someone.

371
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,630
That happens when you like someone.

372

Hey.

How are your studies going
for the midterms? Do you start tomorrow?

374
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,640
Why do you care?

375
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,810
Well, I wanted to bid you good luck.

376
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,800
And I quit smoking.

What? With me?

380

Is there another Dam here? Let's go.

381
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,950
Seon-woo, what you need to quit is
your interest in Dam, not smoking.

382
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,110
Why have you been like this to me lately?

383

I mean, you're always around me,

386
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,990
Because I was asked to...

387
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,700
You were asked to do this?

388
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,360
This monk I know asked me

389
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,780
to be kind to others.

390
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,740
That's how I can gain virtue
and end up in paradise.

391
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,040
I see. So you were a Buddhist.

392
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,360
Something like that.

393
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,710
But I don't even expect
to end up in paradise.

394
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,170
I just want to live
according to my fate and place,

395

enjoying this troublesome life
to the fullest.

396

That's all I want.

397
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,740
Hye-sun, you sometimes seem like
you have years of experience

398
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,980
from the way you talk.

399
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,930
Why are you criticizing me
while I'm being kind to you?

400
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,290
Criticizing you? It's a good thing
to come off as an experienced person.

401
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,900
I'm not sure. I hate it when people say

402
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,670
I seem seasoned
as if I have years of experience.

403
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,220
It looked like humans think
longevity is a blessing

404

and want to live forever.

405
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,100
Imagine if you live for
almost an eternity.

406
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,720
How do you think it'll feel?

407

I didn't expect you to find me.

It has been a while, fox.

409

Don't call me a fox. I'm a human now.

I'll ruin your life right now.

Woo-yeo,
what have you been doing to this day?

00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,860
Hye-sun is younger than you,
yet she became a human ages ago.

422

I said I wanted to become a human,

423
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,320
then you told me to collect
human energy to become one.

424
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,720
I've always known
you weren't the kindest guy since then.

It must've been lots of fun

if you just stood back
and watched me to this day.

427

from pestering you?

watching over her.

she has been safe?

it turns into a maegu.

Maegu?

442
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,500
I didn't want you to turn
into such a wicked creature.

eliminate you

within 1,000 years.

Why would you suddenly
talk about elimination?

446
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,850
There appeared one who goes against nature

447
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:50,220

What does it need it for?

that it might make it a human.

458
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,789

So where's this evil spirit
called maegu or whatever?

Even if you don't try,

00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,380
It was chaotic.

533
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,180
That's right.

534
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,430
I turned everyone down,
so if I share it with you,

535
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,890
it will make society chaotic, I think.

536
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,450
You have your point.

537
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,400
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.
Good luck then.

538
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,750
Why won't you share it with him?

539
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,410
I get it. You don't want to help him
because he's your rival.

540
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,760
He's not my rival.

541
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,530
I have never left my throne.

542
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,070
I have always been the top.

543
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,570
I'm unrivaled.

544
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,370
Come on. That's not quite true.

545
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,920
You're the top student
because you focus only on studying.

546
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,250
And he's in second place
while organizing all the events...

547
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,010
because he's a student representative.

548
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,260
Once he starts focusing only on studying,

549
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,150
he will be the top student, not you...

550
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,070
Which is never going to happen.

551
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,310
As long as you don't stop breathing,
you'll always be the top student.

552
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,480
This is not right.

553
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,750
It's 1859, not 1857.

554
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,400
I see.

555
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,780
-Which year?
-1859.

556
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,970
I'm not interrupting you, am I?

557
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:01,190
You seemed to have trouble
focusing on study these days.

558
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,390
That's why I wanted
to keep you company tonight.

559
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,380
To make sure you work hard.

560
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,960
Well, it's nice studying together anyway
because I can get your help.

561
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,070
I guess I can make
use of my long life sometimes.

562
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,100
Imagine if you live for
almost an eternity.

563
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,730
How do you think it'll feel?

564
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,480
In the end, you have to let go
of all the people you love

565
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,750
and all the good and bad memories
will fade away.

566
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,840
Is it really good to live
a meaningless life like that?

567
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,920
How does it feel to live a long life?

568
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,440
Nothing. It doesn't feel like anything.

569
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,570
I will try to understand.

570
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:06,930
-What?
-I said, I'll try to understand.

571
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,180
What do you mean?

572
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,440
You also say a lot of things
I don't understand.

573
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,640
So just pretend you got what I mean.

574
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,190
[The feeling of liking someone]

575
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,170
[can be quite childish.]

576
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,360
[That childish feeling
sometimes bothers me,]

577
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,330
[but I wish it doesn't go away.]

578
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:41,880
Seriously, everything you mentioned
was on the exam.

579
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:43,330
Did you wash your hair, by the way?

580
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,780
I got changed too.

581
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,390
What am I going to do?
I messed up my first exam.

582
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,440
I shouldn't have studied with him.
I couldn't focus.

583
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,300
Him? Who did you study with?

584
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,390
Dan. He's taking exams too.

585
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,890
Why are you smirking?

586
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,750
-As if you nailed it or something.
-I did nail it.

587
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,090
I almost got a heart attack
when I got the exam paper.

588
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,390
All the exam materials Soo-kyung shared
with me were on the exam.

589
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,940
I had so much to write,
but there wasn't much space for it.

590
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,530
What? Am I the only one who messed it up?

591
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,290
Yes. You're the only one.

592
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:29,180
You'll let me see your notes
and the exam materials again, right?

593
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,760
Where's your conscience?

594
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,530
It's very brazen of you to ask me to share
the fruit of my hard work.

595
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,720
I'm not brazen.

596
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,980
I'm going to buy you food and drinks.
I'll be nice to you.

597
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:40,090
Not interested. I've got to go.

598
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,210
Hey. Soo-kyung.

599
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,730
She said she's studying in the library
the whole night. Let's go join her.

600
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,850
You need to be around a banquet
to get some food

601
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,270
and be around the top student
to get some tips.

602
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,080
-You're right, but...
-The exam is tomorrow morning.

603
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,240
You don't want to waste time
traveling back and forth.

604
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:01,610
Hey, do you want to take
the same class again next semester?

605
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,260
-No.
-Let's go.

606
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:11,460
[Central Library]

607
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,550
I'm sorry. I can't go home today.

608
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,880
I really messed up the exam.

609
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,650
I think I should study
with my friends today.

610
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,770
[Okay. Good luck.]

611
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,050
[And call me if something happens.]

612
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,740
Okay. I'll text you immediately.

613
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,530
-Hello.
[-Mr. Shin.]

614
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,170
[This is Kim So-jeong
from Haemil Publishers.]

615
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,340
[A detective is going to call you soon]

616
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,720
[so I thought I might as well
give you a heads-up.]

617
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,430
What?

618
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,780
[Apparently Ms. Hwang said something]

619
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,620
[before that incident.]

620
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,780
[And all the people related]

621
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,110
[are required to be interviewed.]

622
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,200
[She said she was familiar
with the culprit's face.]

623
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,100
[She was familiar with the face?]

624
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,840
You don't have the Marble anyway.

625
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,830
[If this person can
change their appearance]

626
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,440
[and Ms. Hwang was familiar
with the face...]

627
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,870
Hi, Sir. What are you doing here?

628
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,260
I came to see you.

629
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,560
I was wondering
if you were doing all right.

630
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,270
Oh. I guess it bothered you
that I'm staying out.

631
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,270
There you are.

632
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,910
What?

633
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:05,870
Darn it.

634
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,960
[Sir, why did you suddenly disappear?]

635
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:43,030
[Is everything all right?]

636
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,860
[Sir]

637
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,610
Everything is all right.

638
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,650
Gosh, you scared me.

639
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,170
What happened? I was worried about you.

640
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,740
What did you mean by, "There you are"?

641
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,640
I said that because I found you.

642
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,300
Now, everything will be all right.

643
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,300
What do you mean?

644
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,820
If you want to come home
because you get tired or sleepy,

645
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,540
call me.

646
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,600
I'll come pick you up any time.

647
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:37,890
Okay.

648
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,730
Are you okay?

649
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:17,400
I guess all kinds of things happen
when you live a long life.

650
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,340
Now, don't worry about other things
and focus on your original goal.

651
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,060
You're almost there.

652
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,190
I know it's upsetting.

653
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,810
But there must be a reason why the Marble
changed its color for the first time.

654
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,320
So do everything you can to keep her.

655
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,660
If you become an evil spirit

656
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,700
just like the old man said...

657
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,860
[How does it feel
to witness the vain end?]

658
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,200
I want you to remember this day.

659
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,200
It can happen to you too.

660
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:16,060
Think of the girl as your last hope

661
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,520
and become a human.

662
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:21,510
I truly wish you won't meet

663
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:23,400
a tragic end like this.

664
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,330
Why aren't you saying anything?

665
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,930
Gosh, it's finally over. It feels so good.

666
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,040
Thanks, Soo-kyung. You helped me a lot.

667
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,810
If you thank me so much,
buy me some grilled pork belly.

668
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,220
Okay. Why don't we go now?

669
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:53,720
Grilled pork belly, soju, and beer?

670
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:54,910
I'd love to!

671
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:55,920
Where should we go?

672
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,250
What was that place called
where they had great fried rice?

673
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:04,190
[Sir]

674
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,800
[Miss Dam, now your exams are finished,]

675
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:02,690
[why don't we go on a trip?]

676
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:06,390
Guys, I have an appointment.
I've got to go.

677
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,730
I'm sorry. I'll buy you grilled pork belly
and beef tripe next time.

678
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,920
-Sorry. Bye.
-Hey.

679
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,730
Hey. Darn it.

680
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,890
It's okay. It's just the two of us,
so it'll be cheaper.

681
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,790
-Come on. Let's go.
-Forget it.

682
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,370
Let's do it another time.

683
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:23,070
I mean,

684
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:26,810
I don't want to be hanging around
the campus looking like this.

685
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:29,490
You know, I'm Kim Tae-hee
of Seogwa University.

686
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,680
You know what I mean.

687
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,860
Listen, my friend.
I really didn't want to say this

688
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,050
because you helped me a lot,

689
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,200
but why do you keep
calling yourself Kim Tae-hee?

690
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:40,670
The only thing you two have in common
is that you have a face.

691
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,240
What are you saying?
I totally look like Kim Tae-hee.

692
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,980
Gosh. How do I make you understand?

693
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:52,770
Hey, wait. Since you always say the truth,
please answer me.

694
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,610
Does she look like Kim Tae-hee?

695
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,950
Yes, she does.

696
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,180
What?

697
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,250
Kim Dae-hee, the comedian
who used to be on "Gag Concert", right?

698
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,630
You look a lot like him.

699
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,030
Bye then.

700
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,400
Let's go eat.

701
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:24,800
Hey! Stop right there!

702
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,450
Be careful. You might fall.

703
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:47,900
See? I told you to be careful.

704
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:50,760
Right. I almost fell.

705
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,190
By the way, why a trip all of a sudden?

706
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:57,620
We agreed to go on a trip together
when your exams are finished.

707
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,200
Right.

708
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,890
But I didn't know it would be
on the very day the exam was over.

709
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,400
Should we try another day then?

710
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,040
No. You say that

711
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,710
only when you buy lottery tickets.

712
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,940
Let's go.

713
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,090
Let's take a bus this time.

714
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,290
Why did you suggest
we ride a bus this time?

715
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:32,420
Well. I wanted to go slowly.

716
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,490
Slowly. That sounds great.

717
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:55,570
How about that?

718
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:02,210
Oh, I want to make a wish too.

719
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:52,240
By the way, do you have a wish too?

720
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:56,330
I mean, you can use magic
whenever you want,

721
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,500
you've been accumulating wealth
for almost a thousand years,

722
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,220
and you're so tall and handsome.

723
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,980
I wonder what wish you can possibly have.

724
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,680
Oh. Maybe you wished the Marble
comes out soon so you can be a human.

725
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,420
I made a wish for you.

726
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:13,140
For me?

727
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:17,670
You have a beautiful smile,

728
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,010
so I wished you would get to smile often.

729
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:25,190
You can make your dreams come true,

730
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,010
so I wished you wouldn't give up
on what you like.

731
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:33,600
And I wished you wouldn't get hurt

732
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:38,440
by others.

733
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:44,470
I wished you would always be well.

734
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,070
It's so pretty.

735
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,510
Don't you think, Sir?

736
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,310
I'm so glad we came here.

737
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,300
Sir.

738
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:21,070
Let's come back here next year.

739
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:24,420
Actually, earlier
in front of the stone tower,

740
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,850
I wished I could come back here
next year with you.

741
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:30,140
But not like this.

742
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,130
I wished you could come with me
as a human.

743
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:38,370
Miss Dam.

744
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:43,690
Do you remember what I said then?

745
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:45,540
What do you mean?

746
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,410
I said I had never had a family,

747
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,960
but I felt like I got one now.

748
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,910
I really meant what I said.

749
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:04,150
Nobody has ever stayed with me
for this long.

750
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,420
I've been used to being alone.

751
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,150
Then...

752
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,240
[I'm also okay with staying with you.]

753
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,590
[Then]

754
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:16,380
[Actually, I'm more than
just okay with it.]

755
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,700
[I met you.]

756
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,420
[And you happened]

757
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,810
[to become special to me.]

758
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,240
I lied.

759
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:02,540
I knew how to take out the Marble

760
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,190
from the beginning.

761
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,320
But I lied to you.

762
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:16,790
I needed energy to become human,

763
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,660
and you happened to be there.

764
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,540
You won't remember a thing.

765
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,710
When you wake up,

766
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,700
everything will be over.

767
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:09,060
You just had a short dream.

768
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,040
As of now,

769
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:17,420
the contract has ended.

770
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,120
[We appreciate Jung So-min, Ko Kyoung-pyo,
and Han Ji-eun for the guest appearances.]

771
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:19,110
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

772
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,090
[Sir, I'm home.]

773
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,720
[Her kind voice.]

774
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:24,610
[Her smile.]

775
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,410
[All those things were
perhaps a privilege.]

776
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,710
You don't have time to lose
looking miserable.

777
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:29,930
[Seogwa University]

778
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:33,810
[I'm just watching her
for a while. Just for a while.]

779
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:36,620
Are you free today?

780
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:39,090
[You're just acting like you don't know]

781
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:40,930
that I like you, aren't you?

782
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:45,030
[Is it really okay for you to see her
doing just fine without you?]

783
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,720
I like someone else.
