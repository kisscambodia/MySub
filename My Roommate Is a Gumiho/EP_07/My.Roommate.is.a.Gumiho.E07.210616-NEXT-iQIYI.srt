00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,965
Right, crimes. You're right.

179
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,945
So while we're at it,

180
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,865
I think it might be better
if you avoid strangers from now on.

181
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,089

- Do you want to come with me?
- Sure.

216
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,395
As you know, the annotations were
created to supplement the first edition.

217
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,759
And that's called a sutra plaque.

218

to discern what's written

in the annotation.

220
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,105
It's like a table of contents.

221

I'm highly interested
in the Buddhist culture.

222
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,645
Sir, let's go on a trip
to a Buddhist temple after my midterm.

223
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,755
A trip?

224
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,645
Why not? Don't you like going on trips?

225
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,555
No, it's not that I hate it.

226
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,135
It's my first time.

227
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,595
You always say it's your first time.

228
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,569
Your first time living with someone.

229
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,289
Your first time having a family.

230
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,845
And your first time signing an autograph.
You always say that.

231
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,755
Did you only cultivate your morals
over 1,000 years?

232
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,435
What would you have done without me?

233
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,555
I wonder.

Then we have no choice
but to go on a trip.

235
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,109
I mean, I've been
worried about you lately.

236
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,315
You kept saying
all these mysterious things.

237
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,835
So I wondered if you'd adapt well
once you become a human,

238
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,225
but I think it might be
your lack of experience.

239
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,749
Since you can enlarge your experience
through this chance,

240
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,785
I'd like to go with you.

so I ended up seeing it.

the most appropriate expression.

How did people date
back in the Joseon era?

00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,915
I think so.

I've never done that, but I bought her
shoes decorated with flowers.

299
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,235
Goodness, she always overreacts.

300
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,615
- Hey.
- Fine. I'll eat quietly.

301
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,415

Those two words make you feel
so sentimental and painful.

I had my first love back in middle school.

308

over the most heartrending reason.

00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,965
- Really?
- No, she lied to me.

311
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,435
It turns out
she two-timed me with a close friend.

312
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,849
Even though she made up
such an absurd lie,

313
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,855
I still couldn't forget her
just because she was my first love.

314
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,979

The room where they keep their first love
until the day they die.

317
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,719
So if he doesn't die,
she lives on in that room for life?

318
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,595
Precisely. She checks in,
but there is no check-out hour.

You may face a peak season
with other people you love,

but that room is always sold out.
No one can take it.

No, nothing is going on.
I just wanted to walk a little.

Then let's walk together.

329
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,745
So why did you
suddenly want to walk today?

330
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,485

00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,125
You don't seem very well.

Anyway,

342
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,625

they keep their first love for life.

346
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,505
Is that true?

347
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,475
I'm not sure.

348
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,845
What about you?

349
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,545
She's suddenly come back to me
for a very long time.

00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,175
family history books were often traded.

531
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,995
- Yes, I know that of course.
- What was society like then?

532
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,619
It was chaotic.

533
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,419
That's right.

534
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,659
I turned everyone down,
so if I share it with you,

535
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,135
it will make society chaotic, I think.

536
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,695
You have your point.

537
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,645
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.
Good luck then.

538
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,995
Why won't you share it with him?

539
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,655
I get it. You don't want to help him
because he's your rival.

540
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,005
He's not my rival.

541
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,769
I have never left my throne.

542
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,315
I have always been the top.

543
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,799
I'm unrivaled.

544
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,615
Come on. That's not quite true.

545
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,259
You're the top student
because you focus only on studying.

546
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,589
And he's in second place
while organizing all the events...

547
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,349
because he's a student representative.

548
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,599
Once he starts focusing only on studying,

549
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,495
he will be the top student, not you...

550
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,415
Which is never going to happen.

551
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,655
As long as you don't stop breathing,
you'll always be the top student.

552
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,825
This is not right.

553
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,095
It's 1859, not 1857.

554
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,745
I see.

555
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,125
- Which year?
- 1859.

556
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,315
I'm not interrupting you, am I?

557
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,535
You seemed to have trouble
focusing on study these days.

558
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,735
That's why I wanted
to keep you company tonight.

559
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,725
To make sure you work hard.

560
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,305
Well, it's nice studying together anyway
because I can get your help.

561
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:19,415
I guess I can make
use of my long life sometimes.

562
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:29,445
Imagine if you live for
almost an eternity.

563
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,075
How do you think it'll feel?

564
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:35,825
In the end, you have to let go
of all the people you love

565
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,095
and all the good and bad memories
will fade away.

566
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:44,179
Is it really good to live
a meaningless life like that?

567
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,265
How does it feel to live a long life?

568
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,785
Nothing. It doesn't feel like anything.

569
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,915
I will try to understand.

570
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,275
- What?
- I said, I'll try to understand.

571
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,525
What do you mean?

572
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,779
You also say a lot of things
I don't understand.

573
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,985
So just pretend you got what I mean.

574
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,529
[ The feeling of liking someone ]

575
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,515
[ can be quite childish. ]

576
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,705
[ That childish feeling
sometimes bothers me, ]

577
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,675
[ but I wish it doesn't go away. ]

578
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,219
Seriously, everything you mentioned
was on the exam.

579
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,669
Did you wash your hair, by the way?

580
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,125
I got changed too.

581
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,735
What am I going to do?
I messed up my first exam.

582
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,779
I shouldn't have studied with him.
I couldn't focus.

583
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,645
Him? Who did you study with?

584
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,735
Dan. He's taking exams too.

585
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,229
Why are you smirking?

586
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,089
- As if you nailed it or something.
- I did nail it.

587
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,419
I almost got a heart attack
when I got the exam paper.

588
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,719
All the exam materials Soo-kyung shared
with me were on the exam.

589
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,279
I had so much to write,
but there wasn't much space for it.

590
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,875
What? Am I the only one who messed it up?

591
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,635
Yes. You're the only one.

592
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,525
You'll let me see your notes
and the exam materials again, right?

593
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,099
Where's your conscience?

594
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,869
It's very brazen of you to ask me to share
the fruit of my hard work.

595
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:34,059
I'm not brazen.

596
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,319
I'm going to buy you food and drinks.
I'll be nice to you.

597
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,435
Not interested. I've got to go.

598
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,555
Hey. Soo-kyung.

599
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,069
She said she's studying in the library
the whole night. Let's go join her.

600
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,179
You need to be around a banquet
to get some food

601
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,615
and be around the top student
to get some tips.

602
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,419
- You're right, but...
- The exam is tomorrow morning.

603
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,585
You don't want to waste time
traveling back and forth.

604
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,955
Hey, do you want to take
the same class again next semester?

605
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,605
- No.
- Let's go.

606
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,710
[ Central Library ]

607
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,889
I'm sorry. I can't go home today.

608
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,225
I really messed up the exam.

609
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,995
I think I should study
with my friends today.

610
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,099
[ Okay. Good luck. ]

611
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,395
[ And call me if something happens. ]

612
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,085
Okay. I'll text you immediately.

613
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,869
- Hello.
[ - Mr. Shin. ]

614
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:14,515
[ This is Kim So-jeong
from Haemil Publishers. ]

615
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,679
[ A detective is going to call you soon ]

616
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,065
[ so I thought I might as well
give you a heads-up. ]

617
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,775
What?

618
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,109
[ Apparently Ms. Hwang said something ]

619
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,965
[ before that incident. ]

620
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,119
[ And all the people related ]

621
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,455
[ are required to be interviewed. ]

622
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,545
[ She said she was familiar
with the culprit's face. ]

623
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,445
[ She was familiar with the face? ]

624
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,185
You don't have the Marble anyway.

625
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,175
[ If this person can
change their appearance ]

626
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,785
[ and Ms. Hwang was familiar
with the face... ]

627
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,215
Hi, Sir. What are you doing here?

628
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:20,655
I came to see you.

629
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,955
I was wondering
if you were doing all right.

630
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:28,665
Oh. I guess it bothered you
that I'm staying out.

631
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,665
There you are.

632
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,015
Hi, Sir. What are you doing here?

633
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,455
I came to see you.

634
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,755
I was wondering
if you were doing all right.

635
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:02,465
Oh. I guess it bothered you
that I'm staying out.

636
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,465
There you are.

637
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,105
What?

638
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,065
Darn it.

639
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,149
[ Sir, why did you suddenly disappear? ]

640
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:16,130
[ Is everything all right? ]

641
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,960
[ Sir ]

642
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:17,805
Everything is all right.

643
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,845
Gosh, you scared me.

644
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:24,365
What happened? I was worried about you.

645
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,935
What did you mean by, "There you are"?

646
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,835
I said that because I found you.

647
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,495
Now, everything will be all right.

648
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,495
What do you mean?

649
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,009
If you want to come home
because you get tired or sleepy,

650
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,735
call me.

651
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,795
I'll come pick you up any time.

652
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,085
Okay.

653
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,925
Are you okay?

654
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:50,595
I guess all kinds of things happen
when you live a long life.

655
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,529
Now, don't worry about other things
and focus on your original goal.

656
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,255
You're almost there.

657
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,385
I know it's upsetting.

658
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:10,005
But there must be a reason why the Marble
changed its color for the first time.

659
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,515
So do everything you can to keep her.

660
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,855
If you become an evil spirit

661
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,895
just like the old man said...

662
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,055
[ How does it feel
to witness the vain end? ]

663
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:39,245
I want you to remember this day.

664
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,245
It can happen to you too.

665
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:49,089
Think of the girl as your last hope

666
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,565
and become a human.

667
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,555
I truly wish you won't meet

668
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,445
a tragic end like this.

669
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,375
Why aren't you saying anything?

670
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,969
Gosh, it's finally over. It feels so good.

671
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:21,085
Thanks, Soo-kyung. You helped me a lot.

672
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,849
If you thank me so much,
buy me some grilled pork belly.

673
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:25,259
Okay. Why don't we go now?

674
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,759
Grilled pork belly, soju, and beer?

675
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,939
I'd love to!

676
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,959
Where should we go?

677
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,200
What was that place called
where they had great fried rice?

678
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:37,140
[ Sir ]

679
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,845
[ Miss Dam, now your exams are finished, ]

680
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,735
[ why don't we go on a trip? ]

681
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,429
Guys, I have an appointment.
I've got to go.

682
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:42,769
I'm sorry. I'll buy you grilled pork belly
and beef tripe next time.

683
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:43,959
- Sorry. Bye.
- Hey.

684
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,775
Hey. Darn it.

685
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,935
It's okay. It's just the two of us,
so it'll be cheaper.

686
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,819
- Come on. Let's go.
- Forget it.

687
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,415
Let's do it another time.

688
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,115
I mean,

689
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,839
I don't want to be hanging around
the campus looking like this.

690
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,529
You know, I'm Kim Tae-hee
of Seogwa University.

691
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:03,725
You know what I mean.

692
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,899
Listen, my friend.
I really didn't want to say this

693
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,079
because you helped me a lot,

694
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,239
but why do you keep
calling yourself Kim Tae-hee?

695
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,715
The only thing you two have in common
is that you have a face.

696
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:18,285
What are you saying?
I totally look like Kim Tae-hee.

697
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,025
Gosh. How do I make you understand?

698
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,799
Hey, wait. Since you always say the truth,
please answer me.

699
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,655

700
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,979
Yes, she does.

701
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,225
What?

702
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,295
Kim Dae-hee, the comedian
who used to be on "Gag Concert", right?

703
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,675
You look a lot like him.

704
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:44,075
Bye then.

705
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,445
Let's go eat.

706
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,845
Hey! Stop right there!

707
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,495
Be careful. You might fall.

708
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,945
See? I told you to be careful.

709
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,805
Right. I almost fell.

710
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:27,235
By the way, why a trip all of a sudden?

711
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,659
We agreed to go on a trip together
when your exams are finished.

712
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,245
Right.

713
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:34,935
But I didn't know it would be
on the very day the exam was over.

714
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,445
Should we try another day then?

715
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:40,069
No. You say that

716
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,749
only when you buy lottery tickets.

717
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:42,985
Let's go.

718
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:48,135
Let's take a bus this time.

719
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:01,335
Why did you suggest
we ride a bus this time?

720
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,465
Well. I wanted to go slowly.

721
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,535
Slowly. That sounds great.

722
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,615
How about that?

723
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,255
Oh, I want to make a wish too.

724
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,285
By the way, do you have a wish too?

725
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,369
I mean, you can use magic
whenever you want,

726
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:32,539
you've been accumulating wealth
for almost a thousand years,

727
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,249
and you're so tall and handsome.

728
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:36,025
I wonder what wish you can possibly have.

729
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:40,725
Oh. Maybe you wished the Marble
comes out soon so you can be a human.

730
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,465
I made a wish for you.

731
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,185
For me?

732
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,715
You have a beautiful smile,

733
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,055
so I wished you would get to smile often.

734
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,235
You can make your dreams come true,

735
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:01,055
so I wished you wouldn't give up
on what you like.

736
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,645
And I wished you wouldn't get hurt

737
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,485
by others.

738
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,515
I wished you would always be well.

739
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,115
It's so pretty.

740
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,555
Don't you think, Sir?

741
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,355
I'm so glad we came here.

742
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,345
Sir.

743
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,115
Let's come back here next year.

744
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,465
Actually, earlier
in front of the stone tower,

745
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,895
I wished I could come back here
next year with you.

746
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,185
But not like this.

747
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:06,175
I wished you could come with me
as a human.

748
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,415
Miss Dam.

749
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,735
Do you remember what I said then?

750
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,585
What do you mean?

751
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,455
I said I had never had a family,

752
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,005
but I felt like I got one now.

753
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,955
I really meant what I said.

754
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:37,195
Nobody has ever stayed with me
for this long.

755
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:41,465
I've been used to being alone.

756
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,195
Then...

757
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,190
[ I'm also okay with staying with you. ]

758
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,540
[ Then ]

759
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,425
[ Actually, I'm more than
just okay with it. ]

760
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,745
[ I met you. ]

761
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,465
[ And you happened ]

762
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,855
[ to become special to me. ]

763
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,285
I lied.

764
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,585
I knew how to take out the Marble

765
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:39,235
from the beginning.

766
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:43,365
But I lied to you.

767
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:49,835
I needed energy to become human,

768
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:53,705
and you happened to be there.

769
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,585
You won't remember a thing.

770
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,755
When you wake up,

771
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:29,745
everything will be over.

772
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:42,105
You just had a short dream.

773
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,085
As of now,

774
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,465
the contract has ended.

775
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:20,165
[ We appreciate Jung So-min, Ko Kyoung-pyo,
and Han Ji-eun for the guest appearances. ]

776
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,155
[ My Roommate is a Gumiho ]

777
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,135
[ Sir, I'm home. ]

778
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:55,765
[ Her kind voice. ]

779
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,649
[ Her smile. ]

780
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:59,455
[ All those things were
perhaps a privilege. ]

781
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,660
You don't have time to lose
looking miserable.

782
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,975
[ Seogwa University ]

783
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,855
[ I'm just watching her
for a while. Just for a while. ]

784
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,665
Are you free today?

785
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,135
[ You're just acting like you don't know ]

786
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,975
that I like you, aren't you?

787
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:18,075
[ Is it really okay for you to see her
doing just fine without you? ]

788
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,765
I like someone else.
