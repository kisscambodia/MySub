Where should we go?

178
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,285
[ She somehow managed to hold out. ]

179
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,525
[ A gumiho can become a human
by taking their energy. ]

180
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,105
[ We pass over the Marble
to get energy from them, ]

181
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,105
[ then we must erase all their memories
when we take it back. ]

182
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,499
[ If we draw this out for too long,
their energy will be drained, ]

183
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,025
[ and we have no choice
but to take it from their dead body. ]

184
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,735
[ Woo-yeo also made one mistake, ]

185
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,445
[ and he kept his heart shut
for a very long time. ]

186
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,125
[ But he seems to have
a special place in his heart for her. ]

187
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,749
This is sour.

188
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,829
[ Is it because this was the first time
his Marble turned blue? ]

189
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,155
Why would you drink this?

190
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,725
[ If that's the case, her eyes are just... ]

191
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,909
This is mine.

192
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,919
[ He's about to hit his 1,000th year mark,
his deadline to become a human. ]

193
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,945
[ What's his plan? ]

194
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,765
Hey, you.

195
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,505
I heard Seon-woo made a bet with you.

196
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,615
Is that true?

197
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,665
Everyone knows about this. Everyone.

198
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,415
You're the type
who gets involved with the weirdest guys.

199
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,479
Are you going on this blind date
out of spite because of him?

200
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,485
Or is it because you were
turned down by someone you like?

201
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,425
How did you know about...

202
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,739
[ I will ]

203
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,725
[ break open your head ]

204
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,259
[ in half. ]

205
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,635
[ Getting chills ]

206
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,379
So you've never gone on blind dates
or dated someone.

207
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,855
That means you probably
never kissed anyone either.

208
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,755
- In that case, you're...
- Hye-sun.

209
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,289
Let's change the subject.

210
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,715
Yes, I have to go use the restroom.

211
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,155
Where are you going?
I haven't even begun yet.

212
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,849
If I'm going to help,
I'm going to make this perfect.

213
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,045
Sit down.

214
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,465
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,115
Okay.

216
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,455
Look at me.

217
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,525
When you hit on someone,
do you know what's important?

218
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,975
It's your theme.

219
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,609
You either give him your attention
in his face,

220
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,555
or you can be just plain mean.

221
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,619
I'm not looking to hit on anyone...

222
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,815
First,

223
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,099
a smiley face is the best move

224
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,605
to express your good feelings.

225
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,975
Let's start with that. Give me a smile.

226
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,925
Well, you can't suddenly tell me to smile.

227
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,755
What is this?

228
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,395
That smile was
more mysterious than the Mona Lisa.

229
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,035
Again.

230
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,395
Are you seeing a client?

231
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,879
Forget it. You aren't the type
who has a pretty smile.

232
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,679
No, someone told me I have a pretty...

233
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,075
Enough. You should go
with the bad girl plan.

234
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,719
But there's something you need to know
when you do this.

235
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,725
You can't just continue to push him away.

236
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,485
When you push him away, push.

237
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,135
Then you have to pull him in too.

238
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,815
What a surprise.

239
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,855
Jae-jin, get ready.

240
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,435
Yes, right.

241
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,299
Now, let's say he's your blind date.

242
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,905
What will you say when he asks you this?

243
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,329
Are you free tomorrow?
Let's catch a movie.

244
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,585
I heard "Twilight" was re-released.

245
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,875
I'll see if I'm free.

246
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,459
You should be free at night, right?

247
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,959
I'll pick you up after school.

248
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,165
I have to eat after school.

249
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,395
Then we can eat first
before we watch the movie.

250
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,609
[ Good job. ]

251
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,679
[ This is when you should say okay. ]

252
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,279
I'm sorry,
but I'm turning you down right now.

253
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,265
And I prefer to watch movies alone.

254
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,749
- Jae-jin.
- Yes?

255
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,295
She's hopeless.

256
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,835
What?

257
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,389
The cafe street in Samcheong-dong
by 7 p.m., right?

258
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,809
Yes, he'll see you
where you want to meet him.

259
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,659
So why Samcheong-dong?

260
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,725
What?

261
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,425
Oh, there are
lots of great places to eat in that area.

262
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,725
Anyway, bye. Thanks, Hye-sun.

263
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,985
Dam, you got this!
You can start dating too!

264
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,045
Hey, you can do it too.
You can date someone.

265
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,385
He's such an embarrassment.

266
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,994
It'll be so awkward.
Why did I say yes to this?

267
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:57,769
No, I need to meet someone I can handle.

268
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,845
I should date a human guy since I'm human.

269
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,625
Let's make things work
with this human guy.

270
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,145
Are you Ms. Lee Dam?

271
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,179
I saw your profile photo,
so I recognized you at once.

272
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,345
Hello, I'm Park Jae-hyun.

273
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,055
Yes, hello. I'm Lee Dam.

274
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,329
You must be pretty close to Jae-jin.

275
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,415
Jae-jin? I've only met him once.

276
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,049
But one day, he suddenly invited

277
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,159
all the seniors from our club
into a chatroom.

278
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,549
He said he had a friend
who likes men that are older,

279
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,765
experienced, and settled,
that he needed to set her up with someone.

280
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,985
And he even invited a senior
who graduated ten years ago,

281
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,495
who got married three years ago.

282
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,115
- Why was he such a nuisance?
- Seriously.

283
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,355
I heard you got an internship
with CDAY Group.

284
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,989
It's really hard to get in, right?

285
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,535
The process must've been tough.

286
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,869
The process was fine,
but I had a tough time making a choice.

287
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,735
- Sorry?
- That wasn't my only option.

288
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,415
I got into Samsong, LD, SGEI,

289
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,169
and every single big-name corporation

290
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,595
that comes to your mind.
Isn't that awesome?

291
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,695
So I began to wonder where I should go
to use my potential to the fullest.

292
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,099
- That was the hardest part.
- I see.

293
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,475
It drove me crazy.

294
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,105
Right, you know what?

295
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,405
Each corporation has
a different type of ideal new recruit.

296
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,675
But all of their ideal types
pointed at me.

297
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,699
For example, CDAY Group

298
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,459
loves people who are creative.

299
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,935
And I'm so creative. Let me show you.

300
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,389
I don't make normal lettuce wrap
with meat.

301
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,679
I'd flip the lettuce over like this.

302
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,615
And salt? That's too ordinary.

303
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,075
I'm so creative, I dip it in cola.

304
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,645
Open up.

305
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,835
I'm fine.

306
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,259
Something like that. For Samsong,

307
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,329
they really value teamwork.

308
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,195
And voila, I'm crazy about teamwork.

309
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,389
The kind of sports I love to play

310
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,785
is something like
group jump rope or tug-of-war.

311
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,325
I'm my own co-op.

312
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,339
If we end up dating...

313
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,749
I'm sorry I jumped too far ahead.

314
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,485
But if we do,
we can do the three-legged race.

315
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,905
Why am I listening to his success story?

316
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,359
It's as if I'm here
on a blind date with Bill Gates.

317
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,655
I'd do that for 10, 20 hours.

318
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,455
Hey, Dam.

319
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,365
Did you just yawn?

320
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,495
You were so amazing that I was astonished.

321
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,235
Right? You almost shocked me.

322
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,015
And then SGEI.

323
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,255
[ Miss Dam, may we have a word
after your blind date? ]

324
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,395
[ Is it bad to say you're like a niece? ]

325
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,655
[ Is your blind date ending soon... ]

326
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,675
[ Is your blind date ending soon... ]

327
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,215
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

328
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,515
[ Is your blind date... ]

329
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,815
[ Is your blind date... ]

330
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,019
Is this the cafe you often come to?

331
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,059
Yes, will you go in first?

332
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,549
I need to make a quick call.

333
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,275
All right, then.

334
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:12,635
I just read your message.
I don't understand what you mean by that.

335
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,845
Were you asking
if my blind date is going well?

336
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,005
No, that's not it.

337
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,615
Something has been bothering me.

338
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,595
Bothering you?

339
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,929
Why? Do you think
I'll do something weird here?

340
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,165
Sorry?

341
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,099
I'm doing pretty well.

342
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,269
I even kept the conversation going
as if this isn't my first time,

343
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,525
[ and I've shown positive responses,
so things are pretty mellow. ]

344
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,569
Although I may look
way too young for you, Uncle,

345
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,995
but I'm pretty popular out here.

346
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,465
Things are going really well here.

347
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,665
[ Then I'll continue to have
a great blind date. See you at home. ]

348
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,825
Goodness.

349
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,129
Hey, Dam. Over here.

350
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,895
Yes, hey.

351
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,465
I already ordered coffee for you.

352
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,805
Anyway,

353
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,815
did you walk in late
to avoid paying for coffee?

354
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,845
No, I wouldn't do that.

355
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,165
Dam, let me give you a piece of advice
as a senior in life.

356
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,065
I just bought pork belly, right?

357
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,195
That means you're supposed to buy coffee.

358
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,559
And it's not about money.

359
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,319
I've been a pretty social guy,

360
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,095
and I came to know
that this is good manners.

361
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,249
I really don't mind, though.

362
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,865
But please do be careful
when you meet someone else.

363
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,849
I'm sorry, I'll send you
a voucher for coffee...

364
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,305
One second.

365
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,965
It's CDAY Group. It's the manager there.

366
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,355
Yes, Manager. Yes.

367
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,199
I was going to call you first.

368
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,635
Yes. One second, please.

369
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,299
I love you, sir.

370
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,935
Why are you here?

371
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,235
I couldn't focus at home.

372
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,565
I should probably leave, right?

373
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,735
No, you don't have to go
just because of me.

374
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,389
Then I'll pretend like I don't know you.

375
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,555
Please talk to him at ease.
You don't have to mind me.

376
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,389
Okay.

377
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,405
[ Why did I say things are going well?
He can hear me now. ]

378
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,445
Dam, I have really great news.

379
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,019
What is it?

380
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,669
I mean, that was this manager
who was really fond of me.

381
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,139
- Okay.
- He said I have the highest score

382
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,905
among all interns.

383
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,789
Do you know what this means?

384
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,355
It means I have the highest possibility
of becoming a permanent employee.

385
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,775
My gosh.

386
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,375
This is awesome.

387
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,445
Gosh, congratulations.

388
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,615
Thanks a lot. I got too excited.

389
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,479
Come to think about it,
you're now in your third year.

390
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,775
Shouldn't you get started on job hunting?

391
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,079
Yes, you're right.

392
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,419
I wanted to make use of my major

393
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,569
and be a curator at a museum.

394
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,519
I believe you need to study abroad
even before you apply.

395
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,915
Wait, your family must be pretty affluent.

396
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,279
No, we're just an ordinary family.

397
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,499
I see. Then do you have a high GPA?

398
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,435
May I ask?

399
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,095
Well, it's okay.

400
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,575
Come on, what's your GPA? What is it?

401
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,035
- It's 3.5.
- Your GPA is 3.5?

402
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,455
What will you do with a GPA like that?

403
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,435
What will I do with you?
This is very serious.

404
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:21,235
Dam, let me give you a piece of advice
as a senior in life.

405
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:25,009
You have no time to waste your time
with that empty dream.

406
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,435
You need to face the reality.

407
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,505
When should you dream?

408
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,449
When you sleep. Dream while you sleep.

409
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,405
This is the time for you to consider

410
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,509
what you can do to get a job.

411
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,149
Well, thanks for the advice,

412
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,569
but can you tell me this next time?

413
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,025
Next time?

414
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,415
I'm sorry, Dam.

415
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,495
There won't be a next time for us.

416
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,635
I'm not going to ask you out again.

417
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,875
What?

418
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,509
You sat there yawning

419
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,279
while I shared
all kinds of things about me.

420
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,545
Then you suddenly became nice
when I said I might get a permanent job.

421
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,439
You put your fingers around mine
when I asked you for a high-five.

422
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,045
- No, you did that first...
- Anyway.

423
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,649
Let me give you one last piece of advice
as a senior in life.

424
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,019
Instead of finding a guy
who's already settled,

425
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,569
you should try to become
someone who's established.

426
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:27,325
You should worry about your GPA
before you start dating anyone.

427
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,509
Instead of shopping for clothes,

428
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,929
buy some books
to add a line to your resume.

429
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,399
Instead of putting highlighter makeup on,

430
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,665
go highlights on your book.

431
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,465
Do you get what I'm saying?

432
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,755
Then please excuse me.

433
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,895
Right, send me two coffee vouchers
before the day is over.

434
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,175
That didn't hurt at all.

435
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,465
Hey, Miss Dam.

436
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,485
Miss Dam.

437
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,975
Can you tell me?

438
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,265
Tell you what?

439
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,895
Why were you offended
when I said you're like a niece to me?

440
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,745
Please tell me.

441
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,425
Yes, right. I see.

442
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,165
Well.

443
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,345
Miss Dam.

444
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,555
As you know,

445
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,425
the only thing I can do is
mimicking what humans do,

446
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,195
so my choice of words
may not have been proper.

447
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,835
But what I wanted to tell you on that day
wasn't that you're like a niece.

448
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,755
I meant that you're special.

449
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,955
Over 1,000 years of my life,

450
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,075
I never took in anybody
like they're my family.

451
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,945
It took me lots of courage

452
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,585
to say what I shared with you.

453
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,845
Could you understand
what I was trying to say?

454
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,255
[ If you continue to be so nice to me, ]

455
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,155
[ I can't get over you. ]

456
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,275
Miss Dam, you don't look so...

457
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,505
Oh, I was just reminded
of what that guy said to me.

458
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,439
He said it in an off-putting way,

459
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,425
but it was all true.

460
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,995
I already know how important
this time in my life is.

461
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,975
Instead of worrying about a job,
I loved studying history, so I did that.

462
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,285
But people keep telling me
to face the reality.

463
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,515
Miss Dam, there's something
I need to show you.

464
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,115
Wait, what is this place?

465
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,089
Isn't this place closed?
Are we allowed to be here?

466
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,315
Well, only if you'll keep it a secret.

467
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:58,125
In that case, this might be
my only opportunity in life.

468
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,585
Gosh, white porcelains. So cute.

469
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,505
Have you ever used this in real life, sir?

470
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,825
Of course.

471
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,565
You're calling me sir again.

472
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,155
Right.

473
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,665
My gosh, this is so cool.

474
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,435
Look at that too.

475
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,985
Sir, what does this say?

476
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:05,986
<font color="#0080ff">[iQIYI Ver] tvN E06 'My Roommate is a Gumiho'</font>
<font color="#ff0080">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>
<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

477
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,485
By the way,
why do you like history so much?

478
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,285
I think I started to like it
because of historic dramas.

479
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,749
My brother and I spent a lot of time
alone at home,

480
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,385
so we watched TV a lot.

481
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,395
I used to find museums boring,

482
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,599
but after learning
about Admiral Yi Sun-sin,

483
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,115
his faded journal touched my heart.

484
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,409
They say, "The more you know,
the more you see."

485
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,185
But for me, I think the more you know,
the more you get to like it.

486
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,975
Do you know when is the first time
I saw your smile?

487
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,705
What are all these?

488
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,859
And? What else have you done?

489
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,809
You were in the military too.

490
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,405
How do you have that?

491
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,485
Gosh, that's amazing.

492
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,495
It was in the basement.

493
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,305
I see.

494
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,855
Miss Dam.

495
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:41,795
Living a long life, I've learned one thing
from seeing numerous people.

496
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,965
When you like something a lot,

497
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,825
you'll be led in that direction.

498
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,895
So I'm sure your wish will come true.

499
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,255
That guy earlier kept saying
he's more experienced in life.

500
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,225
I've lived a longer life,
so I should know better than him.

501
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,365
That's why you took me here.

502
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:15,505
I don't want you to give up
on what you like.

503
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,565
Is it really okay that I don't give up?

504
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,115
Is anybody there?

505
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,015
Is anybody there?

506
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,405
I'm glad he didn't find us.

507
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,795
It would've been nicer
if we could look around more.

508
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,485
- What a shame.
- It's okay. I saw enough.

509
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,420
[ - How did the blind date go?
- Tell me how it went. ]

510
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,385
[ Soo-kyung, Jae-jin ]

511
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,535
It's just my friends
asking about the blind date.

512
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,469
They actually put
a lot of effort into this.

513
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,685
Jae-jin even brought Hye-sun.

514
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,609
What?

515
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,379
Hye-sun gave me a special lecture

516
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,845
about flirting.

517
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,655
I should reply them.

518
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,955
I see.

519
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,605
- What's up? You never call me.
[ - Where are you? ]

520
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,935
On a terrace in my room.

521
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,205
I love heights. It's probably because

697
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,525
Then I wish it will be.

698
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,335
Good luck.

699
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,145
I'll go now.

700
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,265
Okay. Bye.

701
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,335
Call me when you arrive.

702
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,105
Bye-bye.

703
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,055
Maybe I should have
sent her off at the airport.

704
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,709
- I'll drive you to the airport.
- What?

705
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,005
If we hurry, you'll have some time
to see her off.

706
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,855
Mom!

707
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,855
Gosh.

708
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,495
Mom!

709
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:01,075
Hey, what are you doing here?

710
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,585
I asked him to come with me
to see you off.

711
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,559
You said you had important training.

712
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,325
This is more important.

713
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,829
You should've told me
you were staying only for three hours.

714
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,815
I didn't know you'd leave so early.

715
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,609
Hey, why do you look so...
Do you wash yourself?

716
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:23,329
Of course. She's the one
you want to nag about washing.

717
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,089
She leaves her hair unwashed
for three days.

718
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:27,729
That's to save shampoo.
I care about this country's environment.

719
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,069
- Wasn't it because you were homeless?
- Do you want to die?

720
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:31,779
- What?
- You are homeless.

721
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,369
- Right.
- You want to die?

722
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,485
- You never take showers.
- I do.

723
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,805
I've got to go.

724
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,285
When are you coming back?

725
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,745
A sudden meetup and a sudden goodbye.
I don't like this.

726
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,865
We haven't met each other for a year.

727
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,955
My Dam.

728
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,755
My Dan.

729
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,189
You remember our family motto?

730
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,665
- "Live your life on your own."
- "Live your life on your own."

731
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:11,965
And you know I believe you can do that.

732
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,995
Why are you saying that now?

733
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,515
I wanted to say thank you
for growing into great people.

734
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,625
I don't feel comfortable
leaving you two alone here either.

735
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,255
But I have never regretted it.

736
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,935
Because I believe in you.

737
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,985
Mom.

738
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,955
Sir, it's been a hectic day, right?

739
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,525
Thank you so much.
I could see her off all thanks to you.

740
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:08,805
That's no problem.

741
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:11,495
You must be sad though.

742
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,445
It feels a bit strange,

743
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,899
but I guess that's what family is like.

744
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,755
We may fight all the time,

745
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:21,469
whenever something happens,
we support each other.

746
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:24,205
That's probably why thinking about them
makes me feel safe.

747
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,865
So that's what family is like.

748
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,725
You have me.

749
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,565
You said I was like your family.

750
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:49,065
I want to be like family to you.

751
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,499
Someone who supports you no matter what

752
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,855
and makes you feel safe.

753
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,195
Even after we take out the Marble.

754
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,915
[ I managed it somehow, ]

755
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,245
but you didn't handle it well

756
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,675
to have someone special to you.

757
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,555
An intruder!

758
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,865
Father!

759
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,755
Father!

760
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,115
Father.

761
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,845
Are you okay?

762
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,165
[ I thought it was nothing. ]

763
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,555
[ Insincere act of kindness. ]

764
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:44,945
[ Meaningless kisses. ]

765
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,775
[ They were just what I do habitually, ]

766
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:59,335
[ so I didn't think
it was anything special. ]

767
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,675
[ I could have saved her life ]

768
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,485
[ if I had taken the Marble out ]

769
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,345
[ and pretended nothing had happened. ]

770
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:14,695
[ If I hadn't hesitated ]

771
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:18,785
[ to take the Marble out
and erase all the memories. ]

772
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,565
[ If I hadn't been afraid ]

773
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,855
[ of being forgotten by her. ]

774
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,355
Just think of this as a bad dream.

775
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,835
When you wake up,

776
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,185
both your memories

777
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,715
and pain will be gone.

778
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,935
Don't cry.

779
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,385
This is not your fault.

780
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,375
You just

781
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,575
wanted to stay with me.

782
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,245
I wish

783
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,645
your dream comes true

784
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:23,415
and meet someone to teach you

785
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,215
what it is like to be together.

786
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,585
Did you know it all this time?

787
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:09,665
[ Or if I had ]

788
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,875
[ never let myself
fall in love with her... ]

789
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:08,575
[ But it was too late
when I realized my mistake. ]

790
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,635
[ I might have just wanted to ignore ]

791
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:19,005
[ how contradictory it was to me
to have someone special. ]

792
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:25,295
[ It was just a coincidence,
and that could have been it. ]

793
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,065
[ That should have been it. ]

794
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:34,095
[ She has her family, her life, ]

795
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:36,345
[ and her people. ]

796
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,015
[ Is it fair that I keep her by my side? ]

797
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:46,319
[ Just because she makes
my life more interesting ]

798
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,885
[ and less lonely? ]

799
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:55,785
[ Just because I'm afraid
I might disappoint her? ]

800
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,765
[ Until when? ]

801
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,075
[ Until something really bad
happens to her? ]

802
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:21,885
Sir, you're up early.

803
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,115
[ Today is the day ]

804
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,635
[ I should let her go. ]

805
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,675
[ Haemil Publishers ]

806
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,665
[ Why those women, not me? ]

807
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,309
[ To be honest, being next to you
is the most dangerous. ]

808
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:48,339
[ Miss Dam, I promised
I would protect you. ]

809
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:51,295
[ And I always think about
how I can keep my word. ]

810
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,969
[ I heard all men have a room
in their hearts ]

811
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:55,869
[ and they keep ]

812
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:58,205
their first loves in that room
for the rest of their lives.

813
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,150
[ What if women around you
are the target, not you? ]

814
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:02,160
[ We appreciate
Oh Hyeon-gyeong, Han Ji-eun, ]

815
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:02,690
Who would be the next then?

816
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:03,830
[ Jung So-min, and Jang Sung-gyu
for their guest appearance. ]

817
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,529
[ Sir. ]

818
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,085
There you are.
