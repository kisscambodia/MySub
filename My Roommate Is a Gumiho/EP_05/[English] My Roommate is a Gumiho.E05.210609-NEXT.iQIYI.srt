1
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,260
"There is always some madness in love."

2
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,530
That you like someone means

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,630
that you are misunderstanding
that person in your own way.

4
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,030
So what I'm trying to say is

5
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,130
you could be Fermina Daza to someone,

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,209
and that's not a misunderstanding.

7
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,160
Fermina Daza?

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,170
She's a heroine from an old book.

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,690
"To him, she seemed so beautiful,
so seductive,"

10
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,310
"so different from ordinary people,"

11
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,010
"that he could not understand"

12
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,450
"why no one was as disturbed as he"

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,500
"by the clicking of her heels
on the paving stones,"

14
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,430
"why no one else's heart was wild"

15
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,340
"with the breeze stirred
by the sighs of her veils,"

16
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,740
"why everyone did not go mad
with the movements of her braid,"

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,090
"the flight of her hands,"

18
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,780
"the gold of her laughter."

19
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,430
"He could not understand"

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,250
"why anyone wouldn't
fall in love with her."

21
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,370
Look at the time.

22
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,530
We should go.

23
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,040
Yes, right. Let's go.

24
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,860
Gosh, it's hot.

25
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,650
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was wondering if you were feverish.

26
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,340
No, I'm all right.
I don't have a fever. I'm fine.

27
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,579
[Guys, listen up.]

28
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,160
[Dam]

29
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,900
[This is my friend's story.]

30
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,620
-It's her.
-It's your story.

31
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,420
[Her heart suddenly starts to pound,]

32
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,990
[Dam]

33
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,400
[she had a tough time breathing,]

34
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,970
[then she felt airheaded as if she's
walking on clouds. What does this mean?]

35
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,900
[Dam]

36
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,710
[Jae-jin]

37
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,660
[Arrhythmia?]

38
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,320
Stop fooling around, Jae-jin.

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,180
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to make Dam fall in love.

40
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,450
I'm... I'm sorry.

41
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,070
[When did you... No, wait.]

42
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,030
[When did your friend
have those feelings?]

43
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:39,440
[Soo-kyung]

44
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,310
[Well, she was just with somebody.]

45
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,000
[In my opinion,]

46
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,180
[I think your friend
fell for that somebody.]

47
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,060
[Dam]

48
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,050
[No, that can't be it.]

49
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,080
You said it's your friend.
How do you know?

50
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,839
[Jae-jin]

51
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,839
[Because...]

52
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,310
[Jae-jin]

53
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,210
All right.

54
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,440
[Look.]

55
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,250
[I burn this place down today
to swear to die on sea.]

56
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,290
If I seek to live, I shall die.

57
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,880
But if I seek to die, I shall live.

58
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,520
Gosh, that line gets me every time.

59
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,290
[Wait, maybe my heart began to race
because I heard a nice quote from a book.]

60
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,110
[My heart always begins to flutter
when I hear great lines in movies.]

61
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,130
Is this any good?

62
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,170
Yes, sure.

63
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,710
Goodness, I'm so sleepy.

64
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,520
What's he doing?
Filming a TV ad or something?

65
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,430
[Wait, maybe I was just impressed]

66
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,460
[because of his breathtaking beauty.]

67
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,270
[I'd be fine if I didn't have a heart,]

68
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,520
[but anybody with a heart is
bound to be impressed by him.]

69
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,290
It's surely so. No, I mean,

70
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,830
I'll be back.

71
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,690
Miss Dam.

72
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,010
Yes, I'm just a huge fan of great lines
with a weak spot for hot guys.

73
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,790
There's no way I would fall for him. No.

74
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,050
What's with her?

75
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,640
[What do you think?
They have a thing for each other.]

76
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,590
Dam likes Seon-woo,
and Seon-woo likes Dam too.

77
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,580
[Episode 5]

78
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,820
What?

79
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,390
That message she sent us yesterday
is about Seon-woo.

80
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,010
Why are you so slow?

81
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,860
You're the one who's slow.

82
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,409
I say that was 100 percent not him.

83
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,659
I say it was 100 percent him.

84
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,909
To be frank, I was a bit worried
because of his reputation.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,070
But he has my support now.

86
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,360
Now that I get to know him,
he doesn't seem all too bad.

87
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,730
Above all, Dam likes him so much.

88
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,150
She never said anything
about liking him so much.

89
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,130
The way she acted shows
she's totally into him.

90
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,020
Don't you know what she's like?

91
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,530
Do you want to eat together?

92
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,640
No, I like to eat alone.

93
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,460
That way, I can eat
all the side dishes by myself.

94
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,190
Hey, if you don't have an umbrella,
do you want to share mine with me?

95
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,490
No, I bet my umbrella is way bigger.

96
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,830
[My gosh, but seriously.]

97
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,690
Her coldness probably brought
the temperature down by three degrees,

98
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,180
but we live to see this day.

99
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,310
I'm all for this relationship. Completely.

100
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,650
-You're all for what?
-It's you and Seon-woo...

101
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,659
He's all for some tteokbokki.

102
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,080
-Are you coming?
-Sure.

103
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:30,260
Let's go.

104
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,000
-Come.
-My gosh.

105
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,030
-Great work.
-See you at the next meeting.

106
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,230
Excuse me, Mr. Shin.

107
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,340
Well, you know.

108
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,210
We'll have to go out for field study soon,

109
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,140
so why don't we discuss the schedule

110
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,370
over dinner with me sometime?

111
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,560
Next time.

112
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,550
Yes, I'd like to schedule

113
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,970
when exactly that next time will be.

114
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,940
I thought dancing around was
my way of showing courtesy,

115
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,270
but I should probably make myself clear.

116
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,820
-I'm not looking to eat dinner with you.
-Sorry?

117
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:17,650
I don't feel comfortable
dining with somebody else.

118
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,140
That was hurtful.

119
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,460
Hello.

120
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,930
Goodness, I'm so sleepy.

121
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,810
It's surely so. No, I mean,

122
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,310
I'll be back.

123
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,330
Miss Dam.

124
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,070
Dam, why aren't you eating?
That's not like you.

125
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,690
You didn't even make a choice on adding

126
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,010
ramyeon or udon noodles.

127
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,770
Why? Are you still worried
about that friend from last night?

128
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,050
-What?
-So?

129
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,030
Does your friend admit she likes him?

130
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,370
She likes him? No way. Never.

131
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,350
[Sir]

132
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,970
[I'll be passing by your school later.
Should I head over there?]

133
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,210
-Yes, Miss Dam.
-Sir, I just read your text message.

134
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,500
Did you pass by my school?

135
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,310
Yes, I did.

136
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,150
What a shame.

137
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,780
[What is?]

138
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,770
My bus fare. I could've saved on that.

139
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,840
Then will you wait there?

140
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,880
I didn't get too far,
so I can be there soon.

141
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,780
See you at school.

142
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,670
I'm so full.

143
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,850
-Hey, I'm leaving.
-Wait for us. We're all done.

144
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,570
No, I have to meet someone.
See you tomorrow.

145
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,170
Who is she in such a hurry to meet?

146
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,390
Wait, do you think
she's going out with Seon-woo?

147
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,590
Goodness, stop that with Seon-woo.

148
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,450
Maybe you're the one
who has a thing for him.

149
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,140
Wait, I think I'm spot on.

150
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,470
If you're done, let's go.
I'm going to my TOEIC class.

151
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,950
Really? Do you want a ride? I drove today.

152
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,070
You brought your brother's car again?
You haven't scrapped it yet?

153
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,530
Why would I? It's still running fine.

154
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,890
And it's not my brother's car anymore.
It's mine.

155
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,610
He gave it to me.

156
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,920
No, he didn't give it to you.
He threw it away to you.

157
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,590
Anyway, I'm fine.

158
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,580
Are you sure you aren't just jealous

159
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,780
that I'm a car owner now?

160
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,340
I'd love to give you a good kick.

161
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,360
Goodness, she's totally jealous. Goodness.

162
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,260
Take me to Silla Hotel.

163
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,160
Did I tell you that
I live in the suite room there?

164
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,140
You don't need to. Get off.

165
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,690
Why? Aren't you here for me?

166
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,630
You know I'm not.

167
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,840
I can't believe Shin Woo-yeo the great
came to pick her up.

168
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,910
Dam seems even more amazing now.

169
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,340
But how disappointing.

170
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,760
I gave you that advice
from the bottom of my heart.

171
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,460
We never had a happy ending
whenever we started having feelings.

172
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,840
I told you not to let those petty feelings
ruin your life's work.

173
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,210
Did you decide to ignore that?

174
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,230
There's no need for me to ignore anything.

175
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,530
I never had
any feelings for her to begin with.

176
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,360
Are you sure she's not different

177
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,910
isn't any different
from all the other boring people you met?

178
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,590
Of course.

179
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,830
That's why I'm not going to get conscious.

180
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,600
If I distance myself from her
for no reason,

181
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,630
it'll seem more peculiar.

182
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,530
You seem more suspicious
with those long excuses.

183
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,640
Stop talking nonsense and get off.

184
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,520
Why? Let's just tell her
that we're acquainted.

185
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,500
Let's say we met somewhere else,

186
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,210
you know, while clubbing or something.

187
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,630
-Stop joking with me.
-I'm not joking.

188
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,610
Drop me off at the hotel.

189
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,740
It's much bigger than I thought.

190
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,820
I've never been in a car like this before.

191
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,330
You'll give me a ride, right?

192
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,980
It's not a big deal for you to drop me off
in our relationship.

193
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,130
In our relationship?

194
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,310
Well, I guess we're partners,

195
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,650
so yes, I can give you a ride home.

196
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,230
Hop in, Hye-sun.

197
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,810
No, I...

198
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,490
Woo-yeo, you punk.
How dare you use your magic on me?

199
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,040
So why did you
suddenly offer to pick me up?

200
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,250
Well, I was passing by,

201
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,570
and

202
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,720
it seemed like
you've been avoiding me since yesterday.

203
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,110
I thought we talked it out
and decided to go back

204
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,350
to how things were before.

205
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,540
Actually,

206
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,450
I was in slight confusion
over something personal.

207
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,310
A confusion?

208
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,210
It's not a big deal.

209
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,680
That's already taken care of,
so you don't have to mind it.

210
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,580
I really love Han River.

211
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,480
Why do you love it?

212
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,450
If you eat something by the river,
everything becomes twice as delicious.

213
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,920
Especially so with ramyeon you make
at a convenience store.

214
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,630
My gosh, really.

215
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,410
While we're on the subject,
do you want to stop by the river?

216
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,010
-You haven't eaten yet, right?
-I was at a tteokbokki place...

217
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,380
but I didn't eat anything.

218
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,010
Let's go to the river.

219
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,950
This isn't my car. It's my brother's.

220
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,110
I didn't ask.

221
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,310
Anyway, you.
Do I make you feel that uncomfortable?

222
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,560
-What?
-You can't talk to me or look at me.

223
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,960
What's up with that?

224
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,650
You seem to get along with Dam all right.

225
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,900
Dam and I are besties, that's why.

226
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,360
Really?

227
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,520
What's she like?

228
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,690
She's a great kid. You know
how people say, "Like attracts like"?

229
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,240
-I don't.
-What?

230
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,400
She's close to me for a reason.
I feel comfortable and pleasant with her.

231
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,630
That means you feel uncomfortable
and unpleasant around me.

232
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,530
What? No, that's not what I meant.

233
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,650
I don't want you to misunderstand this,
so I'll be frank with you.

234
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,220
This is a very heartbreaking story
only Dam and I know.

235
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:46,859
I actually have a goddess trauma.

236
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,650
-A goddess trauma?
-Yes.

237
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,040
In high school, I dated this older girl
who looked like a goddess,

238
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,710
but she turned out to be a bully.

239
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,010
She asked for 50,000 won
to save up for our dates,

240
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:01,730
but we never went out once.

241
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,119
I realized she had been ripping me off
after three months.

242
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,540
After I realized that,
I tried to break up with her,

243
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,520
but she tried to burn me with cigarettes.

244
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,920
So I always remind you of cigarette burns?

245
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,900
Yes.

246
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,800
No, that's not what I meant.

247
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,680
It means you're like a goddess.

248
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,270
It's a compliment.

249
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,180
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

250
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,250
Anyway, I'll do my best
to be more comfortable.

251
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,150
I became partners with a goddess like you,

252
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,450
so I just need to overcome my trauma
and march forward...

253
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,960
I don't think we can march forward now.

254
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,210
You're right. What's wrong with this car?

255
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,330
It's good.

256
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,970
[Jae-jin]

257
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,670
[Dam, you must be spending
some quality time with someone special,]

258
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,870
[Jae-jin]

259
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,210
[so I'm sorry for messaging you.]

260
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,510
[But I wanted to tell you
my last goodbye.]

261
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,320
[Dam]

262
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,080
[What are you suddenly talking about?]

263
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,670
[I was dropping Hye-sun off,
then the car went bust.]

264
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,520
[So my car is getting towed.]

265
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,600
[Hye-sun's face is
as pale as a Goryeo celadon,]

266
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,020
[and I probably need
to take some time off from school.]

267
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,830
Goodness, what a foolish kid.

268
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,030
It's Jae-jin.

269
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,010
He feels sorry for Hye-sun
about something he did,

270
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,430
so he wants to take a leave
instead of facing her.

271
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,150
He could just stay calm and deal with it.

272
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,790
He gets very nervous around pretty girls.

273
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,360
Right, you've seen Hye-sun
at the movie theater, right?

274
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,390
The guys in my department are
all crazy about how pretty she is.

275
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,030
Does she look pretty to you too?

276
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,620
Not at all. You're much prettier.

277
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,920
I am?

278
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,880
I'd say I'm a cute type,
but not pretty like her.

279
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,210
-You must be kidding.
-I mean it.

280
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,990
I'm more serious than ever right now.

281
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,250
Well, really?

282
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,810
I don't think so.

283
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,760
[Jae-jin]

284
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,250
[Why won't you respond?]

285
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,400
Sir.

286
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,300
Why don't you use a texting app?

287
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,520
I never felt the need to use it.

288
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,540
I think you should.

289
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,620
I caught your text message much later

290
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,050
because most people use the texting app,
so I never check my texts.

291
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,970
But I guess I can
just remember to check text messages.

292
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,330
-That sounds all right.
-Sorry?

293
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,720
It sounds like a good idea to learn to use
technology in line with this age.

294
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,660
How do you use this texting app?

295
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,360
It's... Let me show you.

296
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,310
All done. Take this.

297
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,560
-Right, your profile photo.
-Profile photo?

298
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,860
A picture for your profile.

299
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,140
I don't have any photos.

300
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,730
You don't have any photos?

301
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:08,870
[Choose from Album]

302
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,240
[No photos or videos.]

303
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,270
Sir, how can you not have any photos?

304
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,750
I never felt the need to take any.

305
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,340
Then when was the last time
you took a photo?

306
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,740
Back during Jungjong's reign in Joseon,
I once left behind a portrait.

307
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,720
A portrait?

308
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,850
This isn't good.

309
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,780
Sir, let me take some photos for you.

310
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,900
I'll take the best photos of your life,

311
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,260
so stand over there.

312
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,520
Come on.

313
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,940
Can you smile a little?

314
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,640
No, like this.

315
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,340
A little more.

316
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,410
[Are you sure she's not any different
from all of the other dull relationships?]

317
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,570
[Yes.]

318
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,770
[This doesn't mean anything.]

319
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,420
[Just as it always had been,]

320
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,170
[this is another careless relationship
who'll stay with me for a short while.]

321
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,140
You should check.

322
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,510
I'll take one for you too, Miss Dam.

323
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,660
[This isn't special.]

324
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,880
Do I look okay? Let me see.

325
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,110
I look much better than I do in person.

326
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,550
Shall we go home?

327
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,260
The sunset.

328
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,860
It's because of the sunset.

329
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,840
Who was she with?

330
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,650
What type of man does Dam like?

331
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,350
Well, she seems to like
good-looking guys too,

332
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,240
but personality seems to matter the most.

333
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,310
In short,

334
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,040
a nice type.

335
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,420
Seon-woo!

336
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,170
Seon-woo, could you give me
just 50,000 won?

337
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:35,800
I'll be a good sister
who does everything you say. Chu!

338
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,910
Do you think I'll give it to you?

339
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,860
-No.
-Then get lost.

340
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,630
You little...
You just said you'll be a good sister.

341
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,960
Only if you give me 50,000 won.

342
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,130
Hey.

343
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,950
Let me ask you something.

344
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,360
What?

345
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,060
What does a nice guy exactly mean?

346
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,060
A guy with a good personality, obviously.

347
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,270
What do I have to do
for people to say that to me?

348
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,830
In your case,

349
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,500
-you'll have to be born again.
-Why you...

350
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,440
-I'm serious.
-Does it look like I'm joking?

351
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,470
To be frank, you look like a player.

352
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,450
What?

353
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,260
-I look like a player?
-Yes.

354
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,080
Isn't life as a player your core identity?

355
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,030
Wait, player, core, awesome rhyming.

356
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,460
♫ Life as a player is your core identity ♫

357
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,520
You can't pull that on me again.

358
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,470
You won't even give me 50,000 won.
Don't call yourself my brother.

359
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,890
That little punk.

360
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,090
Yes, he needs to use it more often
to get used to it.

361
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,730
[Sir, have you eaten?]

362
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:16,250
[Miss Dam]

363
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,810
[Don't skip your meal for some coffee,
and eat delicious lunch!]

364
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,850
[Miss Dam,
I hope you enjoy your lunch too.]

365
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:23,780
[Miss Dam]

366
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,140
[Why do you add these shapes
at the end of your sentence?]

367
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:30,240
[Sir]

368
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,200
Gosh, I feel like I'm texting an ancestor.

369
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,800
Watch where you're going.

370
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,840
Right, yes. Thank you.

371
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,060
I'm sorry. I had nowhere else to grab.

372
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,000
You don't like it when others touch you.

373
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,000
We have to go on two more dates.

374
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,590
-When can you do it?
-Whenever is fine.

375
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,890
-Do you want to go anywhere?
-Anywhere is fine.

376
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,640
Oh, hey.

377
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,750
Yes, hello.

378
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,650
-Hi.
-Hey.

379
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,730
So you're taking a leave?
Did you file your request?

380
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,580
-I won't see you starting tomorrow.
-Right.

381
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,070
I got paid for the scrap metal
after scrapping the car.

382
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,850
I told Hye-sun I'll buy her a meal
with that money, so we're cool now.

383
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,630
Oh, right. That's not the problem.

384
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,090
Then what? What's the problem?

385
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,270
I saw this on my way here.

386
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,440
Seon-woo was totally coming onto Dam,

387
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,870
but Dam kept pushing him away
like a bouncy ball.

388
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,290
What if Seon-woo gives up on her?

389
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,800
-Told you it's not Seon-woo.
-Yes, it's him!

390
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,110
Let's ask them to grab a drink,
then we can help them get together.

391
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,890
"If you drink this,
it means you two will start dating."

392
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,570
Let's say stuff like that
and help them get together.

393
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,300
Let's not do any stuff
and stay still, okay?

394
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,550
Why should we stay still?
Let's call Seon-woo first.

395
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,960
Hey, stop that!

396
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,220
There's this other guy she likes.
I've seen him.

397
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,430
You've seen what?

398
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,600
He didn't seem like just an acquaintance.
Her face was...

399
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,680
I think it was the guy
she talked to me about.

400
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,960
She talked to you?

401
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,950
Yes, last week, she was worried

402
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,670
things seemed distant with this person.

403
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,480
Really?

404
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,770
I haven't heard anything.
Why didn't she tell me?

405
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm sure there was a reason.

406
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,580
Anyway, we should wait until she tells us.

407
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,450
Don't act like you know something.
Okay? Will you?

408
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,120
Yes, I'll do that.

409
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,670
-Hey, Jae-jin. Want some?
-No.

410
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,880
-What's with this cold response?
-What about it?

411
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,830
What do you mean?
You obviously look annoyed.

412
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,640
Stop piling it up and tell me.

413
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,220
Aren't you the one
who should be telling me something?

414
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,460
What?

415
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,570
I'm a little disappointed.

416
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,940
There is nothing I haven't told you.

417
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,530
You know everything

418
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,300
about my ex-girlfriend,
the ex before that, the one before...

419
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,080
Forget it.

420
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,040
I told you everything I was too ashamed
to share with my brother.

421
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,990
But I guess you didn't feel that way.

422
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,380
Bye.

423
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,180
Hey, Jae-jin.

424
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,000
What was that?

425
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,540
-What's with him?
-What?

426
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,660
He said I didn't tell him something.
What could it be?

427
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,640
I'm... I'm not sure.

428
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,100
Is it how I diluted his soju

429
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,430
when he got trashed
after Jin-ah dumped him?

430
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,780
Or how I pulled out his hair last year

431
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,540
after I got trashed?

432
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,620
My gosh.

433
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,170
[Hey, I told you not to get so antsy.]

434
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:01,540
[Soo-kyung:
Hey, I told you not to get so antsy.]

435
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,870
[Whatever, I'm disappointed.
What can I do?]

436
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,320
Hi.

437
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,940
What was that?

438
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,620
[Lecture Hall]

439
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,300
Hey, Jae-jin.
What should we eat for lunch...

440
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,110
Hey, Jae-jin!

441
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,040
Can we talk...

442
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,700
[Hey! Are you seriously doing this?]

443
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,020
[What?]

444
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,310
[Jae-jin]

445
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,260
"What"?

446
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,100
Darn it.

447
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,860
[Dam]

448
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,580
-Hello?
[-Hello, my foot.]

449
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,940
What's your problem?

450
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,790
-What is it?
-You'll pop my eardrum!

451
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,840
Just leave me alone.

452
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,690
Give me some time to be sulky.

453
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,970
Are you getting drafted?
Why do you need some time?

454
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,630
What are you disappointed about?
Tell me. Tell me now.

455
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,790
You!

456
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,510
Gosh, darn it!

457
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,120
You jerk! You idiot!

458
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,900
Are you all right, Miss Dam?

459
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,940
I'm sorry, sir. That must've been loud.

460
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,190
Is something bad going on?

461
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,570
Well, Jae-jin is angry at me,
but I don't know why.

462
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,380
I wanted to talk, but he avoids me.

463
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,180
He ignores my texts and hung up on me too.

464
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,970
You two looked very close.

465
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,680
That must be disconcerting.

466
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:13,540
Yes. As you know,
I have a younger brother.

467
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,750
But ever since I met him,
I felt like I had two younger brothers.

468
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,540
We were so close like real siblings.
Why is he doing this to me?

469
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,030
Sir, will you take a walk with me?

470
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,960
Sure.

471
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,820
Sorry?

472
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,450
Why don't we

473
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,490
go for some jokbal you love so much?

474
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,000
No, I don't feel like it.

475
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,949
Then how about
the archery game we played...

476
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,270
I'm good.

477
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,400
Do you want to grab a drink?

478
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,949
A drink?

479
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:06,300
Humans seem to drink alcohol
to forget their problems.

480
00:34:06,469 --> 00:34:09,770
I figured you might need that now.

481
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,460
It's okay. I'm not supposed to drink.

482
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,790
If I drink, that would be
violating the contract.

483
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,650
You haven't been drinking until now,

484
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,460
and I'm with you today,
so I think it'll be okay.

485
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,659
But still...

486
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,159
Let's go.

487
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,540
Miss Dam, "the Analects" says

488
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,750
one must stop drinking
while one feels good.

489
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,520
I think we should set limits
before we start drinking.

490
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,890
How much alcohol can you take?

491
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,340
Seven bottles of soju.

492
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,550
Seven...

493
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,260
Why don't we order just one bottle?

494
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,980
Two.

495
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,260
Are you making a deal with me now?

496
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,200
Well, if we're going to drink anyway,

497
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,060
we should drink until we feel good,
just like "The Analects" says.

498
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,600
Just a half bottle of soju

499
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,760
will hardly touch my organs.

500
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,960
But you haven't been
drinking for a while, so...

501
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,230
Come on.

502
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,560
I know my liver.

503
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,860
One bottle of soju can't make it drunk.

504
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,080
Ma'am, I'd like to order two bottles
of soju and stir-fried cartilage.

505
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,220
Okay.

506
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,650
Cheers.

507
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,330
It's good to finally have some drink.

508
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,840
I thought I wouldn't be able
to drink any for one year.

509
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,510
Miss Dam.

510
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,990
You're not going to pretend to be down
whenever you want to drink, are you?

511
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,920
That's a very good tip.

512
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,950
Alcohol is the best.

513
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,850
Sir, do you think
I can make up with Jae-jin?

514
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,170
Cheers.

515
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,130
Actually, whatever.

516
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,930
What does he want me to tell him?

517
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,950
I said I could drink
seven bottles of soju.

518
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,750
Thank you.

519
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,790
Excuse me. I'd like to order
some steamed eggs.

520
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,100
Gosh, it's hot,

521
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,460
but it's tasty.

522
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,630

01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:02,700
Sir, may I go on a blind date?

876
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:03,980
[That should be fine.]

877
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:07,150
[My friends set up the blind date today
in case I change my mind.]

878
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,860
-I see.
-Give me a smile.

879
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,490
Again.

880
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,620
Sir, I'm in big trouble now.

881
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,890
Miss Dam?

882
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,260
Who are you?

883
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,370
[I'm Dam's mother.]

884
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:22,810
[I don't want you to give up
on what you like.]

885
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,620
Is anybody there?

886
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:28,530
[Is it really okay that I don't give up?]
