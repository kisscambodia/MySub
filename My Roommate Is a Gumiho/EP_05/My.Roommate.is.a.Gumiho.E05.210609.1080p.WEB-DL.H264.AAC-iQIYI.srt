00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,639
We never had a happy ending
whenever we started having feelings.

177
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,029
I told you not to let those petty feelings
ruin your life's work.

178
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,399
Did you decide to ignore that?

179
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,419
There's no need for me to ignore anything.

180
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,725
I never had
any feelings for her to begin with.

181
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,549
Are you sure she's not different

182
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,105
isn't any different
from all the other boring people you met?

183
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,785
Of course.

184
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,025
That's why I'm not going to get conscious.

185
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,795
If I distance myself from her
for no reason,

186
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,825
it'll seem more peculiar.

187
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,725
You seem more suspicious
with those long excuses.

188
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,835
Stop talking nonsense and get off.

189
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,715
Why? Let's just tell her
that we're acquainted.

190
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,679
Let's say we met somewhere else,

191
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,399
you know, while clubbing or something.

192
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,825
- Stop joking with me.
- I'm not joking.

193
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,805
Drop me off at the hotel.

194
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,935
It's much bigger than I thought.

195
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,015
I've never been in a car like this before.

196
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,525
You'll give me a ride, right?

197
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,175
It's not a big deal for you to drop me off
in our relationship.

198
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,325
In our relationship?

199
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,499
Well, I guess we're partners,

200
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,845
so yes, I can give you a ride home.

201
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,419
Hop in, Hye-sun.

202
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,005
No, I...

203
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,685
Woo-yeo, you punk.
How dare you use your magic on me?

204
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,235
So why did you
suddenly offer to pick me up?

205
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,445
Well, I was passing by,

206
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,765
and

207
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,915
it seemed like
you've been avoiding me since yesterday.

208
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,305
I thought we talked it out
and decided to go back

209
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,539
to how things were before.

210
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,735
Actually,

211
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,645
I was in slight confusion
over something personal.

212
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,505
A confusion?

213
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,389
It's not a big deal.

214
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,875
That's already taken care of,
so you don't have to mind it.

215
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,775
I really love Han River.

216
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,675
Why do you love it?

217
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,639
If you eat something by the river,
everything becomes twice as delicious.

218
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,109
Especially so with ramyeon you make
at a convenience store.

219
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,825
My gosh, really.

220
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,605
While we're on the subject,
do you want to stop by the river?

221
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,205
- You haven't eaten yet, right?
- I was at a tteokbokki place...

222
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,575
but I didn't eat anything.

223
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,205
Let's go to the river.

224
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,145
This isn't my car. It's my brother's.

225
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,305
I didn't ask.

226
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,499
Anyway, you.
Do I make you feel that uncomfortable?

227
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,739
- What?
- You can't talk to me or look at me.

228
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,155
What's up with that?

229
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,845
You seem to get along with Dam all right.

230
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,095
Dam and I are besties, that's why.

231
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,555
Really?

232
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,709
What's she like?

233
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,885
She's a great kid. You know
how people say, "Like attracts like"?

234
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,435
- I don't.
- What?

235
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,595
She's close to me for a reason.
I feel comfortable and pleasant with her.

236
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,825
That means you feel uncomfortable
and unpleasant around me.

237
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,725
What? No, that's not what I meant.

238
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,845
I don't want you to misunderstand this,
so I'll be frank with you.

239
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,415
This is a very heartbreaking story
only Dam and I know.

240
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,054
I actually have a goddess trauma.

241
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,845
- A goddess trauma?
- Yes.

242
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,229
In high school, I dated this older girl
who looked like a goddess,

243
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,905
but she turned out to be a bully.

244
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,198
She asked for 50,000 won
to save up for our dates,

245
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,925
but we never went out once.

246
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,299
I realized she had been ripping me off
after three months.

247
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,735
After I realized that,
I tried to break up with her,

248
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,715
but she tried to burn me with cigarettes.

249
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,115
So I always remind you of cigarette burns?

250
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,095
Yes.

251
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,995
No, that's not what I meant.

252
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,875
It means you're like a goddess.

253
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,465
It's a compliment.

254
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,375
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

255
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,445
Anyway, I'll do my best
to be more comfortable.

256
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,339
I became partners with a goddess like you,

257
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,645
so I just need to overcome my trauma
and march forward...

258
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,155
I don't think we can march forward now.

259
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,405
You're right. What's wrong with this car?

260
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,525
It's good.

261

[ Jae-jin ]

262
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,770
[ Dam, you must be spending
some quality time with someone special, ]

263
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,970
[ Jae-jin ]

264
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,405
[ so I'm sorry for messaging you. ]

265
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,705
[ But I wanted to tell you
my last goodbye. ]

266
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,420
[ Dam ]

267
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,275
[ What are you suddenly talking about? ]

268
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,859
[ I was dropping Hye-sun off,
then the car went bust. ]

269
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,715
[ So my car is getting towed. ]

270
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,789
[ Hye-sun's face is
as pale as a Goryeo celadon, ]

271
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,215
[ and I probably need
to take some time off from school. ]

272
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,025
Goodness, what a foolish kid.

273
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,209
It's Jae-jin.

274
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,189
He feels sorry for Hye-sun
about something he did,

275
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,625
so he wants to take a leave
instead of facing her.

276
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,345
He could just stay calm and deal with it.

277
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,985
He gets very nervous around pretty girls.

278
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,549
Right, you've seen Hye-sun
at the movie theater, right?

279
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,585
The guys in my department are
all crazy about how pretty she is.

280
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,209
Does she look pretty to you too?

281
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,815
Not at all. You're much prettier.

282
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,115
I am?

283
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,075
I'd say I'm a cute type,
but not pretty like her.

284
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,405
- You must be kidding.
- I mean it.

285
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,185
I'm more serious than ever right now.

286
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,445
Well, really?

287
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,005
I don't think so.

288
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,860
[ Jae-jin ]

289
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,445
[ Why won't you respond? ]

290
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,595
Sir.

291
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,495
Why don't you use a texting app?

292
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,715
I never felt the need to use it.

293
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,735
I think you should.

294
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,809
I caught your text message much later

295
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,245
because most people use the texting app,
so I never check my texts.

296
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,165
But I guess I can
just remember to check text messages.

297
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,525
- That sounds all right.
- Sorry?

298
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,915
It sounds like a good idea to learn to use
technology in line with this age.

299
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,855
How do you use this texting app?

300
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,555
It's... Let me show you.

301
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,499
All done. Take this.

302
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,755
- Right, your profile photo.
- Profile photo?

303
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,055
A picture for your profile.

304
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,335
I don't have any photos.

305
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,925

Sir, how can you not have any photos?

I never felt the need to take any.

310
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,535
Then when was the last time
you took a photo?

311
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,935
Back during Jungjong's reign in Joseon,
I once left behind a portrait.

312
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,915
A portrait?

313
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,039
This isn't good.

No, like this.

Well, she seems to like
good-looking guys too,

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,655
What?

350
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,355
What does a nice guy exactly mean?

351
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,355
A guy with a good personality, obviously.

352
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,565
What do I have to do
for people to say that to me?

353
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,125
In your case,

354
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,795
- you'll have to be born again.
- Why you...

355
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,735
- I'm serious.
- Does it look like I'm joking?

356
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,765
To be frank, you look like a player.

357
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,745
What?

358
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,555
- I look like a player?
- Yes.

359
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,369
Isn't life as a player your core identity?

360
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,325
Wait, player, core, awesome rhyming.

361
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,755
♫ Life as a player is your core identity ♫

362
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,815
You can't pull that on me again.

363
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,765
You won't even give me 50,000 won.
Don't call yourself my brother.

364
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,185
That little punk.

365
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,385
Yes, he needs to use it more often
to get used to it.

366
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,930
[ Sir, have you eaten? ]

367
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:46,450
[ Miss Dam ]

368
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,105
[ Don't skip your meal for some coffee,
and eat delicious lunch! ]

369
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,050
[ Miss Dam,
I hope you enjoy your lunch too. ]

370
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:53,980
[ Miss Dam ]

371
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,340
[ Why do you add these shapes
at the end of your sentence? ]

372
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:00,440
[ Sir ]

373
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,495
Gosh, I feel like I'm texting an ancestor.

374
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,095
Watch where you're going.

375
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,135
Right, yes. Thank you.

376
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,355
I'm sorry. I had nowhere else to grab.

377
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,295
You don't like it when others touch you.

378
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,289
We have to go on two more dates.

379
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,885
- When can you do it?
- Whenever is fine.

380
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,185
- Do you want to go anywhere?
- Anywhere is fine.

381
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,935
Oh, hey.

382
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,045
Yes, hello.

383
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,945
- Hi.
- Hey.

384
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,019
So you're taking a leave?
Did you file your request?

385
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,875
- I won't see you starting tomorrow.
- Right.

386
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,349
I got paid for the scrap metal
after scrapping the car.

387
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,145
I told Hye-sun I'll buy her a meal
with that money, so we're cool now.

388
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,919
Oh, right. That's not the problem.

389
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,369
Then what? What's the problem?

390
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,559
I saw this on my way here.

391
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,729
Seon-woo was totally coming onto Dam,

392
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,159
but Dam kept pushing him away
like a bouncy ball.

393
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,579
What if Seon-woo gives up on her?

394
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,095
- Told you it's not Seon-woo.
- Yes, it's him!

395
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,399
Let's ask them to grab a drink,
then we can help them get together.

396
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,169
"If you drink this,
it means you two will start dating."

397
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,865
Let's say stuff like that
and help them get together.

398
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,589
Let's not do any stuff
and stay still, okay?

399
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,839
Why should we stay still?
Let's call Seon-woo first.

400
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,249
Hey, stop that!

401
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,515
There's this other guy she likes.
I've seen him.

402
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,725
You've seen what?

403
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,895
He didn't seem like just an acquaintance.
Her face was...

404
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,969
I think it was the guy
she talked to me about.

405
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,255
She talked to you?

406
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,239
Yes, last week, she was worried

407
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,965
things seemed distant with this person.

408
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,775
Really?

409
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,065
I haven't heard anything.
Why didn't she tell me?

410
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,959
I'm sure there was a reason.

411
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,869
Anyway, we should wait until she tells us.

412
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,745
Don't act like you know something.
Okay? Will you?

413
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,415
Yes, I'll do that.

414
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,965
- Hey, Jae-jin. Want some?
- No.

415
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,169
- What's with this cold response?
- What about it?

416
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,119
What do you mean?
You obviously look annoyed.

417
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,935
Stop piling it up and tell me.

418
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,509
Aren't you the one
who should be telling me something?

419
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,755
What?

420
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,859
I'm a little disappointed.

421
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,229
There is nothing I haven't told you.

422
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,819
You know everything

423
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,595
about my ex-girlfriend,
the ex before that, the one before...

424
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,375
Forget it.

425
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,335
I told you everything I was too ashamed
to share with my brother.

426
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,285
But I guess you didn't feel that way.

427
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,675
Bye.

428
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,475
Hey, Jae-jin.

429
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,295
What was that?

430
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,829
- What's with him?
- What?

431
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,955
He said I didn't tell him something.
What could it be?

432
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,935
I'm... I'm not sure.

433
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,389
Is it how I diluted his soju

434
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,725
when he got trashed
after Jin-ah dumped him?

435
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,059
Or how I pulled out his hair last year

436
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,835
after I got trashed?

437
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,915
My gosh.

438
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,465
[ Hey, I told you not to get so antsy. ]

439
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,740

What can I do? ]

- What is it?
- You'll pop my eardrum!

I'm sorry, sir. That must've been loud.

00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,419
Is something bad going on?

466
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,809
Well, Jae-jin is angry at me,
but I don't know why.

467
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,619
I wanted to talk, but he avoids me.

468
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,425
He ignores my texts and hung up on me too.

469
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,215
You two looked very close.

470
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,919
That must be disconcerting.

471
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,779
Yes. As you know,
I have a younger brother.

472
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,995
But ever since I met him,
I felt like I had two younger brothers.

473
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,785
We were so close like real siblings.
Why is he doing this to me?

474
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,275
Sir, will you take a walk with me?

475
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,205
Sure.

00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,065
Sorry?

00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,695
Why don't we

00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,735
go for some jokbal you love so much?

479
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,195
No, I don't feel like it.

480
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,139

Do you want to grab a drink?

483

A drink?

484
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:36,495
Humans seem to drink alcohol
to forget their problems.

485
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:39,959
I figured you might need that now.

486
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,655
It's okay. I'm not supposed to drink.

487
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,985
If I drink, that would be
violating the contract.

488
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,838
You haven't been drinking until now,

489
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,655
and I'm with you today,
so I think it'll be okay.

490
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,854
But still...

491
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,354
Let's go.

00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,735
Miss Dam, "the Analects" says

493
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,945
one must stop drinking
while one feels good.

494
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,709
I think we should set limits
before we start drinking.

495
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,079
How much alcohol can you take?

496
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,535
Seven bottles of soju.

497
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,745
Seven...

498
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,455
Why don't we order just one bottle?

499
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,175
Two.

500
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,449
Are you making a deal with me now?

501
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,389
Well, if we're going to drink anyway,

502
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,255
we should drink until we feel good,
just like "The Analects" says.

503
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,789
Just a half bottle of soju

504
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,939
will hardly touch my organs.

505
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,139
But you haven't been
drinking for a while, so...

506
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,425
Come on.

507
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,749
I know my liver.

508
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,055
One bottle of soju can't make it drunk.

509
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,259
Ma'am, I'd like to order two bottles
of soju and stir-fried cartilage.

00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,415

516
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,185
You're not going to pretend to be down

873
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,505
beef tripe and soju.

874
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,735
[ Dishonesty cannot beat honesty. ]

875
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,205
[ Never. ]

876
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,955
Me too.

877
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,825
Miss Dam, you are

878
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,605
special to me too.

879
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:58,005
[ We appreciate Actress Han Ji-eun
for her guest appearance. ]

880
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,215
[ My Roommate is a Gumiho ]

881
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:32,889
Sir, may I go on a blind date?

882
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:34,169
[ That should be fine. ]

883
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:37,339
[ My friends set up the blind date today
in case I change my mind. ]

884
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,055
- I see.
- Give me a smile.

885
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,685
Again.

886
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,799
Sir, I'm in big trouble now.

887
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,085
Miss Dam?

888
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,439
Who are you?

889
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,565
[ I'm Dam's mother. ]

890
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:53,005
[ I don't want you to give up
on what you like. ]

891
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,799
Is anybody there?

892
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,725
[ Is it really okay that I don't give up? ]
