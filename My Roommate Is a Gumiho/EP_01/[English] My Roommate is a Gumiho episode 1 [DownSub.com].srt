[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,590
It's quite rowdy today, isn't it, my lord?

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,880
The new scholars of Seonggyungwan are

9
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,430
having a welcoming party tonight.

10
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,210
You're so funny, my lord.

11
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:32,700
They're so mischievous.

12
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:37,590
Right, I heard
you also studied at Seonggyungwan.

13
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,120
Anyway, I'm afraid
one of the drunk scholars

14
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,240
might get bewitched by a gumiho.

15
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,320
Haven't you heard?

16
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,530
I hear a wicked monster
who devours on people's liver

17
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,690
has recently been seen in the city.

18
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,650
She bewitches people in an instant
with her dazzling beauty,

19
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,340
but she's actually a fox
who has been around for centuries.

20
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,610
If that rumor is true,

21
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,720
I should stop coming
to this gisaeng house.

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,270
What? What do you mean?

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,600
If you stop coming here,

24
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,590
what do we have to live for?

25
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,410
But I thought
the most beautiful women of Joseon

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,829
are here with me right now.

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,079
I'm a coward,

28
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,220
so I'm afraid one of you
might try to eat my liver.

29
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,540
My lord, goodness. Stop teasing us.

30
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:59,470
You were born as a lowly beast,
but you dreamed of becoming a human.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,160
What a foolish and poor thing you are.

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,270
I take pity on you
and will make your wish come true.

33
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,000
My lord, should I blow out the candles?

34
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,950
Do as you like,

35
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,450
since everything is
nothing but your dream.

36
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,140
Pardon? What do you mean?

37
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,100
You won't remember a thing
once you wake up.

38
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,540
[Once you live a hundred years
with good virtue, you'll grow a tail.]

[If you cultivate yourself
and live 200 years, two tails.]

40

and live 300 years, three tails.]

46
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,930

[Episode 1]

60
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,900
Mr. Shin.

61
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,450
-Hello.
-Hello.

62
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,580
Our theme for this project is

63
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,350
the history behind history.

64
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,740
I'd like it to be centered around
the behind stories of our history.

65
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,300
Of course, there will be difficulty
in providing historical evidence,

66
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,820
but I think it might be all right
if we do thorough research.

67
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,780
For example, during the Joseon era,

68
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,610
commoners couldn't accuse the noblemen
no matter how unfair anything was.

69
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,370
I heard they could only use sinmungo

70
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,040
or run over to the King

71
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,460
whenever he was in their town
in a procession.

72
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,050
That wasn't the case.

73
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,790
Everyone could file a lawsuit
regardless of their social class.

74
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,380
They could also appeal their cases,
and there was a system

75
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,410
to avoid corruption of the lawsuit.

76
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,740
While I was a local governor
over Pyeongan Province,

77
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,820
I once took a case of this farmer...

78
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,620
Wow.

79
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,410
Some might hear that and think
you actually did it yourself.

80
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,130
I knew it. You write everything
as if you went through it yourself.

81
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,550
That's why your works are so captivating.

82
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,230
You're right.

83
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,630
Mr. Shin, you're the perfect man
for this project.

84
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,900
Don't you think so? No?

85
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,530
You're right. I agree.

86
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,960
Then let's keep building on this project.

87
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,280
That's all for today.

88
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,090
-Great work.
-Sure.

89
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,590
Mr. Shin. Mr. Shin?

90
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,159
If you have some time,

91
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,930
let's all eat dinner together
and bond as a team.

92
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,340
Let's do it next time.

93
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,220
-I'll see you next time.
-Goodbye.

94
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,930
That darned "next time."
Next time, next time.

95
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,930
So when exactly is this "next time"?

96
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,640
Wait, Mr. Shin. Mr. Shin!

97
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,230
You said
you live in Samcheong-dong, right?

98
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,440
I actually have to be there right now.

99
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,330
Could you give me a lift?

100
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,670
-I'm sorry.
-Wait!

101
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,650
I mean, do I make you feel
that uncomfortable?

102
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,809
It has been a while
since we worked together,

103
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,710
so I thought it'd be great
if we could get a little closer.

104
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,360
It looked like
you didn't have any close acquaintances.

105
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,659
I had a good friend, but I haven't
heard from her since the liberation...

106
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,580
Sorry? The liberation?

107
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,580
You and your jokes.

108
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,320
Wait! One second.

109
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,650
Wait.

110
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,460
In that case,
could you give me just one answer?

111
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,520
Why won't you let anyone
get involved in your life?

112
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,680
You don't make friends or girlfriends.

113
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,770
Do you have a bad history of dating?

114
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,550
Or is there someone you can't forget?

115
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,570
Your Highness, why do you shed a teardrop?

116
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,640
Because of that being that shows up again
as soon as it became history to me.

117
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,890
That being?

118
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,110
Fine dust.

119
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,760
Gosh, my eyes sting.
The fine dust level is awful today.

120
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,270
No, what you're doing is awful.

121
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,780
I mean, think about my elegant face

122
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,950
and how I always become
the top of my class at school.

123
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,190
Why do I have to be some court maid...

124
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,730
-Hey.
-What?

125
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,150
I paid for the rental.

126
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,180
I'm paying a hefty price
for not bringing cash.

127
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,730
Stop acting like the Queen,
and let's go do our homework.

128
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,100
We came here to write a report
on the palace of Joseon.

129
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,170
-Let's not forget our mission.
-Of course.

130
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,120
Hey! Your time is up!

131
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,530
Already?

132
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,340
I paid 10,000 won for this.

133
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,780
The life of a Queen is
very short-lived and futile.

134
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,410
Aren't you coming?

135
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,520
My maid, wait for me.

136
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,090
[What? Two-timed?]

137
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,890
Hey, Jin-ah two-timed you?

138
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,620
This is embarrassing, so please be quiet.

139
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,940
I knew it.

140
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,270
I told you time and time again
that she isn't good for you.

141
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,750
But she really wouldn't do that.

142
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,060
So why?

143
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,070
Hey, why the heck are you crying?

144
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,540
Just think of this as an awful accident,
and get over her already!

145
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,430
I miss her so much.

146
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,060
Jin-ah, you evil brat.

147
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,170
I hope she craps in her pants.

148
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,430
I hope her pouch drops
and her glitter eyeshadow

149
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,840
completely shatters!

150
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,580
Hey, don't touch that phone
as you curse her.

151
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,250
-No.
-Take it. He's going to call her.

152
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,750
Give it to me.

153
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,470
You'll thank me tomorrow.

That softy
always gives his everything to girls.

160
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,240
One day, I'm afraid
he'll give up his organs.

161
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,190
Man! I have a phone English class
with Ryan at 10 p.m.

162
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,250
I have to go.

163
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,450
No! You can't go.

164
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,420
I'm going to disinfect my broken heart
with alcohol through the night.

165
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,770
That's bitter.

166
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,240
It hurts. It hurts right here.

167
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,440
It hurts.

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,000
-Gosh. Why...
-This isn't going to work. You should go.

169
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,640
He's completely wasted.

170
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,220
Can you deal with him?

171
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,730
This isn't the first time.
Don't worry about us and go.

172
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,680
Said I, an hour ago,

173
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,140
and I deserve to be punished.

174
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,600
Darn it. Hey!

175
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,370
How can you drink so much
that you're unable to walk?

176
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,300
Where's your conscience, you jerk?

177
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,340
I'm not missing just my conscience,
I got no girlfriend either.

178
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,630
Hey, wait. You need to walk. Try walking.

179
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,310
This isn't going to work.
Prop yourself up.

180
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,250
Come on, please.

181
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,880
Should I just leave him here?

182
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,050
What? Did you sober up a little?

183
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,250
That crazy idiot. Hey, wait for me!

184
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,740
Jin-ah! I really loved you!

185
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,060
That son of a gun.

186
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,420
I'll kill you once I catch you.

187
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,960
Jin-ah!

188
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,540
♫ Sleep tight, my baby ♫

189
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:57,040
♫ Sleep tight, my baby ♫

190
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,140
By any chance, is this car yours?

191
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,690
[Is he a human or a signboard?]

192
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,430
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

193
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,230
♫ My baby ♫

194
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,530
Have you gone insane?
Get down here. Hey, get down!

195
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,850
Get down here.

196
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,800
-You've gone insane!
-Let go.

197
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,300
Let go of what?

198
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,840
Your life? Your future?

199
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,530
Hey, no. You can't do that. Please stop.
This really isn't a good idea.

200
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,650
-Please, stop.
-Your friend must be drunk.

201
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,560
Yes, right.
He had a little too much to drink.

202
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,910
I'll give you my phone number.
We'll reimburse the damage...

203
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,140
Are you a student?

204
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,120
Yes, I'm in college.

205
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,750
Forget it, then.

206
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,590
It's not badly damaged.

207
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,230
But still, he caused you a nuisance, so...

208
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,040
It's all right, so you can go.

209
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,750
He's an angel.

210
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,260
-What?
-What?

211
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,300
No, nothing.

212
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,910
Then thank you so much. I'm so sorry.

213
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,050
What are you sorry for?

214
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,370
How much do I owe him anyway?

215
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,700
We won't have enough
even if we sold off our organs,

216
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,890
so shut your mouth.

217
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,230
We'll get going, then. Say you're sorry!

218
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,260
-I'm sorry.
-We're sorry.

219
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,250
Come here. One second.
Please try to stand just this once.

220
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,570
Hey, wait!

221
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,330
Gosh, my head hurts.

222
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,830
When did I get home last night?

223
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,240
I need to drink some water first.

224
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,710
-You're up.
-Gosh, who are you?

225
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,980
Aren't you the owner of that red car?

226
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,920
I'm glad you remember.

227
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,960
Oh, and this is

228
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,990
my home.

229
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,980
Why am I here?

230
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,580
You wouldn't wake up,
so I had to bring you here.

231
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,700
And I have to get something back
from you too.

232
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,730
Get something back from me?

233
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,150
You swallowed my Marble last night.

234
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,450
A very important Marble
I carried with me for nearly 1,000 years

235
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,210
to become a human.

236
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,069
To become a human? What do you mean?

237
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,770
Right, I haven't introduced myself yet.

238
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,440
I am

239
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,770
a gumiho.

240
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,540
[He's a lunatic.]

241
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,800
I see.

242
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,150
You don't believe me.

243
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,400
No, I do.

244
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,420
So you're a gumiho,

245
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,720
and I swallowed a Fox Marble last night.

246
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,490
Then what should I do?
Should I wash out my stomach?

247
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,990
It's not in your stomach.

248
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,640
It already placed itself in your body.

249
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,840
Then what should we do?

250
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,610
I'll have to find a way.

251
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,370
Wait, where's my phone?

252
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,450
This means we're on the same boat now.

253
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,410
We have a common purpose,
taking out that Marble.

254
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,800
Therefore, let's cohabitate

255
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,380
for a while.

256
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,900
Sorry? Wait.

257
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,290
You want me to move in here with you?

258
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,020
I understand how you're flustered.

259
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,950
But we're strangers,

260
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,110
and that Marble is very dear to me.

261
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,510
Don't you think I'd only be rest assured
to always have you before me?

262
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,930
I can't believe this guy.

263
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,350
I was sorry my friend damaged your car

264
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,560
and thankful for not leaving me out there,
so I was going to let you run with it.

265
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,820
But what? A gumiho? Cohabitate?

266
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,800
Stop talking nonsense.

267
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,310
See? You don't believe me.

268
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,090
But yes, it'll be easier to understand
once you see it for yourself.

269
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,830
Try not to pass out.

270
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,390
Gosh, my head hurts.

271
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,870
When did I get home last night?

272
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,610
What kind of a dream was that?

273
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,970
Did you sleep well?

274
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,880
You seemed to be very shocked.

275
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,710
I'll get you a cup of tea
that'll help you calm down.

276
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,450
Are you okay with some lotus tea?

277
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,700
I think he came after me.

278
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,780
Mom...

279
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,210
Oh no, what am I going to do?

280
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,750
Dam! Open the door!

281
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,510
What? It's Dan.

282
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,230
-Dan!
-Open the door already.

283
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,700
Dan!

284
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,780
-Dan...
-Move out of my way.

285
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,270
Why did you chain the door?

286
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,910
What's wrong?

287
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,110
Wait.

288
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,540
-Are you hungry?
-What?

289
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,210
I knew you were a little too fast.

290
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,150
-No, I...
-You did your best to eat dinner.

291
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,860
-No, that's not...
-Why haven't you eaten

292
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,670
if you stayed out all night?

293
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,600
-You're so annoying.
-Wait.

294
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,520
Hey, wait for me!

295
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,210
[What am I going to do?
I think he's a real gumiho.]

296
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,490
[What am I going to do now?]

297
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,580
[I'd better stay away
from telling him, right?]

298
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,200
[If I do, I might also put him in danger.]

299
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,660
My gosh.
Why do you keep following me around?

300
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,510
Well.

301
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,020
I can't tell you the reason,
but I'm too scared to be alone.

302
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,010
You frighten me even more.
Go and take a seat.

303
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,760
My gosh!

304
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,830
What's with you today?

305
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,330
Dan.

306
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,290
The fact that you're an archer,
that you're good at shooting arrows,

307
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,070
-might all be fate.
-What are you talking about?

308
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,710
I really didn't want to tell you,

309
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,690
but I can't find a way around this.

310
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,120
I'm sorry to ask, but please help me.

311
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,280
What is it?

312
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,170
I met

313
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,250
a gumiho.

314
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,990
-What?
-He hasn't done anything yet,

315
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,750
but he might come for me soon.

316
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,040
When he does, can you shoot him?

317
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,250
People shoot arrows on fire
in historical dramas, right?

318
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,750
Is that possible...

319
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,360
No, not me. The gumiho.

320
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,420
My foot.
Did you catch yourself in the mirror?

321
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,960
Get out of my room.

322
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,130
-Please hear me...
-Three. Two.

323
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,630
Fine.

324
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,370
[Live your life on your own!]

325
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,920
Figures. No one would believe that.

326
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,740
Anyway, why is that gumiho so quiet?

327
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,540
He's making me more nervous.

328
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,680
[The world is so peaceful.]

329
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,450
[But I actually met a gumiho?]

330
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,190
[Maybe it was just a nightmare.]

331
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,790
[This stop is Terminal.]

332
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,950
[Next stop is...]

333
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,450
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

334
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,320
[What is this?]

335
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,840
[Do I have to take a dump?]

336
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,490
[No, this isn't what that feels like.]

337
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,790
Goodness, are you all right?

338
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,900
It's nothing.

339
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,220
Mr. Driver, one second!
Could you all make way?

340
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,550
This woman has to get to a restroom!

341
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,500
-No, wait.
-Please make way.

342
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,590
No, that's not what...

343
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,790
-Thank you, though.
-It's okay. Don't be flustered.

344
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,730
Thank you.

345
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,800
Hey, Dam. What's going on?

346
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,210
I have a stomachache.

347
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,850
It's not period cramps or number two,

348
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,960
but it hurts ten times as much.

349
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,690
Hey, you should've seen a doctor first.

350
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,760
I wanted to come and do my attendance.

351
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,870
Why does this hurt so much?

352
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,260
It's not like I ate anything special...

353
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,850
Dam, have you been well?

354
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,100
I'm on a break.

355
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,070
Hey, Dam!

356
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,100
Dam, are you okay?

357
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,260
That wasn't very strong.

358
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,780
Hey, Dam. Hey, wake up.

359
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,480
Hey, Dam. Stay with me. Dam!

360
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,840
Yes, this is he.

361
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,880
May I ask who's calling?

362
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,280
So this woman used her purse
to hit you on the back of your head?

363
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,560
I'm telling you.

364
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,290
Is she allowed to do this
to an innocent bystander?

365
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,000
An innocent bystander?

366
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,020
You leered at me up and down,
then sexually harassed me saying,

367
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,690
"You probably had done it a lot,"

368
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,550
"and that's not all,
I'd like to get it on with you."

369
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,370
"I keep thinking about you."
Yet you're innocent?

370
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,610
When did I say that?

371
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,210
And do you have any evidence
that I leered at you?

372
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,720
Were my eyes caught on the CCTV footage?

373
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,410
But you hitting me on the head?
It was clearly seen there.

374
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,920
The law in our country
loves to work with evidence, you know.

375
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,350
Is that the law in our country?

376
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,420
Yes, so you better be ready.

377
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,460
No matter how much you beg,
I won't drop your charges.

378
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,330
The least you can do is
grab my pants and beg me to settle.

379
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,390
What are you doing?

380
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,190
You told me to grab your pants to settle.

381
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,130
-Let me go.
-This is unfair,

382
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,630
but I thought it'd be better
to settle this case.

383
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
Let me go. What are you doing? Hey!

384
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,990
How much longer do I have to go on
for you to settle?

385
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,660
Let's talk after you let go of him.

386
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,370
You're here.

387
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,820
Have you been well?

388
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,000
It's our first time
since the liberation, so 75 years?

389
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,950
Did you ever wonder how my life was going?

390
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,890
We never checked on each other.

391
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,750
[Civil Services Center]

392
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,710
Why did you call me?

393
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,970
You always have that face.

394
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,750
Can you use your magic
to erase their memories?

395
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,130
You can do that yourself.

396
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,720
I can't use magic anymore.

397
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,570
Why not?

398
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,770
You're right.

399
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,120
I've become a human

400
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,480
four years ago.

401
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,630
Why are you leaving?

402
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,580
I wanted to thank you and buy you a meal.

403
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:56,390
People always buy a meal
when they're grateful.

404
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,760
Forget it.

405
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,130
Oh, right.

406
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,110
Human energy is

407
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,270
what fills up a fox, not food.

408
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,030
Sadly, that's not something I can give.

409
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,670
So stay for a chat, will you?

410
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,230
We've been friends for 700 years.
We can't leave like this.

411
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,540
I should stop eating.

412
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,220
Back when I was a gumiho, I never got fat.

413
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,900
But now, my body fat explodes
whenever I eat too much.

414
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,220
That's not all.

415
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,220
Back when I was a gumiho,
my skin was always flawless.

416
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,580
But I have to eat antioxidants

417
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,960
and put on eye cream to maintain my look.

418
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,640
I'm sorry. You probably don't understand.

419
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,090
If you lived for this long,
you should've learned by now.

420
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,240
But you still cross over the line.

421
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,000
What? A line?

422
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,340
Which line did I cross?

423
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,650
I don't mean that there's an actual line.

424
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,460
It's a figure of speech
which humans use often.

425
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,610
I see. Is that so?

426
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,960
That figure of speech or something?
It's tough for me to grasp.

427
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,480
And you're still very dumb.

428
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,290
It took you 80 years
to learn 1,000 Chinese characters.

429
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,430
Fine, good for you
that you studied in Seonggyungwan.

430
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,880
But you know what?

431
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,880
I became a human first
before a smart guy like you did.

432
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,840
Why haven't you become a human yet?

433
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,330
It looks like

434
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,630
you gave up on gathering human energy.

435
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,230
Wait, I hope you aren't still picky,

436
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,680
just as you were back then.

437
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,190
You again?

438
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,130
You again?

439
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,030
"Once you fall for her, you lose
everything starting with your liver,"

440
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,720
"then meet your demise
after your energy is all drained."

441
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,310
That rumor is all over the city.

442
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,260
I'm too beautiful
for people to not hear about me.

443
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,830
There's no need to run them dry
to the point of their death.

444
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,190
Mind your own business.

445
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,400
Stop looking displeased before women.
They can turn you down any minute.

446
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,380
Humans are very sensitive.

447
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,510
Then I will look for another prey.

448
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,130
If it doesn't move my heart,
whatever I take

449
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,110
just disgusts me.

450
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,390
What's your plan?

451
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,680
What are you waiting for?

452
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,790
Say something.

453
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,730
I'm 200 years younger than you,
and I managed to turn into a human first.

454
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,970
Don't you have any questions?

455
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,200
"How did you become a human?"

456
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,220
"Did you change while sleeping or eating?"

457
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,510
"How blue was the Marble?"

458
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,630
"Was it deep blue or light blue?
Or was it a blue gradient?

459
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,890
"Please tell me."
Go down on your knees

460
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,180
and ask me.

461
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,980
You're very boisterous.

462
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,890
"Boisterous"?

463
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,850
Back in Goryeo and Joseon,
I lived in their capital cities,

464
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,220
and even now, I'm a citizen of Seoul,
the capital of Korea.

465
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,250
I only live in the capital cities.

466
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,960
You remember

467
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,730
all the hair sticks and accessories I wore
went out of stock.

468
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,980
Even now in Seoul,

469
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,290
I haven't seen anyone
who is more fashionable than me.

470
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,560
Wait. Was that an idiom as well?

471
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,890
Don't act like idioms are
the only thing you don't know.

472
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,670
You're wholly and largely ignorant.

473
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,850
What?

474
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,570
Why don't we finish
this conversation here?

475
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,420
I'll be having a visitor soon.

476
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,780
A visitor? Who?

477
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,960
So what does "boisterous" mean?

478
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,500
Hey.

479
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,969
It's the Marble
the reason why I'm sick, right?

480
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,510
To be precise,

481
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,200
it's because you met
a man born in the Year of the Tiger.

482
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,350
A man born in the Year of the Tiger?

483
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,400
Tigers are foxes' natural enemies,
so we are vulnerable to their energy.

484
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,290
And it's worse for me

485
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,680
as I was born in the cursed year
and became the only male gumiho.

486
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,990
[Men born in the Year of the Tiger are
full of yang,]

487
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,710
[so they're my worst enemies.]

488
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,260
[And because you have my Marble,]

489
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,820
[you feel pain
when you meet a man born in that year.]

490
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,640
Does that mean I'll be sick

491
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,800
until the Marble is removed from me?

492
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:46,100
-What are you doing...
-Only my touch

493
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,170
can kill the pain.

494
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,320
That's ridiculous...

495
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,170
That's why I asked you to stay with me.

496
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,820
I thought you could use my company.

497
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,260
Why do I have so many things to pack?

498
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,280
So you're going to be preparing
for a contest,

499
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,600
crashing at your friend's place?

500
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,410
Yes. If we win the prize,
it will help us get a job.

501
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,000
What contest is it?

502
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,680
It's about a historical
and cultural context.

503
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,530
You don't know what it is.

504
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,110
I can look it up.

505
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,970
It's official yet.

506
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,250
I think.

507
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,230
Right. My sleep mask.

508
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,900
Did you tell Mom about it?

509
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,540
Why don't you call her?
It must be morning in the US now.

510
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,530
Don't you know our family motto?

511
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,000
[Live your life on your own!]

512
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:27,650
I can't bother her
with such trivial matters. She's busy.

513
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,590
Gosh, stop bothering me and go away.

514
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,830
Stay away from
a grown-up's business, teenager.

515
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,550
Fine...

516
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,760
would've been my answer
if you weren't so suspicious.

517
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,180
No, I'm not.

518
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,060
Your eyes.
Why do you roll your eyes like that?

519
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,130
Since when were you so serious
about getting a job?

520
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,590
I mean, you're packing your back
in the middle of the night.

521
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,130
Wait.

522
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,950
Are you seeing a guy?

523
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,310
Are you moving in with him?

524
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,070
What are you saying? Where did you get

525
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,260
such a naughty idea?

526
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,500
Right. I guess it's nonsense.

527
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,130
Actually, I trust in

528
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,260
us men's tastes.

529
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,250
Stop messing with me.

530
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,840
I already feel bad leaving you here alone.

531
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,040
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

532
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,670
Of course. I'm not a kid.

533
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,920
I'm barely at home anyway,
because of the training.

534
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,940
Still.

535
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,330
It makes me feel bad to leave you
here alone, in this empty house.

536
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,700
But I want you to know

537
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,180
that you're one of the biggest reasons
why I decided to do this.

538
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,030
Because I love you.

539
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,710
I'm leaving you because I care about you.

540
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,410
You lost your mind.

541
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,430
Get back to packing.

542
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,600
I said I'm okay.

543
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,620
I was going to work out anyway.

544
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,930
Good luck. Don't fight with your friend.

545
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,340
And go easy on the drinks.

546
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,290
Okay. I'll hang in there

547
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,800
and try to come back alive.

548
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,910
"Come back alive"?

549
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,920
-From the battlefield called job hunting.
-You're silly.

550
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,250
There's the taxi.

551
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,370
Hey, make sure to call me every two days.

552
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,910
If I don't answer, call the police.

553
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,280
Police?

554
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,000
I mean, it will be just girls there,
so I'm a little worried.

555
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,370
What's there to be worried about?

556
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,130
Your face will protect you.

557
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,210
Why don't you get
something for self-defense then?

558
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,360
-Self-defense?
-Yes.

559
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,200
-Hi.
-Welcome.

560
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,450
By any chance,

561
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,950
do you have any electroshock weapons here?

562
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,540
Of course, we do.

563
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,350
120,000 won.

564
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,900
What? That's expensive.

565
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,550
This should be enough, right?

566
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,990
Of course. You can overpower
any regular person with this.

567
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,760
But he's not regular nor a person.

568
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,430
If you feel so insecure,

569
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,720
you can buy this too.

570
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,460
With this, you will be 100 percent safe.

571
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,150
Once it's sprayed on your face,
it will burn for up to six hours.

572
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,610
It's 70,000 won.

573
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,370
Seven...

574
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,280
-I'll get this one only.
-Sure. Suit yourself.

575
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,390
Thank you.

576
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,390
[A mangled body found
in the middle of the city]

577
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,810
[is shocking the world.]

578
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,350
[“A Female Body Found in the Middle
of the City  Spreads Fear of Murder”]

579
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,480
[Its abdomen and chest were mutilated,]

580
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,410
[as if someone tried
to take its organs out,]

581
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,880
[and the crime was committed
in the middle of downtown,]

582
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,900
[which are terrifying many citizens.]

583
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,850
Gosh. That's horrible.

584
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,650
Maybe the criminal wanted the organs.

585
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,190
Organs?

586
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,390
There must have been a motive.

587
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,110
It could have been a heart or a liver.

588
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,740
Liver?

589
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,730
-I'd like to get this spray too.
-Okay. Thank you.

590
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,240
That would be 70,000 won. Thank you.

591
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,320
Gosh, that startled me.

592
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,480
Goodness.

593
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,610
Why is he giving me such a scary look?

594
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:55,360
But you were there just now.
How can you be here?

595
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,730
I used my power of teleportation.

596
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,530
But why would you do that all of a sudden?

597
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,120
I thought I could help you
with the heavy bag.

598
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,730
He's so kind I almost passed out.

599
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,730
You can use that room.

600
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,010
Okay. Thank you.

601
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,960
Right.

602
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,600
We don't even know each other's names yet.

603
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,320
My name is Shin Woo-yeo.

604
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,870
My name is Lee Dam.

605
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,590
Lee Dam.

606
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:43,010
May I call you Miss Dam from now?

607
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,220
Sure. However you want.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

608
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,850
Why is this in my bag?

609
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,350
[Pepper Spray]

610
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,910
It says, once it's sprayed on your face,
it will burn for up to six hours.

611
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,890
You have a pepper spray.

612
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,000
It's my present for you.

613
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,070
I see.

614
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:35,450
My mom said I should always bring a gift
when I visit someone's house.

615
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,610
I couldn't have it wrapped
because I was in a hurry,

616
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,590
but hope you like it.

617
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,400
It's a present.

618
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,530
A present.

619
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,910
I got them all stolen.

620
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,750
Stay strong.

621
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,860
What's this sound?

622
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,870
Are you okay, Miss Dam?

623
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,430
Oh, this.

624
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,730
I was just trimming the trees
in the garden.

625
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,680
-Trimming the trees?
-Yes.

626
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,290
They need to be pruned off.

627
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,750
But why would you do that
in the middle of the night?

628
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:15,830
Foxes are nocturnal animals.

629
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,710
[Is that a liver?]

630
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,510
It's coagulated ox blood.

631
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,370
What? Ox blood?

632
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,570
It's one of my favorite foods.

633
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,010
The restaurant owner
didn't close it properly.

634
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,360
I got the blood all over my hands earlier
because of this

635
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,120
so I had to wash it off.

636
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,970
By the way, Miss Dam,
you seem to get scared easily.

637
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,830
From now on, I'll make sure
to finish it while it's fresh

638
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,310
so I don't scare you.

639
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,020
There's so much blood.

640
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,930
[I suddenly moved in with a gumiho.]

641
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:40,790
[I'm scared and nervous.]

642
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,680
[Will I ever get to sleep in peace]

643
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,570
[in this house?]

644
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,580
[Aren't you going to school, Miss Dam?]

645
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,750
[Miss Dam?]

646
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:18,190
I'm not nocturnal like you.
Why would I go to school at night...

647
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,550
What? When did I fall asleep?

648
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,750
[Get ahold of yourself, Dam.]

649
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,000
[Gumihos trick humans,
and he's one of them.]

650
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:08,750
[He's just a sly fox
disguised as a good-looking man.]

651
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,050
Did you sleep well?

652
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,120
Yes, kind of.

653
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,550
You don't seem like you did though.

654
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,350
Why don't you have
some warm goji berry tea?

655
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,350
Goji berries protect your liver
and help you beat fatigue.

656
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,990
[What? Why would he worry about my liver?]

657
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,840
[What does he want to do with my liver?]

658
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,260
[-That sly fox.]
-Right.

659
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,690
I don't know what you like yet,
so I bought random things.

660
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,020
[That sly fox.]

661
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,560
I got some popsicles too.

662
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,580
[That sly fox.]

663
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,930
And I will pay your tuition.

664
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,380
That generous fox.

665
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:53,450
Why would you? You don't need to do that.

666
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,490
Well, you will have to live
with some inconvenience here,

667
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,110
and I feel bad about it.

668
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,490
I thought I could pay your tuition
to compensate for it

669
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,600
since you're a student.

670
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,590
It's okay though.

671
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,110
Do you want me to text the bill to you?

672
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,890
[Cash Deposit]

673
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,050
This covers both my tuition
for the next semester and Dan's lessons!

674
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,230
Are you happy?

675
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,390
How could you laugh in this situation?

676
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,050
-Miss Dam.
-Yes?

677
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,170
Do you want to talk to me?

678
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,220
Are you going somewhere?

679
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:53,070
I'm attending a book event.

680
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,400
I'm writing a book about humanities.

681
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:58,440
I see. So you have a job.

682
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,050
Even legendary animals
can't avoid capitalism.

683
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:05,610
Not quite. Living a long life bores me.

684
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,160
-I see.
-Anyway, I'm going to Singapore,

685
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,880
and I'll be away for a few days.

686
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,200
Okay.

687
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,440
Really?

688
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:16,390
You look so happy.

689
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,370
You must've been
really uncomfortable around me.

690
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,320
That's not true. I wasn't.
I'm not happy at all.

691
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,580
I'll see you later then.

692
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:33,860
What are you doing?

693
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,440
It's shapeshifting.

694
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:39,000
I don't want to make myself known
too widely but,

695
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:41,120
I heard reporters might come.

696
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,450
Until I meet the staff
from the publishing company,

697
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,640
I want to look like this.

698
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,940
I see. You have so many talents.

699
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,700
Okay, then. I'll leave for real now.

700
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,690
-Make sure to lock the door.
-Okay.

701
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,760
Let me.

702
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,040
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

703
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,440
[All right. Let's call it a day.]

704
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,640
Make sure to submit your assignment
by the next week.

705
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,630
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

706
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,140
Bye.

707
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:17,680
Hey, Dam!

708
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,510
You scared me.

709
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,060
Why do you look so down?
Are you still sick?

710
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,380
No, I'm fine now.

711
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,060
That's great.
You're coming with us to the club then.

712
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,820
-Let's go.
-The club?

713
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,630
We're throwing a farewell party for Ji-eun

714
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,260
because she's going to go study abroad.

715
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,490
Right.

716
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,950
I've been so busy these days
I forgot about it.

717
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,210
But I can't be in a crowded place.

718
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,200
I can't either.
I'm taking an English exam this weekend.

719
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:46,410
Still. We are not freshmen anymore
who live like there's no tomorrow.

720
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,260
We've reached the age
where we need to worry

721
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,060
about tomorrow's shame
and frozen shoulders.

722
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:53,360
For sure.

723
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:55,740
And you're still wet behind your ears.

724
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:57,320
-You're coming.
-You're coming.

725
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:58,950
-You're coming with us.
-You have to.

726
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,360
-You're coming.
-Let's go.

727
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:03,220
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

728
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:06,120
Fine. Are we going now?

729
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,440
With that on?

730
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,090
-You've got no mercy.
-You've got no conscience.

731
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,470
Okay. Let's go.

732
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,070
It's so crowded here.

733
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,650
Look at all the people.

734
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,730
Gosh, I'm so excited!

735
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:31,470
-Oh, my gosh. What happened?
-What happened?

736
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,010
You look so gorgeous!

737
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,120
Where did you get those newest items?

738
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,410
Dam's mother is a fashion magazine editor.

739
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,350
She's in the US, and she sends
her the clothes she used for photoshoots.

740
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,720
Which is why she was once called

741
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,700
a fashionable

742
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,020
alcoholic.

743
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:47,790
I haven't put on high heels in a while,
and my legs hurt.

744
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,020
Let's go sit inside.

745
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,880
Sit? You're not sitting anywhere.

746
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,770
You're not sitting tonight.

747
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,450
Let's go!

748
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,650
Is this a club
or a subway in the rush hours?

749
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,990
Hey, Dam! I'll go get some vodka.

750
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,710
Hey, wait up!

751
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,300
How old are you?

752
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:18,900
Why do you talk down to me?
Do you know me?

753
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,020
Why did you touch my body
without asking me?

754
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,760
Do you want to go to the police station
with me and talk it out?

755
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:28,890
I apologize.

756
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,880
-Here.
-Thank...

757
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,640
I like your style.

758
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,790
Don't take it so seriously.
I'm just messing with you.

759
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,280
Do you want to have a drink with me?

760
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,020
[The Year of the Tiger.]

761
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:54,360
We booked a table over there.

762
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,470
Want to come?

763
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,980
Move. Move aside.

764
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,480
Move.

765
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:13,460
Mr. Shin, you did a great job today.

766
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,230
How about a glass of whiskey
in the lounge?

767
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,490
My gosh.

768
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:36,690
[The person you have reached is
not available. Please leave a message...]

769
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,460
How much did you drink?

770
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:48,220
Now I have to hold you.

771
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,910
[What do I do?]

772
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,070
[This is bad.]

773
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,240
[Hey, my body, please move.]

774
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,280
Let me take you
to the place I know around here.

775
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,990
Is that okay with you?

776
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,440
[Please.]

777
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,580
[Please. Somebody help me.]

778
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,520
Are you okay?

779
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,890
[Please.]

780
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,360
[Please. Somebody help me.]

781
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,810
I've been looking for you.

782
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,300
Who are you?

783
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:59,710
I'm her friend. I'll take her from here.

784
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,960
How can I believe
if you're her friend or not?

785
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,540
Why do you have my friend's phone?

786
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,770
-Because she's my friend.
-Do you know her name?

787
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,300
Hey.

788
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,220
[I've sober up already,]

789
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,860
[but I can't find
the right time to get up.]

790
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,350
Are you okay?

791
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,920
Do you want me to get you something warm?

792
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:16,140
If I order a cake, will you eat it?

793
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,500
I'd like a tiramisu.

794
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:41,440
I want you to rather scold me

795
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,700
for going to a club

796
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:48,000
even though I knew being
in a crowded place could be dangerous

797
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,770
and making you come a long way

798
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:53,410
from work because of me.

799
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,960
I'm sorry.

800
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:58,860
It's okay.

801
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,960
The Marble is fine, and so are you.

802
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,860
But from now on,
I want you to avoid places like that,

803
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:11,840
for your sake.

804
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,970
-Okay. From now on...
-And don't be scared.

805
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,070
What?

806
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,000
I know you're scared of me.

807
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,260
You're worried
I might harm or threaten you.

808
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,370
I can see that.

809
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,790
-Well...
-I understand.

810
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,490
Who wouldn't be scared of a gumiho?

811
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,800
But you're not just anyone.

812
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,220
You have my Marble,

813
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:39,340
and you need to be safe
to keep my Marble safe.

814
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,740
So I need to protect you at all costs.

815
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:47,840
So why don't you try
to be less scared of me?

816
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,210
It makes me feel bad

817
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,460
to see you being on pins and needles.

818
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,590
I'm sorry I've concerned you.

819
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:59,890
From now on, I'll try
not to be scared of you

820
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,710
and not to repeat the same mistake.

821
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,350
-Promise me.
-I promise.

822
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,210
You have to keep your word.

823
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,550
I will.

824
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,470
-Excuse me for a second.
-Sure.

825
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:43,850
Hello?

826
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:46,620
Yes.

827
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:57,050
I thought he was a scary gumiho
from ghost stories,

828
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:00,870
but he might be a nice fox
from fairy tales.

829
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,450
Okay. Bye.

830
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:20,230
-Shall we?
-Okay.

831
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,240
The Year of the Tiger.

832
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,660
I see.

833
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:49,050
By the way, is the Marble

834
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,560
visible only to you?

835
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,670
Yes.

836
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,830
What color is it?

837
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:00,100
-It's red.
-Red. I see.

838
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,310
Do you think you can take it out?

839
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,820
I will try.

840
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,420
A human cannot hold
the Marble for long anyway.

841
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,370
How long can a human hold it then?

842
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:16,240
A year, at most.

843
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,490
That means after one year of holding it,

844
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,640
it will be sorted out somehow.

845
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:35,780
Doesn't it?

846
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,910
Then what happens
if it's not taken out within a year?

847
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,000
You will die.

848
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,460
What?

849
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,840
Miss Dam.

850
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,440
You will die.

851
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:25,190
[We appreciate Kim Eung-soo and
Han Ji-eun for their guest appearances.]
