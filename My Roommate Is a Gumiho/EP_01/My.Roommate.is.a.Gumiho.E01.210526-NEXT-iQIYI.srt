1
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,829
It's quite rowdy today, isn't it, my lord?

2
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,119
The new scholars of Seonggyungwan are

3
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,675
having a welcoming party tonight.

4
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,438
You're so funny, my lord.

5
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,945
They're so mischievous.

6
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,835
Right, I heard
you also studied at Seonggyungwan.

7
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,359
Anyway, I'm afraid
one of the drunk scholars

8
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,485
might get bewitched by a gumiho.

9
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,559
Haven't you heard?

10
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,769
I hear a wicked monster
who devours on people's liver

11
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,929
has recently been seen in the city.

12
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,895
She bewitches people in an instant
with her dazzling beauty,

13
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,585
but she's actually a fox
who has been around for centuries.

14
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,855
If that rumor is true,

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,949
I should stop coming
to this gisaeng house.

16
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,515
What? What do you mean?

17
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,839
If you stop coming here,

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,829
what do we have to live for?

19
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,649
But I thought
the most beautiful women of Joseon

20
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,074
are here with me right now.

21
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,324
I'm a coward,

22
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,465
so I'm afraid one of you
might try to eat my liver.

23
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,785
My lord, goodness. Stop teasing us.

24
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,715
You were born as a lowly beast,
but you dreamed of becoming a human.

25
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,405
What a foolish and poor thing you are.

26
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,515
I take pity on you
and will make your wish come true.

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,245
My lord, should I blow out the candles?

28
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,195
Do as you like,

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,695
since everything is
nothing but your dream.

30
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,379
Pardon? What do you mean?

31
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,339
You won't remember a thing
once you wake up.

32
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,785
[ Once you live a hundred years
with good virtue, you'll grow a tail. ]

33
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,915
[ If you cultivate yourself
and live 200 years, two tails. ]

34
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,875
[ If you come to an understanding
and live 300 years, three tails. ]

35
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,845
[ Then you will make yourself
a Red Marble. ]

36
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,789
[ If you manage to color that Marble blue
with human energy ]

37
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,055
[ before 1,000 years is up,
before you grow more than 9 tails, ]

38
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,955
[ you, a beast, may become a human. ]

39
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,155
Taking someone's liver?

40
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,175
How did such a heinous rumor begin?

41
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,575
[ If you live your life long enough, ]

42
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,385
[ you become indifferent to everything. ]

43
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,065
[ The change of seasons. ]

44
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,019
[ The meaningless time
as I feign to be in love. ]

45
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,175
[ We encourage you to plan your family. ]

46
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,095
[ The emptiness that swarms in
from time to time. ]

47
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,925
[ All of these mean ]

48
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,445
[ nothing more than
countless numbers of repetitions. ]

49
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,025
[ How much longer
must I spend living my life ]

50
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,715
[ in this indifference? ]

51
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,685
You seem to be here alone,

52
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,245
as always.

53
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,465
[ Episode 1 ]

54
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,145
Mr. Shin.

55
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,695
- Hello.
- Hello.

56
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,819
Our theme for this project is

57
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,589
the history behind history.

58
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,979
I'd like it to be centered around
the behind stories of our history.

59
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,545
Of course, there will be difficulty
in providing historical evidence,

60
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,065
but I think it might be all right
if we do thorough research.

61
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,019
For example, during the Joseon era,

62
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,849
commoners couldn't accuse the noblemen
no matter how unfair anything was.

63
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,609
I heard they could only use sinmungo

64
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,279
or run over to the King

65
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,699
whenever he was in their town
in a procession.

66
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,295
That wasn't the case.

67
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,029
Everyone could file a lawsuit
regardless of their social class.

68
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,619
They could also appeal their cases,
and there was a system

69
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,655
to avoid corruption of the lawsuit.

70
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,979
While I was a local governor
over Pyeongan Province,

71
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,065
I once took a case of this farmer...

72
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,865
Wow.

73
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,655
Some might hear that and think
you actually did it yourself.

74
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,369
I knew it. You write everything
as if you went through it yourself.

75
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,789
That's why your works are so captivating.

76
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,475
You're right.

77
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,859
Mr. Shin, you're the perfect man
for this project.

78
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,139
Don't you think so? No?

79
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,769
You're right. I agree.

80
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,199
Then let's keep building on this project.

81
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,519
That's all for today.

82
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,319
- Great work.
- Sure.

83
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,835
Mr. Shin. Mr. Shin?

84
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,399
If you have some time,

85
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,169
let's all eat dinner together
and bond as a team.

86
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,585
Let's do it next time.

87
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,465
- I'll see you next time.
- Goodbye.

88
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,175
That darned "next time."
Next time, next time.

89
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,175
So when exactly is this "next time"?

90
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,885
Wait, Mr. Shin. Mr. Shin!

91
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,475
You said
you live in Samcheong-dong, right?

92
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,685
I actually have to be there right now.

93
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,569
Could you give me a lift?

94
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,915
- I'm sorry.
- Wait!

95
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,889
I mean, do I make you feel
that uncomfortable?

96
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,039
It has been a while
since we worked together,

97
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,955
so I thought it'd be great
if we could get a little closer.

98
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,599
It looked like
you didn't have any close acquaintances.

99
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,899
I had a good friend, but I haven't
heard from her since the liberation...

100
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,825
Sorry? The liberation?

101
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,825
You and your jokes.

102
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,565
Wait! One second.

103
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,895
Wait.

104
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,705
In that case,
could you give me just one answer?

105
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,765
Why won't you let anyone
get involved in your life?

106
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,925
You don't make friends or girlfriends.

107
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,015
Do you have a bad history of dating?

108
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,795
Or is there someone you can't forget?

109
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,815
Your Highness, why do you shed a teardrop?

110
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,879
Because of that being that shows up again
as soon as it became history to me.

111
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,135
That being?

112
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,349
Fine dust.

113
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,999
Gosh, my eyes sting.
The fine dust level is awful today.

114
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,509
No, what you're doing is awful.

115
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,019
I mean, think about my elegant face

116
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,189
and how I always become
the top of my class at school.

117
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,429
Why do I have to be some court maid...

118
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,975
- Hey.
- What?

119
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,389
I paid for the rental.

120
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,409
I'm paying a hefty price
for not bringing cash.

121
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,969
Stop acting like the Queen,
and let's go do our homework.

122
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,339
We came here to write a report
on the palace of Joseon.

123
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,409
- Let's not forget our mission.
- Of course.

124
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,359
Hey! Your time is up!

125
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,775
Already?

126
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,585
I paid 10,000 won for this.

127
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,025
The life of a Queen is
very short-lived and futile.

128
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,655
Aren't you coming?

129
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,765
My maid, wait for me.

130
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,329
[ What? Two-timed? ]

131
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,129
Hey, Jin-ah two-timed you?

132
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,859
This is embarrassing, so please be quiet.

133
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,179
I knew it.

134
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,509
I told you time and time again
that she isn't good for you.

135
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,995
But she really wouldn't do that.

136
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,305
So why?

137
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,299
Hey, why the heck are you crying?

138
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,785
Just think of this as an awful accident,
and get over her already!

139
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,675
I miss her so much.

140
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,305
Jin-ah, you evil brat.

141
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,415
I hope she craps in her pants.

142
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,669
I hope her pouch drops
and her glitter eyeshadow

143
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,085
completely shatters!

144
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,819
Hey, don't touch that phone
as you curse her.

145
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,489
- No.
- Take it. He's going to call her.

146
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,995
Give it to me.

147
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,715
You'll thank me tomorrow.

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,859
♫ Come back to me ♫

149
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,569

Goodness, you poor thing.

153
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,555
That softy
always gives his everything to girls.

154
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,435
One day, I'm afraid
he'll give up his organs.

155
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,379
Man! I have a phone English class
with Ryan at 10 p.m.

156
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,429
I have to go.

157
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,645
No! You can't go.

158
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,615
I'm going to disinfect my broken heart
with alcohol through the night.

159
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,959
That's bitter.

160
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,435
It hurts. It hurts right here.

161
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,635
It hurts.

162
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,195
- Gosh. Why...
- This isn't going to work. You should go.

163
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,835
He's completely wasted.

164
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,415
Can you deal with him?

165
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,919
This isn't the first time.
Don't worry about us and go.

166
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,875
Said I, an hour ago,

167
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,329
and I deserve to be punished.

168
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,795
Darn it. Hey!

169
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,559
How can you drink so much
that you're unable to walk?

170
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,489
Where's your conscience, you jerk?

171
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,535
I'm not missing just my conscience,
I got no girlfriend either.

172
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,819
Hey, wait. You need to walk. Try walking.

173
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,499
This isn't going to work.
Prop yourself up.

174
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,445
Come on, please.

175
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,075
Should I just leave him here?

176
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,245
What? Did you sober up a little?

177
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,445
That crazy idiot. Hey, wait for me!

178
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,929
Jin-ah! I really loved you!

179
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,249
That son of a gun.

180
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,609
I'll kill you once I catch you.

181
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,155
Jin-ah!

182
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,735
♫ Sleep tight, my baby ♫

183
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:40,235
♫ Sleep tight, my baby ♫

184
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,335
By any chance, is this car yours?

185
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,885
[ Is he a human or a signboard? ]

186
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,625
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

187
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,419
♫ My baby ♫

188
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,725
Have you gone insane?
Get down here. Hey, get down!

189
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,045
Get down here.

190
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,989
- You've gone insane!
- Let go.

191
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,489
Let go of what?

192
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,029
Your life? Your future?

193
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,725
Hey, no. You can't do that. Please stop.
This really isn't a good idea.

194
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,845
- Please, stop.
- Your friend must be drunk.

195
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,755
Yes, right.
He had a little too much to drink.

196
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,089
I'll give you my phone number.
We'll reimburse the damage...

197
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,335
Are you a student?

198
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,315
Yes, I'm in college.

199
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,929
Forget it, then.

200
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,785
It's not badly damaged.

201
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,425
But still, he caused you a nuisance, so...

202
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,235
It's all right, so you can go.

203
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,945
He's an angel.

204
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,455
- What?
- What?

205
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,489
No, nothing.

206
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,089
Then thank you so much. I'm so sorry.

207
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,239
What are you sorry for?

208
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,559
How much do I owe him anyway?

209
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,889
We won't have enough
even if we sold off our organs,

210
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,085
so shut your mouth.

211
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,419
We'll get going, then. Say you're sorry!

212
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,449
- I'm sorry.
- We're sorry.

213
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,439
Come here. One second.
Please try to stand just this once.

214
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,765
Hey, wait!

215
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,525
Gosh, my head hurts.

216
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,025
When did I get home last night?

217
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,435
I need to drink some water first.

218
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,905
- You're up.
- Gosh, who are you?

219
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,175
Aren't you the owner of that red car?

220
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,115
I'm glad you remember.

221
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,155
Oh, and this is

222
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,185
my home.

223
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,169
Why am I here?

224
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,775
You wouldn't wake up,
so I had to bring you here.

225
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,895
And I have to get something back
from you too.

226
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,918
Get something back from me?

227
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:53,345
You swallowed my Marble last night.

228
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,639
A very important Marble
I carried with me for nearly 1,000 years

229
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,405
to become a human.

230
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,264
To become a human? What do you mean?

231
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,965
Right, I haven't introduced myself yet.

232
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,635
I am

233
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,965
a gumiho.

234
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,735
[ He's a lunatic. ]

235
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,995
I see.

236
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,345
You don't believe me.

237
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,579
No, I do.

238
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,609
So you're a gumiho,

239
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,915
and I swallowed a Fox Marble last night.

240
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,679
Then what should I do?
Should I wash out my stomach?

241
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,185
It's not in your stomach.

242
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,835
It already placed itself in your body.

243
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,035
Then what should we do?

244
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,805
I'll have to find a way.

245
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,559
Wait, where's my phone?

246
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,645
This means we're on the same boat now.

247
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,605
We have a common purpose,
taking out that Marble.

248
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,995
Therefore, let's cohabitate

249
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,575
for a while.

250
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,095
Sorry? Wait.

251
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,485
You want me to move in here with you?

252
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,215
I understand how you're flustered.

253
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,139
But we're strangers,

254
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,305
and that Marble is very dear to me.

255
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,705
Don't you think I'd only be rest assured
to always have you before me?

256
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,125
I can't believe this guy.

257
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,539
I was sorry my friend damaged your car

258
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,749
and thankful for not leaving me out there,
so I was going to let you run with it.

259
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,015
But what? A gumiho? Cohabitate?

260
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,995
Stop talking nonsense.

261
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,505
See? You don't believe me.

262
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,285
But yes, it'll be easier to understand
once you see it for yourself.

263
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,025
Try not to pass out.

264
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,585
Gosh, my head hurts.

265
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,065
When did I get home last night?

266
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,805
What kind of a dream was that?

267
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,165
Did you sleep well?

268
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,075
You seemed to be very shocked.

269
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,905
I'll get you a cup of tea
that'll help you calm down.

270
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,645
Are you okay with some lotus tea?

271
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,895
I think he came after me.

272
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,975
Mom...

273
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,405
Oh no, what am I going to do?

274
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,929
Dam! Open the door!

275
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,705
What? It's Dan.

276
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,425
- Dan!
- Open the door already.

277
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,895
Dan!

278
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,975
- Dan...
- Move out of my way.

279
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,465
Why did you chain the door?

280
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,105
What's wrong?

281
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,305
Wait.

282
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,729
- Are you hungry?
- What?

283
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,399
I knew you were a little too fast.

284
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,329
- No, I...
- You did your best to eat dinner.

285
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,049
- No, that's not...
- Why haven't you eaten

286
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,849
if you stayed out all night?

287
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,795
- You're so annoying.
- Wait.

288
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,715
Hey, wait for me!

289
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,389
[ What am I going to do?
I think he's a real gumiho. ]

290
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,685
[ What am I going to do now? ]

291
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,775
[ I'd better stay away
from telling him, right? ]

292
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,395
[ If I do, I might also put him in danger. ]

293
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,855
My gosh.
Why do you keep following me around?

294
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,699
Well.

295
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,199
I can't tell you the reason,
but I'm too scared to be alone.

296
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,205
You frighten me even more.
Go and take a seat.

297
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,955
My gosh!

298
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,025
What's with you today?

299
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,525
Dan.

300
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,479
The fact that you're an archer,
that you're good at shooting arrows,

301
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,259
- might all be fate.
- What are you talking about?

302
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,899
I really didn't want to tell you,

303
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,879
but I can't find a way around this.

304
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,315
I'm sorry to ask, but please help me.

305
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,475
What is it?

306
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,365
I met

307
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,445
a gumiho.

308
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,179
- What?
- He hasn't done anything yet,

309
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,939
but he might come for me soon.

310
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,235
When he does, can you shoot him?

311
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,439
People shoot arrows on fire
in historical dramas, right?

312
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,945
Is that possible...

313
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,539
No, not me. The gumiho.

314
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,615
My foot.
Did you catch yourself in the mirror?

315
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,149
Get out of my room.

316
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,319
- Please hear me...
- Three. Two.

317
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,825
Fine.

318
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,565
[ Live your life on your own! ]

319
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,115
Figures. No one would believe that.

320
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,935
Anyway, why is that gumiho so quiet?

321
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,735
He's making me more nervous.

322
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,869
[ The world is so peaceful. ]

323
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,645
[ But I actually met a gumiho? ]

324
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,385
[ Maybe it was just a nightmare. ]

325
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,979
[ This stop is Terminal. ]

326
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,145
[ Next stop is... ]

327
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,645
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

328
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,515
[ What is this? ]

329
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,035
[ Do I have to take a dump? ]

330
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,685
[ No, this isn't what that feels like. ]

331
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,985
Goodness, are you all right?

332
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,095
It's nothing.

333
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,409
Mr. Driver, one second!
Could you all make way?

334
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,745
This woman has to get to a restroom!

335
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,695
- No, wait.
- Please make way.

336
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,779
No, that's not what...

337
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,979
- Thank you, though.
- It's okay. Don't be flustered.

338
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,925
Thank you.

339
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,989
Hey, Dam. What's going on?

340
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,399
I have a stomachache.

341
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,039
It's not period cramps or number two,

342
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,149
but it hurts ten times as much.

343
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,879
Hey, you should've seen a doctor first.

344
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,949
I wanted to come and do my attendance.

345
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,065
Why does this hurt so much?

346
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,455
It's not like I ate anything special...

347
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,045
Dam, have you been well?

348
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,295
I'm on a break.

349
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,265
Hey, Dam!

350
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,289
Dam, are you okay?

351
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,455
That wasn't very strong.

352
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,969
Hey, Dam. Hey, wake up.

353
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,675
Hey, Dam. Stay with me. Dam!

354
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,035
Yes, this is he.

355
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,075
May I ask who's calling?

356
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,469
So this woman used her purse
to hit you on the back of your head?

357
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,749
I'm telling you.

358
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,479
Is she allowed to do this
to an innocent bystander?

359
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,195
An innocent bystander?

360
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,209
You leered at me up and down,
then sexually harassed me saying,

361
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,879
"You probably had done it a lot,"

362
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,739
"and that's not all,
I'd like to get it on with you."

363
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,565
"I keep thinking about you."
Yet you're innocent?

364
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,799
When did I say that?

365
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,399
And do you have any evidence
that I leered at you?

366
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,899
Were my eyes caught on the CCTV footage?

367
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,599
But you hitting me on the head?
It was clearly seen there.

368
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,115
The law in our country
loves to work with evidence, you know.

369
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,545
Is that the law in our country?

370
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,609
Yes, so you better be ready.

371
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,655
No matter how much you beg,
I won't drop your charges.

372
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,525
The least you can do is
grab my pants and beg me to settle.

373
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,579
What are you doing?

374
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,379
You told me to grab your pants to settle.

375
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,309
- Let me go.
- This is unfair,

376
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,819
but I thought it'd be better
to settle this case.

377
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,069
Let me go. What are you doing? Hey!

378
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,179
How much longer do I have to go on
for you to settle?

379
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,855
Let's talk after you let go of him.

380
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,565
You're here.

381
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,015
Have you been well?

382
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,195
It's our first time
since the liberation, so 75 years?

383
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,145
Did you ever wonder how my life was going?

384
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,085
We never checked on each other.

385
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,850
[ Civil Services Center ]

386
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,905
Why did you call me?

387
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,165
You always have that face.

388
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,945
Can you use your magic
to erase their memories?

389
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,325
You can do that yourself.

390
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,915
I can't use magic anymore.

391
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,765
Why not?

392
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,965
You're right.

393
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:27,309
I've become a human

394
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,675
four years ago.

395
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,819
Why are you leaving?

396
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,769
I wanted to thank you and buy you a meal.

397
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,585
People always buy a meal
when they're grateful.

398
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,955
Forget it.

399
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,325
Oh, right.

400
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,299
Human energy is

401
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,465
what fills up a fox, not food.

402
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,225
Sadly, that's not something I can give.

403
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,849
So stay for a chat, will you?

404
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,425
We've been friends for 700 years.
We can't leave like this.

405
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,735
I should stop eating.

406
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,409
Back when I was a gumiho, I never got fat.

407
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,089
But now, my body fat explodes
whenever I eat too much.

408
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,409
That's not all.

409
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:34,399
Back when I was a gumiho,
my skin was always flawless.

410
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,769
But I have to eat antioxidants

411
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,155
and put on eye cream to maintain my look.

412
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:44,835
I'm sorry. You probably don't understand.

413
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,285
If you lived for this long,
you should've learned by now.

414
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,435
But you still cross over the line.

415
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,189
What? A line?

416
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,535
Which line did I cross?

417
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,839
I don't mean that there's an actual line.

418
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,655
It's a figure of speech
which humans use often.

419
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,799
I see. Is that so?

420
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,155
That figure of speech or something?
It's tough for me to grasp.

421
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,659
And you're still very dumb.

422
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,479
It took you 80 years
to learn 1,000 Chinese characters.

423
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,619
Fine, good for you
that you studied in Seonggyungwan.

424
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,069
But you know what?

425
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:27,075
I became a human first
before a smart guy like you did.

426
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,019
Why haven't you become a human yet?

427
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,519
It looks like

428
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,825
you gave up on gathering human energy.

429
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,419
Wait, I hope you aren't still picky,

430
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,875
just as you were back then.

431
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,385
You again?

432
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,319
You again?

433
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,219
"Once you fall for her, you lose
everything starting with your liver,"

434
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,915
"then meet your demise
after your energy is all drained."

435
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,499
That rumor is all over the city.

436
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,449
I'm too beautiful
for people to not hear about me.

437
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,009
There's no need to run them dry
to the point of their death.

438
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,379
Mind your own business.

439
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,589
Stop looking displeased before women.
They can turn you down any minute.

440
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,569
Humans are very sensitive.

441
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,705
Then I will look for another prey.

442
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,309
If it doesn't move my heart,
whatever I take

443
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,305
just disgusts me.

444
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,579
What's your plan?

445
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,875
What are you waiting for?

446
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,969
Say something.

447
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,919
I'm 200 years younger than you,
and I managed to turn into a human first.

448
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,149
Don't you have any questions?

449
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,389
"How did you become a human?"

450
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,409
"Did you change while sleeping or eating?"

451
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,699
"How blue was the Marble?"

452
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,819
"Was it deep blue or light blue?
Or was it a blue gradient?

453
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,079
"Please tell me."
Go down on your knees

454
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,369
and ask me.

455
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,175
You're very boisterous.

456
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,085
"Boisterous"?

457
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,029
Back in Goryeo and Joseon,
I lived in their capital cities,

458
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,415
and even now, I'm a citizen of Seoul,
the capital of Korea.

459
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,445
I only live in the capital cities.

460
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,149
You remember

461
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,925
all the hair sticks and accessories I wore
went out of stock.

462
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,175
Even now in Seoul,

463
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,485
I haven't seen anyone
who is more fashionable than me.

464
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,749
Wait. Was that an idiom as well?

465
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,079
Don't act like idioms are
the only thing you don't know.

466
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,849
You're wholly and largely ignorant.

467
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,039
What?

468
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,765
Why don't we finish
this conversation here?

469
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,609
I'll be having a visitor soon.

470
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,975
A visitor? Who?

471
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,155
So what does "boisterous" mean?

472
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,695
Hey.

473
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:38,159
It's the Marble
the reason why I'm sick, right?

474
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,705
To be precise,

475
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,395
it's because you met
a man born in the Year of the Tiger.

476
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,545
A man born in the Year of the Tiger?

477
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,595
Tigers are foxes' natural enemies,
so we are vulnerable to their energy.

478
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,479
And it's worse for me

479
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,875
as I was born in the cursed year
and became the only male gumiho.

480
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,179
[ Men born in the Year of the Tiger are
full of yang, ]

481
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,905
[ so they're my worst enemies. ]

482
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,455
[ And because you have my Marble, ]

483
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,015
[ you feel pain
when you meet a man born in that year. ]

484
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,829
Does that mean I'll be sick

485
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,995
until the Marble is removed from me?

486
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,295
- What are you doing...
- Only my touch

487
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,365
can kill the pain.

488
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,515
That's ridiculous...

Why do I have so many things to pack?

493
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:39,469
So you're going to be preparing
for a contest,

crashing at your friend's place?

Yes. If we win the prize,
it will help us get a job.

What contest is it?

497
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,875
It's about a historical
and cultural context.

498
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,725
You don't know what it is.

499
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,305
I can look it up.

500
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,159
It's official yet.

501
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,445
I think.

502
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,419
Right. My sleep mask.

503
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,095
Did you tell Mom about it?

504
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,735
Why don't you call her?
It must be morning in the US now.

Fine...

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,955
would've been my answer
if you weren't so suspicious.

512
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,375
No, I'm not.

513

Why do you roll your eyes like that?

Since when were you so serious
about getting a job?

515
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,785
I mean, you're packing your back

Wait.

such a naughty idea?

521
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,695
Right. I guess it's nonsense.

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,325
Actually, I trust in

Of course. You can overpower

00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,285
Make sure to submit your assignment
by the next week.

700
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:57,275
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

701
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,785
Bye.

702
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,325
Hey, Dam!

703
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,155
You scared me.

704
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,699
Why do you look so down?
Are you still sick?

705
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,019
No, I'm fine now.

706
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,705
That's great.
You're coming with us to the club then.

707
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,459
- Let's go.
- The club?

708
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,269
We're throwing a farewell party for Ji-eun

709
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,889
because she's going to go study abroad.

710
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,129
Right.

711
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,595
I've been so busy these days
I forgot about it.

712
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,849
But I can't be in a crowded place.

713
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:26,839
I can't either.
I'm taking an English exam this weekend.

714
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,049
Still. We are not freshmen anymore
who live like there's no tomorrow.

715
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,899
We've reached the age
where we need to worry

716
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,705
about tomorrow's shame
and frozen shoulders.

717
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,999
For sure.

718
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,379
And you're still wet behind your ears.

719
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,959
- You're coming.
- You're coming.

720
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,589
- You're coming with us.
- You have to.

721
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:43,999
- You're coming.
- Let's go.

722
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,859
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

723
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,759
Fine. Are we going now?

724
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,085
With that on?

725
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,735
- You've got no mercy.
- You've got no conscience.

726
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:57,115
Okay. Let's go.

727
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,699
It's so crowded here.

728
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,295
Look at all the people.

729
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:11,359
Gosh, I'm so excited!

730
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,099
- Oh, my gosh. What happened?
- What happened?

731
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,639
You look so gorgeous!

732
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,759
Where did you get those newest items?

733
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,039
Dam's mother is a fashion magazine editor.

734
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,989
She's in the US, and she sends
her the clothes she used for photoshoots.

735
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,359
Which is why she was once called

736
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,339
a fashionable

737
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,665
alcoholic.

738
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,429
I haven't put on high heels in a while,
and my legs hurt.

739
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,665
Let's go sit inside.

740
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,519
Sit? You're not sitting anywhere.

741
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,415
You're not sitting tonight.

742
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,095
Let's go!

743
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,295
Is this a club
or a subway in the rush hours?

744
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,635
Hey, Dam! I'll go get some vodka.

745
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,355
Hey, wait up!

746
00:54:58,710 --> 00:54:59,945
How old are you?

747
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,545
Why do you talk down to me?
Do you know me?

748
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,659
Why did you touch my body
without asking me?

749
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,405
Do you want to go to the police station
with me and talk it out?

750
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,535
I apologize.

751
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,519
- Here.
- Thank...

752
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,285
I like your style.

753
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,435
Don't take it so seriously.
I'm just messing with you.

754
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,925
Do you want to have a drink with me?

755
00:55:33,184 --> 00:55:34,519
[ The Year of the Tiger. ]

756
00:55:37,183 --> 00:55:39,088
Do you want to have a drink with me?

757
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:42,765
[ The Year of the Tiger. ]

758
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,105
We booked a table over there.

759
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:48,209
Want to come?

760
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,719
Move. Move aside.

761
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,225
Move.

762
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,189
Mr. Shin, you did a great job today.

763
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,975
How about a glass of whiskey
in the lounge?

764
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,235
My gosh.

765
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:28,435
[ The person you have reached is
not available. Please leave a message... ]

766
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:35,205
How much did you drink?

767
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,965
Now I have to hold you.

768
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,655
[ What do I do? ]

769
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,815
[ This is bad. ]

770
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:52,985
[ Hey, my body, please move. ]

771
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,025
Let me take you
to the place I know around here.

772
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:57,735
Is that okay with you?

773
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,185
[ Please. ]

774
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:03,325
[ Please. Somebody help me. ]

775
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,265
Are you okay?

776
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,635
[ Please. ]

777
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,105
[ Please. Somebody help me. ]

778
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,555
I've been looking for you.

779
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,045
Who are you?

780
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:51,455
I'm her friend. I'll take her from here.

781
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,705
How can I believe
if you're her friend or not?

782
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:13,285
Why do you have my friend's phone?

783
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,515
- Because she's my friend.
- Do you know her name?

784
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,045
Hey.

785
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,965
[ I've sober up already, ]

786
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,599
[ but I can't find
the right time to get up. ]

787
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,095
Are you okay?

788
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,665
Do you want me to get you something warm?

789
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,885
If I order a cake, will you eat it?

790
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,245
I'd like a tiramisu.

791
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,185
I want you to rather scold me

792
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:36,429
for going to a club

793
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:39,729
even though I knew being
in a crowded place could be dangerous

794
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:42,509
and making you come a long way

795
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:45,155
from work because of me.

796
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,705
I'm sorry.

797
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,605
It's okay.

798
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:54,705
The Marble is fine, and so are you.

799
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:01,599
But from now on,
I want you to avoid places like that,

800
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,585
for your sake.

801
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:06,715
- Okay. From now on...
- And don't be scared.

802
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:07,809
What?

803
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,745
I know you're scared of me.

804
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:12,999
You're worried
I might harm or threaten you.

805
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,115
I can see that.

806
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,535
- Well...
- I understand.

807
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:21,235
Who wouldn't be scared of a gumiho?

808
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:25,545
But you're not just anyone.

809
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:27,959
You have my Marble,

810
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,085
and you need to be safe
to keep my Marble safe.

811
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:35,485
So I need to protect you at all costs.

812
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,585
So why don't you try
to be less scared of me?

813
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:41,949
It makes me feel bad

814
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:44,205
to see you being on pins and needles.

815
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,335
I'm sorry I've concerned you.

816
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,629
From now on, I'll try
not to be scared of you

817
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:54,455
and not to repeat the same mistake.

818
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,095
- Promise me.
- I promise.

819
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,955
You have to keep your word.

820
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:14,295
I will.

821
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,215
- Excuse me for a second.
- Sure.

822
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,595
Hello?

823
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,365
Yes.

824
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:48,795
I thought he was a scary gumiho
from ghost stories,

825
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,615
but he might be a nice fox
from fairy tales.

826
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:04,195
Okay. Bye.

827
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,975
- Shall we?
- Okay.

828
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,985
The Year of the Tiger.

829
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:33,405
I see.

830
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:40,789
By the way, is the Marble

831
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,305
visible only to you?

832
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,415
Yes.

833
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:47,575
What color is it?

834
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:51,845
- It's red.
- Red. I see.

835
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,055
Do you think you can take it out?

836
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,549
I will try.

837
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:01,165
A human cannot hold
the Marble for long anyway.

838
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,115
How long can a human hold it then?

839
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,979
A year, at most.

840
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,229
That means after one year of holding it,

841
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:12,385
it will be sorted out somehow.

842
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,525
Doesn't it?

843
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:34,655
Then what happens
if it's not taken out within a year?

844
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:38,745
You will die.

845
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:41,205
What?

846
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:43,585
Miss Dam.

847
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,185
