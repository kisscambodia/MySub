00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,580
One second.

3
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,450
Well, I...

4
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,500
It's not that I hate it,
I'm a little flustered.

5
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,130
Sir.

6
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,509
I'm sorry, Miss Dam.

7
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,850
There's no need to apologize.

8
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,150
It's just that

9
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,080
you're moving a little too fast,
so I'm about to feel motion sickness.

10
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,960
I have to be in a class,
so please excuse me.

11
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,270
[What? You felt hungry again?]

12
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,040
[Episode 10]

13
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,480
I don't know why this is happening.

14
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,560
This has never happened

15
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,340
over centuries of my life.

16
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,680
Like I said before,
you'll have to walk a fine line

17
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,820
between your affection and hunger
when a gumiho loves a human.

18
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,850
And your 1,000 years are about to expire,

19
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,670
so your instincts
would crave her energy even more.

20
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,720
But still, don't worry.

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,090
You have the Marble.
What's there to worry about?

22
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,560
We give them the Marble,

23
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,500
let them fill it up with energy,
then have it returned to us.

24
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,790
That's the rule the mountain spirit made.

25
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,520
I mean that you shouldn't worry
because your instincts perked up

26
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,320
only due to your lack of energy.

27
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,840
But I still exposed Miss Dam
to a bit of danger.

28
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,960
This is unacceptable.

29
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,390
Do you want me to tell you a solution?

30
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,780
Stay away from touching her.

31

32

What do you think?
Doesn't it sound like a good idea?

36
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,890
Right. I shouldn't ask you
to do something that I can't.

37
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,420
Then is there anything else you can do?

38
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,079
What a long day.

39
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,240
What is this?

40
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,050
Why do I suddenly feel so conscious?

41
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,990
That wasn't the first time.

42
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,880
Wait, then does this mean
that time doesn't count?

43
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,030
Then was that my first kiss?

44
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,390
Dam, I'm home.

45
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,590
-My gosh.
-What's with her?

46
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,360
Is she hungry?

47
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,800
My lord, have you heard that rumor?

48
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,150
What rumor?

49
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,090
That a wicked monster
who leeches on people's energy

50
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,030
was seen in the city.

51
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,120
But the monster is unbelievably beautiful,

52
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,860
so there is no one
who wasn't bewitched by it.

53
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,680
Is that so?

54
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,100
Once you run into this monster,

55
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,340
you lose your liver, gallbladder,
and everything,

56
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,070
then get your energy drained to death.

57
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,620
Isn't that horrendous?

58
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:15,320
I'm sure that's just a rumor
made up by gossipers.

59
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,190
That must be the case, right?

60
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,010
Then

61
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,110
shall we blow out the candles, sir?

62
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,810
What was that?

63
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,640
[No matter how low in energy I was,]

64
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,700

hasn't happened before.]

I had to leave in a hurry yesterday.]

72
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,800
It looked so good.

73
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,460
Yes, it's natural for couples to do that.

74
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,750
I need to get used to this.

75
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,310
I'll quickly grow into someone
who enjoys physical contact.

-Sir.
-Did I keep you waiting?

78
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,130
No, I didn't wait for too long.

79
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,740
This place is famous for their coffee.
Let's go inside.

80
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,780
Wait for me, sir.

81
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,350
-He so stylish.
-He's so handsome.

82
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,470
-Who is that?
-Is he a model or what?

83
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,700

84
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,570
I got you Caffe Mocha.

85
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,350
Looks great.

86
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,900
You got cream on your lips.

87
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,450
-Where?
-Right here.

88
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,790
You should wipe it with this.

89
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,970
No way. It looks like
only the girl has a crush on him.

90
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,440
Yes, or he might be
bored with their relationship.

91
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,160
[Bored? This is our fourth day together.]

92
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,710
[And it's not a crush.
We like each other.]

93

first kiss yesterday...]

94

What should we do after coffee?

95
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,170
There was something I wanted to do.

96
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,300
Why are we at an arcade?

97
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,130
I used to come often before,
so I thought it'd be fun to come with you.

98
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,340
-Why? You don't like it?
-I do. I love it.

99

all my time shooting guns.]

-Okay.
-Sure.

106
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,830

No, it's...

108
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,330

109

-You're home.
-Hi.

110
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,070
What's with your shirt?
Did you get into a fight?

111
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,740
Why would I fight anyone?

112
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,580
Why are you watching this?

113
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,340
Why do you care?

114
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,410
I'm 18, so I can watch a 15 rated drama.

No, even someone from Joseon

117
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,050
would call you old-fashioned.

118
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,500
What? I'm not old-fashioned.

119
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,870
Wait.

he was trying to keep his distance?

[There seems to be a misunderstanding
between us, so I send you a message.]

178
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,170
[Everything I said and did two days ago]

179
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,770
[didn't mean that
I don't want you to touch me.]

180
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,190
[Actually, it was wonderful.]

181
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,700
[I was just a little flustered
because it was my first time.]

182
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,220
[I felt like a baby
who just learned to walk]

183
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,080
[doing a windmill all of a sudden.]

184
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,430
[But now I'm all ready for this.]

185
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,560
[I'm willing to races at your speed
on the highway or wherever else.]

186
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,760
[Miss Dam]

187
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:19,240
[Professor of History, Shin Woo-yeo]

188
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,100
You're buying today.
I bought you this last time.

189
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,660
If he read my message
why won't he respond?

190
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,150
You

191
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,710
dropped this.

192
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,360
Thank you.

193
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,850
How did you know this was mine?

194
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,810
I've been watching you.

195
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,750
What's he saying? Why was he watching me?

196
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,150
So you sold the laptop?

197
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,480
Yes, it was sold in five minutes
as soon as I posted it.

198
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,940
-I wouldn't even take it for free.
-It's not for you anyway.

199
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,200
Hey, do you remember everyone
who went on the history trip?

200
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,050
I keep running into him,
but I can't remember.

201
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,050
He's a guy, a little taller than me,

202
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,850
-and has monolid eyes.
-Monolids?

203
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,770
Oh, that guy. I know him.

204
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,010
His name is...

205
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,870
Do Jae-jin.

206
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,910
He's taller than you, has monolid eyes.

207
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,670
No, not him.

208
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,190
[History 101 is canceled
due to Mr. Shin's personal circumstances.]

209
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,370
What?

210
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,210
History 101 lecture is canceled.

211
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,490
What? Why?

212
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,820
Professor Shin's personal reasons.

213
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,120
I hope nothing bad happened
to Professor Shin.

214
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,850
His lectures are as fascinating
as his facial features,

215
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,490
so he wouldn't cancel a lecture
over something petty.

216
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,870
She's so worried
as if she's his girlfriend.

217
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,920
Right?

218
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,370
Yes, you're right.

219
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,650
[Professor Shin Woo-yeo]

220
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,360
[Professor of History, Shin Woo-yeo]

221
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,770
Sir.

222
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,240
I'm here.

223
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,790
Sir! Sir, are you not feeling well?

224
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,970
Sir! Oh no.

225
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,590
Sir.

226
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,600
Are you all right?

227
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,890
Sir.

228
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,560
Sir.

229
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,550
[Professor of History, Shin Woo-yeo]

230
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,220
-Are you all right?
-Miss Dam.

231
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,360
You might want to leave for a second.

232
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,860
Sorry?

233
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,520
Yes, you should probably do that.

234
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,760
Hye-sun.

235
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,320
-Let's go.
-Wait, I... Hey.

236
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,040
[I'm sorry.
I'll explain everything later.]

237
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,240
[Sir]

238
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,900
You must be startled. Drink this.

239
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,480
Thanks.

240
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,880
I heard that

241
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,310
you're a gumiho too.

242
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,950
I heard it from my sir.

243
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,360
"Sir"?

244
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,360
Is that what you call Woo-yeo? "Sir"?

245
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,780
-Yes.
-My gosh.

246
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,610
Woo-yeo finally met his match.

247
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,100
You're a funny girl.

248
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,210
Anyway, what's going on?

249
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,200
Something seemed serious.

250
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,560
You know what's happening, right?

251
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,650
I'm not sure.

252
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,170
Even if I explained it to you,
would a human like you understand?

253
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,580
But what I do know is that
you don't even know half of who he is

254
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,610
or what we're like.

255
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,140
[I'm going to be a human
as soon as I can.]

256
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,120
Why are you in such a hurry?

257
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,810
Because I want to live a different life.

258
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,470
A cold-hearted guy like you
who's made of ice won't understand.

259
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,350
Please erase my memories.
Please, I ask of you.

260
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,460
[One day, there will come a moment]

261
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,560
[when you can't stand
that you're actually a fox.]

262
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,860
Why don't you try getting energy
from other women?

263
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,540
Then she won't have to see you
as a threat,

264
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,270
and if you get lucky,
you may become a human too.

265
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,050
If the result is great,
who cares about the process?

266
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,840
Well, there's no way
an upright man like you would do that.

267
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,570
Then try doing something as I suggested.

268
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,520
-Try stuffing yourself to quench...
-I tried.

269
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,070
What?

270
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,670
I tried everything I can.

271
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,160
Really?

272
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,890
Yet you couldn't control yourself?

273
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,720
I don't get it.

274
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,940
Could it be

275
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,420
because of that?

276
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,190
Because of what?

277
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,660
If it's because of that,
then I wouldn't be too worried.

278
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,700
You know.

279
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,100
Sexual desire.

280
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,370
I think there's definitely a chance.

281
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,550
I recently saw a movie
where the male lead was in your spot.

282
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,780
He couldn't restrain himself,

283
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,380
so he'd get up in the middle of a meal
and wipe out the table...

284
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,700
That's enough.

285
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,680
It's not that I can't restrain myself.

286
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,760
I can't control myself.

287
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,930
And what's more important is

288
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,380
the Marble is somehow gathering energy.

289
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,700
What? How does that make any sense?

290
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,360
-Sir.
-Miss Dam.

291
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,700
You might want to leave for a second.

292
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,720
[Sir]

293
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,530
Sir!

294
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,580
Why did you call...

295
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,000
Forget that. Are you all right?

296
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,740
-Miss Dam.
-Yes?

297
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,330
Could we

298
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,390
keep our distance for a while?

299
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,070
We just started to go out.
Why would we do that?

300
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,960
Stay right there. I'm coming.

301
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,280
Just for a short while,

302
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,230
until I find a way.

303
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,170
A way?

304
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,290
Miss Dam.

305
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,690
You thought I'd become a human right away

306
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,170
once I take the Marble back, right?

307
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,390
So didn't you wonder

308
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,160
why everything seemed to be the same?

309
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,890
Yes, I was dying to know.

310
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,320
But I thought you had a reason
for not telling me.

311
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,590
I don't have enough energy yet.

312
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,930
That's why

313
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,660
I continue to crave for more

314
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,790
against my will.

315
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,290
But isn't it all right
since you have the Marble?

316
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,780
[What if it isn't?]

317
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,470
What if something goes wrong?

318
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,020
If I take more energy from you,
you might fall in danger, Miss Dam.

319
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,270
So let's keep our distance for a while

320
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,350
until I find a way.

321
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,350
I know how smart you are,

322
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,840
so I'm sure you understood everything.

323
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,010
We have lots to discuss,
so let's get started.

324
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,730
I'm thinking of donating proceeds

325
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,500
from our school festival
to a cultural asset protection group.

326
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,570
I'm not sure. It all sounds great,

327
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,430
but are we going to make that much
from opening a pub like everyone else?

328
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,680
I was wondering if you had any other ideas
other than opening a pub.

329
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,980
How about doing tarot card readings
or having your fortune read?

330
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,270
-Economics is doing that.
-Really?

331
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,480
Just do a free hug campaign for 500 won.

332
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,430
If they have to pay, it's not free.
It's a paid-hugs campaign.

333
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,930
Don't be so uptight.

334
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,910
We can leave a box,

335
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,200
and ask people to donate
as much as they want.

336
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,500
So who would pay money for a hug?

337
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,480
It's not like we have somebody big.

338
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,530
Hey, people would pay.
They'd pay to do this.

339
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,290
We'll empty out everyone's pockets.

340
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,830
I'd give up my tuition for him.

341
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,650
-What's going on?
-You've just been sold.

342
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,290
You're our free hug guy at the festival.

343
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm not doing it.

344
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,270
He's right. He's not in the student body,
so we can't force him.

345
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,820
-Why not?
-You totally killed this.

346
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,300
-Hey.
-Then what about Dam?

347
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,380
She can do this for coming late.

348
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,360
You do the free hugs campaign.

349
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,740
-The free hugs campaign?
-Yes.

350
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,950
You were late, and we already chose
what we're going to do.

351
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,160
-You don't have a job yet.

So tell me. How did you meet him?

I want the whole story.
Do you have a photo of him?

Come on. I said I should go home.

00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,400
No, I want to drink more.

703
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:48,080
If you're busy, just go.

704
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:50,370
I will take him home today.

705
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,570
Are you sure? He's horrible with alcohol.

706
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,870
I know he is.

707
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:59,480
I owe him a bit,

708
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,510
so I'll take care of him today.

709
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,590
Then please take care of him.
Thanks, Hye-sun.

710
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:10,120
What a disloyal friend she is.

711
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,260
Seriously, Hye-sun. Can you believe it?

712
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,280
How could she have secrets from us?

713
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:18,660
We are not just anybody, are we?

714
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,710
This is why they say
the axe you trust stabs you in the back.

715
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,030
"The axe you trust stabs you in the back"?

716
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,510
Well, it doesn't mean

717
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,050
you actually get stabbed by an axe.

718
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:37,140
I know. It means you get betrayed
by someone you trusted.

719
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,790
It was written in the second chapter
of the book you got me.

720
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,740
You read the book?

721
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,470
I'm so proud of you, Hye-sun.

722
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,370
Well done.

723
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:54,030
Well done.

724
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,500
Well done.

725
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:58,390
What are you doing?

726
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:01,430
You're still wet behind the ears.

727
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,690
I'll keep drinking then.

728
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:17,660
Dam.

729
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,670
Are you going home? I'll take you home.

730
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:31,920
You're not taking me anywhere.
You're almost crawling.

731
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:56,380
You drove here, right?
Do you want me to call you a chauffeur?

732
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,190
No.

733
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,610
I'll walk home.

734
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,480
You can't walk to Seocho-dong.

735
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,140
You remember where I live.

736
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:15,350
You're drunk. You should go inside,

737
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,800
sober up, and...

738
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,520
It's a free hug. It's free for you.

739
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,800
[We appreciate Go Kyung-pyo and
Lee Kyu-sung for the guest appearances.]

740
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:44,000
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

741
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,290
[Can I come to your place?
It's been a while.]

742
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,580
[Don't worry about touching.]

743
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,780
[I'm just worried
I might take your energy...]

744
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,900
[When I woke up,
I was half-naked in a hotel.]

745
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:54,960
Are you crazy?

746
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,470
[To get close to you, Miss Dam,]

747
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,320
I have to think through a lot of things.

748
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,080
[But it seemed too easy for him.]

749
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,890
[When the red thread of fate
ties two people together,]

750
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:06,840
[they end up growing feelings
for each other.]

751
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,950
[Don't make me jealous.]

752
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,370
[My boyfriend, whom I really like a lot.]

753
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,040
Dam!
