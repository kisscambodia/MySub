[ Sir, good morning. ]

177
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,635
[ There seems to be a misunderstanding
between us, so I send you a message. ]

178
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,315
[ Everything I said and did two days ago ]

179
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,915
[ didn't mean that
I don't want you to touch me. ]

180
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,335
[ Actually, it was wonderful. ]

181
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,845
[ I was just a little flustered
because it was my first time. ]

182
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,365
[ I felt like a baby
who just learned to walk ]

183
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,225
[ doing a windmill all of a sudden. ]

184
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,575
[ But now I'm all ready for this. ]

185
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,705
[ I'm willing to races at your speed
on the highway or wherever else. ]

186
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,905
[ Miss Dam ]

187
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:19,385
[ Professor of History, Shin Woo-yeo ]

188
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,245
You're buying today.
I bought you this last time.

189
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,805
If he read my message
why won't he respond?

190
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,295
You

191
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,855
dropped this.

192
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,505
Thank you.

193
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,995
How did you know this was mine?

194
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,955
I've been watching you.

195
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,895
What's he saying? Why was he watching me?

196
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,279
So you sold the laptop?

197
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,619
Yes, it was sold in five minutes
as soon as I posted it.

198
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,085
- I wouldn't even take it for free.
- It's not for you anyway.

199
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,339
Hey, do you remember everyone
who went on the history trip?

200
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,195
I keep running into him,
but I can't remember.

201
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,195
He's a guy, a little taller than me,

202
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,995
- and has monolid eyes.
- Monolids?

203
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,915
Oh, that guy. I know him.

204
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,155
His name is...

205
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,015
Do Jae-jin.

206
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,049
He's taller than you, has monolid eyes.

207
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,815
No, not him.

208
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,240
[ History 101 is canceled
due to Mr. Shin's personal circumstances. ]

209
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,515
What?

210
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,349
History 101 lecture is canceled.

211
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,635
What? Why?

212
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,965
Professor Shin's personal reasons.

213
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,259
I hope nothing bad happened
to Professor Shin.

214
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,989
His lectures are as fascinating
as his facial features,

215
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,635
so he wouldn't cancel a lecture
over something petty.

216
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,999
She's so worried
as if she's his girlfriend.

217
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,059
Right?

218
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,515
Yes, you're right.

219
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,795
[ Professor Shin Woo-yeo ]

220
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,505
[ Professor of History, Shin Woo-yeo ]

221
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,915
Sir.

222
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,385
I'm here.

223
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,935
Sir! Sir, are you not feeling well?

224
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,115
Sir! Oh no.

225
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,735
Sir.

226
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,745
Are you all right?

227
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,035
Sir.

228
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,705
Sir.

229
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,235
Sir.

230
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,695
Are you all right?

231
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,985
Sir.

232
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,655
Sir.

233
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,639
[ Professor of History, Shin Woo-yeo ]

234
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,315
- Are you all right?
- Miss Dam.

235
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,455
You might want to leave for a second.

236
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,955
Sorry?

237
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,615
Yes, you should probably do that.

238
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,855
Hye-sun.

239
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,415
- Let's go.
- Wait, I... Hey.

240
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,040
[ I'm sorry.
I'll explain everything later. ]

241
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,335
[ Sir ]

242
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,979
You must be startled. Drink this.

243
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,575
Thanks.

244
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,975
I heard that

245
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,405
you're a gumiho too.

246
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,045
I heard it from my sir.

247
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,455
"Sir"?

248
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,455
Is that what you call Woo-yeo? "Sir"?

249
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,875
- Yes.
- My gosh.

250
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,699
Woo-yeo finally met his match.

251
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,195
You're a funny girl.

252
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,305
Anyway, what's going on?

253
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,295
Something seemed serious.

254
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,655
You know what's happening, right?

255
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,745
I'm not sure.

256
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,265
Even if I explained it to you,
would a human like you understand?

257
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,669
But what I do know is that
you don't even know half of who he is

258
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,705
or what we're like.

259
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,235
[ I'm going to be a human
as soon as I can. ]

260
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,215
Why are you in such a hurry?

261
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,905
Because I want to live a different life.

262
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,565
A cold-hearted guy like you
who's made of ice won't understand.

263
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,429
Please erase my memories.
Please, I ask of you.

264
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,555
[ One day, there will come a moment ]

265
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,655
[ when you can't stand
that you're actually a fox. ]

266
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,955
Why don't you try getting energy
from other women?

267
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,629
Then she won't have to see you
as a threat,

268
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,365
and if you get lucky,
you may become a human too.

269
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,145
If the result is great,
who cares about the process?

270
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,935
Well, there's no way
an upright man like you would do that.

271
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,659
Then try doing something as I suggested.

272
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,615
- Try stuffing yourself to quench...
- I tried.

273
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,165
What?

274
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,765
I tried everything I can.

275
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,255
Really?

276
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,985
Yet you couldn't control yourself?

277
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,815
I don't get it.

278
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,035
Could it be

279
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,515
because of that?

280
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,285
Because of what?

281
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,755
If it's because of that,
then I wouldn't be too worried.

282
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,795
You know.

283
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,195
Sexual desire.

284
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,465
I think there's definitely a chance.

285
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,639
I recently saw a movie
where the male lead was in your spot.

286
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,869
He couldn't restrain himself,

287
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,469
so he'd get up in the middle of a meal
and wipe out the table...

288
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,795
That's enough.

289
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,775
It's not that I can't restrain myself.

290
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,855
I can't control myself.

291
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,025
And what's more important is

292
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,475
the Marble is somehow gathering energy.

293
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,795
What? How does that make any sense?

294
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,455
- Sir.
- Miss Dam.

295
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,795
You might want to leave for a second.

296
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,815
[ Sir ]

297
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,625
Sir!

298
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,675
Why did you call...

299
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,095
Forget that. Are you all right?

300
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,835
- Miss Dam.
- Yes?

301
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,425
Could we

302
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,469
keep our distance for a while?

303
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,165
We just started to go out.
Why would we do that?

304
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,055
Stay right there. I'm coming.

305
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,375
Just for a short while,

306
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,325
until I find a way.

307
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,265
A way?

308
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,385
Miss Dam.

309
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,785
You thought I'd become a human right away

310
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,265
once I take the Marble back, right?

311
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,485
So didn't you wonder

312
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,255
why everything seemed to be the same?

313
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,985
Yes, I was dying to know.

314
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,415
But I thought you had a reason
for not telling me.

315
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,685
I don't have enough energy yet.

316
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,025
That's why

317
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,755
I continue to crave for more

318
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,885
against my will.

319
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,369
But isn't it all right
since you have the Marble?

320
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,875
[ What if it isn't? ]

321
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,565
What if something goes wrong?

322
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,115
If I take more energy from you,
you might fall in danger, Miss Dam.

323
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,365
So let's keep our distance for a while

324
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,445
until I find a way.

325
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,445
I know how smart you are,

326
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,935
so I'm sure you understood everything.

327
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,099
We have lots to discuss,
so let's get started.

328
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,819
I'm thinking of donating proceeds

329
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,589
from our school festival
to a cultural asset protection group.

330
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,659
I'm not sure. It all sounds great,

331
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,519
but are we going to make that much
from opening a pub like everyone else?

332
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,769
I was wondering if you had any other ideas
other than opening a pub.

333
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,069
How about doing tarot card readings
or having your fortune read?

334
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,365
- Economics is doing that.
- Really?

335
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,569
Just do a free hug campaign for 500 won.

336
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,525
If they have to pay, it's not free.
It's a paid-hugs campaign.

337
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,025
Don't be so uptight.

338
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,999
We can leave a box,

339
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,279
and ask people to donate
as much as they want.

340
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,579
So who would pay money for a hug?

341
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,575
It's not like we have somebody big.

342
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,619
Hey, people would pay.
They'd pay to do this.

343
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,379
We'll empty out everyone's pockets.

344
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,919
I'd give up my tuition for him.

345
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,745
- What's going on?
- You've just been sold.

346
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,385
You're our free hug guy at the festival.

347
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,895
I'm not doing it.

348
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,359
He's right. He's not in the student body,
so we can't force him.

349
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,915
- Why not?
- You totally killed this.

350
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,389
- Hey.
- Then what about Dam?

351
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,475

00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,799
Come on and tell me.
You're really upsetting me.

701
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,305
- Tell me...
- Gosh!

702
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,755
Just eat the meat.

703
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,645
Give me some water.

704
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,305
Seon-woo is drinking so much today.

705
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,725
I haven't seen him so down.

706
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,785
But he looks even more handsome.

707
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,679
- Hey.
- Where are you going?

708
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,065
- Don't go.
- Where are you going?

709
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:51,685
What time is it now?

710
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:35,199
So tell me. How did you meet him?

711
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,309
I want the whole story.
Do you have a photo of him?

712
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,075
Come on. I said I should go home.

713
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,545
No, I want to drink more.

714
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,219
If you're busy, just go.

715
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,509
I will take him home today.

716
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,715
Are you sure? He's horrible with alcohol.

717
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:52,015
I know he is.

718
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,609
I owe him a bit,

719
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:58,655
so I'll take care of him today.

720
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,735
Then please take care of him.
Thanks, Hye-sun.

721
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,265
What a disloyal friend she is.

722
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:10,399
Seriously, Hye-sun. Can you believe it?

723
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,419
How could she have secrets from us?

724
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,805
We are not just anybody, are we?

725
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:18,855
This is why they say
the axe you trust stabs you in the back.

726
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:24,175
"The axe you trust stabs you in the back"?

727
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,649
Well, it doesn't mean

728
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,189
you actually get stabbed by an axe.

729
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:33,285
I know. It means you get betrayed
by someone you trusted.

730
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,935
It was written in the second chapter
of the book you got me.

731
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,885
You read the book?

732
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,615
I'm so proud of you, Hye-sun.

733
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,515
Well done.

734
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:50,169
Well done.

735
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,645
Well done.

736
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,535
What are you doing?

737
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,575
You're still wet behind the ears.

738
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,835
I'll keep drinking then.

739
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,805
Dam.

740
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,815
Are you going home? I'll take you home.

741
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:28,065
You're not taking me anywhere.
You're almost crawling.

742
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,525
You drove here, right?
Do you want me to call you a chauffeur?

743
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:54,335
No.

744
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,755
I'll walk home.

745
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:00,625
You can't walk to Seocho-dong.

746
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,285
You remember where I live.

747
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,479
You're drunk. You should go inside,

748
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,945
sober up, and...

749
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:26,665
It's a free hug. It's free for you.

750
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,945
[ We appreciate Go Kyung-pyo and
Lee Kyu-sung for the guest appearances. ]

751
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,145
[ My Roommate is a Gumiho ]

752
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,435
[ Can I come to your place?
It's been a while. ]

753
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,719
[ Don't worry about touching. ]

754
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,925
[ I'm just worried
I might take your energy... ]

755
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,039
[ When I woke up,
I was half-naked in a hotel. ]

756
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,099
Are you crazy?

757
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,609
[ To get close to you, Miss Dam, ]

758
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:55,449
I have to think through a lot of things.

759
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:57,209
[ But it seemed too easy for him. ]

760
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:00,029
[ When the red thread of fate
ties two people together, ]

761
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,985
[ they end up growing feelings
for each other. ]

762
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,095
[ Don't make me jealous. ]

763
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:07,515
[ My boyfriend, whom I really like a lot. ]

764
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:09,185
Dam!
