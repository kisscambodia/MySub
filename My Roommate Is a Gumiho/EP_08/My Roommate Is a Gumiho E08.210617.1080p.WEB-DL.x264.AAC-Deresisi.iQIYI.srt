-Hi.
-Hi. Doing okay?

-You're going this early?
-Yes.

to the first period after midterms.

66

do you just want to say
we did it and write the report?

67
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,070
Can we do that?

68
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,120
Yes, if we get the story straight
out of our lips.

69
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,730
We have to make a story through our lips?

70
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,310
Yes, something like that.

Wait, why do we have to do that
over some assignment?

72
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,290
Well.

73
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,990
You have to do it well to get good grades,

74
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,440
then it'll be easy to find a job...

75
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,640
Does it even affect your job search?

76
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,640
All right. I hear getting a job is
the biggest priority for kids these days.

77
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,240
If it's that necessary, then fine.

78
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,540
Let's do it.

79
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,560

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,510
Hey, what are you doing?
Are you crazy? Let me go.

81
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,350
Let me go. What's with you?

82

-Let me go.

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,170
What are you doing? Have you gone insane?

85
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,020
How can you strangle my neck

86
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,780
as if you're killing a chicken?

87
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,590
Why did you...

88
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,100
[Right, she isn't good at Korean
because she lived abroad.]

89
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,540
Hye-sun, listen up.

90
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,690
There is this thing
called a figure of speech.

91
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,800
When we say "take out our hands and feet,"

92
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,650
it doesn't mean we use our feet.

93
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,330
It means we should do
everything we can to help.

94
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,110
And "get the story straight
out of our lips" means

95
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,170
we come up with a story

96
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,080
and run with the same story
as we make up stuff.

97
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,150
Are you trying to teach me?

98
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,820
-No.
-I'm not that stupid.

99
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,760
I even memorized 1,000 Chinese characters.

100
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,970
I may not have finished Lesser Learning,
but I got into the collegiate system.

101
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,920
Do you think I didn't know?

102
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,340
[Wait, does she think]

103
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,760
[the book Lesser Learning is
related to college?]

104
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,260
[She's a pretty funny girl.]

105
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,080
I'll see you on Saturday.
Instead of using our lips...

106
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,300
I mean, instead of coming up with a story,

107
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,840
let's just meet up.

108
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,700
I get it. You need to go.

109
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,900
All right. See you on Saturday.

110
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,460
[She wouldn't tell me
why she's crying even if I asked.]

111
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,840
[I can't believe
I'm happy to see her in this situation.]

112
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,260
Hey, what's going on?

113
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,770
Why is she crying next to that Tiger boy?

114
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,580
Wait.

115
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,940
Please excuse me.
You should get to class too.

116
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,020
Hey, wait.
Do you want to meet this weekend?

117
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,430
I mean, that's not what I meant.

118
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,170
I mean, well, it is.

119
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,480
We have to do the assignment.
Don't you want to do it?

120
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,090
I don't want to.

121
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,260
Sir, I'm home.

122
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,780
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

123
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,140
You took the Marble out, didn't you?

124
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,480
I could tell by the way she looks.

125
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,660
Did you see her?

126
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,980
So what if I did?

127
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,640
Why do you care?
You won't be seeing her again.

128
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,920
If you've decided

129
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,260
to strain every drop of energy
from a stranger,

130
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,280
you should've stayed away
from getting attached.

131
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,560
And if you've let her go,

132
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
you need to brace yourself
and find the next target.

133
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,190
You don't have time to lose
looking miserable,

134
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,510
and that goes for both of you.

135
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,620
Both of us?

136
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,080
She was crying.

137
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,760
She was? Why?

138
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,520
Why do you ask?

139
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,500
I'm sure it's because of you.

140
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,000
That's impossible.

141
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,640
I erased everything about me
from her memories.

142
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,650
I'm not sure if you're sweet or cruel.

143
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,880
Are you sure your magic worked?

144
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,000
You said it didn't work on her mom.

145
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,550
I'm sure no one will remember a thing.

146
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,920
That girl

147
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,430
and everyone else who saw me.

148
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,320
Please keep an eye on her
and see if she does all right

149
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,900
and stays healthy.

150
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,510
You said you wanted me to keep her safe,

151
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,180
not to pry on her private life.

152
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,600
She's safe now.

153
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,270
From whom?

154
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,250
From me.

155
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,850
So now you're worried
about her private life

156
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,410
instead of her safety?

157
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,340
I thought of her like my family.

158
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,360
Please do that for me.

159
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,280
No, if you want to see her,
you can see her in person.

160
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,940
She won't even recognize you.
What's the problem?

161
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,660
Family, my foot.

162
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,130
No guy makes a face like that
to a girl he thinks of like family.

163
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,920
[What about my face?]

164
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,000
How can I put this?

165
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,090
I mean, you've been smiling,

166
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,070
but you look like you're empty inside.

167
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,260
Whatever.

168
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,280
Are you sure everything is okay?

169
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,040
I'm fine.

170
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,430
[I lied.]

171
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,250
I knew how to take out the Marble

172
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,980
from the beginning.

173
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,070
But I lied to you.

174
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,960
I needed energy to become human,

175
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,750
and you happened to be there.

176
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,160
[Yes, I was just a consumable human]

177
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,990
[who was there to give him my energy.]

178
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,010
[So this is enough.]

179
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,800
[The least I can do is celebrate.
Why am I crying?]

180
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,100
Soo-kyung, are you free today?

181
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,370
Today?

182
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,450
I don't have a lesson at my academy.

183
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,710
And my phone English lesson
isn't today either.

184
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,000
Let's call Jae-jin
and party until the morning.

185
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,270
Midterms are over too.

186
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm going to do everything
I couldn't do for a while.

187
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,340
That feels much better.

188
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,040
Chicken and beer
beat any kind of relationship.

189
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,250
Tipsy and delicious,

190
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,890
yet delicious and tipsy.

191
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,560
-I missed this so much.
-Right.

192
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,160
You didn't have to miss it.

193
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,270
You did this every other day.

194
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,530
Tell me about it. Some might think
she hasn't done this for months.

195
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,250
Excuse me, we'll take
one more garlic chicken

196
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,930
and another 3,000cc beer pitcher.

197
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,690
-Sure.
-You're eating more?

198
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,890
Are you going to stop eating chicken
after today?

199
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,000
I know our midterms are over,

200
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,200
but I need to recap
today's lecture and study.

201
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,890
Stop eating. Let's go.

202
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,480
Hey, go where?

203
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,030
My curfew is lifted.
We have to party harder.

204
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,530
You had a curfew?

205
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,690
-I didn't know Dan was that strict.
-Right?

206
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,130
I don't have to avoid them anymore.

207
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,450
-What?
-What?

208
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,280
My life is filled with happiness,

209
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,820
and it's killing me.

210
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,800
Hey, let's go to a karaoke room.

211
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,910
Karaoke sounds great.

212
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,730
It's time to bust out
Jae-jin's sentimental songs again.

213
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,670
-Hey.
-Fine.

214
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,700
Hey, I don't want
any of these drowsy slow songs.

215
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,420
Only dance songs.

216
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,190
Dance, dance!

217
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,180
Why is Dam so hyper today?
She's scaring me.

218
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,410
I'm not sure.

219
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,700
She said that she feels lighthearted.

220
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,640
Is it because tests are over?

221
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,480
I don't think she studied so hard

222
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,120
for her to feel that lighthearted.

223
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,940
We have a minute left. Let's go.

224
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,720
Let's not sing a long song
and mope over the time we lost,

225
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,650
-but let's go home with some class.
-Start.

226
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,000
["Apartment"]

227
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,260
What's with this song?
Did her taste in music change?

228
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,610
Well, I guess trot music is
really big these days.

229
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:40,490
[Seoul]

230
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,210
Now that he took out the Marble,
did he become a human

231
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,030
with the energy I gave him?

232
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,780
Goodness, I don't even care.

233
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,120
But why am I here again?

234
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,940
Old habits die hard.

235
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,180
[She was crying.]

236
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,150
You either sleep late
or suffer from a hangover.

237
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,430
Eat up. It's ox blood hangover soup.

238
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,150
Can you make me bean sprout soup
or dried pollack soup next time?

239
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,350
I don't want to see any blood for a while.

240
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,310
You're very hasty.
I was just asking you to consider that.

241
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,170
[Do you feel better now?]

242
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,070
[Let's go eat something
to help you feel better.]

243
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,360
[Let's meet up even if you don't want to.]

244
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,060
[I know it sounds weird,
but just think of this as an assignment.]

245
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,560
[Just think of this as an assignment.]

246
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,880
[Lee Dam]

247
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,960
What are you up to?
Why are you staring at...

248
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,910
My gosh, you were
getting clingy to a girl?

249
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,640
Are you crazy? Give it back.

250
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,460
No, I won't. Why would I
give back something this hilarious?

251
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,820
Darn it, give it back.

252
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,070
You weren't turned down just once,
but continuously over and over again.

253
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,460
I can't believe you're in this situation
despite your looks.

254
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,660
This is the power of one's personality!

255
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,480
Hey, I'm going to kill you, okay?

256
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,910
[Lee Dam]

257
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,430
-What?
-I sent that message.

258
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,470
You've been turned down anyway,
so keep trying and leave no regrets.

259
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,560
Get turned down 100 times, 101 times,
it's the same.

260
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,410
-Hey.
-Boo-ya.

261
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,690
-Darn it, that brat.
-Gosh.

262
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,190
[Gye Seon-woo,
Let's meet up even if you don't want to.]

263
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,850
Why? Who is it?

264
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,370
-Just a senior at school.
-It doesn't look like he's just a senior.

265
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,010
He's interested in you.

266
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,730
I guess he's not into looks.

267
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,490
You psycho.

268
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,550
[Gye Seon-woo]

269
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,500
Man, he's unbelievably good-looking.
What happened?

270
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,870
Stop talking nonsense.

271
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,900
It's not like that.
He just contacted me for an assignment...

272
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,720
-What are you doing?
-Replying.

273
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,260
-Give me back.
-Give me a moment.

274
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,620
Give it to me now.

275
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,470
-Hey.
-What assignment? He's into you.

276
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,270
Give it back, you psycho.

00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,170
-Darn it.
-Here.

[I'd love to meet you anytime.]

279
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,850
Hey, it's on.

280
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,350
He's 100 percent into you.

281
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,460
I'm going to kill you!

282
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,910
Wash your hair before you go!

I bid you good luck
with your first boyfriend. You got this.

284

Don't you dare lay a hand on me.

290
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,500
I'll use this hair iron
to straighten your twisted mind.

291

Look at this.

[Lee Dam, I'd love to meet you anytime.]

293

00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,520
[I'll call you.]

295
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,840

[No, don't cry.]

299
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,120
[You were just turned down harshly.]

[You had a crush on him,
had expectations that couldn't be met,]

301
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,490
[then got turned down.]

302
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,540
-My gosh.
-It wasn't supposed to rain today.

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,980
I'll share with you
until your destination.

309
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,040
I'm headed
to the Department of Humanities.

310

[If he ended everything
without making an excuse,]

313
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:15,130
[it means he was
never going to see me again.]

[In the end,]

315
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,560
[that's how little I meant in his life,]

Excuse me.

Was that a sun shower?

330
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,040
It was sunny, then it suddenly rained.

-Let's go.
-Okay.

perhaps a privilege.]

Professor Jung recently took a leave
because of his health,

Why? Are you worried?

00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,720
Well, in my case, it doesn't matter
who the new guy is.

What's wrong?

347
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,610
Our grades aren't in, so I doubt
you're worried about repeating this class.

348
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,810
Well,

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,330
Jin-ah has been in contact for a few days.

Why won't you even hear me out?

351
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,840
I mean, she keeps texting me
late at night asking if I'm asleep.

352
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,260
Then she sends old pictures
and asks if I remember.

353
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,850
She wants to meet, so what do I do?

354
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,880
What do you think? She's bored,

355
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,730
so she wants to lead you on.

356
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,670
Just ignore her.
You don't have to be shaken.

357
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,230
-She's not like that.
-Whatever. Be quiet.

358
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,630
-Hey, are you serious?
-Yes, he's going to be here.

359
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,060
-Hey, let's sit in the very front.
-Stop that.

360
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,380
Hey, Yu-ri.

361
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,650
What's going on here?

362
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,100
It's the new professor.

363
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,130
I just saw him, and he's amazing.

364
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,980
Why? How amazing is he?

365
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,250
It's none of your business.

366
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,750
-Look.
-My gosh.

367
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,570
He looks like an actor.

368
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,500
He's really hot.

369
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,900
[Seogwa University]

370
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,610
[Seogwa University]

371
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,260
-Gosh, he's so hot.
-Who is that?

372
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,940
I'm sorry I ran in late on my first day.

373
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,400
-Don't say that.
-It's okay.

374
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,080
-Don't say that.
-Right.

375
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,140
Dam, I'm thinking of retaking this lecture
for the first time in my life.

376
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,960
No, I'll re, re, re, re,
retake this lecture.

377
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,840
[Why is he here right now?]

378
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,850
[If he can use magic,
is he not a human yet? Wait, no.]

379
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,270
[That's not what's important.]

380
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,120
Then let me call attendance first.

381
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,570
-Okay.
-Yes.

382
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,070
-Jeon Da-young?
-Yes.

383
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,210
Seo Jin.

384
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,020
-Yes.
-Gye Seon-woo.

385
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,740
-Yes.
[-What on earth is going on?]

386
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,420
-Choi Soo-kyung.
-Yes!

387
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,090
-Yes.
[-Is it because of me?]

388
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,730
[Is he here to keep an eye on me?]

389
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,420
Lee Dam.

390
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,540
Yes.

391
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,970
[Is he doing this to keep an eye on me?]

392
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,700
As you have been probably informed,

393
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,740
I'm going to be teaching History 101
starting today.

394
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,870
Then

395
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,990
let's start from page 178.

396
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,390
-Yes, Professor.
-Yes, Professor.

397
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,700
I've got to hurry to the next class. Bye.

398
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,980
Bye.

399
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,370
Professor.

400
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,610
Thanks for the lecture.

401
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,490
Hey, Dam. Beef tripe after school?

402
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,670
I have no money.

403
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,700
It's on me. I got my allowance.

404
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,410
-Stop annoying me.
-Come on.

405
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,040
-Go away.
-Come on.

406
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,820
[Professor of History, Shin Woo-yeo]

407
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,120
I'm just watching her for a while.

408
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,980
Just for a while.

409
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,120
All right.
I didn't say anything yet, though.

410
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:27,060
So you're just watching her for a while.

411
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,250
Then what?

412
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,790
What are you going to do next?

413
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,590
You saw what happened
when one failed to become a human

414
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,170
after living 1,000 years.

415
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,240
Haven't you learned your lesson?

416
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,170
Time is ticking.

417
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,200
Why are you still thinking about her?

418
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,620
-I cared...
-If you cared about her so much,

419
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,550
why did you erase her memories first?

420
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,420
[Because I thought]

421
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,430
[if she wouldn't look at me
the same way as she did,]

422
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,550
[I wouldn't be able to stand it.]

423
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,140
Are you sure you want her
to go back to her normal life?

424
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,120
Is it really okay for you to see her
doing just fine

425
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,440
without you?

426
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,040
Of course.

427
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,310
You know what?

428
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,480
I may lie to other people,

429
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,420
but I would never lie to myself.

430
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,900
I'm buying you a really tasty beef tripe.

431
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,740
I said I'm not interested.

432
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,340
You can't convince me
with 20cm of beef tripe.

433
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,360
I know you want to talk about Jin-ah.

434
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,260
Just move on, you clingy punk.

435
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,540
I'm not being clingy.
I just want to say to her

436
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,230
that I'm not an idiot anymore
so she should stop contacting me.

437
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,340
I just want to talk with you about

438
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,630
how I make it sound

439
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,740
more charismatic and ruthless, my friend.

440
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,410
-Whatever.
-Jae-jin.

441
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,219
Jin-ah, what are you doing here?

442
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,860
I just came by

443
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:32,100
to see your face.

444
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,550
By the way, Dam,
it looks like you're still single,

445
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,570
seeing that you still
hang out with Jae-jin.

446
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,790
-You little...
-No, Dam. Don't.

447
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,929
My legs hurt.

448
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,850
Jae-jin, will you keep me waiting here?

449
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,699
Let's go somewhere and talk.

450
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,560
You're not talking to anyone. Go away.

451
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,170
Who do you think you are
to tell me to go away?

452
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,250
I know who I am to him.

453
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:10,160
If you make him cry, I'll be the one
who has to take all his drunken grumbles.

454
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,070
If you're not paying
for the drink, just go.

455
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,890
Jae-jin.

456
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,700
Should I go?

457
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,140
Well...

458
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,370
Sorry, Dam.

459
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,320
She came all the way here.
I can't just let her go like this.

460
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,090
Let's go, Jae-jin.

461
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,510
I saw a nice cafe on my way here.
Let's go.

462
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,870
I'll text you.

463
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,990
What am I going to do with that idiot?

464
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:30,810
[Jae-jin]

465
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,400
[I'm sorry, Dam.]

466
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,470
[I know I'm being stupid,]

467
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,770
[but seeing her face makes me weak.]

468
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,780
Hi, Seok.

469
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,980
Now?

470
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,010
Professor, what kind of coffee
do you like?

471
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,780
Professor. Please have some snacks.

472
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,340
-Seok, what's this about?
-What's your favorite?

473
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,630
Obviously,

474
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,270
we're welcoming our new professor.

475
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,900
You're the president of the council.

476
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,640
[I wished I didn't have to bump into him.]

477
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,840
What are you doing here though?
You're not even a member of the council.

478
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,750
Do you have to be a member

479
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,730
to greet our new professor?

480
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,490
Professor.

481
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,070
As the top History major junior,

482
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,140
I have a question.

483
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,100
Are you married?

484
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,420
Hey.

485
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,330
Can't you see he's not wearing a ring?

486
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,450
Of course. You look so young

487
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,230
I thought you were one of my seniors.

488
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,340
What a surprise.

489
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,980
Dam, don't you have any questions
to ask him?

490
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,500
How will our grades be calculated?

491
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,610
-Sorry?
-This is my first time

492
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,430
having my professor changed
in the middle of the semester.

493
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,730
They will be calculated
in the same way as before.

494
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,750
Yes, Professor.

495
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,530
I see.

496
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,490
Jae-jin.

497
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,660
You thought I was two-timing too, right?

498
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,260
But if you define my love
using one cheap word like that,

499
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,750
I'll be sad.

500
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,950
I was simply confused

501
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,240
if I liked you or him.

502
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,280
I see.

503
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,560
I think I'm done
organizing my thoughts now.

504
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,440
So I'm thinking of giving you
another chance.

505
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,620
-Another chance?
-Yes.

506
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,690
A chance to make me feel safer

507
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,420
and be nicer to me
so I don't get confused.

508
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,750
To be honest, you haven't been
that good either.

509
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,510
You hung out with Lee Dam all the time.

510
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,320
Jin-ah, Dam is just a friend.

511
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,950
How many times do I have to tell you?

512
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,240
Dam is not even a female friend.

513
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,570
She's just a human friend.

514
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,420
I said I didn't like her.

515
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,940
How many times did I say
I didn't like her?

516
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,830
Fine.

517
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,130
I did see another guy while dating you.

518
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,110
But you weren't nice to me either.

519
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,220
We're both at fault.

520
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,430
Choi Jin-ah. Do you even hear yourself?

521
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,440
Not once have I put her before you.

522
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,940
You have always been my priority,

523
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,480
and I have always done my best
for this relationship.

524
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,370
Don't use Dam as an excuse.

525
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,880
You may not be that good of a person,

526
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,080
but you're not that shameless either.

527
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,110
How could you side with her
in front of me?

528
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,190
I didn't know you were such cold a person.

529
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,120
Hye-sun.

530

Hi. I didn't expect to see you here.

531
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,140
Who is she?

532
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,790
I'm sorry if I have interrupted.

533
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,210
I'll leave you two alone.

534
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,750
See you on Saturday.

535
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,600
Okay. I'll text you.

536
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,210
Who is she? Why are you texting her?

537
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,640
-Well, she's just...
-What?

538
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:55,860
She's just someone
I do an assignment with.

539
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,330
It's...

540
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,810
Even if he told you who I am,
you wouldn't know.

541
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,850
What?

542
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,150
So what's the point of asking?

543
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:15,490
-Hey! What are you?
-Don't...

544
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,600
Jae-jin, meet me on Saturday.

545
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,740
[Seriously? Saturday?]

546
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,890
I can't, Jin-ah. I told you
we had to do an assignment together.

547
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,220
You can do the assignment on Sunday.

548
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,830
I like Saturday.

549
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,040
I must meet Jae-jin on Saturday.

550
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,440
I'm not going to cancel
my appointment for you.

551
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,940
And I'll never see you again.

552
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,140
You haven't answered my question yet.

553
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,650
Who is this woman?

554
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,020
Do you want to know who I am? Why?

555
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,770
I don't care whether you're Jae-jin's ex
or a utility pole.

556
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,320
I just want you to know this one thing.

557
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,860
On Saturday, he's mine.

558
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,090
Maybe I shouldn't have meddled.

559
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,760
It's okay.

560
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,890
Next time, don't be like that.

561
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,310
Don't open your heart to others.

562
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,760
You can't win the game
if you show all the cards in your hand.

563
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,390
I didn't play a game.

564
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,060
I didn't want to win either.

565
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,570
I just...

566
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,390
I just liked her a lot.

00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,520
Yes.

00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,730
Why aren't you asking me
why I didn't call you?

574
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:02,490
Pardon?

575
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,660
I said I would call you
because we're having dinner together.

576
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,430
Oh, right.

577
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,030
Are you free today?

578
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,890
Today, I can't...

579
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,770
Thanks, Seon-woo.

580
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,230
Let's have the dinner later
when you feel better.

581
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,460

You cried a lot the other day...

00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,690
Seon-woo, why don't we just do it today?

-What?
-Let's go.

This place is famous
for their salmon steak.

587

For salad, I'd recommend
avocado salad or Cobb salad.

Do you like ceviche?

If you don't want to have flour
in your main dish,

591

there are whole grain
or tofu noodle options.

592

00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,560
What's Cobb and what's ceviche?

596
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,640
And who doesn't want flour?

597

Then I'll make orders for you.

598
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:51,920
Okay.

Excuse me. I'd like to order.

600

That text message wasn't sent by me.

601
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,190
It was my brother.

602
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,630
He has this crazy idea
that you're interested in me.

603
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,020
I know. I figured it wasn't from you.

604
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,240
I thought you would never
talk so sweetly to me

605
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,880
nor send me such emojis.

606
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,000
In fact, that's the reason
why I hesitated to call you.

607
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,950
I was afraid you would
cancel this thing at all.

608
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:40,490
Seon-woo, you don't have to do this.

609
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:44,060
If this is because you feel bad
about the bet--

610
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,740
I do feel bad about it,
but that's not the reason.

611
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:51,710
Then is it because our deadline is near?

You're the only one

Literally, you're the only one.

That's what I said. You're one cold girl.

I'm doing this not because I feel bad
but because I like you.

What is it?

642
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,070
I'm sorry.

643
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,210
I like someone else.

[Someone else?]

645
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,200
I knew it.

646
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,620
So why did you follow her
in the first place?

647
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:20,400
It was nice seeing her.

648
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,180
I resented and hated her a lot,

649
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,910
but we had good memories too.

650
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,340
And I used to really like her.

651
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,920
I know she randomly appeared,
but it was nice seeing her.

652
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,290
It was weird.

653
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,960
I understand.
Emotions are weird like that.

654
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,120
Why do you think she suddenly appeared?

655
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,720
Exactly. Why?

656
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,920
Why did she have to appear and sway me

657
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,460
when I was almost finally over her?

658
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,830
Why sway me?

659
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:03,910

664
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,170
I still have this stupid idea

667
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,270
And I even have this idea

668
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,550
that she might have come

669
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,850

00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,620

00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,000
[Is it pathetic of me]

00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,070
[to wish that he misses me too?]

to move on this time.

I'll act like I don't know you.

Let me help.

702

It's okay. We can take a taxi.

703
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:18,960
Right. What do we do about your car?

704
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:23,760
It must be tough.

705
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,560

706
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,630
Tell him to call me when he sobers up.

00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:36,430
Gosh, I'm going to throw you
into the recycling bin.

710
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,710
Another round, my foot.

711
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,870
Do you think you can handle him?
I can drive him home.

712
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,290
It's okay. I can take him to my place.
I live near here.

713
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,570
You don't need to.

714
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,430
We'll drive him home.

715
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,210
Let us do that.

716
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,670
Where does Jae-jin live?

717
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,510
It's really okay. If he goes home now,

718
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,200
his brothers might undress him
and kick him out.

719
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,440
But it's late and dangerous.

720
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,290
You should go home first.

721
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:06,480
[I want to ask him why he sounds so sweet]

722
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:10,130
[as if he worries about me.]

723
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:12,990
[I want to ask him why he's with her]

724
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,770
[and why he's always around me,]

725
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,920
[keeping me from recovering.]

726
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,200
[There are so many things
I want to ask him, but...]

727
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,630
It's really okay.

728
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,010
Hye-sun, I'm sorry.
I'll text you tomorrow.

729
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,470
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

730
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,850
I should go.

731
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:46,830
What?

732
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,290
I'm worried.

733
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,220
But...

734
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,040
[Is the person she likes...]

735
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,900
[Why do I keep...]

736
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:46,980
[No way.]

737
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,390
[Do I like her in a different way?]

738
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,260
I'll get going.

739
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,670
You can't go by yourself.

740
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,340
-I can...
-Ouch!

741
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:24,330
See? I said you might fall.

742
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,210
[How dare]

743
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:31,900
[I...]

744
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,370
[She's so young]

745
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:41,090
[and young.]

746
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,070
[Since when and how?]

747
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:52,530
I can take care of him.

748
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,340
You can go, Professor.

749
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,210
Hye-sun must be waiting.

750
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:02,480
[Why now?]

751
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:04,500
[You know what?]

752
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,750
I may lie to other people,

753
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,290
but I would never lie to myself.

754
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,490
Are you sure you want this?

755
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,050
[Even if she meets other people,]

756
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:15,940
[dates others,]

757
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:17,920
[loves others,]

758
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,190
[and eventually
stays out of your life forever?]

759
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,060
No.

760
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:41,420
I'm not sure.

761
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,940
[We appreciate Kang Mi-na
for her guest appearance.]

762
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,880
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

763
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,840
[For the first time since I met her,]

764
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:38,790
[I felt like I fell from clouds]

765
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,770
[and bumped into reality.]

766
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:43,900
[I'm going to give a presentation
about Goryeo's Buddhist culture...]

767
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,540
[What kind of fox is so easy to read?]

768
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,650
[if you like her so much,
why don't you hurry]

769
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,800
[and turn into a human
so you can meet her again?]

770
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,150
[I think her memories aren't erased.]

771
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:57,670
[Is there really something
going on between them?]

772
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,340
[Miss Dam.]

773
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:00,920
[The soundtrack, "One Step Closer" is
now available on streaming sites.]

774
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,760
[Your memories aren't erased, are they?]
