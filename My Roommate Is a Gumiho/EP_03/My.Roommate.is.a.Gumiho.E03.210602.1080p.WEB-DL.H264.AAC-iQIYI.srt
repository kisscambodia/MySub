Let me check one thing.

7
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,665
You can go back now.

8
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,025
Just think

9
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,765
all this was a dream.

10
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,634
I'll get going.

[ What? The Marble turned blue? ]

12
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,229
It turned blue
the moment you tried to take it back,

13
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,875
then it went back to normal?

14
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,764
How could that happen?

15
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,305
How did it go for you?

16
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,629
It turned blue at once.

17
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,055
Then I instinctively knew

18
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,185
I became a human as of that moment.

19
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,009
So? How do you feel?

20
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,439
I know it happened for a second,
but it never changed colors before.

21
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,645
It felt very peculiar for me.

22
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,035
Well, a little, I guess.

23
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,845

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,955
Well, this isn't about me.
She's a friend of mine.

26

27
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,085

What's he after?

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,849
After what? This is why I don't associate
with kids who haven't dated.

32
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,359
That's called expressing affection.

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,055
What do you think he was trying to check?
Their love.

34
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,175
Anyway, your friend got married young.

35
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,319
Oh, she's not married.
She's living with him.

36
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,828
But it's not affection.
They don't like each other.

37
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,695
What? They live together even though
they don't like each other? Why?

38
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,289
Well things happened, so she ended up

39
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,945
- getting something precious in her...
- What?

40
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,185

41
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,955
She's not pregnant, but...

[ - Isn't it frustrating? ]
- I...

43
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,745
You have no idea how to color
the rest of the Marble in blue.

44
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,145
I'll have to keep my eyes on her for now.

45
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,115
I finally get it.

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,539
You wouldn't let
a random human stay by your side.

47
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,349
The Marble rolled into her

48
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,849
as if she's the owner
right before your 1,000 years are up.

49
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,985
It happened for a moment,
but it even turned blue.

50
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,755
I can see why you thought this was fate.

51
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,999
Anyway, be good to her as much as you can,

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,025
and do everything you can.

53
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,065
Why should I do that?

54
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,345
This might be the last chance you have.

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,699
In my experience, humans emit

56
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,955
the best kind of energy
when they're happy.

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,315
So I made a lot of efforts
to make them happy.

58
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,825
What did you do?

59
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,585
I dated them.

60
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,545
There's no other way
they could be happier than that.

61
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,575
Right.

62
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:58,895
You should just date her
while you got this chance.

63
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,779
Nonsense.

64
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,735
I'm saying because dating is
the best way to make them happy.

65
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,699
And of course, I know how much you hate

66
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,745
to feign love and stay by a human's side.

67
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,905
But you have no other choice.

68
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,705
Learn to be patient

69
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,995
and try dating her.

70
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,825
- Why would you say...
[ - Are you going to date me? ]

71
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,625
Then why did you hug me?

72
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,995
Oh, well...

73
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,925
I mean, I gave it a thought
to figure out why you did that.

74
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,445
But you're the one who did something odd,
so why should I be troubled?

75
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,265
So I decided to ask you.

76
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,504
What's going on?

77
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,395
At first,

78
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,165
I was really going to let you go.

79
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,805
But then it hit me

80
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,855
that I had to stay behind all by myself
to figure this out,

81
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,805
and it made me feel hopeless.

82
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,189
So in a word,

83
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,125
it's like we're stuck
on a deserted island,

84
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,289
but you felt as if
you had to let me escape alone,

85
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,545
as if your only comrade is leaving?

86
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,235
Well, something like that.

87
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,549
I guess I can understand how you feel,

88
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,275
so I'll let you slide.

89
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,245
But from now on,
don't do anything to lead people on.

90
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,975
People will misunderstand what you did.

91
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,905
What if it's not a misunderstanding?

92
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,225
If I say I want to be your boyfriend,
will you let me?

93

If I say I want to be your boyfriend,

94
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,425
will you let me?

95
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,935
No, I won't.

96
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,699

97
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,245
You are not my type.

98
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,835
But why do you ask?

99
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,779
Well, I am

100
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,395
feeling anxious and unable to think right,

101
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,085
so it must be a withdrawal symptom.

102
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,065
I see.

103
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,575
Why did I say that?

104
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,745

I had you help me out,
then made you buy for meals too.

145

Forget it. I was going to anyway.

146

[ But she's not
particularly like that to you. ]

149
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,839
She builds a wall against all men,
just like what her name, Dam, means.

150
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,389
It's like the Iron Curtain.
No one can get through.

151
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,589
Tae-jin tried to hit on her,

152

but she turned him down at once.
It was hilarious.

153

You're actually comparing me to Tae-jin?

154
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,639
Fine, you do look much better.

155
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,409
But you both have
that impression of a scumbag.

156
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,669
Dam might be the type
who's into people's character, not looks.

157
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,045
Precisely.

Do you feel confident?

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,805
She won't go out with me.

178
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,705
Because you're a gumiho?

179
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,645
Because I'm not her type.

180
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,069
People used to say gumihos are bewitching,
but not anymore.

181
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,365
[ What happened to you, Sim Woo-yeo? ]

182
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,725
Anyway, I'm sorry.

183
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,309
You took my advice,
then only embarrassed yourself.

184
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,685
I didn't take your advice.

185
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,815
I wasn't going to do that,
but she didn't seem to care at all,

186
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,569
so it just came out.

187
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,119
Yes, don't go begging a girl
who doesn't care about you

188
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,619
to go out with you.

189
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,249
[ Let's find another way. ]

190
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,655
It looks like dating you
isn't her idea of happiness.

191
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,209
Right, humans have
a weak spot for presents.

192
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,285
Why don't you give her
a load of stuff she likes?

193
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,039
If she likes clothes, get her clothes.

194
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,325
If she likes accessories,

195
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,739
get her things made with diamond,
gold, sapphire, clam gem,

196
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,675
and pearl.

197
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,805
Clam gems are pearls.

198
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,479
What? Since when?

199
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,785
You should take lessons
instead of meddling with my business.

200
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,555
- Forget it.
- Are you afraid of getting lashed?

201
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,189
The education system has changed a lot.

202
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,715
You won't get lashed by the teacher
like we used to in the old days.

203
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,795
I hope you get the courage
to sign up for a class. Bye.

204
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,555
I can't believe this guy.

205
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,569
Fine, big shot.

206

All showing off how he's
an elite scholar from Seonggyungwan.

207
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,055
Something that she likes.

208
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,299
- Do you enjoy ghosting people?
- Sorry?

209
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,205
I said we're meeting at the back gate.

210
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,129
Right, I have to go home early...

211
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,325
Then forget today.

212
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,915
Let's catch a movie this weekend.

213
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,775
Why do you want to go with me?

214
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,225
No way.

215
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,175
I've seen seeing them together often.

216
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,619
Is she his type now?

217
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,329
I'm sure Dam flirted with him.

218
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,335
She went for so long pretending like
she's not interested in guys.

219
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,009
Hey, do you remember
that one senior, Eun-jo?

220
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,699
She kept saying
she doesn't think Seon-woo is hot,

221
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,265
but got humiliated
when she got caught flirting with him.

222
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,575
What if Dam ends up like her?

223
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,225
- My gosh.
- Dam, what are you up to?

224
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,579
What?

225
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,305
Get some yourself.

226
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,105
It's not that.

227
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,365
What's going on between you and Seon-woo?

228
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,669
Nothing. We just had a meal once.

229
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,289
What? You had a meal with him?

230
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,529
Just you two? Why?

231
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,389
He seemed like the bad boy type.

232
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,319
Hey, she won't die from eating with him.

233
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,825
She can manage that much.

234
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,429
Well, I'm sure you're surprised
that he went for her and not me,

235
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,509
but I can always let you have him, Dam.

236
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,349
No, it's not like that.

237
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,035
We just ate a meal, and that's all.

238

[ So we'll catch a movie this weekend. ]

240
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,609
No way, a movie?

241
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,279
It's not "not like that."

242
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,389
You ate with him, took classes together,

243
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,719
then asked me to leave, and now, a movie?

244
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,099
Then he's 100 percent interested.

245
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,169
That's what it looks like on the outside.

246
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,619
But look at me.

247
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,859
I don't look so bad today,

248
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,989
but you wouldn't want to say hi to me
if you weren't my friends.

249
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,349
- You want to be strangers.
- Yes.

250
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,979
So why would he?

251
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,905
Why would he be interested in me
among countless numbers of students?

252
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,579

Don't you remember how I got hammered

and stuck my phone charger up your nose?

272
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,119
If you still like me
even though you remember that day,

273
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,019

Can you just be honest?

289
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,978
Just tell him that you feel uncomfortable.

290
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:20,919
What if he thinks
I'm playing too hard to get?

291

Most of the girls
in my major are on his side.

What if he gets mad at me

That could happen.

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,819
But are you going out like that, Miss Dam?

352
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,109
Yes, I thought he'd hate it
if I go out like this

353
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,185
to watch a movie with him.

354
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,915
What do you think? Do I look awful?

355
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,909
Instead of this,

356
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:01,275
why don't you put on
that reddish-brown shirt with a dog on?

357
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,685
[ You should go with that. ]

358
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,105
[ It's a little bit tackier, ]

359
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,285
[ there are spots here and there,
and the neck is stretched out too. ]

360
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,085
[ How can I put this? ]

361
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,339
Yes, you looked pretty awful.

362
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,639
I see. Then I'll wear that
when I go out with him.

363
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,259
And you'll look much more frivolous

364
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,859
if you put on your sneakers
while stepping on the back as always.

365

I hope this won't become a problem
in our cohabitation.

If I put you off a bit too much,
call a time out.

Okay.

This is the best restaurant
near our school,

374

if I devour on this aggressively,

Watch this.

377
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,649
Why don't you just eat jjajangmyeon?

378
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,925
Sorry?

379
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,779
I watched you eat jjajangmyeon last time.

380
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,629
You got the sauce all over your mouth,

381
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,835
and you slurped on the noodles
very loudly.

382
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,749
It might be more off-putting
than this dish.

383

I see.

384
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,429
And you take a bite of your picked radish
and leave the eaten ones in your bowl.

385
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,579
It seemed quite selfish too,

386
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,299

That was hot.

391
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,049
Right, when you drink hot drinks,

392
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,435
you tend to slurp a lot.

393
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,425
I think you should show
such uncultured behavior too.

394
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,559
And you should call your friend
when you're with him.

395
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,239
I overheard your call once,

396
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,229
and it seemed like you were using
all kinds of vulgar language such as,

397
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,785
"jerk, idiot, I'll kill you," and more.

398
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,475

- I just had to be myself.

- No.

There's no point talking
to someone like him.

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,795
- Anyway, what was your friend's name?
- Shin Woo...

524
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,699
- hee.
- What?

525
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,149
Shi Nu-i?

526
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,489
Her last name is Shi, first name Nu-i?

527
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,865
No, not Shi Nu-i, but Shin Woo-hee.

528
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,895
Anyway, why did you call?

529
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,489
Mom called

530
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,909
[ and asked me to make sure you're fine.
How are you doing? ]

531
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,645
I'm done fine. I'm doing so great.

532
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,025
Okay. Good night.

533
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:17,348
[ The person you have reached is
unavailable. Please leave a message... ]

534
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:18,845
Why won't she answer the phone?

535
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,538
- Hey! Lee Dan!
- Hey!

536
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:24,339
- What's up?
- Hey.

537
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,709
What are you doing here?

538
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,939
I was just passing by.

539
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,699
I haven't seen my sister
for a while, so...

540
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,368
What do you mean? You live together.

541
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,909
Didn't you know it?

542
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,669
She's not living with me.

543
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,618
She's living with a friend named
Shin Woo-hee to prepare for a contest.

544
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:38,909
What? Shin Woo-hee?

545
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,325
I have never heard of that name.

546
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,525
I also haven't heard about the contest.

547
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,288
Wait. I drove her home two days ago

548
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:46,999
with my brother's car.

549
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,154
What?

550
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:51,618
But she moved out two weeks ago.

551
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:52,815
What?

552
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:56,904
What could it be?

553
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,989
I don't think she's doing
something shady though.

554
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,595
Actually, something weird happened.

555
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,555
The most popular guy in our major
is interested in Dam.

556
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,325
You're lying.

557
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,885
I know. It does sound like a lie.

558
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,029
Right! There's one more.

559
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,049
She quit chicken and drinking.

560
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,239
- No way.
- Right?

561
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,065
But it's true. It's been almost two weeks.

562
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,909
Wait.

563
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:26,255
She moved out two weeks ago and
quit chicken and drinking two weeks ago.

564
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,905
Could it be...

565
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,125
she's into something weird?

566
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,809
Something like a cult
where they worship chicken.

567
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:39,985
- Maybe she lives there and...
- No way.

568
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,839
- Dam.
- Hey, wait.

569
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,435
I'll call her.

570
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,539
Hey, Dam. Where are you?

571
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,179
[ The class is finished,
so I'm going home. Why? ]

572
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,789
Home? You mean the place
where you live with Dan?

573
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,035
[ Of course. I've got to go. ]

574
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,725
See? She was lying.

575
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,945
Okay.

576
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,595
[ The next bus is... ]

577
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,795
See?

578
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,899
She has to take 171 to go to your place,

579
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,625
but she took that bus.

580
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,865
Wait up.

581
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,335
Wait up.

582
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,019
Sir, where are you coming from?

583
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,469
I went to the publishing company.

584
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,669
You're finished early.

585
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,895
- "Sir"? But he looks so young.
- Let's eat together.

586
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,099
Hey, he must be the priest.

587
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,955
The leader of that cult she got into.

588
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,199
How was it today?
Are you feeling all right?

589
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,019
Are you worried about my condition

590
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,169
or the Marble's?

591
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,085
Your condition is the Marble's condition.

592
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,515
What are they saying? Why would she talk
about a marble while rubbing her belly?

593
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,929
Hey, it must be the baby's nickname.

594
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,509
My cousin is also pregnant,

595
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,179
and she calls her baby by nickname.

596
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,329
Now it all makes sense.

597
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,879
- She's not into a cult. She's pregnant.
- What?

598
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,039
That's why she can't
drink nor eat chicken.

599
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,095
That's why.

600
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,539
Is there anything you want to eat?

601
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,319
I put you through all this,
so tell me anything.

602
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,499
Don't say that.

603
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,449
It's not like I'm keeping it forever.
It will come out soon.

604
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,299
See? She's pregnant.

605
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,019
- Shall we go in?
- Let me carry it for you.

606
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,475
It's okay. It's not heavy.

607
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,075
Dam!

608
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,205
Dan!

609
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,885
I'm not here for a drink.

610
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,079
Come on and explain.

611
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,475
When we talked on the phone last night,
you said you were living with your friend.

612
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,275
Is this man your friend?

613
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,079
Well...

614
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,749
You said one of your friends got pregnant

615
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,079
and now she has to live
with a man she doesn't even like.

616
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,879
- It's you, right?
- No, it's not!

617
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,849
Then what is it?

618
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,999
What's that marble

619
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,019
that you won't keep forever
and will come out soon?

620
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,259
You even gave a nickname to your baby.
Stop lying to me.

621
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,549
He's right. Just admit it
so we can give you blessings.

622
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,529
- That's not...
- Do you love my sister?

623
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,775
No.

624
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,869
Still, you're going to marry her, right?

625
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,235
No.

626
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,315
- And you call yourself a human?
- No.

627
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,135
- You scumbag!
- That jerk!

628
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,675
How dare you...

629
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,599
I'm sending them back home.

630
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,319
Their memories will be erased.

631
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,555
What?

632
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,949
Why won't he pick up the phone?

633
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,035
[ The person you have reached
is unavailable. ]

634
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,485
It looks like it's not a big deal to you.

635
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,265
Erasing the memories.

636
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,075
How much did you erase?

637
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,149
It looked like he learned about it today,
so I erased today's memories only.

638
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,089
You don't know
how much this day meant to them.

639
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,165
How could you erase their memories
just like that?

640
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,565
I did it
because you seemed to be flustered.

641
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,349
Do you think there was another way?

642
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,509
We could have given it some time
and think--

643
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,319
What if more people find out about it
while we think?

644
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,145
Then I might have to erase more memories.

645
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,535
And I don't want to waste my time
doing something annoying like that.

646
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,145
"Something annoying"?

647
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,709
I know there was no other way

648
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,659
and I understand that you're right,

649
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,509
but I'm still upset.

650
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,619
You must have someone you care about too.

651
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,639
If that person has to lose memories
because of you,

652
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,155
won't it upset you?

653
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,915
That's not how I think.

654
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,865
I don't think like humans.

655
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,235
Did you at least try to?

656
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,475
If you really want to be a human,

657
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,965
I think you need to learn
about those emotions.

658
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,005
I hope he's all right.

659
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,895
Dan.

660
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,099
- What?
- Stay still.

661
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,825
Dan!

662
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,085
- Hi, Dam.
- Hi.

663
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,349
Hi.

664
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,299
- What's up?
- What?

665
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,805
I said, what's up?

666
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,635
- I was worried.
- Worried about what?

667
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,525
Well...

668
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,909
I was wondering
if you're eating and exercising well.

669
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,205
I'm doing fine. Now, go.

670
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,445
Go?

671
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,075
Well...

672
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,165
I don't think I can be
in that house comfortably now.

673
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,179
I'll be in my room.

674
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,595
Don't mind me and have fun.

675
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,319
- Hey, the toilet is clogged.
- Hey, come in.

676
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,519
Hi, Dam.

677
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,659
- Hi.
- Hi.

678
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,905
Hi.

679
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,209
- Hold on!
- Hey!

680
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,445
- What is it?
- Oh.

681
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,265
- Hi, Dam.
- Hi, Dam.

682
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,895
Oh, hi.

683
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,515
I guess I can be in Dan's room.

684
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,225
- Have fun.
- Okay.

685
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,915
- Hey, I'm hungry.
- Me too.

686
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,895
Hi, Dam.

687
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,829
Hey, let's just go.
I think we're making her uncomfortable.

688
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,475
What? You said you'd sleep over tonight.

689
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,985
She's leaving soon. Right?

690
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,299
Right. I'm leaving soon.

691
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,075
I just came by to take my stuff.

692
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,795
See? Take your stuff and go.

693
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,159
Okay.

694
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,219
Have fun. Okay?

695
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,945
- Bye.
- Bye, Dam.

696
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,325
Why did I even worry about that punk?

697
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,335
If I had known he's doing so well,
I wouldn't have been so mad at Mr. Gumiho.

698
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,965
Right. I wonder how Jae-jin is.

you should be as nice to her

704

705
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,419
You should put her on a pedestal,
not argue with her.

706
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,455
And she's way younger than you.

707
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,895
What if she never comes back?

708
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,195
She's not that irresponsible.

709
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:41,649
What's the point of
crying over spilled milk?

710
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,549
You should have thought of her
as your last hope.

711

But look at what you have done.

712

Don't you feel that urge to become
a human whenever you see me?

713

But if you're so smart,
why haven't you become a human yet?

720
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,959
What's the point of having
so much knowledge

721
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,955
if you can't wheedle a human?

722
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,165
Why don't you
stop improving your knowledge

723
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,199

724

treating her like that, she might leave.

00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:55,259
[ Sir, let me share the progress
because I don't want to worry you. ]

877
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,149
[ Everything is fine here. ]

878
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:00,145
[ I'm going home early.
Let's have dinner together. ]

879
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,745
I didn't know it'd rain today.

880
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,335
We should call a cab.

881
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:33,319
I spent all my money
buying the jjajangmyeon earlier.

882
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,525
Where do you live? I can take you home.

883
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:38,915
That little...

884
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:40,715
Pardon?

885
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,889
My little sister stole my money.

886
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:48,065
She does that all the time.
What do we do now?

887
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,599
Oh, well.

888
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,849
Let's just run to the bus stop.
It'll take ten minutes from here.

889
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:54,225
Which bus do you take?

890
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,215
Well, I haven't taken a bus before.

891
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:58,929
Then what have you been riding?

892
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,295
My car or taxis.

893
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,645
And my car happens
to be in a repair shop today.

894
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,415
Oh, well.

895
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,209
Follow me then.

896
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,725
I'll make sure you have a safe bus ride.

897
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,295
Come on!

898
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,235
You can take this bus.

899
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,465
It's raining so much.

900
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,659
[ The bus is arriving soon. ]

901
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,809
The bus is coming.

902
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:12,765
Take that bus
and get off the bus after nine stops.

903
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,135
Okay. Thanks.

904
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,125
Get on the bus now. Have a safe trip home.

905
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,309
When you get home safely,

906
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:32,125
please call me.

907
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:52,055
He just ignored me. He must have lost
interest in me completely.

908
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:05,385
I'll be clingy until the last moment.

909
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:24,870
[ Lee Dam ]

910
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,429
[ Seon-woo, are you going home all right? ]

911
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:23,515
[ I feel bad we had to say goodbye.
Have a safe trip home. ]

912
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,240
[ Did you get on the bus too? ]

913
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:31,740
[ Lee Dam ]

914
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,105
[ I wish my car wasn't in the repair shop. ]

915
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:33,060
[ Okay. ]

916
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:38,915
[ Lee Dam ]

917
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:50,040
[ Gye Seon-woo ]

918
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,459
[ I had fun today. ]

919
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,625
[ I'm sorry we had to say goodbye
so suddenly. ]

920
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:51,750
[ Don't worry! I'm having
ox blood soup for dinner today, ]

921
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:54,220
[ Gye Seon-woo ]

922
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,789
[ so I was planning
on going home early anyway. ]

923
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,865
[ Lee Dam: Don't worry! I'm having
ox blood soup for dinner today. ]

924
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:59,025
What's with this tone?

925
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,979
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

926
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,205
Both my battery and I are worn out.

927
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:22,645
[ Sir ]

928
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:02,205
It's raining so much.

929
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:06,695
[ Sir, Battery Low ]

930
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,245
[ Sir, Battery Low ]

931
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,085
Sir, how did you come all the way here?

932
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:54,875
You weren't answering your phone.

933
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,955
Right. I was going to tell you
when I get home.

934
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,455
Miss Dam.

935
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:07,455
From now on, always answer my phone.
Even when I'm next to you.

936
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:02,579
[ But you were okay, Miss Dam. ]

937
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,719
[ I'm also okay with staying with you. ]

938
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,745
[ Actually, I'm more than
just okay with it. ]

939
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:08,575
[ My Roommate is a Gumiho ]

940
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,175
[ I'm thinking of going to this place
called school. ]

941
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,915
[ Don't you need someone
who can observe that girl closely? ]

942
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,900
[ The first assignment is
"romantic relationship". ]

943
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,825
[ Lee Dam, Gye Seon-woo ]

944
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,899
[ Speaking of which,
why don't we set a date? ]

945
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,445
[ How about Saturday? ]

946
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:27,529
[ I think we need a curfew. ]

947
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:28,985
If you break it...

948
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:34,575
[ Aren't you nervous, anxious,
and sleepless these days? ]

949
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:37,395
[ My heart suddenly starts to pound ]

950
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,705
[ and I would suddenly feel dizzy.
What do you think this is? ]
