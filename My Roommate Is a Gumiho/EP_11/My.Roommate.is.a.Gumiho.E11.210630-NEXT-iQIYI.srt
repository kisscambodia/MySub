Nothing.

She acts as if nothing has happened.

That means she doesn't have

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,505
No way.

359
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,259
Then why?

360
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,965
[ Wait, did Jae-jin
make that mistake with her? ]

361
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,735
[ No way. ]

362
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,539
What do you mean,
they're pretending to date for grades?

363
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,645
We get an A plus if we become a couple
in our Communications lecture.

364
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,069
Is it because I haven't gone on
too many dates with Seon-woo?

365
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,845
The grade for our report
doesn't look too great.

366
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,415
Wait, sir.

367
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,495
Are you concerned about Seon-woo?

368
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,729
Of course,

369
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,735
you wouldn't be happy
after you saw him hug me.

370
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,575
But you seemed down since yesterday.

371
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,465
It's not that I think you're jealous.

372
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,265
But I am jealous.

373
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,465
I have to think about all kinds of things

374
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,585
to get closer to you like this.

375
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,565
But it seemed too easy for him.

376
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,755
So don't get too close to him.

377
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,315
Don't make me jealous.

378
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,075
Okay. I won't.

379
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,169
[ New text message ]

380
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:51,395
[ Could you come
for your job interview at... ]

381
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,215
Sir, I was told to come
for the part-time job interview.

382
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,755
- Come again.
- Sure.

383
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,065
Uncle, could you please
let me borrow three million won?

384
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,755
Three million, my foot.
I'll beat you three million times.

385
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,049
I opened up my restaurants two weeks ago,

386
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,419
but you never visited me once.

387
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,945
Then when you actually come,
you come asking me for money?

388
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,505
What can I do?
My dad cut me off his credit card.

389
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,875
No, I can't.

390
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,509
Of course, you took after me the most
among all of my nephews,

391
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,155
so it's true that I especially adore you.

392
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,115
But I know what my brother-in-law means,
so I can't let you borrow money.

393
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,499
- Gosh, what do I do?
- He's hot.

394
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,065
- He's really good-looking.
- He is.

395
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,015
Look at how hot he is.

396
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,309
- What are you doing?
- You needed money.

397
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,689
Things have been hectic since I opened up,

398
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,239
so I was going to hire new part-timers.

399
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,409
You need money, I need part-timers.

400
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,079
It's a win-win situation, my nephew.

401
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,505
Whatever, Uncle. I can't work here.

402
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,895
Excuse me, hello.

403
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,415
I'm here for the part-time job interview.

404
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,119
Yes, you must be Ms. Lee Dam.

405
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,535
You're right.

406
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,165
I'm the owner here.

407
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,905
Please take a seat.
Let me grab your resume.

408
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,445
Okay, sir.

409
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,759
Gosh, why are you standing there?

410
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,325
Uncle, you have to hire her.

411
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,665
You can't try to pull strings
the moment you start here.

412
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,995
On top of that, why should I?

413
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,385
- She's pretty.
- What?

414
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,689
Are you sure you can start today?

415
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,009
You said you're in need.

416
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,869
And I'm grateful that
you're willing to hire me.

417
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,189
Don't mention it.

418
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:08,219
It's wonderful that you're doing this
for your brother.

419
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,539
Then do you want to begin now?

420
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,975
Of course, I signed
the employment contract.

421
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,965
- Seon-woo.
- Hey.

422
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,775
What?

423
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,105
You two know each other?

424
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,745
Yes, she's a junior at school.

425
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,895
He's my uncle.

426
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,369
You look startled.

427
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,175
You must have thought I was his brother.

428
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,685
My gosh.

429
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,245
Why have I been
running into him all the time lately?

430
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,815
I don't think
my sir will be happy about it.

431
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,625
[ Sir ]

432
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,459
Sir, did you see my message?

433
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,185
I'm working starting today.

434
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,605
Yes, I saw it.

435
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,145
How is it? Is it all right?

436
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,599
Yes, it's doable, but...

437
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,105
[ It's near Hongdae, right? ]

438
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,215
Do you want me to pick you up after work?

439
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,485
Pick me up?

440
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,015
Actually, the thing is...

441
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,719
Oh, no.

442
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,309
- Hang on. Let me...
- Oh, no.

443
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,419
Sir, I'll talk to you later.

444
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,705
[ Seon-woo, are you okay? ]

445
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,565
Professor Shin. Hi.

446
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,035
Wait.

447
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,995
Would you like to have a cup of coffee?

448
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,295
I have good coffee beans in my lab.

449
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,505
Maybe next time. Now, if you'll excuse me.

Please don't mind what they said earlier.

Oh. You mean, that I keep you in check?

455

Of course, I don't mind.

If you haven't gotten over it yet...

461
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,065
I'll be late for my class.

462
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,509
Hey, Dam. What are you up to?
Want to grab a drink...

463
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,619
Sorry, I'm working now.
I'll call you back.

464

Work?

465
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,645
When did she even get the job?

466
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,725
Since when she has so many secrets?

467
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,495
Jae-jin.

468
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,875
Since when is he going out with Hye-sun?

469
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,165
[ Everyone has a secret. ]

470
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,819
[ Dam, who had always been single
and used to tell me everything she does ]

471
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,455
[ has a boyfriend now. ]

472
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,099
[ And Jae-jin, whom I thought was
a one-woman man, ]

473
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,245
[ had one-night... ]

474
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,685
[ Well, he made shocking moves
for a while and then got a girlfriend. ]

475

[ And... ]

[ he's my secret. ]

00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,685
[ The secret of mine that gave me ]

478
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,485
[ an incurable wound. ]

479
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,455
[ My biggest secret. ]

I'll see you tomorrow.

481

I'm leaving.

482
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:25,355
Dam.

483
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:27,864
I'll walk you home.

484
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,255
If you feel uncomfortable,
I'll just walk you to the station nearby.

485
00:34:31,689 --> 00:34:34,465
Wherever you walk me,
it'll make me uncomfortable anyway.

486
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,765
I just have a lot of things to ask
regarding work.

487
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,355
- Then let's talk about it on the way.
- Okay.

488
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,635
- Hi, Sir.
[ - Have you finished work? ]

489
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,155
Yes. I was just about to go home.

490
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,865
[ Was it all right? ]

491
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,135
Yes. It wasn't so hard.
My boss seems like a nice person too.

492
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,295
[ How about your coworker? ]

493
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,295
[ I don't want to worry him. ]

494
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,985

00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,355
[ Are you sure? ]

496
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,065
- Yes.
[ - Okay. ]

497
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,665
[ Then have a safe trip back home. ]

498
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,155
Thanks.

499
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,925
Was that your boyfriend?

500
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,285
Yes. It's my boyfriend,
whom I really like a lot.

501
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,845
I didn't ask how much you like him.

502
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,255
Surprise!

503
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,849
I couldn't make it last weekend,
so I came today.

504
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,709
I was crushed because I was really looking
forward to our indoor date.

505
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,249
You should have called me.

506
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,755
I did, but you didn't answer.

507
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,855
The battery is dead.

508
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,455
Nothing has changed.

509
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,199
The huge TV, the comfortable sofa,

510
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,765
and you, a dashing man
standing right there.

511
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,875
I've missed them all.

512
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,475
So...

513
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,625
come here and have a seat.

514
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,515
Come on.

515
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,185
I brought something for us.

516
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,725
Surprise!

517
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,985
[ Order here ]

518
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,985
Here.

519
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,265
Come on and try.

520
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,019
I don't feel like it.

521
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,915
Why not? Try it at least.

522
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,639
I want to open it up.

523
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,185
I don't like that it's hiding things.

524
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,519
Who knows what's inside the bun?

525
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,239
I can tell you what's inside.

526
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,009
Bacon, salami, lettuce...

527
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,335
I'll pass.

528
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,575
[ I thought she came to tell me the truth. ]

529
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,725
[ I came to tell him the truth,
but his mood seems... ]

530
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,185
It's tasty.

531
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,595
Miss Dam.

532
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,285
The sound.

533
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,125
Okay.

534
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,405
[ What a petty man. ]

535
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,179
Wait here.

536
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,305
I'll make you the coffee you used to like.

537
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,945
Sir, wait.

538
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,855
I have something to tell you.

539
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,539
It looks like the light went out.

540
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,535
I think it's a blackout.

541
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,015
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

542
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,305
It's okay.

543
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,609
I should have some candles.
Do you want to come with me?

544
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,885
Sure.

545
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,295
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

546
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,705
I'm sorry.

547
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,909
- Ouch.
- What's the matter?

548
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,675
I got a cramp.

549
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,345
Open your mouth.

550
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,105
Did you swallow it?

551
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,825
Yes.

552
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,755
What do we do now?

553
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,779
Since I swallowed it anyway,

554
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,179
should I keep it for a few days?

555
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,859
I don't have much energy anyway, so...

556
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,795
No. Hurry and give it back.

557
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,125
How? Should I hit my chest really hard?

558
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,145
Don't you remember?

559
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:47,595
You have taken the Marble out before.

560
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,785
I'll be closing my eyes, so do whatever
you have to do to take it back.

561
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,515
What's wrong?

562
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,215
I'm afraid I might take your energy too.

563
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,635
Then let me do it.

564
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,845
What?

565
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,495
I don't know how to spit it out,

566
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,795
so you take care of the rest.

567
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,895
I don't think it was this long before.

568
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,205
You told me to take care of it.

569
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,745
And I took care of it all right.

570
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,365
How was it?

571
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,515
Oh.

572
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,115
My heart fluttered.

573
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,885
No, I mean...

574
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,925
How did you feel?

575
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,485
Did you feel weak, by any chance?

576
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:37,445
Oh, that. I think I feel fine.

577
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,855
Actually, whenever I see you,

578
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:50,515
I want to hold your hands
and stay close to you.

579
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,955
But I'm afraid that might hurt you.

580
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:58,655
You always say that,
but you have never actually hurt me.

581
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,745
You said you would find a way.

582
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,875
And this is the way I came up with.

583
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,355
This way, you can take
a little bit of energy from me,

584
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,945
and I can be very happy.

585
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,155
- Miss Dam...
- Come on. Let me do this at least.

586
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,145
I trust you.

587
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,655
I want you to trust me too.

588
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,925
Right. There's something
I need to tell you.

589
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,805
I'm working

590
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,835
with Seon-woo.

591
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,609
I didn't mean to lie to you.

592
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,905
I didn't tell you
because I didn't want to worry you.

593
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,755
I'm sorry.

594
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,585
You probably couldn't tell me

595
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,935
because my jealousy
made you feel uncomfortable.

596
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,785
But I can't promise I won't get jealous.

597
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,985
Actually, there's a reason

598
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,725
why he bothers me.

599
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,465
I'll be honest with you too.

600
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,705
But I don't see anything.

601
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,175
Is that why I keep getting involved
with him these days?

602
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,775
I guess destiny does exist...

603
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,495
Whatever.

604
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,945
I made a promise.

605
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:14,279
Red thread? What do we do now?

606
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,485
Just like me more.

607
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,635
Don't change.

608
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,655
Like me as much as I like you.

609
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,095

[ Hye-sun, I'm arriving soon.
Is there anything you want to eat? ]

613
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:44,239
What? Why did he send this to me...

614
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,669
[ Hey, Dam. Did I make any mistake there? ]

615
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,315
[ Did I write anything women hate to hear? ]

616
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,245
I thought we were dating to get
good grades, not to actually go on dates.

617
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,325
Excuse me.

618
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,485
Can I have your phone number?

619

I have a boyfriend.

620
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:14,345
We can just be text buddies too.

621
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,475
I said, I have a boyfriend.

622
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,535
Do you have a problem with my girlfriend?

623
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,145
No. I'm sorry.

Oh.

625
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:39,595
Sorry, I held your hand without asking.
I just wanted to help you.

626
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,495
It's just like the time at the festival.
Being pretty must be hard.

627
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,595
What are you saying?
Come on. Let's go eat.

628
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,485
Okay.

629
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,715
Hye-sun, have this too. It's really tasty.

630
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,985
- Why don't you have some too?
- I had enough already.

631
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,765
Do you want me to take photos of you?

632
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,829
That's so random.

633
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,115
Look over here.

634
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,055
You look great.
Do you want to have a look?

635
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,165
If you don't like it,
I can take you some more.

636
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,985
Don't bother.

No.

Are you bored?
Should we do something else?

641

Something else?

642
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,205
Hye-sun, do you want to go somewhere
and take some rest?

643
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,845
Shall we get inside now?

644
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:10,855

647

Well, we didn't get to talk much.

648
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,429
You may not believe this
because of our start,

649
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,719
but I like taking it slowly and properly.

650

We agreed to go out anyway,

- Let's go, Hye-sun.
- Seriously?

658
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:01,845
Why did you not answer my call?
I said I had something to say to you.

659
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:05,455
I don't have anything to say
nor to hear from you.

Don't you remember?

661
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,955
We broke up. You dumped me.

662
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,355
But you weren't like this before.

663
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,035
You don't even reply to my texts anymore.

664
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,309
You think I should always
answer your calls and texts

665
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:25,199
and listen to whatever you tell me to do?

666
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,705
You think that's my job?

667
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,215
Enough already. You've crossed the line.

668
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,025
Then let me ask you just one thing.

669
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,665
Are you two going out?

670
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,405
Yes. She's my girlfriend.

I'm sorry, Hye-sun.

672
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,905
I should have

673
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,675
just ignored her.

674
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,465
I ruined our first date.

675

Did you like her so much?

676

That's not what it is.

677
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:27,735
I was unsure if I could see anyone else
after breaking up with her.

678
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,325
I felt like
I couldn't trust anyone anymore

679
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:38,165

680
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,135

00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,329
Dam, why are you so late?

712
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:43,065
All the front seats are taken
because it's Professor Shin's lecture.

713
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,885
It's like an idol concert.
I barely managed to take this seat.

714
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,745
I'll sit in the back then.

715
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,335
I'll sit here. This is the only seat left.

716
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,665
Okay.

717
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:20,155
[ So the red thread is tying us together. ]

718
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,405
[ But why? ]

719
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,915
[ - Hello, Professor.
- Hello, Professor. ]

720
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,795
There are two views
about understanding historical events.

721
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:52,635
One argues that historical events
happened for real...

722
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,935
There was a piece of thread on.

723
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,195
Seon-woo, no matter what it is
that is on my hair,

724
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,715
unless it's threatening my life,
please don't touch me.

725
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,495
But...

726
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,489
Miss Dam.

727
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:35,079
Please don't get me wrong.
There was a piece of thread on my hair.

728
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,415
I didn't get it wrong.

729
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,805
I just wanted to see you up close.

730
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,215
From now on, please sit on the front seat
when you take my lecture.

731
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,445
But they are not facts.

732
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,065
Let's start with the first argument.

733
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,635
To quote a German historian of the 1800s,

734
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:29,075
"How things actually were is history."

735
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,145
Miss Dam.

736
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,565
Sir.

737
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,775
See?

738
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,449
This is what happens
when you mess with the destiny

739
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:15,955
that the deity has prepared for you.

740
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,455
Are you the one who tied the thread?

741
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:22,945
- Why...
- Consider yourself lucky.

742
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,515
You don't get to meet the one
tied with you by the red thread easily.

743
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:31,615
Don't you want to know

744
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,635
what your destiny is?

745
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:35,705
Does that mean

746
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:39,795
my destiny or future is all decided?

747
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,555
The deity cannot tell the future either.

748
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:49,215
But the deity can show
what might be the future.

749
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,155
I'll let you dream.

750
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,665
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

751
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,215
No, I'm fine.

752
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,575
Miss Dam.

753
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,375
What did you do?

754
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,835
I just let her dream.

755
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,285
A short dream, which will end
in a blink of an eye.

756
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,945
You're a mere animal.

757
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,645
Therefore you don't have
the right to decide your own destiny.

758
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:31,905
Whatever this girl chooses
for her destiny,

759
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,845
you have to accept it.

760
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,295
I'm sure you want to know
what she's seeing.

761
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:45,945
I'll let you see

762
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,675
what can be her future too.

763
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,355
Dam.

764
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,565
Wake up.

765
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:50,885
Stop

766
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,285
looking at that.

767
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,669
[ We appreciate
Shim Hyoung-tak, Go Kyung-pyo, ]

768
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,085
[ Son Sung-yoon, and Kang Mi-na
for their guest appearances. ]

769
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,855
[ My Roommate is a Gumiho ]

770
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:38,185
Their ordinary day looked nice.

771
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,819
Those are the things I can't give her.

772
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,889
I'll be away for two days, one night.

773
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:44,739
[ To be honest, I don't want you to go. ]

774
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,545
[ I wish you stay away from him. ]

775
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,655
[ One day, there will come a moment ]

776
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,615
[ when you can't stand
that you're actually a fox. ]

777
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:57,065
[ I felt that way
because of the red thread? ]

778
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:03,445
[ I want to be your ordinary future. ]
