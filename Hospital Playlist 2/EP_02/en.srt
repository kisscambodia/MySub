HOSPITAL PLAYLIST 2

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,941
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

3
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:20,701
Good morning, Dr. Jang.

4
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:21,994
Hey, good morning.

5
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,538
Nice, right on time.

6
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:26,206
I'm five minutes early.

7
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,085
I didn't expect there
to be a line already.

8
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:32,129
Why is everyone here at the crack of dawn?

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,049
I'd call this "morning."
It's five to seven.

10
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:43,140
I remember everything about you
all through middle and high school.

11
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:45,100
You were so cute even back then.

12
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:46,560
-<i>Liar.</i>
-What?

13
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:48,771
<i>You didn't even remember me.</i>

14
00:00:48,854 --> 00:00:52,357
<i>Ik-jun told me that you were confused
between me and Micky.</i>

15
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:54,860
You two talk about everything.

16
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:58,363
We always tell each other everything
that makes us laugh.

17
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:00,115
At work already? Did you just park?

18
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:02,409
Yeah, I have a conference
early in the morning.

19
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:04,620
Don't you usually go to work
with Jeong-won?

20
00:01:04,703 --> 00:01:06,789
He had to go in early
for an emergency surgery.

21
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:08,957
I'm going to buy him coffee.

22
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,252
Are you guys married or what?
You're so good to him.

23
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:15,172
I know, right?
Why am I doing this for Father Andrea

24
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,216
when I should be doing it for you?

25
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,593
Ik-sun, I'm getting in the elevator.
Hold on.

26
00:01:20,552 --> 00:01:22,054
Hold on a moment.

27
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:35,442
PICU

28
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:37,110
Please check Jeong-hun's JP drain

29
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:40,572
for any changes
and see if the output is increasing.

30
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:41,949
Will do, Professor.

31
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:47,579
I'll get one iced Americano,
one hot Americano and…

32
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,083
-A hot cappuccino, please.
-And one hot cappuccino.

33
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:53,877
Who's the second one for?

34
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:55,420
They're both for me.

35
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:57,131
I see.

36
00:01:57,714 --> 00:02:00,300
-Here you go. I have my professor's card.
-Really?

37
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,845
Yes, you should have come to GS too.

38
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:04,346
Good morning.

39
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:06,849
-Hi, guys.
-Good morning.

40
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:10,561
Good morning.

41
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:12,312
Yes, good morning.

42
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,192
-Aren't you cold?
-No.

43
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,862
-Here's your card.
-Thank you.

44
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,572
Which professor's card is it?

45
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:23,657
It can't be the chief's.

46
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,992
A professor's card?

47
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:26,827
-Is it yours?
-No.

48
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,078
Professor Lee Ik-jun.

49
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:30,956
I was on duty last night,
so he gave it to me to buy snacks.

50
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,916
Love's in the air in GS.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,334
Give me that.

52
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:38,088
You have to return it to him anyway.
I'll drop it off.

53
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:40,549
Okay.

54
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:45,178
Let's order everything on the menu
and put it on Ik-jun's card.

55
00:02:45,262 --> 00:02:46,930
I'll get everything from café mocha

56
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:50,142
to the sparkling tangerine-ade
at the bottom. One of each.

57
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:53,312
For every nurse in the PICU.

58
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:55,063
Then I'll get…

59
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,417
14,800 WON
DECEMBER 29, 7:00 A.M.

60
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,517
Darn it.

61
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:49,368
What's with Jang Gyeo-ul?

62
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:52,871
Is she having a premium steak
for breakfast? 182,000 won?

63
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:59,670
Wait, at the café on the second floor?

64
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:03,882
What?

65
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:07,052
What? I'm waiting for the elevator.

66
00:04:07,135 --> 00:04:08,553
I'm not in the elevator yet.

67
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:10,847
Don't act like you can't hear me.

68
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,432
By the way, who is it?

69
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:14,768
Who's having a steak at the café
with my card?

70
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:18,438
You'd better tell me.

71
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:21,233
I'm in the elevator now.
I'll call you back.

72
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:26,780
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

73
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:30,284
Why won't the doors close? I'm in a rush.

74
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,412
Jeez, nothing's going my way.

75
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:37,708
I hope she can hold out until Week 23.

76
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,835
-I know.
-Is her husband here too?

77
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,754
Yes, he took time off from work
to be with her.

78
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:47,175
-She really is putting in a lot of effort.
-I know.

79
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,511
She's feeling cooped up
but is not leaving her bed

80
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:52,806
and is even relieving herself
in the room just in case.

81
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,143
If we tell her this,
she won't be able to sleep.

82
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:58,270
We should still tell her though.

83
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:00,355
Okay.

84
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:04,985
Your cervix is a little open.

85
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:06,611
And because your baby is breech,

86
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:10,657
the ultrasound shows its feet
moving in and out of the cervix.

87
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:14,119
But they're not completely
out of the uterus.

88
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:18,165
Dr. Chu is monitoring it
throughout the day at the moment.

89
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:21,626
But if we find that your cervix
has dilated further by Week 23,

90
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,172
and if the baby's feet and umbilical cord
come out completely,

91
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:27,507
it may require emergency surgery.

92
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:28,675
Okay.

93
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:34,306
What should we do?

94
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:38,935
It's okay. He's just saying
it's a possibility.

95
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,228
The feet are not out yet.

96
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:41,646
Yes, that's right.

97
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:45,734
If you notice that your belly
feels tighter than usual

98
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:48,445
or experience bad cramps,
let us know right away.

99
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:50,322
We'll keep checking, of course,

100
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:52,532
but you'll most likely be the first
to feel it.

101
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:54,993
Okay.

102
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:58,121
We'll monitor everything more carefully.

103
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:00,749
We'll talk soon.

104
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:11,093
Keep checking the monitor
for signs of contractions.

105
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,302
Check for bleeding,

106
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:15,097
and see if she's feeling heaviness
in her pelvic region.

107
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:19,601
I really hope she can hold out
until Week 23.

108
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:24,981
Our goal is to get the baby out safely.

109
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:27,442
She'll need surgery
in case of notable decelerations

110
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:29,069
or cord prolapse at Week 23, okay?

111
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:31,196
-Yes.
-Double-check everything.

112
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,491
-I'm counting on you.
-Yes, Professor.

113
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:14,739
-Free this weekend?
-Why?

114
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:15,991
-We need to talk.
-Talk.

115
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:18,618
I'll tell you when we're all together.

116
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:22,205
Don't tell me…

117
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,001
you took out a private loan.

118
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:40,807
All right.

119
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:43,935
Ta-da!

120
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:46,354
-It looks delicious!
-Mom.

121
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:49,524
I'm having <i>ramyeon</i> for dinner.
I had a sandwich for lunch.

122
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:51,568
Jeong-won said
he has something to tell us.

123
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,820
Jeong-won makes the best <i>ramyeon.</i>

124
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:00,243
Oh, no. Hey, are you all right?

125
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:02,287
Are you okay?

126
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:07,334
I got it.

127
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:30,398
It's so sweet. It's really good.
Who bought these?

128
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:32,108
Me. They were on sale.

129
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:33,318
-Aren't they good?
-Yeah.

130
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,570
They're good,
but it looks like we should hurry.

131
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:36,738
Hurry and eat.

132
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:38,990
Why? Is someone else coming?

133
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,868
He'll perform surgery here.

134
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:45,747
How many times do you need
to clean your hands?

135
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,124
Do the strawberries need surgery?
Are they ill?

136
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,547
Eat, before these hungry bums
finish everything.

137
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:56,925
There's still a lot left.

138
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:02,222
Hey, it's so sweet.

139
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,518
It's like springtime.

140
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:09,312
What do you mean? It's January.
It's minus ten degrees Celsius out.

141
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:11,106
Maybe in his heart, it is.

142
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:14,818
Jeong-won, you said
you had something to tell us.

143
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,319
Isn't that why we're all here?

144
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:18,738
Yes.

145
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:22,969
Guys.

146
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:26,641
Jeong-won, you said
you had something to tell us.

147
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:28,142
Isn't that why we're all here?

148
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,561
Yes.

149
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:36,484
-Guys.
-Oh, do you have surgery on Thursday?

150
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,403
I heard it's for Yoo Gyeong-jin.

151
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:41,239
Who is Yoo Gyeong-jin?
You mean the violinist?

152
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:44,117
I know who it is, Yoo Yeong-jin.

153
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,619
-"Yoo Gyeong-jin."
-Right, Yoo Gyeong-jin.

154
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:48,329
Isn't she a famous musician?

155
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,164
Where does she live now?

156
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:51,958
-Who?
-Yoo Gyeong-jin.

157
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,751
Guys, listen carefully.

158
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:55,753
I'm only going to say it once. That's it.

159
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:56,879
Mapo.

160
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,506
-Wrong.
-Then Banpo?

161
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,050
I think she's based in Europe
and lives in Germany.

162
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:02,760
What's wrong with her?

163
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:04,595
I think she has a brain tumor.

164
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,763
She was tested there,

165
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:08,182
but she returned this week
to get surgery here.

166
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:11,561
Her mother and the hospital director
are close friends.

167
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,646
They don't care for famous doctors.

168
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:17,692
They asked for the best neurosurgeon
at our hospital.

169
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,610
And Song-hwa was chosen.

170
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:22,238
What? You're coming back again
this Thursday?

171
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:25,575
You should move to Hoengseong or Wonju.

172
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,994
Or get a room
near the Naerincheon Service Area.

173
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,746
I'll be back on Wednesday.

174
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,583
I need to meet the patient
the day before the surgery.

175
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,628
Seon-bin is updating me on the lab results
and the patient's condition.

176
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:41,007
That sounds intense.
I think you can just turn it down.

177
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,884
No, I want to do it.

178
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,094
I love doing VIP surgeries.

179
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:51,976
I used to do it out of a sense of duty
because of the agreement I had signed,

180
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:54,312
but something else
is keeping me motivated now.

181
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:55,980
What's that?

182
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:57,815
You don't need to know.

183
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,234
Anyway, I'll do my best,

184
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:02,695
so I can operate on more patients.

185
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:03,905
What do you mean?

186
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:06,324
It's nothing.

187
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:08,618
Hey, Jeong-won. Why aren't you talking?

188
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:12,288
Right, you called us here.
Stop eating strawberries and talk.

189
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,457
Did you call us
to have strawberries with us?

190
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:21,339
Don't even say a word from now on.
Just let me talk.

191
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:23,049
-Talk!
-Knock yourself out.

192
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:24,133
-Go for it.
-Go ahead.

193
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,218
-Tell us.
-What is it?

194
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,014
I'm seeing Gyeo-ul.

195
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,851
So am I.

196
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:37,063
I saw her yesterday and today too.
I see her every day.

197
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:38,022
No, I mean…

198
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:42,151
We're dating.

199
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:50,284
It's been about a month.

200
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:55,539
Is that why you decided to stay?

201
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,377
That was one of the biggest reasons.

202
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,962
I'm so happy for you.

203
00:12:01,796 --> 00:12:03,798
I always thought you'd make a good couple.

204
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,050
Thanks.

205
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,680
-Hey.
-Don't mind me.

206
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:14,684
I'm just happy for you.
You made the right decision.

207
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,312
No one can be happier than I am right now.

208
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:24,610
I already knew
because my mom told me last week.

209
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:26,696
You're very discreet.

210
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,323
Hey, how does your mother know?

211
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:31,701
Your mother probably told her.

212
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,868
I didn't know who, though.

213
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,499
We'll keep it a secret at the hospital.
Don't worry.

214
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:41,085
I want to tell everyone,

215
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:43,546
but I won't, for dear Gyeo-ul's sake.

216
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,256
What? "Dear Gyeo-ul"?

217
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:48,175
You can't say that anymore.
You'd better watch out.

218
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,846
I can.

219
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:54,598
You can't. You'd better watch out.

220
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:58,144
Right, okay.

221
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,417
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST 2

222
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:32,553
It won't be easy.

223
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:36,640
The location is bad.

224
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:40,978
This is my first olfactory groove
meningioma surgery, Professor.

225
00:13:41,062 --> 00:13:44,065
The symptoms are quite unusual.
You become lethargic and…

226
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:47,735
You have no energy
and lose interest in everything.

227
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:48,819
Frontal lobe syndrome.

228
00:13:48,903 --> 00:13:50,613
I know what it is.

229
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,865
-Look at you.
-I've been studying.

230
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:54,992
Well done.

231
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,953
-Shall we go meet her?
-Sure.

232
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:01,916
Heo Seon-bin speaking.

233
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,044
Got it.

234
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:07,755
The ER needs me.

235
00:14:07,838 --> 00:14:11,133
Hurry. I can do rounds by myself.

236
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,718
-Go, hurry.
-Okay.

237
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:18,557
By the way, Yoo Gyeong-jin's guardian.

238
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,309
Her mother…

239
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,022
She's intense.
I've never dealt with anyone like her.

240
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,069
This week alone, I went there
more than five times a day

241
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:32,029
to explain the symptoms in detail,

242
00:14:32,113 --> 00:14:34,198
book the time slots they wanted
for the tests,

243
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:36,200
and explain everything about the surgery.

244
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,035
Great. And?

245
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,580
But she didn't uncross her arms once.

246
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:45,501
I don't expect her to thank me,

247
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:49,380
but that doubtful look in her eyes…

248
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:53,300
The way she looks at me
screams that she doesn't trust me.

249
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:55,261
Hurry to the ER. What are you doing?

250
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:57,388
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,856
I'll go explain the situation
to Min-chan's mother.

252
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:09,024
I'll tell her.

253
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,155
I'm not seeing things.

254
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,407
You're stepping out often.

255
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,117
Professor.

256
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:22,079
Are you trying to encourage
or criticize me?

257
00:15:22,663 --> 00:15:24,039
Pick one.

258
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,417
Plus, this is the first time in a week.

259
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,503
They needed all the documents
for the loan by today.

260
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:31,172
-You're taking out a loan?
-Yes.

261
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,967
My wife's having a hard time
commuting from Paju,

262
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,636
and we haven't lived apart in so long,

263
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,306
so we decided to take out a loan
to rent an apartment.

264
00:15:41,182 --> 00:15:43,225
That scammer hasn't been caught, right?

265
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,020
No, but the police are still
on the lookout for him.

266
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:48,022
Are you off to see Eun-ji? I'll tag along.

267
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:50,232
-No. Min-chan, not Eun-ji.
-Min-chan?

268
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:54,195
A patient with DCMP.
We may need to implant another VAD.

269
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,281
DCMP? Then he must have a history.

270
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:00,409
He was told last year
that his heart wasn't beating properly

271
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:01,994
and that it was enlarged.

272
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:03,162
Did he come to the ER?

273
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:05,164
Yes, two days ago.

274
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:07,082
We've been monitoring him,

275
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,336
but the heart rhythm problem is
getting worse even with inotropes.

276
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:13,130
He needs something,
whether it's an ECMO or a VAD.

277
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:15,174
I want to use a VAD if it's approved soon.

278
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:19,762
He was playing in the playground
up until two days ago.

279
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,807
If his mother hears
that he now needs a heart transplant,

280
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,141
she'll be heartbroken.

281
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:26,894
I'll bring it up carefully.
I'm on my way to meet her now.

282
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:28,938
-How old is Min-chan?
-Four.

283
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,356
-Weight?
-He weighs 13kg…

284
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:33,776
What are you doing?

285
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:36,779
Why am I reporting this to you right now?

286
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:38,614
I don't know.

287
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:45,496
I'll be off, then.

288
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,924
A VAD is a mechanical pump
that's used to support heart function,

289
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:59,051
so it can't support the lungs,

290
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:03,138
whereas the ECMO replaces
the function of the heart and lungs.

291
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,986
So he needs to depend on a machine.

292
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,905
It means he's in serious condition, right?

293
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:22,199
Well…

294
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,037
I don't think his heart
can hold out any longer.

295
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:30,666
It's too risky to let him go on like this.

296
00:17:32,543 --> 00:17:35,004
Ultimately, he'll need a heart transplant.

297
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,298
He needs to be supported with a VAD

298
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:39,884
until we can find the right donor for him.

299
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:44,221
Could his condition improve

300
00:17:44,972 --> 00:17:47,850
with the VAD alone?

301
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,520
That can happen in some cases.

302
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:55,065
But the chances are slim,
so I don't want to get your hopes up.

303
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:59,069
The VAD is just temporary.
It's not a permanent solution.

304
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:02,197
So I can't say he'll recover
with the VAD alone.

305
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:05,784
It only supports heart function,

306
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:09,914
so many issues will arise
in the lungs such as infections.

307
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,084
If he can't hold out until it's approved,

308
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,881
we may need to put him on the ECMO
as an emergency measure.

309
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,059
But at the moment,
I think the VAD is the best solution

310
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:35,439
to help Min-chan hold out
until we find the right donor for him.

311
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:38,442
I'll get the screening started today.

312
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:41,111
The results will be out
in three to four days.

313
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:45,950
Our coordinator will walk you through
the steps and costs.

314
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:50,537
Okay.

315
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,959
We'll do our best.

316
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:19,233
A VAD is a mechanical pump
that's used to support heart function,

317
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:20,943
so it can't support the lungs.

318
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,406
Hello, Professor. I'm Jang Hong-do.

319
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:26,824
Yes, hi.

320
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:31,954
You're shadowing Dr. Im Chang-min, right?

321
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,708
Yes, I'm shadowing him
in Cardiothoracic Surgery.

322
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,503
-Professor, a VAD is--
-It looks like you know.

323
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,590
Then how is a pediatric VAD different?

324
00:19:46,844 --> 00:19:48,387
-Well…
-How are the ones in the ICU

325
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,639
different from the ones
you've seen in the PICU?

326
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:02,735
Have the answer ready
the next time I see you.

327
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:14,329
It's okay.

328
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,248
It's okay.

329
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,292
Everything will be okay.

330
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:24,590
My kid has had a VAD
for over three months now.

331
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:30,220
And she's staying strong.

332
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,931
I see.

333
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,434
This is like a marathon.

334
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:41,982
We're like marathoners.

335
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,486
It has only just begun.

336
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:48,447
Come on. You're a mother.
You can't break down so soon.

337
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:53,160
Your kid's staying strong,
and so should you.

338
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:56,830
Thank you.

339
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:03,712
And about Professor Kim Jun-wan…
He's blunt and to the point,

340
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,132
but he's very thorough.
He's a wonderful person.

341
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:10,928
I've been observing him
for over three months.

342
00:21:12,346 --> 00:21:13,347
I see.

343
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:16,183
Every time my dear Eun-ji faced a hurdle,

344
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,852
he helped and protected her
so she could overcome it.

345
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:25,192
So only think positive thoughts.

346
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,362
Trust that your child
can get through this.

347
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:39,414
Cheer up, okay?

348
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,042
The real marathon begins now.

349
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:45,879
Yes, thank you.

350
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:02,563
Hello.

351
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:05,149
Ms. Yoo Gyeong-jin, right?

352
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:06,775
Yes, hello.

353
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,486
I heard you had a headache. How is it now?

354
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,863
I still have it.

355
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,490
-My head still hurts a little.
-I see.

356
00:22:14,074 --> 00:22:15,242
And you feel listless.

357
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:19,037
That's right. I don't want to do anything.

358
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:23,375
The tumor in front of the brain
can cause listlessness and lethargy.

359
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,963
We suspect that you have
an olfactory groove meningioma.

360
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:31,884
The symptoms include fatigue,
listlessness, and headaches.

361
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:35,679
Her condition seems to have gotten worse
since coming here.

362
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:38,765
I asked for pain meds
to get rid of her pain at least,

363
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:41,226
but what you gave her
wore off in half a day.

364
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:47,065
I came all this way because
of a recommendation, but I'm so worried.

365
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:53,280
We can't prescribe pain medications
every time patients or guardians ask.

366
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,951
They can cause liver damage
and gastrointestinal bleeding,

367
00:22:58,035 --> 00:23:00,120
so we can't go over the approved amounts.

368
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:02,122
Yes, I know that much.

369
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:06,168
Then I'll see you in the evening.

370
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,920
You have to sign the consent form,

371
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:10,547
and we'll go over a few things
before your surgery.

372
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,549
I'll see you later.

373
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,723
Where's the professor
who's operating tomorrow?

374
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:22,517
They keep sending these young residents.

375
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:26,188
The professor is in Sokcho now.

376
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:29,149
She'll probably get here tonight.

377
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:32,861
I'm excited to meet her.

378
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:36,323
The tenth female Professor of Neurosurgery
in the country.

379
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,951
I even like her name, Chae Song-hwa.

380
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,787
Isn't that impressive?

381
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:45,666
We'll have to see.

382
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:50,462
Gosh, we donated so much money
to this hospital.

383
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:53,006
I'm sure Mr. Kettle gave you
the best neurosurgeon

384
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:55,634
if he has a conscience.

385
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,224
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

386
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:11,024
You're still here?

387
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:13,360
Yes, I want to see a patient
before I head out.

388
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,029
It's Yoo Gyeong-jin.

389
00:24:16,113 --> 00:24:17,447
Is it a difficult surgery?

390
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:20,659
Olfactory groove meningioma.

391
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,120
I'm sure you've heard of it.

392
00:24:23,954 --> 00:24:28,166
It's a meningioma in the olfactory nerve,
just like the name suggests.

393
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:30,794
But the tumor is located pretty deep.

394
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:35,132
-Are you on duty tonight?
-Yes, I am.

395
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:39,177
But you're not. You should go home early.

396
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:41,346
I will,
after I check in on Yoo Gyeong-jin.

397
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:45,058
She must be very nervous
about the surgery.

398
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:48,812
Song-hwa, you really are…

399
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:54,276
How can you be so focused
whenever you start something?

400
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:57,362
You should never be put in charge
of anything.

401
00:24:58,405 --> 00:25:01,908
I had five phone calls about
Daddy-Long-Legs this month.

402
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:03,702
I need to work harder.

403
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:06,538
To turn all your plans into reality,

404
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:08,373
I definitely need to work harder.

405
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:10,751
If you're going to keep this up,
I'm really…

406
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,919
I'm going to take it off your plate.

407
00:25:13,003 --> 00:25:16,548
I don't want your life to be
consumed by work because of it.

408
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:18,008
But I love it.

409
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,844
Please, keep me on it.

410
00:25:25,015 --> 00:25:28,226
There aren't many patients in Sokcho,
so I have time to work on it.

411
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,729
Timing-wise, it's perfect.

412
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,397
Oh, boy.

413
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:35,942
You're too busy these days.
You're taking care of all the surgeries.

414
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:39,154
Without you, the entire Pediatric Surgery
will shut down.

415
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:42,032
Where will all the kids
in the PICU and NICU go?

416
00:25:44,785 --> 00:25:46,495
I should've asked Ik-jun to do it.

417
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:48,747
He's busy too.

418
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,833
He's had transplant surgeries
for two days in a row.

419
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:13,522
Have we picked a song for this week?

420
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:16,858
Yes, but I'm not telling you.

421
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,695
It's in our group chat, you freak.

422
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:25,117
Nothing's going my way.

423
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:27,953
Jeez, what is this?

424
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,129
-What was that?
-What?

425
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:38,380
What was that?

426
00:26:38,922 --> 00:26:40,549
-Nothing.
-What? It was you.

427
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,008
No, it wasn't me.

428
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:44,886
That was just her ringtone.

429
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:48,140
What's this twerp saying?
Are you confused?

430
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:49,683
Hey, it's me.

431
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:51,768
I know you're Daddy-Long-Legs.

432
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:56,189
Oh, right. You already know.

433
00:26:56,273 --> 00:26:58,316
-He knows.
-How?

434
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,235
How did you know?

435
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:01,736
Is that important now?

436
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:07,159
I'm going to be Daddy-Long-Legs
from now on.

437
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:10,745
You? But you're short.

438
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:12,622
Jeez, that was lame.

439
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:16,376
Wasn't it kind of funny?

440
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:20,505
You like his jokes.

441
00:27:21,965 --> 00:27:25,260
Anyway, I'm Daddy-Long-Legs now.
It's been decided.

442
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:28,180
Don't tell anyone, okay?

443
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,435
Okay, I heard you.
Take off that pain relief patch, will you?

444
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,646
This is part of me now.

445
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,981
It's like a tattoo.

446
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,863
Hey, I'm coming now.

447
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:49,910
Hey, whether it's a tattoo
or whatever else…

448
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:52,329
Take it easy, okay?

449
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,795
Has Seok-min lost his mind?

450
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,464
Why? The two of us can do it.

451
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,342
The fellow was really stressed out,

452
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:07,469
so Seok-min volunteered to scrub in.

453
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,847
His wife's surgery is tomorrow,
and it's for cancer.

454
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:14,226
He won't be able to focus,
so Seok-min volunteered to cover for him.

455
00:28:15,101 --> 00:28:16,770
Did you tell him?

456
00:28:16,853 --> 00:28:19,689
No, he knew about it
even before I told him.

457
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,277
He went through hoops to get out of here.

458
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:26,780
Why volunteer to come back?

459
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:33,286
This surgery is for a brain tumor,
and it'll be open brain surgery.

460
00:28:33,954 --> 00:28:36,039
The tumor is located deep,
so there are risks,

461
00:28:36,122 --> 00:28:38,208
and you may lose a lot of blood.

462
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:40,543
After the surgery, you may experience

463
00:28:40,627 --> 00:28:43,004
unexpected neurological complications
or infection.

464
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,925
I'll go over the details
when you sign the consent form.

465
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:48,677
Okay.

466
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,264
You must be very nervous.

467
00:28:52,973 --> 00:28:53,974
Yes.

468
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,893
My team is very experienced,

469
00:28:56,977 --> 00:28:59,521
and we'll be fully prepared,
so don't worry.

470
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,855
Doctor.

471
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:04,818
I know the hospital director very well.

472
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:08,613
Are you well versed in this type of tumor
and how to treat it?

473
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,617
I have many questions about it.

474
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,287
I'd like to speak to someone

475
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,415
who's more knowledgeable
and can give us an in-depth explanation.

476
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:21,126
When will the professor be here
and go over it with us?

477
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,545
Professor Chae Song-hwa.

478
00:29:25,422 --> 00:29:26,881
The surgery is tomorrow.

479
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,927
Shouldn't she go over everything with us
the day before the surgery?

480
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,764
I am Chae Song-hwa.

481
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,186
I'm Professor Chae Song-hwa.

482
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:42,647
Oh, I see.

483
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:45,400
This is Professor Chae Song-hwa.

484
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,241
My gosh, Professor Chae. You're so young.

485
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,744
I thought you were a resident.

486
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:01,291
I think your daughter has
an intracranial meningioma.

487
00:30:01,374 --> 00:30:03,877
It's a brain tumor.

488
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,087
We'll remove the tumor during the surgery.

489
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:08,465
The tumor is pretty big,

490
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:10,800
and it's a long, complicated surgery,

491
00:30:10,884 --> 00:30:12,927
so there could be
post-surgical complications.

492
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:16,097
We'll need to monitor her in the ICU
after the surgery.

493
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:19,184
But this meningioma

494
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:21,936
is a benign tumor,
so don't worry too much.

495
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,230
Okay, thank you.

496
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:29,861
And ma'am.

497
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:36,117
The residents are neurosurgeons too.

498
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:40,497
They studied this field
for almost or over ten years.

499
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:44,417
They have all the necessary
medical knowledge,

500
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:47,837
and they actually know more
about the patients than I do.

501
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:51,549
So they'll be able to answer
all of your questions.

502
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:53,134
Right.

503
00:30:56,596 --> 00:30:59,683
You need to sleep well
to be ready for the surgery tomorrow.

504
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:02,477
We'll be fully prepared,
so see you tomorrow with smiles on.

505
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:04,396
Okay, Professor.

506
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:06,314
Good night.

507
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:19,244
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

508
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,541
Hello, how are you feeling today?

509
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,001
Doctor.

510
00:31:27,877 --> 00:31:31,339
Gosh, my belly feels tight today.

511
00:31:32,215 --> 00:31:36,261
It feels a little heavy down there.

512
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:41,975
I can feel something running…

513
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,519
Just a moment. I'll check right away.

514
00:31:45,395 --> 00:31:46,855
MATERNAL FETAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

515
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,024
Nurse! Can I have a speculum set? Hurry!

516
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:54,404
Professor Yang,
Kim Su-jeong's baby is in the external os.

517
00:31:54,487 --> 00:31:57,115
Both the feet and the cord are out.
She needs surgery now.

518
00:31:57,198 --> 00:31:59,868
Get ready and call Pediatrics now.
I'll be right there.

519
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,746
Tell Anesthesiology
that she'll need general anesthesia.

520
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,790
Sorry, I have emergency surgery.
My apologies.

521
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:07,208
It's okay.

522
00:32:16,092 --> 00:32:17,177
Let's move her quickly.

523
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,512
We're ready, right?
Can we go ahead and drape her?

524
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:20,889
DRAPING: STERILIZATION

525
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:35,904
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

526
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,189
-Why do you look so serious?
-Hey.

527
00:33:11,272 --> 00:33:12,941
What kind of surgery do you have?

528
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:16,903
It's for ALCAPA, an anomalous left
coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.

529
00:33:16,986 --> 00:33:20,448
But the heart rhythm is uneven,
and the coronary artery is pretty far.

530
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,575
I'm not sure if I can do this.
I'm worried.

531
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:26,246
It's likely that the patient will leave
the OR with the chest open or on ECMO.

532
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:30,917
Anyway, wish me luck.

533
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:35,505
Wish me luck too.

534
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:43,513
This patient, Kim Jang-ho.

535
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:46,599
The immunosuppressant levels are too high.

536
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:49,602
I told him to come back in two weeks
because they were low.

537
00:33:49,686 --> 00:33:52,438
I think he's been drinking again.

538
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:56,818
Who?

539
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,404
He had a liver transplant
from his daughter a year ago.

540
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:01,865
And from his elder daughter
three years ago.

541
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,950
What?

542
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:05,827
Let me examine the next patient first.

543
00:34:06,536 --> 00:34:07,537
Sure.

544
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,666
-Mr. Choi Sang-ha.
-Yes.

545
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,918
Let me check your name
and registration number.

546
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:16,629
It's 3978654…

547
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:24,470
Then I'll remove it
while you're holding him like that.

548
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:27,640
Yes, it looks like
you'll just have to do it like this.

549
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:30,184
Seung-won, it won't hurt at all.

550
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,687
The doctor will remove
all the stitches for you today.

551
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,649
Let's see.

552
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,361
No, it hurts!

553
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,113
Hold on.

554
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:45,283
There, it's done!
It's all done, Seung-won.

555
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,244
See? It didn't hurt at all.

556
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,080
I have to say, the wound looks clean.

557
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:52,165
Here.

558
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,045
It'll sting a little, Seung-won.
But it'll be quick, okay?

559
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,172
Today, we have to remove…

560
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:02,216
One, two, three, four, five…

561
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,135
We have to remove seven stitches today.

562
00:35:04,218 --> 00:35:06,804
It's okay, Seung-won.
It'll be done before you know it.

563
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:11,309
I'm going to disinfect it first.
This will feel nice and cool.

564
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:15,647
No! Stop! I don't like this. It hurts!

565
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,190
I don't want to do this!

566
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:19,859
Seung-won, it doesn't hurt at all.
It feels nice.

567
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:23,404
No! Stop! I don't like this!

568
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,490
I don't want to do this!

569
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,200
It feels nice and cool.

570
00:35:27,283 --> 00:35:29,118
There, it's done. It's all done.

571
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:32,205
Doesn't it feel nice?
It doesn't hurt at all.

572
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,624
So far, so good.

573
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,043
You're doing great, Seung-won.

574
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:39,212
All right.

575
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:42,340
It hurts!

576
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:46,052
No! Stop! I said I don't want to do this!

577
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:48,471
Seung-won, it doesn't hurt at all.

578
00:35:48,554 --> 00:35:51,474
Be honest.
The doctor hasn't even done anything yet.

579
00:35:51,557 --> 00:35:53,434
Stay still, so he can be quick.

580
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:54,978
If not, it'll take forever.

581
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:57,605
I'll do it quickly
and make sure it doesn't hurt.

582
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:01,109
No! I don't want to do this!

583
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:06,030
Seung-won, the doctor hasn't even done
anything yet, okay?

584
00:36:06,614 --> 00:36:08,950
He can't even get started
because you keep crying.

585
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:15,957
No! Stop! It hurts!

586
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:22,088
This won't work. Step out and do something
that will put you in a better mood.

587
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:27,719
Ma'am, I'll treat the other kids first.

588
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:31,222
Why don't you step out with Seung-won
and make him feel better?

589
00:36:32,348 --> 00:36:35,685
And it looks like you'll have to
negotiate with him a little.

590
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,604
Okay, Professor Ahn.

591
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:41,232
I'm sorry.

592
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:44,527
Get down.

593
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,495
-You can let Da-eun in.
-Okay.

594
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:06,966
The adhesion is quite strong.

595
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,886
Gosh, I'm having a hard time
dissecting the tumor.

596
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,181
Should I pull it this way
with the retractor?

597
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,515
Yes, please.

598
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,024
Don't touch the heart.

599
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:25,276
It'll cause fibrillation.

600
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,111
FIBRILLATION: VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION

601
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:29,572
I'll tent the pericardium now.

602
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:31,157
TECHNIQUE FOR CREATING A PERICARDIAL TENT

603
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:38,706
We did a biopsy during the surgery
and confirmed that it's not cancerous.

604
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:42,335
We did everything we could,

605
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:44,921
so keep taking your meds,
and we'll see how it goes.

606
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,423
-Thank you, Professor Lee.
-No problem.

607
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,518
Is Mr. Kim Jang-ho next?

608
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:00,728
Yes.

609
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:05,108
Hello, Professor Lee.

610
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:07,068
-Hello.
-Hello.

611
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,002
Mr. Kim, have you been taking
your medications?

612
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:26,963
Yes, of course.

613
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:30,758
It doesn't seem like you have.

614
00:38:34,554 --> 00:38:37,306
The immunosuppressant levels are too high.

615
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,808
Maybe you suddenly

616
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,019
started taking them
because of this appointment.

617
00:38:42,812 --> 00:38:44,147
No, not at all.

618
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,356
Mr. Kim.

619
00:38:46,899 --> 00:38:48,734
I think you've been drinking again.

620
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:50,736
No.

621
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:52,572
Not at all.

622
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:57,869
Please. These numbers
are telling me the truth.

623
00:38:57,952 --> 00:38:59,328
Your blood work shows it all.

624
00:38:59,412 --> 00:39:01,122
How much did you drink?

625
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:05,835
Just a little. I only drank a little.

626
00:39:07,003 --> 00:39:08,504
How many bottles at a time?

627
00:39:08,588 --> 00:39:09,881
A bottle and a half…

628
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:14,760
A bottle and a half? Give me a break.

629
00:39:14,844 --> 00:39:16,804
I wasn't going to drink any.

630
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:19,640
I went out for dinner,
but my friends forced me to drink.

631
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,810
Did you tell them
that you've had a liver transplant?

632
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,520
Yes, I told them.

633
00:39:24,604 --> 00:39:29,275
Who tells their friend to drink,
knowing he's had a liver transplant?

634
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:33,905
I wouldn't call that person a friend.

635
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,073
Professor Lee.

636
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:42,413
He drank five days straight,
last week alone.

637
00:39:42,496 --> 00:39:44,582
Every time,
he drinks until the crack of dawn.

638
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,959
How could he do this?

639
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:49,587
No one in his right mind would do this!

640
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,215
Why bring up such nonsense? Be quiet!

641
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:02,183
You're Ms. Kim Su-jeong's husband, right?

642
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,268
Yes, how did it go?

643
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,145
I'm Kim U-jae in Pediatrics.

644
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:10,358
I heard the staff in OB-GYN worked hard
to help you keep the baby,

645
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,693
but the fetus was too young,

646
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,488
and the situation was worse
than we had expected.

647
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,866
Unfortunately, we were unable
to send the baby to the NICU.

648
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,660
It didn't go well.

649
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:24,789
We did our best,

650
00:40:25,581 --> 00:40:27,959
but we couldn't save the baby.

651
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:35,258
How's my wife? Is she okay?

652
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:39,720
Professor Yang is operating on Ms. Kim
at the moment.

653
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,974
He'll update you on everything
when he's out of the OR.

654
00:40:57,446 --> 00:40:58,823
Pass me the thread.

655
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:00,950
Her vitals are okay, right?

656
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:02,410
Yes, they seem fine.

657
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:03,995
Okay.

658
00:41:07,623 --> 00:41:13,838
I'll start counting.
One, two, three, four, five,

659
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:18,217
six, seven, eight, nine…

660
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:33,274
It hurts!

661
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:37,486
It hurts so much! I said it hurts!

662
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,114
He needs to do this
to make your pain go away.

663
00:41:40,614 --> 00:41:42,908
He promised that it'll be quick
and painless.

664
00:41:42,992 --> 00:41:44,368
It'll only take a moment.

665
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:46,704
It'll sting three times. That's it.

666
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:51,000
Seung-won, I'll make sure
it doesn't hurt at all. All right.

667
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:55,504
It hurts! I don't want to do this!

668
00:41:55,588 --> 00:41:59,133
I said I don't want to do this!
I hate this!

669
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,763
Park Seung-won,
are you going to keep this up?

670
00:42:04,263 --> 00:42:06,724
The doctor can't do anything
because of you!

671
00:42:07,475 --> 00:42:10,311
He did your surgery and treated you.
Must you do this?

672
00:42:21,322 --> 00:42:23,991
It's okay. I can take care
of the other appointments first.

673
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,327
Why don't you try to calm him down?

674
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,414
You can come back
after my last appointment.

675
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,293
Talk to him
and try to calm him down again.

676
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:36,212
Come back in anytime if he's ready.

677
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,172
Okay, thank you.

678
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,841
My goodness.

679
00:42:42,843 --> 00:42:46,097
Let's go, Seung-won. I'm sorry.

680
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,683
The patient's losing quite a bit of blood.

681
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,394
What's the BP now?

682
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:53,312
It's dropping. It's 90 over 70 now.

683
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,108
If we have blood ready, go get it quickly.

684
00:42:57,191 --> 00:42:58,192
Sure.

685
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,291
The doctor from Pediatrics came

686
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:20,089
and performed CPR on the baby
for 20 to 30 minutes,

687
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:24,051
but that failed as the baby was too young.

688
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:34,937
You've been doing so well
for almost four weeks.

689
00:43:37,273 --> 00:43:39,483
We did our best,

690
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:41,902
but we're sorry that this happened.

691
00:43:42,695 --> 00:43:46,782
Ms. Kim, you should focus
on your recovery now.

692
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:51,036
You were under general anesthesia,

693
00:43:51,745 --> 00:43:54,165
so we're going to focus
on helping you recover…

694
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,293
from the surgery.

695
00:44:34,914 --> 00:44:37,082
Mr. Kim, we met three years ago.

696
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:40,294
Yes. You saved my life back then, Doctor.

697
00:44:41,003 --> 00:44:42,546
Three years ago,

698
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,050
when you collapsed while drinking
and lost consciousness,

699
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:47,635
your eldest daughter became your donor.

700
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:51,222
Doctor.

701
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:54,808
It's all my fault, Doctor.

702
00:44:55,643 --> 00:44:56,977
What did you do after that?

703
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:00,773
You started drinking again.

704
00:45:02,107 --> 00:45:05,110
So your younger daughter had to
donate her liver last year.

705
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:06,195
And you're back at it?

706
00:45:13,702 --> 00:45:17,248
Your children volunteered,
but you should not take it for granted.

707
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:18,749
Okay?

708
00:45:23,295 --> 00:45:25,381
It rarely happens now
thanks to the technology,

709
00:45:25,464 --> 00:45:28,384
but many people died
during liver surgeries back in the day.

710
00:45:28,968 --> 00:45:31,303
Donors have to risk their lives
to get the surgery.

711
00:45:31,387 --> 00:45:33,597
Your daughters risked their lives for you.

712
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:37,268
Countless people die
because they can't find donors.

713
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:41,689
I'm sorry.

714
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,400
If you come back here
with liver damage again,

715
00:45:44,483 --> 00:45:46,610
you'll have to find
a brain-dead liver donor.

716
00:45:46,694 --> 00:45:48,946
But why should I bother
if you'll drink again?

717
00:45:51,156 --> 00:45:53,867
For the sake of the donor
and the donor's family…

718
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,703
I can't. I refuse.

719
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,664
You'll drink again anyway.

720
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,916
I refuse to treat you from now on.

721
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,545
I'll refer you to a clinic near your home,
so please…

722
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:07,381
don't come back.

723
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,634
Professor Lee, I'm sorry.

724
00:46:11,552 --> 00:46:15,723
I won't drink again. Never, I promise.

725
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:17,891
I'm sorry.

726
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,518
The next patient, please.

727
00:46:20,853 --> 00:46:21,854
Okay.

728
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,655
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

729
00:46:32,948 --> 00:46:34,825
I think we're almost done.

730
00:46:34,908 --> 00:46:37,578
Yes, Professor. It looks good.

731
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,965
The heartbeat is strong and solid.

732
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,426
Thank goodness.

733
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:55,429
We can close up the chest.
We won't need an ECMO.

734
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,222
Let's keep this up.

735
00:46:57,806 --> 00:46:58,682
Okay.

736
00:47:03,604 --> 00:47:04,688
Goodness.

737
00:47:10,152 --> 00:47:11,487
Gosh.

738
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,131
ANESTHESIA DURATION, CURRENT TIME,
ELAPSED TIME

739
00:47:39,306 --> 00:47:41,183
Do you see that the tumor's been removed?

740
00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:42,768
Yes, Professor.

741
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,563
You can remove the microscope now.

742
00:47:46,647 --> 00:47:47,773
Got it.

743
00:47:49,525 --> 00:47:52,069
What's the BP now? Is the blood going in?

744
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:53,445
Yes, everything looks fine.

745
00:47:56,156 --> 00:47:57,408
That was a hard one.

746
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:01,036
We'll close up the dura and the rest.

747
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,747
We'll take care of the rest, Professor.

748
00:48:04,498 --> 00:48:07,376
Okay. Close up the dura thoroughly
so the CSF won't leak.

749
00:48:08,043 --> 00:48:10,421
Keep the bleeding under control
and wrap it up well.

750
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:11,630
Will do.

751
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,763
We removed the tumor.

752
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:25,436
Thank you, Professor Chae.

753
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:27,020
Thank you. Thank you so much.

754
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,022
Thank you so much.

755
00:48:29,648 --> 00:48:33,318
A resident doctor is wrapping up
the surgery at the moment.

756
00:48:33,402 --> 00:48:35,404
The patient will be moved to the ICU soon.

757
00:48:35,487 --> 00:48:37,489
I'll check in on her
when she's in the ICU.

758
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:40,492
Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.

759
00:48:40,576 --> 00:48:41,869
Thank you.

760
00:49:03,765 --> 00:49:06,477
Why are you sitting out here all alone
on this cold day?

761
00:49:07,686 --> 00:49:09,646
What about you?

762
00:49:17,946 --> 00:49:20,532
I just have a lot on my mind.

763
00:49:28,457 --> 00:49:29,291
The baby…

764
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:33,629
I guess you couldn't save it.

765
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:46,767
It happens very rarely.

766
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:50,896
A baby expiring as soon as it's out
in the OR.

767
00:49:55,442 --> 00:49:57,319
The mother did her very best

768
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:01,365
to keep the baby until Week 23.

769
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,045
I have to go do rounds now,

770
00:50:17,923 --> 00:50:19,716
but I really don't want to.

771
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,718
I know what you mean.

772
00:50:29,935 --> 00:50:31,770
I'm at a loss for words.

773
00:50:35,274 --> 00:50:38,318
There's nothing I can say to comfort her.

774
00:50:40,654 --> 00:50:42,823
I really have no idea…

775
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,618
what I should say to her.

776
00:51:05,554 --> 00:51:09,683
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

777
00:51:18,191 --> 00:51:20,152
-Hello?
-<i>Hey, you.</i>

778
00:51:20,235 --> 00:51:21,528
Ik-sun, before the surgery,

779
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:24,656
I had thought the patient would need
the heart-lung machine,

780
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,783
but the heart was beating so well after…

781
00:51:30,162 --> 00:51:31,330
Are you okay?

782
00:51:31,413 --> 00:51:34,625
-<i>I had an encounter with a racist earlier.</i>
-What?

783
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:37,127
<i>I went to a café earlier</i>

784
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:40,255
<i>and ordered a latte.</i>

785
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:42,382
<i>But the person taking my order
kept asking me,</i>

786
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,301
<i>as if she couldn't understand me.</i>

787
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:47,092
<i>I only said two words,
"Latte, please".</i>

788
00:51:48,263 --> 00:51:50,307
<i>I'm pissed right now.</i>

789
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,517
Did you confront them and call them out?

790
00:51:52,601 --> 00:51:55,020
<i>I was so flustered
that I couldn't say anything.</i>

791
00:51:55,103 --> 00:51:57,564
<i>I told Se-gyeong about it
after I left the café,</i>

792
00:51:57,648 --> 00:52:00,025
<i>and Se-gyeong said what I experienced
was racism.</i>

793
00:52:00,942 --> 00:52:02,819
<i>I'm really upset.</i>

794
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:06,823
<i>By the way,
weren't you saying something earlier?</i>

795
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,535
Right, it was nothing important.

796
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,164
Did you have lunch? Not yet, probably.

797
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:18,251
I see. I should have dinner too.

798
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,836
Right.

799
00:52:39,147 --> 00:52:41,650
-Hello.
-Hello, Professor Chae.

800
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,528
I just checked the CT scan.

801
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:47,948
It shows that the tumor
has been completely removed.

802
00:52:49,658 --> 00:52:51,868
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

803
00:52:51,952 --> 00:52:53,370
Everything went as planned.

804
00:52:53,453 --> 00:52:55,831
And she's waking up from anesthesia now.

805
00:52:56,581 --> 00:52:58,792
It is still a bit too early
to say anything,

806
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,586
but we'll see how she recovers
in the ICU for a day or two

807
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,755
and move her back to the room
if all's good.

808
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:04,923
Okay, thank you.

809
00:53:05,006 --> 00:53:06,633
Thank you so much, Professor Chae.

810
00:53:08,135 --> 00:53:10,262
Our residents will monitor her thoroughly,

811
00:53:10,345 --> 00:53:13,890
and I'll check in on her often as well,
so please don't worry.

812
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:16,768
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

813
00:53:16,852 --> 00:53:17,853
We'll talk again soon.

814
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,494
<i>Third floor.</i>

815
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,622
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

816
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,959
Professor Chae, you're still here?

817
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,670
I saw the patient, so I'll get going.

818
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:47,299
Don't tell me you'll go to Sokcho
at this hour.

819
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:49,384
I'm going to leave in an hour.

820
00:53:49,468 --> 00:53:51,928
But I'll come back right after
my morning appointments.

821
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:54,473
I have to check in on her
for postoperative hemorrhage.

822
00:53:54,556 --> 00:53:55,891
What?

823
00:53:55,974 --> 00:54:00,061
Then can't you move those appointments
to another day? My goodness.

824
00:54:00,145 --> 00:54:03,190
I can't. I only take
outpatient appointments once a week.

825
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:06,860
Some patients come all the way
from Samcheok and Donghae.

826
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,779
I'll be back quickly.

827
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:11,615
Get some sleep before you leave.
You were in surgery all day.

828
00:54:11,698 --> 00:54:13,408
I'll sleep when I get there.

829
00:54:13,492 --> 00:54:15,202
Good job today, Seon-bin.

830
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,162
Thank you for everything, Professor Chae.

831
00:54:18,872 --> 00:54:20,457
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

832
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,042
Hello.

833
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:06,002
How are you feeling?

834
00:55:34,906 --> 00:55:36,074
Hello, ma'am.

835
00:55:36,157 --> 00:55:37,409
Hello.

836
00:55:38,743 --> 00:55:39,953
You're still here.

837
00:55:40,829 --> 00:55:41,997
Where is Seung-won?

838
00:55:42,956 --> 00:55:45,417
He went to get dinner with his dad.

839
00:55:46,001 --> 00:55:47,460
I see.

840
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:48,545
I didn't go…

841
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:51,131
because I was so angry at him.

842
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,641
We couldn't even remove
the stitches today.

843
00:56:02,642 --> 00:56:04,603
He just tired you out.

844
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:09,941
I'm so upset.

845
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,697
I wonder what's wrong with him.

846
00:56:16,197 --> 00:56:18,241
Why can't he just suck it up and do it?

847
00:56:19,868 --> 00:56:21,077
Gosh…

848
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:25,248
Oh, boy.

849
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:28,752
Ma'am.

850
00:56:30,503 --> 00:56:34,299
Seung-won even endured
and recovered from his cancer surgery.

851
00:56:38,053 --> 00:56:42,682
He's had to endure a lot of pain,
so he must know more about it than we do.

852
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:47,520
I understand why you're upset.

853
00:56:48,355 --> 00:56:51,399
But you came this far
because you've been so patient with him

854
00:56:51,483 --> 00:56:53,693
and have been taking
such great care of him.

855
00:56:54,235 --> 00:56:56,404
So, removing a few stitches…

856
00:56:57,155 --> 00:57:00,825
Compared to the time when he was ill
and had to go through surgery,

857
00:57:00,909 --> 00:57:04,788
what happened today is nothing
compared to that.

858
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,543
I'm totally fine,

859
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:14,255
so please don't worry about it.

860
00:57:15,382 --> 00:57:17,676
We can try again in about a week.

861
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:28,186
Professor Ahn.

862
00:57:29,562 --> 00:57:31,356
Do you know what people call you?

863
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,066
Pardon me?

864
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,068
You're Catholic,

865
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:37,612
but your nickname is Buddha.

866
00:57:38,238 --> 00:57:39,239
Oh, that.

867
00:57:43,868 --> 00:57:44,869
Professor Ahn.

868
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:49,541
I heard rumors that you may be quitting.
It's not true, right?

869
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:53,545
Why would I quit? No, it's not true.

870
00:57:54,629 --> 00:57:55,630
Thank goodness.

871
00:58:00,302 --> 00:58:01,386
You know,

872
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:04,222
the thought of you leaving this hospital

873
00:58:04,306 --> 00:58:07,600
worries me more
than my husband quitting his job.

874
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:12,063
I'll remove Seung-won's stitches

875
00:58:12,147 --> 00:58:15,108
and stay here
until he graduates from high school,

876
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:18,570
so don't you worry about a thing.
Just go have dinner now.

877
00:58:20,155 --> 00:58:22,532
Seung-won must be waiting for you.

878
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:27,662
Thank you, Professor Ahn.

879
00:58:29,956 --> 00:58:30,832
Go on.

880
00:58:33,752 --> 00:58:35,253
-I'll get going, then.
-Bye.

883
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:27,972
<i>Like the flowers that withstood</i>

00:59:28,056 --> 00:59:33,978
<i>The summer rain showers</i>

885

<i>And the trees that withstood</i>

<i>The snowstorm last winter</i>

887
00:59:46,658 --> 00:59:52,997

01:00:25,947 --> 01:00:30,785
<i>I didn't even realize</i>

894
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:34,330
<i>The sun was</i>

895
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:40,086

YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,983
How many cups of coffee have we had?

898
01:01:02,066 --> 01:01:03,276
Just four.

899
01:01:04,068 --> 01:01:06,613
I don't think the coffee here
has any caffeine.

900
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:09,616
I only drink decaf coffee.

Hello.

905
01:01:25,131 --> 01:01:26,508
Have you had lunch yet?

906
01:01:26,591 --> 01:01:27,717
Yes, I have.

01:01:28,426 --> 01:01:29,594

Yes.

924
01:02:33,408 --> 01:02:34,617
Okay, I'll do it.

925
01:02:35,326 --> 01:02:38,621
I have some time on the weekend,

926
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,542
but let me check one thing
and call you right back.

927
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,876
Don't confirm it yet.

928
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:45,962
Okay.

929
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,303
Professor Chae, have some cake.

930
01:02:53,386 --> 01:02:55,680
I was just about to call you.

931
01:02:55,763 --> 01:02:58,224
-Take a seat.
-Me? Why?

932
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:00,810
Are you free this Saturday?

933
01:03:00,893 --> 01:03:02,186
I'm on duty.

934
01:03:02,854 --> 01:03:04,897
I have to do rounds in the ICU too,

935
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,191
so I can't go anywhere
even if I win the lottery.

936
01:03:08,026 --> 01:03:08,943
What about Seok-min?

937
01:03:09,027 --> 01:03:13,031
Right! He has the test, doesn't he?
The second one.

938
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:14,699
Is it this Saturday?

939
01:03:14,782 --> 01:03:16,743
Yes, he's cramming for the test right now.

940
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:18,286
I see.

941
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:20,079
-Why do you ask?
-Nothing.

942
01:03:25,877 --> 01:03:27,003
This cake is good.

943
01:03:27,962 --> 01:03:29,714
You should have bought the whole cake.

944
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:31,716
Just for the two of us?

945
01:03:32,467 --> 01:03:33,801
Yeah, the whole thing.

946
01:03:36,596 --> 01:03:37,764
-Oh, right.
-What?

947
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,974
Yoo Gyeong-jin's mother
was looking for you.

948
01:03:40,808 --> 01:03:42,727
Me? Why?

949
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:45,021
I checked in on her earlier.

950
01:03:45,104 --> 01:03:47,774
I think she wants to talk to you
about something.

951
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:57,207
<i>"Introduction to Obstetrics."</i>
Obstetrics.

952
01:03:57,283 --> 01:04:01,079
-Studying your textbooks again?
-Put that down. Don't touch anything.

953
01:04:01,162 --> 01:04:03,539
Just ask your questions
and get lost, will you?

954
01:04:11,464 --> 01:04:13,675
You have two surgeries today.
Aren't you busy?

955
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:15,885
I am, but I came to see you.

956
01:04:15,968 --> 01:04:17,011
Why?

957
01:04:17,095 --> 01:04:19,514
-I need answers when I'm curious.
-What is it?

958
01:04:20,264 --> 01:04:21,808
Are you and Sin-hye back together?

959
01:04:24,143 --> 01:04:27,355
Why did you two meet up today?
Her father has been discharged.

960
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,734
Are you guys trying to see
if you can make things work?

961
01:04:34,153 --> 01:04:35,238
No.

962
01:04:36,364 --> 01:04:38,658
Her father had an appointment here today,

963
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,410
and I ran into her in the elevator.

964
01:04:40,993 --> 01:04:43,454
I see. My goodness.

965
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,375
Any possibility
that you could get back together?

966
01:04:48,793 --> 01:04:49,794
Zero.

967
01:04:52,296 --> 01:04:53,631
"Zero"?

968
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,260
Yes, zero.

969
01:04:58,052 --> 01:05:00,221
There's zero chance that will happen.

970
01:05:08,229 --> 01:05:10,565
I came here to have dinner with you.

971
01:05:14,152 --> 01:05:15,486
Let's…

972
01:05:16,821 --> 01:05:20,032
meet up like this and have dinner together
once in a while.

973
01:05:22,368 --> 01:05:23,786
Can we do that?

974
01:05:40,595 --> 01:05:43,890
To be honest, seeing you like this…

975
01:05:47,018 --> 01:05:48,227
makes me uncomfortable.

976
01:05:51,063 --> 01:05:55,485
When I see you, I still feel bad.

977
01:05:57,445 --> 01:05:58,905
And I feel guilty

978
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,492
for not being there for you
when you were having a hard time.

979
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:11,250
But you know, I think…

980
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:16,589
we should put our relationship behind us
and move on.

981
01:06:19,634 --> 01:06:22,970
I'm fine with running into you like this,

982
01:06:23,721 --> 01:06:25,807
but that's it.

983
01:06:30,311 --> 01:06:31,229
Okay.

984
01:06:33,439 --> 01:06:35,358
I understand what you're trying to say.

985
01:06:58,005 --> 01:06:59,549
DIRECTOR JU

986
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,389
Hello, sir.

987
01:07:06,472 --> 01:07:08,766
<i>You said you'd call me right back.</i>

988
01:07:09,433 --> 01:07:12,478
-I don't think I can do it.
-<i>What? Why not?</i>

989
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:15,356
<i>Others would kill
for an opportunity like this.</i>

990
01:07:15,439 --> 01:07:18,317
Can they do a different day?
Does it have to be this Saturday?

991
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,987
<i>It's the only day that works for them.</i>

992
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,656
<i>You performed the surgery,
so you should do it.</i>

993
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:25,616
<i>You said you were available.</i>

994
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:28,828
I'll pass.

995
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:32,665
-Why don't you do it in my place?
-<i>My goodness.</i>

996
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:34,750
<i>Why should I?</i>

997
01:07:36,127 --> 01:07:38,713
<i>Anyway, all right.
I'll politely turn it down.</i>

998
01:07:38,796 --> 01:07:39,839
Okay.

999
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:42,633
<i>Professor Chae, thanks for everything.</i>

1000
01:07:43,217 --> 01:07:45,553
<i>I promise I won't overwork you like this
anymore.</i>

1001
01:07:45,636 --> 01:07:48,514
No, it's fine.

1002
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:50,683
If it's surgery for VIP patients,
don't worry.

1003
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:53,394
Send them over to me right away.

1004
01:07:53,477 --> 01:07:56,981
<i>I didn't know you had this side to you.</i>

1005
01:07:59,025 --> 01:08:00,151
<i>Anyway, take it easy.</i>

1006
01:08:00,234 --> 01:08:01,736
-Will do.
-<i>Bye.</i>

1007
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:22,006
My gosh. What's with the flowers?

1008
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,300
We can't accept gifts,

1009
01:08:24,383 --> 01:08:28,429
but Ms. Kim Su-jeong asked me
to make sure Professor Yang gets it.

1010
01:08:30,389 --> 01:08:33,643
I guess he didn't get to see her leave.

1011
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,146
-He's still in surgery, right?
-Yes.

1012
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,734
He texted her last night.

1013
01:08:42,902 --> 01:08:45,363
Who? Professor Yang?

1014
01:08:45,446 --> 01:08:48,074
-Yes.
-That's very unlike him.

1015
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:51,994
He asked me for her contact information
last night.

1016
01:08:52,078 --> 01:08:55,164
He said he had never texted a patient
since passing the board exam.

1017
01:08:55,247 --> 01:08:56,958
I see. So what did he say to her?

1018
01:08:59,126 --> 01:09:01,504
-Hello, Professor Yang.
-Hello.

1019
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:04,048
Yes, hi.

1020
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:09,637
What are these flowers for?

1021
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,348
Patient Kim Su-jeong
dropped them off for you.

1022
01:09:12,431 --> 01:09:13,557
There's a card inside.

1023
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:17,979
We can't accept flowers.

1024
01:09:18,062 --> 01:09:20,272
-Professor Yang.
-Take it easy.

1025
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:35,830
-Where are you going?
-The VIP Ward. You?

1026
01:09:35,913 --> 01:09:37,957
-The ICU. Do you have surgery?
-Yes.

1027
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,376
But I'm going there while they get ready.

1028
01:09:40,459 --> 01:09:41,669
A new optician's shop?

1029
01:09:41,752 --> 01:09:43,587
Yes, so everything's 30 percent off.

1030
01:09:44,964 --> 01:09:47,758
Hi! Look who's here.

1031
01:09:47,842 --> 01:09:50,302
It's Dr. Heo Seon-bin,
the third-year NS resident

1032
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:53,014
who is suspected to be dating Dr. Yong.

1033
01:09:53,097 --> 01:09:54,432
You know everything.

1034
01:09:55,016 --> 01:09:56,225
Hello.

1035
01:09:57,768 --> 01:09:58,983
Professor, did you hear?

1036
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:00,738
Hello.

1037
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,867
-Professor, did you hear?
-About what?

1038
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:07,328
Is this the start of an interesting story?

1039
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:10,039
A German TV station
wants to cover the story.

1040
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:12,792
I don't think Ms. Yoo is well enough
to be interviewed yet.

1041
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,794
They want to interview Professor Chae.

1042
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:17,421
-Song-hwa?
-Yes.

1043
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:23,386
The best neurosurgeon in Korea
who saved the world-famous violinist.

1044
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,929
They want to interview you.

1045
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:27,932
I know. Director Ju told me about it.

1046
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:28,891
Really?

1047
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,519
But I already declined the request.

1048
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:35,356
Why? Why did you decline the request?

1049
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:37,149
Just because. No reason.

1050
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,195
I bet it's because of her mother.

1051
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,825
You turned it down because
you don't like her mother, right?

1052
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,744
No, I don't dislike her mother.

1053
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:52,665
And even if I did, why would I
turn down the interview because of that?

1054
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,041
That's not it.

1055
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:56,669
Then why? Why did you turn it down?

1056
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:03,593
Because none of you would be available.

1057
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,097
How could I do it alone
when we all worked hard together?

1058
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:12,101
I thought it'd be great
to have you guys join me,

1059
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:14,395
so I suggested a few different time slots,

1060
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:17,398
but they can only do this Saturday.

1061
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,817
That's why I turned it down.

1062
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,193
This is nuts.

1063
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:24,655
Professor Chae…

1064
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:26,866
I told them we'd find another time

1065
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,285
when everyone is available.

1066
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,042
What are you doing?

1067
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,502
I made a statue of Song-hwa.

1068
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:42,548
What? Seriously?

1069
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:43,966
-Is that me?
-Yes.

1070
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,593
Next time, it'll be a bronze one.

1071
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:48,262
Forget it. I'm off.

1072
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:53,643
Hey, try it on.

1073
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,604
-Cut it out.
-It doesn't look so bad.

1074
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,938
Try it on.

1075
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,398
-Try it on.
-You try it on.

1076
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:02,360
No, Song-hwa! No!

1077
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,820
-Stop it.
-Are you all right?

1078
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,865
-Try it on.
-Hand it over. Let me try it on.

1079
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:10,910
-Song-hwa!
-Hey, it ripped! My face is torn.

1080
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:14,747
Next time,
it will be a full statue made of bronze.

1081
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:30,846
<i>Hello, Professor Yang.
It's me, your patient Kim Su-jeong.</i>

1082
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:33,683
<i>I really wanted to see you before I leave,</i>

1083
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,310
<i>but you were in surgery,
so I'm writing to you instead.</i>

1084
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:40,940
<i>Professor Yang, I cried so much</i>

1085
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,025
<i>when I got your text last night.</i>

1086
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,695
<i>I wanted to leave
with a big smile on my face,</i>

1087
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:48,572
<i>but your text message moved me
and my husband to tears.</i>

1088
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:53,327
<i>Professor Yang, please don't be sorry.</i>

1089
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:59,083
<i>Thanks to you, we had a meaningful month
listening to our baby's heartbeat</i>

1090
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,419
<i>and feeling our baby
for the very first time.</i>

1091
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,755
<i>You probably have no idea</i>

1092
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:07,925
<i>how precious those moments were to me
and my husband</i>

1093
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:09,760
<i>even though they were short-lived.</i>

1094
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:16,934
<i>Professor Yang,
if another angel comes to me,</i>

1095
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:21,522
<i>I'd like you to protect me
and my baby again.</i>

1096
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:26,819
<i>Thank you so much
for everything you did for us.</i>

1097
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:30,656
<i>Oh, my husband</i>

1098
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:34,744
<i>already printed the quote you sent us
and framed it.</i>

1099
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:06,066
<i>I found this quote on the first page
of my Obstetrics textbook.</i>

1100
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,612
<i>"Bad things at times…</i>

1101
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:15,451
<i>do happen to good people."</i>

1102
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,794
Professor Chae.

1103
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,087
Yes?

1104
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,714
Are you still single?

1105
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,842
Pardon me? Oh, yes.

1106
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,888
Would you like to meet
Gyeong-jin's brother?

1107
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,811
I think the two of you
are around the same age.

1108
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:45,231
He doesn't take after me,
so he's kind and diligent.

1109
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:46,649
I see.

1110
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:49,276
He has his own pharmacy.
A pretty big one in Gangnam.

1111
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,489
If you're okay with it,

1112
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:56,617
I'd love to introduce you to each other.

1113
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:14,069
THIS HAS AN EXTRA SHOT OF ESPRESSO

1114
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:20,159
IF YOU'RE NOT SLEEPY,
DRINK THIS DECAF COFFEE

1115

Subtitle translation by: Liya Choi

1116
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:30,062
-He's coming?
-He moved all his appointments

1117
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,022
-<i>to come here right away.</i>
-I'm coming now.

1118
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:33,440
<i>Isn't there a guardian?</i>

1119
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:35,693
There's no one. No family or relatives.

1120
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:37,319
<i>And she's always alone.</i>

1121
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,947
The patient's not doing well,
so we don't have time.

1122
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,324
-Can you take a look?
-Is it someone you know?

1123
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:43,492
Who is it?

1124
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:46,870
If you think the surgery can't be done,

1125
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,455
then I'll give up.

1126
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:49,748
Don't worry too much.

1127
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:53,085
<i>I believe in miracles.</i>

1128
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,546
We'll go into surgery now.

1129
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:59,883
Are you not seeing anyone?
I mean a girlfriend.

1130
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:03,053
<i>Just pick one of your friends
and say he's your boyfriend.</i>

1131
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,222
I have a date.

1132
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,934
<i>The owner of Yulje Medical Center.
A rich heir.</i>

1133
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:11,979
You know that your mother owns
some land in Hwaseong, right?

1134
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:15,232
-She'll give it to you, as inheritance.
-Really?

1135
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:16,942
If it's him, they'll believe you.

1136
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,777
<i>Your best friend.</i>

1137
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:22,531
They brag every day
about going camping with their dad.

1138
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:24,908
We can go too. Let's go camping.

1139
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:26,118
<i>-Really?
-Yes.</i>

1140
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,871
<i>What if people see us?</i>

1141
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:30,789
<i>Everyone will find out at this rate.</i>

1142
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:32,958
<i>She probably won't give up.</i>

1143
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:36,170
I like you.
