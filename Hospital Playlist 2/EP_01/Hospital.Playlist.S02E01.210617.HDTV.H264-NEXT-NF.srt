HOSPITAL PLAYLIST 2

2
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:16,409
<i>Professor Yang, it's me, Min-ha.</i>

3
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:19,079
<i>Do you have any plans for this evening?</i>

4
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:22,207
<i>If not, let's have dinner together
at the steakhouse across the street.</i>

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,291
<i>At 7:30 p.m.</i>

6
00:00:25,585 --> 00:00:28,004
<i>No pressure though.
You don't have to come.</i>

7
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:31,508
<i>My friend lives in the area,
so I can eat with her if you can't come.</i>

8
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:35,345
<i>But I really hope you can come.</i>

9
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:47,941
SORRY, JUST HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,703
SORRY, JUST HAVE DINNER
WITH YOUR FRIENDS, MERRY CHRISTMAS

11
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:09,087
SORRY, JUST HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS

12
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:21,224
YOON SIN-HYE

13
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:34,571
Hello?

14
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:38,658
What about a CT scan?

15
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,411
He's conscious?

16
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:43,747
<i>Yeah, he got a CT scan done.</i>

17
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,709
<i>The Professor of Neurosurgery said
they'd just have to monitor him tonight.</i>

18
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:51,046
<i>Is that okay though?</i>

19
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:52,380
I'll be there in a minute.

20
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:06,227
THE STEAKHOUSE IN FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL

21
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:07,771
You go ahead.

22
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:10,815
My gosh.

23
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,820
Yeah, please go ahead.

24
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:20,742
SORRY, JUST HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS

25
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:39,719
Hey, Seok-hyeong! You're still here?

26
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:43,640
This is Kang So-ye.
She's a good friend of mine.

27
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:46,392
She's going to join our hospital
as a fellow next year,

28
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:48,937
but she wanted to learn the job
in advance. How kind!

29
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,063
Yes, thank you.

30
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,773
-Hello.
-Hello.

31
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:54,692
Just now, Professor Yoon Seon-ju…

32
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:57,862
He was just admitted, right?
Cerebral hemorrhage, in his seventies.

33
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:01,241
Yes, the CT scan shows
ICH in the right basal ganglia.

34
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:03,660
I'd say about 15cc,

35
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:05,119
which isn't a lot, thankfully.

36
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:07,205
The CT angiogram shows no abnormalities.

37
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:11,292
His mental status is alert,
but the left side motor response is poor.

38
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:14,462
We're going to monitor him all night.
Why? Do you know him?

39
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,756
He's a famous professor.

40
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,551
Over here.

41
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,267
Who's on duty tonight for Neurosurgery?

42
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,395
Professor Choi Hyeong-su.
He came and left.

43
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:31,396
Seok-hyeong.

44
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,731
Yes.

45
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:39,863
EMERGENCY CENTER

46
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:42,574
Who is she?

47
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:57,130
Cheers!

48
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:36,169
It's a Christmas gift from our chef.
Enjoy.

49
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:46,429
What a stingy chef.

50
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:49,098
This is tiny!

51
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:23,299
THE STEAKHOUSE IN FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL

52
00:05:36,354 --> 00:05:39,065
Wash up later.
The bathroom's flooded right now.

53
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:48,366
Hey, where were you? I called you twice.

54
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,078
<i>The study session ended just now.
What's up? Is something up?</i>

55
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:54,080
No, it's fine.

56
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:56,833
<i>Liar. You're obviously not okay.</i>

57
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,461
-What?
-<i>You miss me.</i>

58
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:05,717
<i>Gosh, what should we do?
There's no medicine for this.</i>

59
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,803
<i>Should I come see you?
Should I get on the bus now?</i>

60
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:10,388
I really miss you a lot.

61
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:14,017
I miss you so much
that I'm about to get a sty…

62
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:19,147
Hold on.

63
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:22,608
Go away. Get lost.

64
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:25,486
I'm off anyway.

65
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,448
I can't stand to watch any more of this.

66
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:30,950
Jeong-won dropped by.

67
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:33,661
Ik-sun, the ring got sent back
to the hospital.

68
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:35,079
I received it today.

69
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:37,206
<i>It got sent back? Why?</i>

70
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,709
It just says, "Return to sender."

71
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:42,336
<i>That's odd. I was home all week.
Last week too.</i>

72
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:46,716
<i>Let me ask my friend in the room
next to mine. I'll call you back.</i>

73
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,509
All right.

74
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,348
He can't move one arm
and threw up earlier.

75
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:55,725
Doesn't he need surgery?

76
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:59,812
No. It's only a little bit of blood,
so the meds will do.

77
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,607
They're right in putting him on meds

78
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,610
that can lower
the intracranial pressure and BP.

79
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:08,571
But what if the bleeding
gets worse overnight?

80
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:10,198
What if his condition worsens?

81
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,116
The bleeding could increase.

82
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,995
But I'm sure the ICU staff will
keep taking CT scans to check.

83
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,749
If the bleeding worsens,
we'll insert a long tube

84
00:07:19,832 --> 00:07:22,960
called a catheter to drain the blood.

85
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:25,963
If the bleeding worsens significantly,

86
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,800
we'll go into surgery right away.

87
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:32,887
But at the moment, we don't know.

88
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,015
We have no idea whether or not
the bleeding will worsen,

89
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,018
so let's wait and see.
We can decide later.

90
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:42,688
This is why it's important to know someone
who works in a hospital.

91
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:44,607
Thank you for stopping by.

92
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,192
No problem.

93
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:50,947
The ICU is full at the moment,
so he'll have to wait a little.

94
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:55,493
You should sit down and get some rest.
It won't take too long.

95
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,870
See if you can speed it up a little…

96
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:02,291
for old times' sake.

97
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:04,419
Okay.

98
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:20,143
Did you have dinner?

99
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:22,186
No.

100
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,107
He suddenly collapsed
on our way to a family dinner.

101
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,860
So we brought him here.

102
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,361
None of us had dinner.

103
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:31,988
I see.

104
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:33,698
Mom must be hungry.

105
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:37,994
Is there a <i>gimbap</i> place nearby?
Or even just a convenience store.

106
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:40,288
Yes, there's a <i>gimbap</i> place
across the street.

107
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:42,165
It should still be open.

108
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:45,042
-Come with me.
-What?

109
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:48,129
Okay.

110
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:57,972
It's snowing a lot outside.

111
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:00,558
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

112
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,852
We're stepping out to get <i>gimbap</i>.
It'll be quick.

113
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,020
Let's go, Seok-hyeong.

114
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:15,448
It's so cold!

115
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:29,045
Oh, no. What should I do?

116
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:40,181
I'm here.
I'm right in front of the ER now.

117
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:43,100
My gosh, it's snowing so much right now.

118
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:44,727
<i>I just saw your text.</i>

119
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,605
<i>You're back already?
You said you had a date this evening.</i>

120
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:50,316
Did I?

121
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,818
I was joking. A date, my foot.

122
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:55,363
Anyway, I'm heading in now.

123
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:58,032
Wait at the station, okay?

124
00:09:58,616 --> 00:09:59,867
Gosh, it's so cold.

125
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,236
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

126
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:33,169
The half-dried herring
actually goes quite well with wine.

127
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:35,254
-Doesn't it?
-Yes, it's very nice.

128
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:37,089
Good choice, Kettle.

129
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:40,926
What kettle? What brand is it?

130
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:43,679
He calls me Kettle, Mr. Kettle.

131
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,223
Oh, I see.

132
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,019
What are you doing? Hurry up!

133
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:53,189
It must be good news, right?

134
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:56,359
That's what you want to tell me.
That's why you're coming to see me!

135
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:59,070
<i>What is the good news
that you're thinking of?</i>

136
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:02,406
What do you think? You staying
right by my side forever, obviously.

137
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:04,700
<i>Let's talk in person on the weekend.</i>

138
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,538
Okay. I'll be waiting, with the red carpet
rolled out just for you.

139
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:11,290
I love you, son!

140
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:18,506
Jong-su, pour me some wine.
All the way to the top.

141
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:21,509
What's going on? What did Jeong-won say?

142
00:12:21,592 --> 00:12:23,427
Sounds like he decided not to quit.

143
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,180
Really?

144
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:28,933
That's great.

145
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:34,105
My, that's such good news. Great news!

146
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:37,608
Really?
He told me that he was leaving soon.

147
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,903
He's not going anywhere.
He's had a change of heart.

148
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:43,322
He's visiting Yangpyeong this Sunday,

149
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:45,699
but his flight was booked for this Sunday.

150
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:48,828
What does that mean?
Clearly, he's decided to stay!

151
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:55,418
And I think Jeong-won's got a girlfriend.

152
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:57,628
What does her family do?

153
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:00,131
What does her father do?

154
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:04,093
How would I know?
And who cares what her family does?

155
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:08,848
I'm just grateful that my 40-year-old son
has finally got a girlfriend!

156
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:11,350
That's such great news for the hospital.

157
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:16,397
I was really worried about how
I'd manage Pediatric Surgery without him.

158
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,108
PEDIATRIC SURGERY AHN JEONG-WON

159
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,278
Gosh, it's Professor Ahn.

160
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:24,697
Answer it. Hurry, quick!

161
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,160
Hi, Professor Ahn. What's up?

162
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:34,123
Me? I'm with your mother now.

163
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:36,709
Right.

164
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:39,462
Can I stop by your office for a moment
tomorrow morning?

165
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:41,088
I need to have a word with you.

166
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:44,967
<i>Yes, of course. You can stop by
for ten hours, if you'd like.</i>

167
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,344
<i>You can come by anytime.</i>

168
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:51,974
Okay. Then I'll come by
before my outpatient appointments.

169
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,768
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.

170
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,164
Hey, what's our next song?

171
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:18,375
"I'm okay now. I've given up on love."

172
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:20,878
"Why am I crying like a fool?" By the way…

173
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:22,922
Someone's dating.

174
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:28,469
Seok-hyeong is seeing someone, right?

175
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:33,474
Well, I'm not sure.
He didn't say anything to me.

176
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:36,644
The song choice is pretty suspicious.

177
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:44,652
<i>Hey! I figured out why. My goodness.</i>

178
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,530
Hold on. Hold on a second.

179
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:49,782
Just a second.

180
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,261
It got sent back because no one was there?

181
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:11,720
<i>That's the way it's done here.</i>

182
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:14,890
<i>The mailman must have come
when I stepped out for a moment last week.</i>

183
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:17,852
<i>Se-gyeong told me they'd redeliver it</i>

184
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:20,563
<i>if I called the post office
and confirmed the details,</i>

185
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:22,356
<i>but I'd have to call right away.</i>

186
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:25,401
<i>I can't believe it got sent back.</i>

187
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:26,652
I'll send it again.

188
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:29,488
<i>No, it's okay.
What if something goes wrong again?</i>

189
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,575
<i>Just give it to me in person
when I'm back in Korea.</i>

190
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:34,076
When will that be?

191
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:35,744
<i>I don't know.</i>

192
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:38,080
All right. Then I'll hold onto it for now.

193
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:41,500
I don't want you to be stuck at home
waiting for the ring.

194
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:43,043
How's studying going?

195
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:46,171
<i>It's hard. I should've done this sooner.
I'm physically struggling.</i>

196
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:48,173
<i>I get tired so easily.</i>

197
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:50,801
<i>Doesn't my face look weird now? Look.</i>

198
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:54,305
You look pretty.
You don't look weird at all.

199
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,016
I guess your friend
is helping you out a lot.

200
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:59,143
<i>Yes, Se-gyeong helps me out so much.</i>

201
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:02,646
<i>She came here just a little before I did,
but she's like a native Londoner.</i>

202
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,733
My gosh, your friend is better
than your boyfriend.

203
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:11,405
<i>Jun-wan, I know it's late,
but Merry Christmas.</i>

204
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:15,326
<i>-It'll be Christmas in a few hours there.
-Yes.</i>

205
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,745
<i>I'm sorry for leaving you alone.</i>

206
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:20,372
<i>I'm sorry too. Merry Christmas.</i>

207
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:22,666
<i>Thanks. I love you.</i>

208
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:26,462
<i>I love you too.</i>

209
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:29,256
<i>-I love you.
-I love you.</i>

210
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:30,883
All right.

211
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:58,868
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST 2

212
00:17:19,223 --> 00:17:20,349
Professor Lee.

213
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:23,435
How did you know it was me?

214
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,314
Who else would be here at this hour?

215
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:28,232
By the way…

216
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:33,487
where are you going so early?
You usually sleep in.

217
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,406
-I'm off to work.
-I'm sorry?

218
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:38,784
I haven't been exercising at all,
so I feel very unfit these days.

219
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:41,036
I'm going to bike to work.

220
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,663
This man in black will be off now.

221
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,434
U-ju, see you later. Have fun with Auntie.

222
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:06,061
My gosh.

223
00:18:07,938 --> 00:18:12,609
Oh, my. When did my son grow so much?

224
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,111
Right?

225
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:18,657
I feel like he's grown so much overnight.

226
00:18:18,741 --> 00:18:19,658
Isn't it odd?

227
00:18:20,951 --> 00:18:22,119
The New Year is here.

228
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:26,165
He's had a growth spurt
now that he's a year older.

229
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:30,419
Sorry?
You're not making much sense right now.

230
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:38,177
Auntie.

231
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:43,015
Sometimes, yesterday feels like today,
and vice versa.

232
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:46,477
And sometimes, the day after tomorrow
feels like the past, you know?

233
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,561
Look here.

234
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:10,334
-Hello, take it easy.
-Thank you.

235
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:13,629
Hey, let's take a break too.
I have a headache.

236
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:17,007
Yes, don't push yourself too hard
on a cold day like this.

237
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:20,677
Come on. We're almost there. Get up.

238
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,474
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

239
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:26,558
Are you all right?

240
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,441
I'm…

241
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:38,779
Sir.

242
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:42,282
Sir, open your eyes. Sir?

243
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:45,994
Can you describe your symptoms?
What's your name?

244
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:48,580
My head…

245
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:10,686
I'm a doctor. Can you call an ambulance?

246
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:11,979
This could be a stroke.

247
00:20:12,062 --> 00:20:13,397
Okay.

248
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,134
911 RESCUE SERVICES

249
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,932
-Can I borrow your penlight?
-Sure.

250
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:04,907
Thankfully, his pupil reaction seems fine.

251
00:21:06,116 --> 00:21:09,661
By the way, where are we taking him?
Which hospital?

252
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:11,997
-We're taking him to Yulje.
-Yulje?

253
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,625
It's before the rush hour,
so there's no traffic now.

254
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,919
Right, it's still early.

255
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:19,755
Sir, which hospital do you work at?

256
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:23,008
If it's on our way back,
we'll drop you off.

257
00:21:23,842 --> 00:21:26,094
It's okay. There's no need.

258
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:31,183
It's really okay.

259
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:49,701
It's so cold.

260
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:52,996
I got here way too early.

261
00:22:00,934 --> 00:22:02,769
I got here way too early.

262
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,572
Are you a ghost?

263
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:17,325
Hey, why are you here?

264
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:22,164
-Where's your car?
-Why are you here so early, sleepyhead?

265
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:24,291
Something happened.
Did you not go to Sokcho?

266
00:22:24,374 --> 00:22:27,252
I have a lecture in the morning.
Thank you!

267
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:29,921
I came early to prepare for it.

268
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:31,757
I'm getting my new car later today.

269
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,759
Did you bike here? What are you wearing?

270
00:22:33,842 --> 00:22:36,511
-Does it look weird? Do I look lame?
-Yes, weird and lame.

271
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:40,724
Did you have coffee?
Don't you need coffee in the morning?

272
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:43,477
Coffee?

273
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:51,943
Sure, let's have some coffee.
Come to my office.

274
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:53,612
Okay!

275
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,374
<i>-Good morning.
-Hello, Professor Yang.</i>

276
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,084
Hello, good morning.

277
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:15,926
Hurry.

278
00:23:17,135 --> 00:23:18,804
-Hello, Professor.
-Hello, Professor.

279
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:21,389
Hi, guys.

280
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:25,352
Aren't you getting in?

281
00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:28,563
I left something in the car.

282
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:30,690
Go ahead.

283
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:34,945
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

284
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:02,013
Ms. Song, ER's sending a patient now.
Is that okay?

285
00:24:02,097 --> 00:24:04,516
Tell them it's fine.
And see if Room 11 is ready.

286
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,601
Got it. Yes, you can send the patient now.

287
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:10,730
This patient had a hepatectomy,

288
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:14,109
but the urine output has decreased a lot.
Was everything okay last night?

289
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:16,778
Yes, I went there and checked.

290
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:20,532
The patient was fine,
and I confirmed that we changed IV bags.

291
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:24,452
Dr. Jang, Park Cheol-yong in Room 10
has a fever of 37.5 degrees Celsius,

292
00:24:24,536 --> 00:24:26,746
and he's shivering badly.
What should we do?

293
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,832
Give him an IV
and a fever reducer for now.

294
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:30,375
-I'll check on him soon.
-Okay.

295
00:24:35,797 --> 00:24:37,799
I have surgery first thing in the morning.

296
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:39,593
You've seen me go to work this early.

297
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:43,763
I'll be late. I'll call you at night.

298
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:44,848
All right.

299
00:24:49,144 --> 00:24:50,812
Hey, did you use my shampoo?

300
00:24:50,896 --> 00:24:52,814
No, I didn't.

301
00:24:52,898 --> 00:24:55,567
Jeez, you stingy prick.
You can have it all.

302
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,569
Why not? Try it.

303
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,448
It's really good. You should use it too.

304
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:04,200
I've used it. It was great.

305
00:25:09,706 --> 00:25:11,458
Was he a pitcher or what?

306
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,585
That pitch was so accurate.

307
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:20,300
Have you been practicing?

308
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,512
Yes, I have.

309
00:25:28,016 --> 00:25:29,684
Then do it in front of me.

310
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:42,656
You haven't been practicing hard enough.

311
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:45,367
-This isn't good.
-My stomach…

312
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,118
My stomach hurts a lot.

313
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:50,830
It feels tight, and I feel so weak.

314
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:54,084
Doctor, please leave it to me.
I'll do it at my own pace.

315
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:57,462
You may have to go back to the ICU
if you end up with pneumonia again.

316
00:25:58,046 --> 00:26:00,882
Five times, every hour.
Do it properly before you rest.

317
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:03,134
I'll be back in the afternoon.

318
00:26:03,218 --> 00:26:06,262
I expect you to fully lift a ball
when I'm back.

319
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:07,597
Do you understand?

320
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:11,893
Yes, Doctor. I'll make sure he practices.

321
00:26:11,977 --> 00:26:13,395
Great. See you later.

322
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:35,917
What is this patient's diagnosis?

323
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:38,962
Well…

324
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:39,963
Age?

325
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:42,757
I'm sorry, sir.

326
00:26:43,508 --> 00:26:45,427
What kind of surgery has the patient had?

327
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:51,725
Are you here
to just watch me perform surgery?

328
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:54,269
Make sure you study before you scrub in.

329
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:57,188
I'm sorry, sir.

330
00:26:58,481 --> 00:26:59,983
Let's do the purse-string suture.

331
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:01,735
PURSE STRING: TECHNIQUE THAT CLOSES
A WOUND LIKE A PURSE

332
00:27:05,238 --> 00:27:06,781
Keep checking the vitals

333
00:27:06,865 --> 00:27:09,367
and check for any drainage color change.

334
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:11,536
We're doing a Doppler ultrasound today,

335
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:14,205
so check for fluid collection
in the hilum.

336
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:15,373
Yes, sir.

337
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:22,255
I'm counting on you guys.

338
00:27:35,018 --> 00:27:37,187
PEDIATRIC SURGERY

339
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:49,574
Did you count everything?

340
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:52,744
-We're short of a dressing set.
-Room 8 is using one now.

341
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:55,622
Hello, Professor Ahn.

342
00:27:55,705 --> 00:27:56,790
Hello.

343
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:05,340
Seung-ho ran a fever last night.

344
00:28:05,423 --> 00:28:09,010
We gave him an IV and a fever reducer,
but he still has a mild fever.

345
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:13,640
A fever is common because of
the post-surgery condition of the lungs.

346
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:16,101
I'll have a look at him
when I'm doing rounds later.

347
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:18,061
Do we have Chae-eun's results?

348
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:20,897
The liver Doppler ultrasound results
look good,

349
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,816
but she's not in a good mood.

350
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:29,322
She's become a pessimist
since getting the liver transplant.

351
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,251
Hi, Chae-eun.

352
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:43,545
Hello, Professor Ahn.

353
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:46,172
Chae-eun, Dr. Ahn is here.

354
00:28:48,883 --> 00:28:50,677
-What's the matter?
-No idea.

355
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:54,722
She's been eating well, right?

356
00:28:54,806 --> 00:28:56,891
Yes, she's still a good eater.

357
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,393
I see.

358
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:03,356
Then I think she can go home tomorrow.
All the test results look good.

359
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,024
-I think she'll be fine--
-Doctor.

360
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:07,318
Yes, Chae-eun.

361
00:29:08,862 --> 00:29:11,197
How much longer do I have to live?

362
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:18,163
My mom asks you that question
all the time.

363
00:29:18,872 --> 00:29:22,834
"How much longer can Chae-eun live
with this new liver?"

364
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:28,590
I don't know either.

365
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:37,432
But I'm pretty sure you'll outlive me.

366
00:29:42,103 --> 00:29:45,190
You'll live longer than me,
so don't worry.

367
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:48,276
Okay?

368
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:55,742
All right, see you.

369
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:01,748
-Jin-u is next.
-Okay.

370
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:05,418
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

371
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:09,797
It stings, doesn't it?
I'll be gentle. It's almost done.

372
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:10,882
Okay.

373
00:30:11,424 --> 00:30:14,802
But how many more times
do I have to do this?

374
00:30:15,678 --> 00:30:18,473
I really can't get used to this position.

375
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:21,267
Oh, I'm sorry.

376
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:26,689
Yes, Professor Yang.

377
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:28,942
<i>We have a</i> primi<i>-patient, 12 weeks.</i>

378
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:31,277
<i>She's lost weight
because of her morning sickness,</i>

379
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:33,321
<i>so I told her she should be hospitalized.</i>

380
00:30:33,404 --> 00:30:35,198
I'll get you a new dressing set.

381
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:36,241
Okay, thank you.

382
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:39,160
Got it. So just order lab tests
and give her an IV?

383
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:42,121
-<i>Are you doing something now?</i>
-Pardon me?

384
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:45,041
-<i>Are you changing someone's dressing?</i>
-Yes.

385
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:47,835
<i>Then call me when you're done.</i>

386
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:58,888
Oh, I'm sorry.

387
00:31:05,812 --> 00:31:08,731
Make sure the Hemovac doesn't
get disconnected. Close it up well.

388
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:10,567
Dress the wound thoroughly. See you.

389
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,402
Got it. Thank you, Professor Chae!

390
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:16,573
-Hey, Seok-min.
-<i>I stopped by to see you.</i>

391
00:31:16,656 --> 00:31:18,825
-<i>Where are you now?</i>
-I'm busy.

392
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:23,246
<i>You must not care about me
since I'm leaving. Spare me five minutes.</i>

393
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:27,083
You've been slacking off so often.
Don't you have to study?

394
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:31,254
<i>I was studying until ten minutes ago.
Where are you?</i>

395
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:33,798
The Operating Unit.
Come to my office in five minutes.

396
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:36,259
<i>Why are you in the Operating Unit again?</i>

397
00:31:36,342 --> 00:31:39,971
<i>Jeez, were you assisting
Professor Min again?</i>

398
00:31:40,054 --> 00:31:42,932
We're short-staffed, so I had to.
Why did you have to leave?

399
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:45,518
I wish you were here to do these things.

400
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:48,563
<i>Why did you take care of it
when the fellows can do it?</i>

401
00:31:48,646 --> 00:31:51,566
They're the busiest ones here.
I have the most time to spare.

402
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:53,192
Anyway, I'll see you in a bit.

403
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:08,207
Hey!

404
00:32:23,848 --> 00:32:26,059
Is Chi-hong doing well
at the Jongno branch?

405
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:28,478
Didn't he start at the Jongno branch
this week?

406
00:32:28,561 --> 00:32:30,855
Yes, his clinical rotation started today.

407
00:32:30,938 --> 00:32:33,941
He didn't have to go there,
but I heard he volunteered.

408
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:35,401
I suggested he do it.

409
00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:37,945
Professor Chae.

410
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,864
They were short-staffed and needed help.

411
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:42,283
I figured nothing bad
would come out of it.

412
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,410
They handle a wider range of cases.

413
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:47,872
And the more work you do,
the more and quicker you'll learn.

414
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,626
Did I sound like a geezer?

415
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,253
My goodness…

416
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:56,673
If you're a geezer,

417
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:59,133
Chae Song-hwa and company
are the only ones

418
00:32:59,217 --> 00:33:02,011
who aren't geezers in this hospital.

419
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:04,889
I don't want to end up being a geezer.

420
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:07,558
I want to be a villain.

421
00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:12,563
The greatest villain
in this entire hospital.

422
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:23,116
Hey, do you live here?

423
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:26,411
Yeah, I do. Want some crackers?

424
00:33:29,872 --> 00:33:30,748
That…

425
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,751
Are you eating my crackers?

426
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,556
My gosh.
Thank you so much, Professor Chae.

427
00:33:47,473 --> 00:33:51,561
The lecture will happen elsewhere,
so I wasn't sure how to bring it up.

428
00:33:51,644 --> 00:33:55,106
My brother was the one who asked me,
so I couldn't refuse him.

429
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:57,066
Asking him will only take a second.

430
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,902
Ik-jun will do it if he's free.
He likes doing those things.

431
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:01,821
It's just that he's always busy.

432
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:03,865
He's in my office now, so let's ask him.

433
00:34:03,948 --> 00:34:05,032
Thank you.

434
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:10,580
But does it have to be Ik-jun?

435
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,419
It is mine.
Why do you keep eating my snacks?

436
00:34:16,502 --> 00:34:18,254
This is my favorite!

437
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:23,968
Jeez.

438
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,095
Get out, Ahn Jeong-won.

439
00:34:28,931 --> 00:34:29,766
I said, get out.

440
00:34:30,725 --> 00:34:32,810
Get out! Get out of Jun-wan's body.

441
00:34:32,894 --> 00:34:35,605
Get out at once. You won't?

442
00:34:36,856 --> 00:34:38,733
Get out.

443
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:40,777
-Stop…
-Get out.

444
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:43,946
Get out. Get lost.

445
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,324
-Leave Jun-wan alone!
-Jeez!

446
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:48,910
Get out.

447
00:34:48,993 --> 00:34:54,040
Professor Lee Ik-jun is very famous
as a leading liver transplant specialist.

448
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:58,294
They specifically requested
Professor Lee Ik-jun.

449
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:01,255
He's a great lecturer
on top of being a competent doctor.

450
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:04,133
He's very charismatic.

451
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:06,469
Really?

452
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,601
He's a great lecturer
on top of being a competent doctor.

453
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:15,479
He's very charismatic.

454
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:17,815
Really?

455
00:35:31,871 --> 00:35:33,080
Hey, stop!

456
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:44,592
He'll do it.

457
00:35:46,468 --> 00:35:47,636
Ik-jun said he'll do it.

458
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:51,015
Just text me the location and time.

459
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:52,975
He'll be there. Don't worry.

460
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:54,810
Talk to you later.

461
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,939
Bye.

462
00:36:07,281 --> 00:36:11,118
Patient Cho Seon-hwa said she was feeling
less fetal movement this morning.

463
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,078
-Did you do a nonstress test?
-Hello.

464
00:36:13,162 --> 00:36:16,707
Yes, the variability seemed fine.

465
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,127
And she said she's feeling
more fetal movement now.

466
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,962
Check her ultrasound and let me know.

467
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:23,255
Sure.

468
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:25,883
Min-ha, can you spare me a moment?

469
00:36:25,966 --> 00:36:26,967
Sure.

470
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,102
What happened to your hair?
Did you just wash it?

471
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:38,687
Don't ask.

472
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:42,149
Jun-wan…

473
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:46,362
He was possessed by you,
so I carried out a little ritual.

474
00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:48,113
What are you talking about?

475
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:52,159
You are inside me.

476
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,913
You freak.

477
00:36:58,499 --> 00:36:59,833
Kim Jun-wan speaking.

478
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:03,337
<i>We're having a hard time
with the peripheral IV line for Eun-ji.</i>

479
00:37:03,963 --> 00:37:06,465
Okay, I'll check. I'm coming now.
Bye, guys.

480
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:10,261
Where's Seok-hyeong?

481
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,721
He's at a cafe meeting someone.

482
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:17,184
Who? He's not the type
to meet someone at a cafe.

483
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,019
-Is it a woman?
-Yes, Yoon Sin-hye.

484
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,438
That name rings a bell.

485
00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:22,648
His ex-wife.

486
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,901
Her father is hospitalized now.
He should've told me.

487
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:29,488
I know. I thought he'd tell us,
but he hasn't said a word about it.

488
00:37:29,571 --> 00:37:31,615
Her father will be discharged
in a day or two.

489
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,617
She must want to say bye to him in person.

490
00:37:36,245 --> 00:37:37,746
My buddy, Ik-jun.

491
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,791
What's up, my buddy Jeong-won?

492
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:43,210
I'm curious about something.

493
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,920
What is it?

494
00:37:46,005 --> 00:37:48,757
How is it that you always know everything?

495
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:52,094
That's because
I'm interested in everything.

496
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:55,264
-I'm curious about something too.
-What is it?

497
00:37:55,347 --> 00:37:58,475
How much time do you need
to unwrap the damn pickled radish?

498
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:03,397
Look at her. She ate a whole line
of <i>gimbap</i> without it.

499
00:38:05,774 --> 00:38:07,026
There was pickled radish?

500
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,453
I'm sorry.

501
00:38:18,954 --> 00:38:21,707
Pass the phone over to someone else
in a situation like that.

502
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,168
The patient must have been uncomfortable.

503
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:26,754
Right. I'm sorry.

504
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:30,382
I understand you answered right away
because your professor called you,

505
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:34,053
but don't answer my calls
in situations like that.

506
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:36,096
You can call me back when you're done.

507
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,556
You're right.

508
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:45,731
Hey, Sin-hye.

509
00:38:46,398 --> 00:38:47,816
I'll be there in three minutes.

510
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:54,531
It happens. Once is okay.

511
00:38:55,741 --> 00:38:57,826
But not twice, okay?

512
00:38:58,869 --> 00:38:59,787
Got it.

513
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,790
-See you.
-Bye.

514
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:13,258
My gosh, Yeon-u's mother is here again.

515
00:39:13,342 --> 00:39:16,261
Hello, ma'am. Is it raining outside?

516
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:18,764
No, I brought an umbrella
because they said it'd rain,

517
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:20,349
but it doesn't look like it will.

518
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:25,938
I was in the area and wanted to stop by.
Here, have some tangerines.

519
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:28,190
They're from my parents' farm.

520
00:39:28,273 --> 00:39:31,902
It's okay. You know that
we can't accept any gifts.

521
00:39:31,985 --> 00:39:34,238
I know. I sure do.

522
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:36,490
I practically lived here for three years.

523
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,909
Then what should I do with these?

524
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:40,619
I should just throw them away.

525
00:39:40,702 --> 00:39:42,621
Please throw these out for me.

526
00:39:42,704 --> 00:39:45,207
My gosh. Thank you.

527
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,088
By the way, is Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul
not here today?

528
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:54,341
She's in the ICU. Oh, there she is.

529
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:57,803
Hello, Dr. Jang.

530
00:39:58,637 --> 00:40:00,180
-Hello.
-My gosh.

531
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:02,391
You still seem so busy.

532
00:40:02,474 --> 00:40:04,518
Aren't there any juniors
joining this year?

533
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:06,854
I should file a complaint or something.

534
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,940
No, it's okay. What brings you here today?

535
00:40:10,732 --> 00:40:12,651
Did you want to talk to me
about something?

536
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:16,113
No, I just wanted to stop by
because I was in the area.

537
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:19,992
My friend's daughter turned one today,
so I had lunch with them.

538
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:25,122
The baby's skin was flawless,
without a single scar on the face.

539
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:28,709
But Yeon-u…

540
00:40:29,543 --> 00:40:33,338
That tiny body was covered with scars,
you know.

541
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,302
We changed the dressings
as often as we could

542
00:40:38,385 --> 00:40:41,638
and paid extra attention
to minimize scarring.

543
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:44,099
We're sorry.

544
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:45,684
Gosh, don't be.

545
00:40:46,643 --> 00:40:49,855
I know you adored Yeon-u so much.

546
00:40:50,772 --> 00:40:53,442
Was it about a month before Yeon-u died?

547
00:40:53,525 --> 00:40:55,235
In the afternoon,

548
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,779
Yeon-u suddenly started vomiting
after taking the meds.

549
00:40:57,863 --> 00:41:00,115
Even then, you took care of everything…

550
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,992
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

551
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,994
Yes, Professor.

552
00:41:05,204 --> 00:41:08,290
Yes. I've wrapped up everything here,
so I can go.

553
00:41:08,957 --> 00:41:10,209
Okay.

554
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,628
My professor needs me.

555
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:14,254
Okay.

556
00:41:27,476 --> 00:41:29,895
Yes. You just need me
to procure it, right?

557
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:31,605
Okay, I'll make sure to check.

558
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:41,073
Let it go.
Just make sure you don't do it again.

559
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,075
Ms. Han.

560
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,204
Why is it that I don't know anything
I have not experienced before?

561
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,416
I'm incapable of learning things
on my own.

562
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,502
I always start from zero.

563
00:41:54,002 --> 00:41:55,963
I don't have the talent
to be a good doctor,

564
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,507
I have no skills, and I'm dumb…

565
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,718
Anyway, I suck at everything.

566
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:06,181
-Hello?
-<i>This is the ER.</i>

567
00:42:06,265 --> 00:42:08,850
<i>We have a 38-year-old patient.
She's 19 weeks pregnant.</i>

568
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:11,228
<i>She's had a watery discharge
since lunchtime today.</i>

569
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:14,398
<i>PROM is suspected.
Could you come down and take a look?</i>

570
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:15,899
<i>She's not a follow-up patient.</i>

571
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:18,527
<i>She noticed the discharge
and came to our ER right away.</i>

572
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,280
Sure, no problem. I have to go.

573
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:34,501
We managed to do it after we called you.

574
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:37,879
-Really? The peripheral line is in?
-Yes, it's in.

575
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:39,881
Great, let's get the central line in now.

576
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:40,882
Okay.

577
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:44,970
PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

578
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:48,432
And Dr. Do Jae-hak just got here

579
00:42:48,515 --> 00:42:49,725
to see Eun-ji.

580
00:42:54,146 --> 00:42:56,815
NAME: SON EUN-JI
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

581
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:03,155
Oh, dear. The machine is bigger than her.

582
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:06,074
Eun-ji is waiting
for a heart transplant, right?

583
00:43:06,158 --> 00:43:07,159
Yes.

584
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:11,330
She's been hooked up to the VAD
for over three months now,

585
00:43:11,413 --> 00:43:13,206
but we can't find a donor for her.

586
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:16,293
But Eun-ji is staying strong.

587
00:43:19,338 --> 00:43:20,505
What are you doing here?

588
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,759
-Hello.
-Hello, Professor Kim.

589
00:43:24,426 --> 00:43:25,886
I came to see Eun-ji.

590
00:43:27,054 --> 00:43:28,472
Jang Hong-do, right?

591
00:43:29,056 --> 00:43:32,100
Yes, that's right.
I'm Jang Hong-do, in third year.

592
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:34,019
We've met a few times.

593
00:43:34,102 --> 00:43:35,562
Isn't he impressive?

594
00:43:36,355 --> 00:43:38,690
-What do you mean?
-He's spending his winter break

595
00:43:38,774 --> 00:43:42,277
working here as a sub-intern
instead of hanging out with his friends.

596
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,821
Even Jang Yun-bok, his twin sister--

597
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:46,823
How's the VAD different from the ECMO?

598
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:50,869
Well…

599
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:53,455
Professor Kim.

600
00:43:53,538 --> 00:43:55,791
He should study
since that's what he's here to do.

601
00:43:56,792 --> 00:43:59,878
I expect you to have the answer ready
the next time I see you.

602
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:00,879
Yes, sir.

603
00:44:00,962 --> 00:44:02,673
You should go study too.

604
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:05,300
Don't be one of the few people
who fail the board exam.

605
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:12,599
Does he always have to be so mean?

606
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,312
Eun-ji! She woke up.

607
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:20,107
Eun-ji, you woke up!

608
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:35,997
Someone left an umbrella here.

609
00:44:36,581 --> 00:44:38,917
That's Yeon-u's mother's.
You can give it to me.

610
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:46,174
Is this Yeon-u's mother?

611
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:52,681
To be honest, I don't really get it.

612
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:54,641
What?

613
00:44:56,727 --> 00:45:00,689
Yeon-u was hospitalized here
for a long time

614
00:45:01,356 --> 00:45:03,608
but ended up dying
after suffering a lot of pain.

615
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:08,613
Yeon-u was born prematurely,
underwent surgery several times,

616
00:45:08,697 --> 00:45:10,699
and practically lived here
for three years.

617
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,952
I only knew Yeon-u for about a year,

618
00:45:14,536 --> 00:45:18,498
but Da-yeong and Dr. Jang saw everything
from the time when Yeon-u was a newborn.

619
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,126
-That kid practically grew up here.
-Yes.

620
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:25,005
They had Yeon-u's 100th-day celebration
and even their first birthday party here.

621
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:30,218
I understand she's befriended
many people here

622
00:45:30,302 --> 00:45:32,596
and is grateful to the staff,
but if I were her…

623
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:38,810
If my child died here
after suffering from an illness for years,

624
00:45:39,728 --> 00:45:42,355
I wouldn't even want
to think of this place.

625
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,191
I'd hate to visit.

626
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:48,528
That said, what if…

627
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,739
She said she'll pick it up
tomorrow evening.

628
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:53,283
It's Yeon-u's birthday tomorrow.
She'll bring cake.

629
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:55,911
-She'll be here again tomorrow?
-Yes.

630
00:45:58,413 --> 00:45:59,539
Da-yeong.

631
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:02,083
I was just thinking,

632
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:05,795
but do you think that Yeon-u's mother

633
00:46:06,755 --> 00:46:09,633
could be preparing to sue us,
thinking that Yeon-u died

634
00:46:09,716 --> 00:46:12,344
because of some kind of mistake
that happened here?

635
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:17,140
Maybe she's coming here so often
to obtain clues or evidence.

636
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:22,729
I'm not sure. She got along with all of us
and with the doctors as well.

637
00:46:22,812 --> 00:46:26,483
She still talks to Professor Lee Ji-yeong
who performed the surgery.

638
00:46:26,566 --> 00:46:28,360
I'm sure that's not it.

639
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:31,321
I know, just in case.

640
00:46:31,404 --> 00:46:35,700
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul and I were always
right by Yeon-u's side.

641
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:38,870
Dr. Jang isn't the type to make mistakes,

642
00:46:39,371 --> 00:46:42,249
which means… Did I make a mistake?

643
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:46,419
Don't worry.
I told you, I was just thinking.

644
00:46:52,175 --> 00:46:55,595
Yes, hello. I'm sure you told
Professor Kwon all the details,

645
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,014
but I wanted to ask you
about the donor's condition.

646
00:46:58,098 --> 00:46:59,641
Was CPR performed?

647
00:47:01,768 --> 00:47:02,936
Right.

648
00:47:04,396 --> 00:47:08,275
Can you tell me the LFT results
and the amount of cardiac stimulant used?

649
00:47:08,817 --> 00:47:10,360
I just wanted to double-check.

650
00:47:18,994 --> 00:47:20,453
Move her to the delivery room.

651
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:24,916
Doctor. My baby is okay, right?

652
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,546
I'm only 19 weeks pregnant.
My water shouldn't break yet.

653
00:47:30,088 --> 00:47:31,339
Nothing will happen, right?

654
00:47:31,423 --> 00:47:35,302
Well, we need to run some tests
to find out what's going on.

655
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,846
We also need to find out
whether it's amniotic fluid.

656
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:41,516
Okay.

657
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:45,270
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

658
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,942
-Is the professor here yet?
-No.

659
00:47:51,026 --> 00:47:54,154
-Who's on duty today?
-Professor Yeom Se-hee.

660
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,533
-There she is.
-Hello.

661
00:47:58,617 --> 00:47:59,993
She's 19 weeks pregnant.

662
00:48:00,076 --> 00:48:02,787
She's nitrazine positive
and has a gross rupture.

663
00:48:02,871 --> 00:48:05,081
Her AFI is 3cm at the moment.

664
00:48:05,165 --> 00:48:07,000
PROM is suspected.

665
00:48:07,542 --> 00:48:09,210
-Did you say 19 weeks?
-Yes.

666
00:48:09,294 --> 00:48:11,254
To be exact, 19 weeks and 5 days.

667
00:48:12,297 --> 00:48:13,256
It's too soon.

668
00:48:14,257 --> 00:48:16,509
-Where is she now?
-In the MFICU.

669
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:24,559
No, Doctor.

670
00:48:25,644 --> 00:48:29,230
We went through hoops
to conceive this baby.

671
00:48:30,273 --> 00:48:34,778
I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do
at this stage of pregnancy.

672
00:48:35,987 --> 00:48:39,199
You need to be at least 24 weeks pregnant
for us to save the baby.

673
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:42,744
Waiting won't help as it's happening
so early in the pregnancy.

674
00:48:42,827 --> 00:48:47,290
Even if we decide to wait,
the baby's lungs won't develop properly

675
00:48:47,374 --> 00:48:49,292
because your water broke prematurely.

676
00:48:51,086 --> 00:48:55,173
The baby won't last long at all
even if it's born.

677
00:48:56,341 --> 00:48:59,344
And it could cause inflammation,
which will also put you in danger.

678
00:49:08,728 --> 00:49:10,063
You probably need…

679
00:49:11,189 --> 00:49:13,692
some time to prepare yourself
to say goodbye.

680
00:49:13,775 --> 00:49:15,026
I'll leave you to it.

681
00:49:37,716 --> 00:49:40,468
<i>Premature rupture of membranes
at 19 weeks of pregnancy.</i>

682
00:49:40,552 --> 00:49:44,013
<i>Can't keep the baby as she has lost
most of her amniotic fluid.</i>

683
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:47,892
<i>If delivered now,
the fetus will not be viable,</i>

684
00:49:47,976 --> 00:49:50,353
<i>and the chance of survival is low.</i>

685
00:49:50,437 --> 00:49:52,981
<i>PROM can cause a prolapsed umbilical cord,</i>

686
00:49:53,064 --> 00:49:57,318
<i>a womb infection, and preterm labor pains,
which can be dangerous.</i>

687
00:49:57,402 --> 00:50:00,071
<i>It can also cause inflammation
in the mother's body.</i>

688
00:50:00,155 --> 00:50:03,074
<i>If prematurely born,
the baby's underdeveloped lungs</i>

689
00:50:03,158 --> 00:50:06,119
<i>could cause complications
such as breathing difficulties.</i>

690
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,375
Oh, boy. That's quite a chart.

691
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:15,211
She must be devastated now.

692
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:16,713
I know.

693
00:50:17,505 --> 00:50:21,384
I hope she can let it go
and pull herself together soon.

694
00:50:21,468 --> 00:50:24,137
If it's dragged out,
it'll only get harder for the mother.

695
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:29,768
The ambulances are so busy today.

696
00:50:30,268 --> 00:50:32,437
Se-ho.

697
00:50:34,147 --> 00:50:36,566
Do you know where you are now? Se-ho.

698
00:50:38,443 --> 00:50:41,446
It's okay, Se-ho.
You're in the hospital now. It's okay.

699
00:50:43,615 --> 00:50:45,200
Did you call Pediatric Surgery?

700
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:48,661
Dr. Jang is out for procurement.
It'll take her a while.

701
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:51,498
Oh, no.
I think we should call Professor Ahn.

702
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,958
Professor Ahn must be in surgery now.

703
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:00,256
<i>This is Professor Ahn's phone.</i>

704
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,509
<i>He's in surgery
and can't come to the phone now.</i>

705
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,344
This is Kang So-ye, a fellow in the ER.

706
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:07,055
I'm calling because
Professor Ahn's patient just came in.

707
00:51:07,138 --> 00:51:09,474
<i>An eight-year-old
traffic accident patient, male.</i>

708
00:51:09,557 --> 00:51:12,268
<i>Mental state, drowsy.
His BP is 80 over 60,</i>

709
00:51:12,352 --> 00:51:14,813
<i>and his heart rate is 120.
Based on the physical exam…</i>

710
00:51:14,896 --> 00:51:17,148
If there's a notable difference
in the diameters,

711
00:51:17,232 --> 00:51:19,317
-keep the stitches small.
-Got it.

712
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,196
<i>Everything else looks okay,
but we've spotted a fluid collection.</i>

713
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:24,823
An emergency transfusion…

714
00:51:24,906 --> 00:51:27,200
We need to do surgery.
Examine the patient quickly.

715
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:35,667
The intestinal anastomosis is done.
Please seal up the rest.

716
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,293
Please call me when it's done.

717
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,966
His current vitals?

718
00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:46,094
BP is 70 over 50,
and his heart rate is 130.

719
00:51:52,684 --> 00:51:54,143
Se-ho, does it hurt a lot?

720
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,731
I'm sorry, but can you book an OR for me?

721
00:51:58,815 --> 00:51:59,899
Sure.

722
00:52:06,281 --> 00:52:07,282
Sorry?

723
00:52:08,783 --> 00:52:10,285
You want a different doctor?

724
00:52:10,368 --> 00:52:13,705
I read a blog post about
Professor Yang Seok-hyeong helping someone

725
00:52:13,788 --> 00:52:16,749
who was 18 weeks pregnant
keep her baby and give birth safely.

726
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:20,086
I'm really sorry.

727
00:52:21,045 --> 00:52:23,673
I know it's rude of me
to make such a request.

728
00:52:24,257 --> 00:52:27,010
I'm fully aware that
I shouldn't be asking you this,

729
00:52:28,344 --> 00:52:31,764
but I feel no shame right now.

730
00:52:34,267 --> 00:52:35,560
Please, help me.

731
00:52:36,102 --> 00:52:39,898
Could you please ask
Professor Yang Seok-hyeong just once?

732
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:44,360
I'm really sorry.

733
00:52:46,487 --> 00:52:50,950
I understand the situation is bad…

734
00:52:54,287 --> 00:52:56,164
but I can feel my baby moving.

735
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,626
So how could I give up?

736
00:53:22,106 --> 00:53:25,276
-Who is it?
-It's Chu Min-ha, Professor.

737
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,861
-Come in.
-Thank you.

738
00:53:37,163 --> 00:53:38,623
Sure, that's fine.

739
00:53:41,876 --> 00:53:44,504
Let her have her way. I don't care.

740
00:53:46,506 --> 00:53:48,216
Okay, then.

741
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:53,805
-Who is it?
-It's me, Min-ha.

742
00:53:53,888 --> 00:53:55,181
Come in.

743
00:53:57,016 --> 00:53:59,978
I explained the situation to her
several times,

744
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:02,355
but she's saying she still can't give up.

745
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:05,650
She said she can't give up
when she can still feel her baby moving.

746
00:54:06,818 --> 00:54:07,944
Is she, by any chance…

747
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:11,489
on the slimmer side?

748
00:54:11,572 --> 00:54:12,657
Pardon?

749
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:15,076
Well, yes.

750
00:54:17,537 --> 00:54:19,747
She conceived the baby
after three rounds of IVF.

751
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:23,918
She practically begged me, saying
she wants to try everything she can.

752
00:54:25,712 --> 00:54:26,879
What did Professor Yeom say?

753
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,298
She said the decision is yours.
She doesn't care.

754
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,217
Really?

755
00:54:34,095 --> 00:54:36,681
-Then I'll examine the patient.
-Really?

756
00:54:36,764 --> 00:54:39,642
-Where is she now?
-In the MFICU.

757
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:42,270
-I'll go after my outpatient appointments.
-Okay.

758
00:54:42,353 --> 00:54:45,023
Text me her name and registration number.

759
00:54:45,106 --> 00:54:46,107
-Will do.
-Okay.

760
00:55:00,038 --> 00:55:00,872
Get going.

761
00:55:03,249 --> 00:55:04,417
Have a good day.

762
00:55:09,672 --> 00:55:13,092
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

763
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:15,261
The situation looks pretty bad indeed.

764
00:55:17,263 --> 00:55:20,391
The baby has a slim chance of survival.

765
00:55:24,062 --> 00:55:27,482
But I wouldn't say there's zero chance,

766
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:31,069
so I'm going to trust that
we still have hope and do my very best.

767
00:55:37,075 --> 00:55:38,951
Thank you, Doctor.

768
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,956
For the baby, we'll use antibiotics
and see how it goes.

769
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,126
At week 23, we'll consider injections
that speed up lung development.

770
00:55:47,668 --> 00:55:51,339
Thankfully, the baby's movements
in the womb seem totally fine.

771
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:56,219
You're not showing any signs of infection,
and you don't have a fever.

772
00:55:57,095 --> 00:55:58,554
If you experience contractions,

773
00:55:58,638 --> 00:56:02,058
we'll give you meds that can control that
and see how it goes.

774
00:56:02,141 --> 00:56:03,309
Okay.

775
00:56:04,102 --> 00:56:07,814
-Thank you.
-Then I'll see you tomorrow.

776
00:56:48,688 --> 00:56:51,607
I bet you haven't had dinner yet.
I got you some pastries.

777
00:56:51,691 --> 00:56:53,192
I feel bad that I'm going home.

778
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:02,910
I feel like you work all the night shifts
in OB-GYN.

779
00:57:02,994 --> 00:57:04,370
Do you have a lot to do?

780
00:57:08,332 --> 00:57:10,793
Are you organizing the charts?
Is there a problem?

781
00:57:10,877 --> 00:57:12,545
Look at this.

782
00:57:15,089 --> 00:57:16,215
"At 19 weeks…"

783
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:19,135
<i>Premature rupture of membranes
at 19 weeks of pregnancy.</i>

784
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:22,680
<i>Lost most of her amniotic fluid,
but fetal movements look good.</i>

785
00:57:22,763 --> 00:57:23,931
<i>Breech presentation.</i>

786
00:57:24,015 --> 00:57:27,476
<i>No signs of infection in the womb.
No contractions detected.</i>

787
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,521
<i>Antibiotics will be given
to prevent infection in the womb.</i>

788
00:57:30,605 --> 00:57:32,815
<i>Contractions will be regulated
should they occur.</i>

789
00:57:32,899 --> 00:57:35,860
<i>If stable condition is maintained
until Week 23,</i>

790
00:57:35,943 --> 00:57:39,655
<i>the fetus will become viable.
We will, then, consider betamethasone.</i>

791
00:57:39,739 --> 00:57:41,574
<i>C-section will be performed if needed.</i>

792
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:44,410
Looks like this patient may be able
to keep her baby.

793
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:48,873
WATERY DISCHARGE

794
00:57:52,752 --> 00:57:56,881
CAN'T KEEP THE BABY AS SHE HAS LOST
MOST OF HER AMNIOTIC FLUID

795
00:57:56,964 --> 00:58:00,259
I see.
This case will be a little difficult.

796
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,932
Don't you notice anything strange?

797
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,141
I do.

798
00:58:09,227 --> 00:58:11,103
You can't organize the charts like this.

799
00:58:13,147 --> 00:58:15,775
There can't be two different patients
under one profile.

800
00:58:17,735 --> 00:58:19,529
It's the same person.

801
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,283
The same day, the exact same patient.

802
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,371
And the charts were written
by the same person,

803
00:58:28,955 --> 00:58:31,040
Chu Min-ha. Me.

804
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:35,586
The same patient.

805
00:58:36,754 --> 00:58:38,130
The same day.

806
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,008
The same resident.

807
00:58:42,718 --> 00:58:44,720
Just a different professor,

808
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,849
but the content of the chart
totally changed in just a few hours.

809
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:09,537
Professor Ahn!

810
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:12,123
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

811
00:59:12,206 --> 00:59:14,208
-Hello.
-Hello.

812
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:15,334
Are you done for the day?

813
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:17,044
Yes, I'm going to head out soon.

814
00:59:17,795 --> 00:59:21,257
Professor Ahn, I'm on duty tonight.
Can you buy me a coffee?

815
00:59:26,554 --> 00:59:28,264
You can use this to get a coffee.

816
00:59:28,764 --> 00:59:29,640
Thank you.

817
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:32,685
You can give my ID badge to Gwang-hyeon.

818
00:59:32,768 --> 00:59:34,895
I'll pick it up tomorrow morning.

819
00:59:34,979 --> 00:59:36,272
Thank you.

820
00:59:50,745 --> 00:59:52,622
EMERGENCY CENTER

821
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:58,210
It's cold. Come out when I call you.

822
01:00:01,756 --> 01:00:04,383
I knew it. I'll be right there.
Give me a minute.

823
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,975
I blow-dried my hair.

824
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,561
Stop raining, please.

825
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:28,407
Let's go. I'm hungry.

826
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:29,825
Okay.

827
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:36,332
All right, let's go.

828
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:39,293
-Aren't you hungry?
-I am.

829
01:00:39,877 --> 01:00:42,922
-What shall we have?
-I'm good with anything.

830
01:00:43,005 --> 01:00:46,384
Really? What should we eat
to make everyone jealous?

831
01:00:46,467 --> 01:00:48,427
What? No one can know about this!

832
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,680
Oh, right. We have to keep this a secret.

833
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:06,779
Professor Lee Ik-jun asked me twice
today alone.

834
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:08,781
He asked me if we were seeing each other.

835
01:01:09,824 --> 01:01:12,034
He said he feels like
we're putting on an act.

836
01:01:12,118 --> 01:01:15,913
He asked me to tell him the truth,
swearing he wouldn't tell anyone.

837
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:19,125
I'll tell my friends sometime next week.

838
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:22,128
They'll keep their lips sealed
and keep it under wraps.

839
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:27,508
I'm totally fine with it
as long as you're okay with it.

840
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:29,969
So if there's anyone you want to tell,
go ahead.

841
01:01:30,511 --> 01:01:31,679
I don't care.

842
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:35,307
Okay, let me think about it.
There's one person I want to tell.

843
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:39,437
Who? Dr. Chu Min-ha in OB-GYN?

844
01:01:40,271 --> 01:01:41,272
Yes.

845
01:01:53,033 --> 01:01:54,952
She stayed with you all night

846
01:01:55,035 --> 01:01:57,037
when you went to the ER
due to anaphylaxis.

847
01:01:57,121 --> 01:01:58,164
You're both ARMYs.

848
01:01:59,457 --> 01:02:02,668
Yes, how did you know?

849
01:02:04,712 --> 01:02:05,713
I heard about it.

850
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,218
-I think Ik-jun told me.
-I see.

851
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:13,721
Aren't you on duty tomorrow night?

852
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:16,140
I saw the schedule.

853
01:02:17,016 --> 01:02:19,935
You're working all the night shifts
this week except for today.

854
01:02:20,686 --> 01:02:22,062
Are you going to be okay?

855
01:02:25,065 --> 01:02:27,651
I can stay with you at night.

856
01:02:31,155 --> 01:02:34,366
I mean, I'd be in my office working,
obviously.

857
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:41,248
I can't help you with your tasks,

858
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:45,711
but I can stay up all night with you.

859
01:02:46,754 --> 01:02:49,423
No, it's okay. I got it.

860
01:02:52,092 --> 01:02:54,762
By the way,
there's something I want to ask you.

861
01:02:55,429 --> 01:02:56,430
What is it?

862
01:02:57,556 --> 01:03:00,226
I have one personal question
and one work-related question.

863
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:02,436
Well…

864
01:03:03,437 --> 01:03:04,647
What's the personal one?

865
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:09,109
Can we go to the movies this weekend?

866
01:03:11,028 --> 01:03:12,112
Of course, we can.

867
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,533
Now, the work-related question.

868
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:17,827
Well…

869
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,621
It's about Yeon-u.

870
01:03:21,163 --> 01:03:23,457
The kid who died last fall.

871
01:03:23,999 --> 01:03:25,501
Professor Lee Ji-yeong's patient.

872
01:03:26,919 --> 01:03:27,753
Right.

873
01:03:29,129 --> 01:03:34,134
Yeon-u's mother
has been visiting the hospital

874
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:37,054
since about a month after Yeon-u died.

875
01:03:40,057 --> 01:03:42,935
Sometimes, she'd intentionally
book an appointment to visit us,

876
01:03:43,018 --> 01:03:45,521
or she'd say she stopped by
because she was in the area.

877
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:50,109
She visits the hospital often
for no reason.

878
01:03:50,192 --> 01:03:52,486
And she looks for me every time.

879
01:03:54,655 --> 01:03:57,408
I get the feeling that
she has something to say to me,

880
01:03:58,492 --> 01:04:00,369
but I can't figure out what it could be.

881
01:04:02,788 --> 01:04:06,667
Should I politely ask her what it's about?

882
01:04:07,334 --> 01:04:12,339
Or should I just continue
to feign ignorance like I'm doing now?

883
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:15,342
I don't know what to do.

884
01:04:22,016 --> 01:04:26,061
She keeps visiting the hospital
because she wants to talk about Yeon-u.

885
01:04:29,523 --> 01:04:32,443
There's no other reason.

886
01:04:35,446 --> 01:04:39,241
No one else remembers her child, you know.

887
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:45,414
The relatives must have only met Yeon-u
once or twice.

888
01:04:45,998 --> 01:04:49,251
And Yeon-u didn't go to day care,
so there are no teachers.

889
01:04:51,045 --> 01:04:54,006
Yeon-u practically lived
in the hospital since birth,

890
01:04:55,507 --> 01:04:59,511
so no one outside the hospital
remembers the kid.

891
01:05:01,889 --> 01:05:06,018
As a mother,
she wants to talk about Yeon-u

892
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,729
but has no one to talk to…

893
01:05:10,397 --> 01:05:15,194
except for the doctors and nurses
who took care of him for a long time.

894
01:05:18,906 --> 01:05:21,200
She's grateful to you for all your help,

895
01:05:21,283 --> 01:05:23,744
but she also wants to talk to you
about Yeon-u.

896
01:05:24,703 --> 01:05:27,623
She might make you uncomfortable
or avoid the subject altogether,

897
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:30,626
but next time you see her,

898
01:05:30,709 --> 01:05:35,172
go talk to her first and buy her
a cup of coffee or something.

899
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,262
No one keeps visiting forever.

900
01:05:43,055 --> 01:05:44,682
She, too, will stop eventually.

901
01:05:45,933 --> 01:05:48,811
Because we all have to forget and move on.

902
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,690
So just until then,

903
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:57,069
give her a warm welcome
whenever you see her.

904
01:05:58,862 --> 01:05:59,863
Okay.

905
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:03,200
Let's eat.

906
01:06:24,304 --> 01:06:25,431
No.

907
01:06:27,975 --> 01:06:30,644
Come in. I can see you, you know.

908
01:06:30,728 --> 01:06:31,603
Thank you.

909
01:06:49,997 --> 01:06:51,457
Thank you.

910
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,541
No problem.

911
01:06:59,214 --> 01:07:02,259
Professor Yang,
I guess it is winter indeed.

912
01:07:04,178 --> 01:07:07,306
You're drinking hot coffee
instead of an iced Americano today.

913
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:11,935
I guess…

914
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:14,313
you're not scared of me at all.

915
01:07:15,439 --> 01:07:17,983
I am. I'm really scared of you.

916
01:07:19,276 --> 01:07:20,778
So, what's up?

917
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:22,946
I'm tired. I want to go home.

918
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:24,823
I have two questions for you.

919
01:07:26,116 --> 01:07:28,452
-Just ask one.
-Just one?

920
01:07:28,535 --> 01:07:31,038
Yes, just one question a day.

921
01:07:31,622 --> 01:07:35,459
Only one a day. Then I'll answer it nicely
without getting angry.

922
01:07:37,127 --> 01:07:38,545
What should I do?

923
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:42,716
What if the two questions
are combined into one?

924
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,801
No, you can't do that.

925
01:07:45,302 --> 01:07:46,303
Okay.

926
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,599
Patient Kim Su-jeong…

927
01:07:50,682 --> 01:07:52,684
The PROM patient who was admitted today.

928
01:07:54,269 --> 01:07:58,148
What made you make such a decision
in that situation?

929
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:01,985
No one can guarantee
the treatment will be successful.

930
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:05,114
So why did you make that decision
knowing the chances are slim?

931
01:08:06,448 --> 01:08:07,908
I was so impressed.

932
01:08:11,745 --> 01:08:16,708
Well, I just wanted to help
the patient and her baby.

933
01:08:18,836 --> 01:08:23,590
She felt her baby sooner
because she's on the slimmer side.

934
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:30,180
The fact that she can feel her baby
shows us the baby's will to live.

935
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:36,979
If both the mother and the baby
are determined to get through this,

936
01:08:38,438 --> 01:08:42,693
I think helping them is the best choice
I can make in this situation

937
01:08:42,776 --> 01:08:44,653
even though the chances are slim.

938
01:08:49,283 --> 01:08:50,534
If…

939
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:57,040
something bad happens to the baby
and the mother as well…

940
01:08:57,124 --> 01:08:59,376
What if her family blames you for it?

941
01:09:00,752 --> 01:09:02,880
Aren't you afraid of that?

942
01:09:07,134 --> 01:09:07,968
I am.

943
01:09:10,888 --> 01:09:12,347
I'm afraid too.

944
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:15,642
But if I think about that now,
I won't be able to do anything.

945
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:19,605
"What is the best I can do now?"

946
01:09:20,105 --> 01:09:21,815
That's what I try to focus on.

947
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:31,950
Get going. It's past midnight.

948
01:09:33,076 --> 01:09:33,952
I'm sorry.

949
01:09:40,751 --> 01:09:42,961
-Professor Yang.
-Yeah?

950
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:44,338
It's past midnight.

951
01:09:44,421 --> 01:09:46,673
I know. I'll go home soon.

952
01:09:46,757 --> 01:09:48,217
No, it's not that.

953
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,805
It's a new day,
so I can ask you another question.

954
01:09:56,266 --> 01:09:58,644
May I ask you the question of the day?

955
01:10:00,103 --> 01:10:01,188
Sure.

956
01:10:01,855 --> 01:10:03,273
What's your question?

957
01:10:03,357 --> 01:10:05,275
Well…

958
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:09,738
It's about Professor Yoon Seon-ju
in Room 7009.

959
01:10:10,322 --> 01:10:13,909
What's your relationship
with his daughter?

960
01:10:16,453 --> 01:10:19,790
Rumors say she's your girlfriend.

961
01:10:19,873 --> 01:10:20,958
She's my ex-wife.

962
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:26,421
Professor Yoon Seon-ju's daughter
is my ex-wife.

963
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:28,340
I see.

964
01:10:29,508 --> 01:10:31,677
What are you doing tomorrow evening?

965
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:34,888
You don't have any surgeries
or outpatient appointments booked,

966
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:37,808
and I'm not working the night shift.

967
01:10:37,891 --> 01:10:40,143
I have my band practice right after work.

968
01:10:40,227 --> 01:10:41,937
But Professor Chae is in Sokcho now.

969
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,647
Song-hwa is in Seoul now.

970
01:10:44,147 --> 01:10:46,275
She got a new car,
so she'll give us a ride…

971
01:10:48,902 --> 01:10:51,780
Why am I telling you these things
right now?

972
01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:54,074
Good night.

973
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,185
We picked the perfect song
for this rainy day.

974
01:11:23,103 --> 01:11:24,438
Did you choose the song?

975
01:11:24,521 --> 01:11:25,522
No.

976
01:11:27,107 --> 01:11:28,608
I didn't know it'd rain.

977
01:11:29,192 --> 01:11:31,945
Hey, everyone at the hospital's saying
you're seeing someone.

978
01:11:32,029 --> 01:11:33,488
I don't care.

979
01:11:33,572 --> 01:11:36,074
Are you sure you didn't spread the rumor?
It's so cold.

980
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,784
Why would I?

981
01:11:39,661 --> 01:11:41,330
"She's his ex-wife, not girlfriend."

982
01:11:41,413 --> 01:11:43,874
I'm debating whether or not
I should tell everyone.

983
01:11:43,957 --> 01:11:48,045
Jeong-won, are you and Gyeo-ul
really not seeing each other?

984
01:11:48,128 --> 01:11:49,379
Mind your own business.

985
01:11:50,047 --> 01:11:54,843
Jun-wan's lovely dove is in the UK now.
He's in a long-distance relationship.

986
01:11:54,926 --> 01:11:56,970
Really? Where in the UK?

987
01:11:57,637 --> 01:11:59,431
I think she's in London.

988
01:11:59,514 --> 01:12:00,515
London?

989
01:12:05,408 --> 01:12:07,452
Really? Where in the UK?

990
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:09,913
I think she's in London.

991
01:12:09,996 --> 01:12:10,997
London?

992
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:14,876
Don't tell me…

993
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,257
Ask her if she knows Ik-sun.

994
01:12:21,508 --> 01:12:23,260
My sister's in London now, you know.

995
01:12:23,885 --> 01:12:26,179
Oh, right. I'll ask her.

996
01:12:26,263 --> 01:12:27,347
Okay.

997
01:12:29,599 --> 01:12:31,184
Make sure you ask her.

998
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:34,563
My sister's always the life of the party,
so she may already know her.

999
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:36,815
-Okay, I'll ask her.
-Good.

1000
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:39,150
-Don't forget.
-I won't.

1001
01:12:39,234 --> 01:12:41,695
-London is…
-Is that her car?

1002
01:12:59,045 --> 01:13:01,798
Nice car!

1003
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:05,343
All right!

1004
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:09,890
Get in the car!

1005
01:13:15,312 --> 01:13:17,272
It's raining a lot.

1006
01:13:17,355 --> 01:13:19,816
Let's wait for that car to move.
No need to rush.

1007
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,359
We'll just watch the rain.

1008
01:13:22,152 --> 01:13:23,069
All right.

1009
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:24,571
Did you pick up the car today?

1010
01:13:24,654 --> 01:13:26,573
Yesterday. I bought it with my own money.

1011
01:13:26,656 --> 01:13:29,743
Obviously. Who buys a car
with someone else's money?

1012
01:13:34,664 --> 01:13:38,627
You're not the type
to leave these things on, are you?

1013
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:42,380
Yes! I am! My gosh!

1014
01:13:42,464 --> 01:13:44,758
I bought the car yesterday.
Why take this off?

1015
01:13:44,841 --> 01:13:46,801
You have to take it off eventually.

1016
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:49,429
Hey, the hazard lights.
Let's move the car a little.

1017
01:13:55,894 --> 01:13:58,563
Seriously. Did you have to do that?

1018
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:08,907
-Song-hwa.
-Yes?

1019
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:11,242
Why do I always have to sit here?

1020
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:13,286
Jeez, he's at it again.

1021
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:15,956
Hey, keep your eyes on the screen.
Right here.

1022
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:18,458
It shows you everything you need to see.

1023
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:20,877
My gosh, you're right!

1024
01:14:20,961 --> 01:14:22,796
This has been around for a long time.

1025
01:14:22,879 --> 01:14:26,341
Lee Ik-jun, you sit here.
Sit in the middle for a change.

1026
01:14:26,424 --> 01:14:28,093
No, the seat warmer is on now.

1027
01:14:28,176 --> 01:14:30,011
You never sit in the middle.

1028
01:14:30,095 --> 01:14:32,681
These guys have sat in the middle
once at least.

1029
01:14:32,764 --> 01:14:33,848
But you, never.

1030
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:35,976
For me, this is the third time in a row!

1031
01:14:36,059 --> 01:14:39,521
Jeez, that creepy jerk.
Is he a pervert or a genius?

1032
01:14:41,022 --> 01:14:42,023
We'll go now.

1033
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:46,277
Ahn Jeong-won, can we go now?

1034
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:48,989
-Yes, ma'am.
-Mom? What should I eat for dinner?

1035
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:50,740
My friends and I will order in.

1036
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:52,951
Should I have <i>kalguksu</i> or fried chicken?

1037
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:54,828
How many chickens?

1038
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:57,414
You guys drive me nuts.

1039
01:14:57,497 --> 01:15:00,667
I have to say, U-ju is much more mature
than these guys.

1040
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:17,392
My goodness.

1041
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:44,794
Hello.

1042
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:46,838
Oh, you're here. Just a moment, please.

1043
01:16:07,942 --> 01:16:10,737
-You didn't bring an umbrella?
-No.

1044
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:12,781
Because I was coming to pick this up.

1045
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:16,409
Right, here.

1046
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:19,746
Oh, no. I'm the only one here now.

1047
01:16:19,829 --> 01:16:22,332
Take it home
and enjoy it with your family.

1048
01:16:22,415 --> 01:16:26,503
We already had one.
We also had seaweed soup this morning.

1049
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:31,216
We wished Yeon-u a happy birthday
and had the cake together.

1050
01:16:31,299 --> 01:16:34,260
I got this for the Pediatric Surgery team.

1051
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:37,055
Still, I can't finish this whole cake
by myself.

1052
01:16:37,138 --> 01:16:38,515
I'll eat the whole thing.

1053
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:42,185
-Hello, Dr. Jang.
-Hello.

1054
01:16:42,268 --> 01:16:46,356
We'll accept the cake.
I can finish it alone.

1055
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:48,149
Well, okay.

1056
01:16:50,276 --> 01:16:52,320
Are you working the night shift again?

1057
01:16:53,196 --> 01:16:55,615
Gosh, you're always so busy.

1058
01:16:55,698 --> 01:16:59,828
I've gotten the hang of it,
so I actually have more free time now.

1059
01:17:00,453 --> 01:17:04,249
Make sure to look after yourself.

1060
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:08,795
You're busy.
Sorry for taking up your time.

1061
01:17:08,878 --> 01:17:10,672
I'll be off, then.

1062
01:17:12,006 --> 01:17:13,007
Ma'am.

1063
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:21,683
Would you like to have some coffee with me
if you're free now?

1064
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:28,106
It's my treat.

1065
01:17:32,527 --> 01:17:33,361
Sure.

1066
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:11,107
<i>I don't miss you anymore</i>

1067
01:18:12,317 --> 01:18:15,820
<i>I don't even want to see you</i>

1068
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:24,579
<i>I'm even beginning to forget the fact
That we were in love</i>

1069
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:29,292
<i>Quietly</i>

1070
01:18:32,337 --> 01:18:34,881
<i>I don't understand</i>

1071
01:18:35,673 --> 01:18:37,967
<i>Why I feel this way</i>

1072
01:18:38,968 --> 01:18:42,388
<i>I cry when it rains</i>

1073
01:18:45,642 --> 01:18:51,648
<i>Just like the day I left you</i>

1074
01:18:52,232 --> 01:18:56,110
<i>Many years ago</i>

1075
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:04,786
<i>I'm okay now</i>

1076
01:19:05,536 --> 01:19:09,457
<i>I've given up on love</i>

1077
01:19:12,335 --> 01:19:18,841
<i>Why am I </i>

1078
01:19:18,925 --> 01:19:23,888
<i>Crying like a fool?</i>

1079
01:19:32,772 --> 01:19:37,151
I visit too often, don't I?

1080
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:39,570
I'm sorry.

1081
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:43,574
My husband always asks me
why I keep coming here.

1082
01:19:45,243 --> 01:19:49,122
For some strange reason,
I keep coming here.

1083
01:19:55,503 --> 01:19:56,587
Ma'am.

1084
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:02,260
I can be very quiet and blunt.

1085
01:20:05,138 --> 01:20:06,848
I'm not good with words.

1086
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:09,892
And I don't know what to say
to console others.

1087
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:17,817
But if you ever want to talk about
or miss Yeon-u ,

1088
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,570
feel free to visit me anytime.

1089
01:20:24,907 --> 01:20:26,367
Thank you.

1090
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:30,371
I know as much about Yeon-u as you do.

1091
01:20:31,706 --> 01:20:34,709
You won't find anyone
who understands you better.

1092
01:20:36,502 --> 01:20:37,503
Right.

1093
01:20:41,257 --> 01:20:42,592
Dr. Jang.

1094
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:47,180
Whenever I come here,

1095
01:20:48,139 --> 01:20:51,809
people call me Yeon-u's mom.

1096
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:58,316
I love hearing that.

1097
01:21:02,445 --> 01:21:04,614
Now that Yeon-u is no longer with us,

1098
01:21:06,574 --> 01:21:08,868
no one knows that I'm Yeon-u's mom.

1099
01:21:10,828 --> 01:21:12,330
But when I come here,

1100
01:21:14,749 --> 01:21:17,251
everyone calls me Yeon-u's mom.

1101
01:21:21,422 --> 01:21:22,590
People tell me

1102
01:21:24,592 --> 01:21:26,135
that I should put behind

1103
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:30,598
such painful memories and move on,

1104
01:21:32,141 --> 01:21:33,643
but I don't want to…

1105
01:21:35,353 --> 01:21:36,979
lose Yeon-u so soon.

1106
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:43,361
That poor thing lived such a short life.

1107
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:50,660
I want to remember Yeon-u
for as long as I can.

1108
01:21:58,668 --> 01:21:59,669
Oh, and…

1109
01:22:04,465 --> 01:22:05,466
Here.

1110
01:22:09,345 --> 01:22:13,266
I thought maybe I shouldn't give it to you
because it's embarrassing,

1111
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:17,562
but I still wanted
to express my gratitude.

1112
01:22:23,943 --> 01:22:29,866
<i>The faint memories
That I vaguely remember now</i>

1113
01:22:30,658 --> 01:22:34,245
<i>They truly broke my heart</i>

1114
01:22:37,415 --> 01:22:43,421
<i>I hate you</i>

1115
01:22:43,963 --> 01:22:49,135
<i>But I still miss you</i>

1116
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:57,143
<i>I'm okay now</i>

1117
01:22:57,226 --> 01:23:00,897
<i>I've given up on love</i>

1118
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:10,573
<i>Why am I </i>

1119
01:23:10,656 --> 01:23:16,412
<i>Crying like a fool?</i>

1120
01:23:17,413 --> 01:23:23,878
<i>I know you won't come back to me</i>

1121
01:23:23,961 --> 01:23:27,632
<i>I hate myself
For still being hung up on you</i>

1122
01:23:30,718 --> 01:23:37,225
<i>How much longer</i>

1123
01:23:37,308 --> 01:23:43,356
<i>Will my heart ache?</i>

1124
01:23:44,023 --> 01:23:50,571
<i>I'm okay now</i>

1125
01:23:50,655 --> 01:23:54,450
<i>I've given up on love</i>

1126
01:23:57,453 --> 01:24:03,918
<i>Why am I </i>

1127
01:24:04,001 --> 01:24:09,882
<i>Crying like a fool?</i>

1128
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:17,139
<i>Why am I crying?</i>

1129
01:24:39,704 --> 01:24:42,373
-We're off.
-I'll drive you guys home.

1130
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:46,961
I said, I can drive you home.

1131
01:24:47,044 --> 01:24:49,755
It's okay. We can take a cab.

1132
01:24:49,839 --> 01:24:51,090
Just drive Ik-jun home.

1133
01:24:52,174 --> 01:24:53,217
Yes, please!

1134
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:59,849
Song-hwa, if you hook up your phone
to your car,

1135
01:24:59,932 --> 01:25:03,227
you can listen to music loudly
while driving. Try it.

1136
01:25:03,811 --> 01:25:05,938
I always listen to music when I drive.

1137
01:25:06,564 --> 01:25:09,108
That's called Bluetooth.

1138
01:25:11,193 --> 01:25:12,445
I know that.

1139
01:25:13,571 --> 01:25:15,197
Drive safely to Sokcho.

1140
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:17,908
-Will do. Bye.
-Bye.

1141
01:25:18,534 --> 01:25:20,620
Gosh, I'm getting sleepy.

1142
01:25:20,703 --> 01:25:23,372
-Drive safely. See you on the weekend.
-Okay.

1143
01:25:23,456 --> 01:25:25,625
-Bye, Ik-jun.
-Bye, enjoy.

1144
01:25:34,884 --> 01:25:36,969
He wants to watch <i>New Journey to the West</i>.

1145
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:39,555
I know that much.

1146
01:25:44,518 --> 01:25:46,812
-Where's your car?
-Right in front.

1147
01:25:48,022 --> 01:25:50,107
-Shall we?
-Okay.

1148
01:26:13,047 --> 01:26:14,298
Should we put the radio on?

1149
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:17,134
Put on that song.

1150
01:26:17,635 --> 01:26:19,637
The song we practiced earlier.

1151
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:20,846
Sure.

1152
01:27:25,327 --> 01:27:27,163
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

1153
01:27:27,705 --> 01:27:30,332
Is everything okay? I have surgery.

1154
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,836
<i>Do you have plans for this evening?
Let's have dinner together.</i>

1155
01:27:35,337 --> 01:27:37,465
I won't be out of the OR
until around 8 p.m.

1156
01:27:37,548 --> 01:27:40,509
<i>That's fine.
I'll come to the hospital around eight.</i>

1157
01:27:41,427 --> 01:27:43,429
All right, sure.

1158
01:27:43,512 --> 01:27:44,889
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

1159
01:28:14,251 --> 01:28:16,170
-<i>Hey.</i>
-Where are you?

1160
01:28:16,253 --> 01:28:18,255
-<i>The Operating Unit.</i>
-I'll call you back.

1161
01:28:18,339 --> 01:28:21,801
<i>It's fine. They're still getting ready.
I came down early.</i>

1162
01:28:21,884 --> 01:28:24,345
<i>I'm waiting in the lounge now.
Where are you?</i>

1163
01:28:24,428 --> 01:28:26,347
Me? I'm at Yulje.

1164
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:28,516
<i>What? Why are you back?</i>

1165
01:28:28,599 --> 01:28:30,684
<i>You wanted to take it easy and recuperate.</i>

1166
01:28:30,768 --> 01:28:33,187
<i>Why do you keep coming to Seoul?
Cut down on work.</i>

1167
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:35,272
<i>Just say no. Should I do it for you?</i>

1168
01:28:35,356 --> 01:28:38,526
I heard you. I'll take care of it.

1169
01:28:39,652 --> 01:28:42,696
Ik-jun, when will you be done
with the surgery?

1170
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:46,617
<i>Me? Around eight or nine? Why do you ask?</i>

1171
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,702
I'll come to your office around then.

1172
01:28:48,786 --> 01:28:53,332
<i>Really? Okay. Then do what you need to do.
I'll call you when I'm out.</i>

1173
01:28:53,415 --> 01:28:55,876
<i>Or, go home and get some rest.
I'll stop by later.</i>

1174
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,254
No, I'll come to your office.

1175
01:28:59,463 --> 01:29:03,676
I can find things to do to kill time,
so just do a good job with the surgery.

1176
01:29:03,759 --> 01:29:06,595
<i>I always do a good job.
All right, see you later.</i>

1177
01:29:06,679 --> 01:29:07,763
All right.

1178
01:29:21,026 --> 01:29:22,611
We could have gone somewhere else.

1179
01:29:23,946 --> 01:29:25,406
The food here is good.

1180
01:29:26,323 --> 01:29:30,286
By the way, what's up? Is everything okay?

1181
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:34,331
You keep asking if everything's okay.

1182
01:29:34,415 --> 01:29:37,418
Everything's fine.
My father's doing well too.

1183
01:29:38,002 --> 01:29:39,420
Everything is fine.

1184
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,548
Then why are you here?

1185
01:29:46,176 --> 01:29:47,845
I wanted to have dinner with you.

1186
01:29:51,849 --> 01:29:54,184
I came here to have dinner with you.

1187
01:29:57,771 --> 01:29:59,106
Let's…

1188
01:30:00,441 --> 01:30:03,652
meet up like this and have dinner together
once in a while.

1189
01:30:05,904 --> 01:30:07,656
Can we do that?

1190
01:30:35,184 --> 01:30:36,352
<i>Are you done?</i>

1191
01:30:36,435 --> 01:30:38,562
Yes, I'm done. Where are you?

1192
01:30:38,646 --> 01:30:40,439
I'm hungry.

1193
01:30:40,522 --> 01:30:42,399
I'll come to you. Where are you now?

1194
01:30:42,483 --> 01:30:44,068
<i>No, I'll come to you.</i>

1195
01:30:44,693 --> 01:30:45,694
<i>Stay in your office.</i>

1196
01:31:15,391 --> 01:31:16,684
Take a seat.

1197
01:31:17,309 --> 01:31:18,310
It's okay.

1198
01:31:19,395 --> 01:31:21,105
I'll keep it short and get going.

1199
01:31:25,234 --> 01:31:26,652
I want to give you my answer.

1200
01:31:28,529 --> 01:31:29,446
Answer to what?

1201
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,449
The question you asked me in Sokcho.

1202
01:31:53,637 --> 01:31:54,972
Don't tell her how you feel.

1203
01:32:01,395 --> 01:32:04,690
I don't think you should tell her
how you feel about her.

1204
01:32:07,943 --> 01:32:09,862
You said you've known her for a long time.

1205
01:32:11,363 --> 01:32:14,241
If you tell her,
things will get really awkward.

1206
01:32:19,079 --> 01:32:21,874
"I want us to stay best friends.

1207
01:32:24,543 --> 01:32:27,004
I want things to stay
the way they are now."

1208
01:32:28,213 --> 01:32:29,715
She'll probably say that.

1209
01:32:38,307 --> 01:32:39,850
If I were you…

1210
01:32:41,852 --> 01:32:43,061
I wouldn't tell her.

1211
01:32:51,779 --> 01:32:54,364
Don't ask me for advice
on stuff like this.

1212
01:32:55,991 --> 01:32:56,992
I'm off.

1213

1214
01:34:20,242 --> 01:34:22,619
-Professor, did you hear?
-About what?

1215
01:34:22,703 --> 01:34:26,164
They asked for the best neurosurgeon
at our hospital.

1216
01:34:26,248 --> 01:34:28,166
And Song-hwa was chosen.

1217
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:30,586
Send them over to me right away.

1218
01:34:30,669 --> 01:34:34,464
<i>I had five phone calls about it.
I need to work harder.</i>

1219
01:34:34,548 --> 01:34:35,841
<i>-Free this weekend?
-Why?</i>

1220
01:34:35,924 --> 01:34:36,925
-We need to talk.
-Talk.

1221
01:34:37,009 --> 01:34:38,677
A professor's card? Is it yours?

1222
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:40,637
<i>Love's in the air in GS.</i>

1223
01:34:40,721 --> 01:34:43,056
-Take it easy.
-What's with the flowers?

1224
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:45,100
<i>-Professor.
-You startled me.</i>

1225
01:34:45,183 --> 01:34:47,060
-What's going on?
-What?

1226
01:34:47,144 --> 01:34:49,021
<i>I need answers when I'm curious.</i>

1227
01:34:50,731 --> 01:34:54,818
Our goal is to get the baby out safely,
so double-check everything.

1228
01:34:56,361 --> 01:34:57,613
Obstetrics.

1229
01:34:57,696 --> 01:34:59,239
<i>Studying your textbooks again?</i>

1230
01:34:59,323 --> 01:35:01,116
<i>I can feel something running…</i>

1231
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:04,328
<i>Her condition seems to have gotten worse
since coming here.</i>

1232
01:35:04,411 --> 01:35:05,954
<i>I came all this way
because of a recommendation.</i>

1233
01:35:06,038 --> 01:35:08,707
<i>That doubtful look in her eyes…</i>

1234
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:09,666
Gosh.

1235
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:13,754
The way she looks at me
screams that she doesn't trust me.

1236
01:35:13,837 --> 01:35:17,591
<i>Countless people die
because they can't find donors.</i>

1237
01:35:17,674 --> 01:35:19,843
<i>Nothing's going my way.</i>

1238
01:35:19,927 --> 01:35:21,178
I don't think…

1239
01:35:22,554 --> 01:35:24,348
his heart can hold out any longer.
