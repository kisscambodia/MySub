(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,349
I have a wish.

4
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,460
I want you...

5
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,460
to love me.

6
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,199
Can I...

7
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,469
wish for that too?

8
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,100
No.

9
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,850
What is it?

10
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:04,320
(Episode 7)

11
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,280
Ms. Tak.

12
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:06,679
Ms. Tak?

13
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:10,560
- Ms. Tak. - What? Yes?

14
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,790
- Mr. Park is asking for you. - Okay.

15
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,900
What? Mr. Park who? Who is it?

16
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,859
Mr. Park, our CEO.

17
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:20,729
Right. You weren't in the office earlier.

18
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,400
He came to work when you were out.

19
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:25,039
Is it because he's been away?

20
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:26,870
He looks like a different guy.

21
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,109
What's gotten into her?

22
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,780
Maybe, I should have set her up with some guy.

23
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,780
Hey.

24
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:42,049
"Hey"?

25
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,190
Hooray!

26
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,900
Mr. Park is back at last!

27
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,669
I feel so reassured.

28
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:50,739
Right?

29
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,929
The company isn't doing well without me, right?

30
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,259
That's the burden my position comes with.

31
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,910
So you wanted to see me.

32
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,310
Book a restaurant for a get-together.

33
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,079
A get-together? All of a sudden? For what?

34
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,040
I'm back. It's a welcome-back party.

35
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,720
The writers must've been so nervous when I was away.

36
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,079
Just like you,

37
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,979
to make them feel reassured, I should show them I'm back.

38
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,919
Okay.

39
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,350
Call and invite everyone that can attend the get-together.

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,489
(Jijo King)

41
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,559
Hey.

42
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,929
Yes. I was about to set up a meet. Yes.

43
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,629
Right.

44
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:30,929
That's right. I only ended up draining my energy.

45
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,669
I don't get why women want to...

46
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,288
I'm on a break for now.

47
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,679
I have to go back to the dorm later tonight.

48
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:51,749
I decided to spend my valuable time coming here.

49
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:53,119
Right.

50
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,129
I wonder why you decided to spend your valuable time here.

51
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,830
You said you wouldn't write anymore.

52
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,700
Ms. Tak, are you upset?

53
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:06,869
How can I get upset at work?

54
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:08,580
If things don't work out, that's it.

55
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,410
And once it's over, we're no better than strangers.

56
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,419
I wonder why this stranger came to my office.

57
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:15,040
That's what I want to know.

58
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,150
I'll keep writing.

59
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:23,549
- What? - I'll keep writing.

60
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,530
I don't have a lot left to write about anyway.

61
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,460
I'll cut it short and finish it.

62
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,689
But you cannot tell anyone.

63
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:32,439
Right now, people think I'm an innocent boy...

64
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,030
who doesn't even know how to use the Internet.

65
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,830
Well, why did you change your mind?

66
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,530
I keep having weird dreams.

67
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
Dreams?

68
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,100
Some weird guy keeps popping up in my dream.

69
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,650
He keeps threatening me that I can't debut if I don't finish.

70
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,979
He pushed me off the cliff.

71
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,850
He locked me up in an elevator and made it fall.

72
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,540
He made the plane I was on crash.

73
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,559
My mom tells me it's a dream...

74
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,080
that will make me taller, so I shouldn't worry.

75
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,679
But these dreams are on another level.

76
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,729
I always wake up in fear.

77
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:00,520
I can't sleep because I'm scared that I'll dream again.

78
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,090
Since I can't sleep, I can't remember all of my lines.

79
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:07,629
I'm really worried that I'll ruin my chance.

80
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,830
Let me keep writing.

81
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:14,369
Do you think this is funny? I'm serious.

82
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,939
It's not funny. I'm serious too.

83
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,590
It's about that man who showed up in your dreams.

84
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,580
Did he say who he was?

85
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:27,979
He said...

86
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:30,619
he was a jerk.

87
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,689
Jerk.

88
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,390
What? Was that for me?

89
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,400
No. That man in your dream is.

90
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,530
The man who just disappeared.

91
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,030
Gosh, where did he go?

92
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,569
Seriously. Where is he?

93
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,030
Where am I?

96

Sir! Sir!

97
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:57,340
Wait!

98
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,040
She can't see you.

99
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,460
This isn't real.

100
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,859
I brought a piece from the past for education purposes.

101
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:08,119
It's to teach you something.

102
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:11,890
It's not real, but at the same time, it is.

103
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,919
What do you think? Doesn't it feel pretty real?

104
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,040
- My gosh. - What was that?

105
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,939
- My goodness. - Gosh.

106
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,250
I'm sorry, everyone. We have a flat tire.

107
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,359
- You need to get off. - I can't believe this.

108
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:46,100
- Hurry up and let us out. - My gosh, seriously.

109
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm sorry, everyone.

110
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,689
- You can take the next bus. - My gosh.

111
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,819
This isn't good.

112
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,670
Excuse me. Excuse me.

113
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,799
I'm candidate number 127. Am I too late?

114
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,199
Candidate number 127...

115
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,649
- Ms. Tak Dong Kyung? - Yes.

116
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,540
It was your turn ages ago.

117
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,410
Numbers 207, 208, and 209. Please go inside.

118
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:16,330
Excuse me. The thing is,

119
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,729
the bus I was on suddenly got a flat tire.

120
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:21,729
And it was really hard to get a cab.

121
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:23,369
I'm late for a reason.

122
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:26,130
We need to follow the rules. I'm sorry.

123
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,530
Wait.

124
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,369
Can you please give me a shot?

125
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:30,900
I'm sorry.

(Toshino, Recruiting New and Experienced Employees)

127
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,900
Poor girl. It was all because of you.

128
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,740
What do you think you were doing this day?

129
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:11,839
Yes, I know.

130
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,979
The bus would've gotten a flat tire one way or another...

131
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:15,579
as long as you existed.

132
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,349
Unfortunately, it just had to happen at that very moment.

133
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,499
The third exam of the 2012 CSAT will begin...

134
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:35,970
after lunchtime.

135
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,509
All test takers must be seated in their seats...

136
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:41,669
10 minutes before the exam begins.

137
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,518
Once again,

138
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,980
the third exam of the 2012 CSAT will begin after lunchtime.

139
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:54,629
All test takers must be seated in their seats...

140
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:56,750
10 minutes before the exam begins.

141
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,459
What did you do this day?

142
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,059
But then again, I guess it's not that important.

143
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:13,429
Everything happens due to your existence.

144
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,169
It doesn't matter what you do.

145
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:17,040
It wasn't just her lunch box.

146
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,478
Tons of other things happened because of you.

147
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:21,040
Every minute and second of the day.

148
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,219
But I'm sure you already know...

149
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,750
that everything happens for a reason.

150
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,859
It's not your fault.

151
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:31,949
It's essential that you exist in this world.

152
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,739
I always sat here like this...

153
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:48,008
whenever I wanted to cry...

154
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:49,640
ever since I was a child.

155
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,679
Hello?

156
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,789
Is there an adult at home?

157
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,759
Mom and Dad will be home soon.

158
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,899
Who's this?

159
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:08,589
This is Tak Jong Won and Kang Soo Ha's home, right?

160
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,369
This is a hospital. There's been an accident.

161
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:13,130
Is there an adult I can call?

162
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,410
You're responsible for everything that disappears.

163
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,980
But I'm sure you already know that.

164
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,650
Stop.

165
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:53,429
You seemed to be lost.

166
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,299
Are you done being angry?

167
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,900
- You... - Do you finally see...

168
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,799
what you've done to her?

169
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,809
You're going to let her love you so you can disappear?

170
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,380
So you're telling me...

171
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,419
you're going to be loved by her? You?

172
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,049
What a grand dream.

173
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:52,369
I... I'm...

174
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:55,360
I'm sure you were also busy doing something...

175
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:57,699
the day a lump started growing in her brain.

176
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,469
You may go now if you're done.

177
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,500
I have nothing more to say.

178
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,099
People who are nice always disappear.

179
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:37,069
It was always like that for me.

180
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,069
There was never an exception.

181
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,649
It's like they were nice to me because they knew...

182
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,339
they were going to disappear.

183
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,349
Why... Where...

184
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:57,520
How... What...

185
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:05,099
In the end, there's absolutely nothing...

186
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,199
I can do.

187
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,669
I finally get why you always looked so sad...

188
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:13,669
as you saw things disappear.

189
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,309
The look on your face...

190
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,910
was the look of helplessness.

191
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:55,880
Where were you?

192
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:00,380
Did you run away?

193
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:03,380
I was kicked out.

194
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,520
You were kicked out?

195
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,829
By whom? To where?

196
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,829
From your life to your life.

197
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,639
Can you explain it more simply?

198
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:18,500
No, I can't.

199
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,700
Plus, you won't be able to understand it anyway.

200
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,740
Hey.

201
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:28,419
Why are you angry? I'm the one who should be angry.

202
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:30,079
I'm not angry at you.

203
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,809
Then what's the matter?

204
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:37,049
Why are you angry at yourself?

205
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,889
Because I forgot everything.

206
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,290
That's what makes me so angry.

207
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,000
I can't understand anything you say.

208
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:51,730
You don't plan to tell me, do you?

209
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,609
Fine.

210
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,309
I got it, so let's go to your home.

211
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,379
- We are. - No.

212
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,719
Let's go through your front door,

213
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,629
not through my front door.

214
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:10,920
You must have a front door too.

215
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,389
When you disappeared,

216
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,599
I had nowhere to look.

217
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,599
Tell me where you live.

218
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,350
That way, even if you're kicked out again,

219
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,000
I'll have a place to go look.

220
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,659
So, it's a real place that actually exists?

221
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,500
This is my house.

222
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,500
Okay.

223
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,530
Your house is closer than I thought.

224
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,869
I'll be able to come next time.

225
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,339
No, you can't.

226
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:42,079
If I get kicked out again,

227
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,680
I won't be here.

228
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,119
What happened?

229
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,579
- You need to tell me... - I was wrong.

230
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:57,260
It was the incorrect conclusion.

231
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,460
What...

232
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,559
- do you mean? - You were right.

233
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:05,170
You must not love me.

234
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,569
You cannot.

235
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:13,170
That's why I can't grant you...

236
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:16,409
your wish.

237
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,790
It's cold. Let's go inside.

238
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,149
Let's talk inside.

239
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:26,649
It's impossible for me to love you.

240
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,329
Let's stop it.

241
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:43,970
Let's stop...

242
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,470
living together.

243
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,710
What are you doing, sir?

244
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,180
I wasn't doing anything.

245
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,549
- Sir. - Yes?

246
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:01,010
Do you have a crush?

247
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,349
No.

248
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,920
It isn't a crush.

249
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,290
- It's my first love. - What?

250
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,869
First love? How old are you?

251
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:15,299
When was your first love?

252
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,670
When I was about 18?

253
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:20,770
I was madly in love.

254
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,449
I have only half of a heart left...

255
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:25,040
because I burned the other half back then.

256
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,750
That's when it started for me too.

257
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,639
And it's still ongoing?

258
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:32,109
Yes. I met her again recently.

259
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:33,579
Awesome. How?

260
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,020
No. That's not important.

261
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,649
Why did you break up?

262
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:39,399
Why we broke up...

263
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:41,619
matters more than meeting her again?

264
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,589
Of course.

265
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,059
I need to know the reason to gauge it.

266
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:48,599
Gauge what?

267
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,030
Whether it's possible or impossible.

268
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:53,730
Why did you break up?

269
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:58,719
("The Perspective of the Forest")

270
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:01,550
Come on. Do it for me.

271
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,339
I'm too nervous to talk to her.

272
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,149
Come on.

273
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,590
Teacher!

274
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,819
You call me "Teacher" only at times like this.

275
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,330
Why should I say what you should say? No.

276
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,369
I don't know what I should say, that's why.

277
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:17,199
What do I say?

278
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:19,260
Just tell her the truth.

279
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,709
How can I do that?

280
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:24,960
I can never. It's way too humiliating.

281
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:26,700
Darn it.

282
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,670
This is all your fault!

283
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:31,740
How is it my fault?

284
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,050
This is because I got sick from the rice cake you gave me...

285
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,850
and bombed the CSAT.

286
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,919
That's why this happened.

287
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,189
It's not my fault you lost your temper...

288
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:40,619
and said you were studying abroad...

289
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:41,929
without telling your girlfriend...

290
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:43,389
just because your friends teased you.

291
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:45,760
Those jerks were talking about whether I can go to college,

292
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,399
and how I can't get into an athletics program...

293
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,260
with my medal from 10th grade. That's why I got angry and...

294
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:51,589
And...

295
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,530
Whatever. This is all your fault.

296
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:56,599
Come on.

297
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,170
Teacher!

298
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,809
You keep screening my calls.

299
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,879
Are you really going to Japan?

300
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:13,590
Where are you?

301
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,849
Are you ignoring me?

302
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:17,189
Sorry for not telling you before.

303
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:18,649
Let's talk in person.

304
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,159
Will you meet with her?

305
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,369
No. Let's just get past today for now.

306
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:24,089
I'll fix it for real later.

307
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:29,559
Sorry, but I can't right now.

308
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,599
I'll be there in 10 minutes. Come out.

309
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,970
Don't come. I can't go out.

310
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,339
I'll wait until you come.

311
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:37,940
I can't go.

312
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,339
Why are you suddenly using proper grammar?

313
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:43,839
- Do you not use proper grammar? - No. Why?

314
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,809
Did she catch on?

315
00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:52,929
Couldn't you misspell a few words?

316
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:54,649
Seriously.

317
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,020
My grammar lessons were wasted on you.

318
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,589
I'll contact you later.

319
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,760
Are you breaking up with me?

320
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,599
If you don't respond, I'll assume we're breaking up.

321
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,599
You decide from this moment on.

322
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,310
What?

323
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,320
Hey. Where are you going?

324
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,040
Hey! But...

325
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,719
(If you don't respond, I'll assume we're breaking up.)

326
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:21,149
What did you say in response?

327
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,990
I couldn't respond.

328
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,129
Are you kidding me? And you call yourself a man?

329
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:27,428
That's inhumane.

330
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:29,619
I was hurt just now.

331
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,790
My heart shrank to a third.

332
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:35,930
I had only half to begin with.

333
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:40,799
Why did you do it?

334
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,310
What do you mean?

335
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,940
You must've had a reason.

336
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,780
I like her...

337
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:53,549
too much.

338
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:58,119
That's why I was too ashamed of myself.

339
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,290
Why should you be ashamed? You both liked each other.

340
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:05,559
That's how adult relationships are. It's complicated.

341
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,930
Adult? Whatever. You were a teen back then.

342
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:11,040
I'm more of an adult now than you were back then.

343
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,179
Is that right?

344
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,179
Then can my adult employee...

345
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:17,069
gauge the situation or no?

346
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,010
This is tough.

347
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:21,020
A girl I know...

348
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,839
was also dumped via text.

349
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:25,409
It stayed with her for years.

350
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,090
Every time she got drunk,

351
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,379
she said she'd kill the rat and then that she missed him.

352
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,349
He should be dead by now.

353
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,230
If you can't figure it out, let's go home.

354
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:44,930
We have no choice.

355
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,770
Your heartbreaking situation right now...

356
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,240
has moved my heart.

357
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,940
I'll provide a special service...

358
00:27:55,689 --> 00:27:57,109
and give you love counseling.

359
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,049
Hello.

360
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:06,158
But... Who are you?

361
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,889
That's what I'd like to ask.

362
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,619
Hey. You're home.

363
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,230
He's the good-looking employee I told you about.

364
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:14,329
And as I told you before, he's...

365
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,829
Wait. I didn't tell you. He's my roommate.

366
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,649
Don't you work for that company?

367
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:24,339
I saw you a few times at the cafe.

368
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,250
What a great memory.

369
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,679
You remember customers' faces already?

370
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,879
Is it you?

371
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,609
Then you must work at the same company as my sister.

372
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,349
- Your sister? - Your sister?

373
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:36,950
Do you know Tak Dong Kyung? She's my big sister.

374
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:45,369
- What's your name? - Tak Sun Kyung.

375
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:46,881
So you're Tak Dong Kyung's brother?

376
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:48,779
Yes. I'm her brother.

377
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,769
Calm down. Easy, easy.

378
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,940
I can fix this. Right.

379
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,269
You can do it, Lee Hyun Kyu.

380
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:03,779
So...

381
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:07,410
it sounds like I know your secret.

382
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,920
Right, brother?

383
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,719
Right, brother.

384
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,719
What's important between brothers?

385
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,970
Loyalty.

386
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,959
Then, how can you show your loyalty to me?

387
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,660
Keeping this secret.

388
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,900
Hey, you hired a good one. He's smart.

389
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,199
Of course.

390
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,940
Just look at his face.

391
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,079
He looks so considerate and tight-lipped.

392
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,910
He's good. I'm serious.

393
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:36,880
As you can see, my looks say everything about me.

394
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,479
Right. They sure do.

395
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,559
You know what happened today?

396
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,829
He wanted to help me out with my dating life.

397
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:45,700
So he's staying behind.

398
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,099
- To help your dating life? - Yes.

399
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:51,019
Gosh. You know, I'm pretty smooth in that area.

400
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:58,199
When I was in Jeju, I was pretty famous for it.

401
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:01,469
Gosh. I can just picture it.

402
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:03,809
I bet all the girls were looking out the hallway windows...

403
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:05,519
when you were in the hallway...

404
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,548
and screamed their hearts out. Am I right?

405
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:08,809
It was just like that for me.

406
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,619
I went to an all-boys school.

407
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:14,049
I see. I didn't know that.

408
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:17,650
Anyway, let me continue from where I left off.

409
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,559
To be honest, men are about the same when it comes to love and dating.

410
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:25,059
But women are different. That's my point.

411
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,590
Here's an example.

412
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,499
Let's say there are 1,000 women.

413
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:31,630
Then, they are all different.

414
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,900
And you must target what makes them...

415
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,499
different.

416
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,340
So what is that exactly?

417
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:42,840
Well,

418
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:45,509
what could that be?

419
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,410
Just pray.

420
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:50,850
- What? - Pray that you'll look handsome.

421
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,350
How do you do that?

422
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,190
Right. There's no right answer for that.

423
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,330
So tell me. How do I do that exactly?

424
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:04,869
This is why there's no point coaching someone's love life.

425
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:07,969
You are so not in my league.

426
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,969
Right?

427
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:18,039
That's bitter.

428
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,580
Whether it's dating or life, nothing is easy.

429
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,820
What is it? Is there something that's troubling you?

430
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:27,449
Everyone has a sad story.

431
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,759
What is it?

432
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:32,369
Tell your boss... I mean...

433
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:35,059
Tell me about it. I'm your friend too. Okay?

434
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:38,229
Later.

435
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,370
I'll tell you when we get a bit closer.

436
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,769
You know, Hyun Kyu can be such a softie.

437
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:48,779
I'm so worried about you.

438
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,989
It's about your first crush too.

439
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,610
I just asked a few questions and you told me the whole story.

440
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,259
You and I met not long ago.

441
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:58,479
When people ask you serious stuff, you should be on your guard.

442
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,890
He's got a point for the first time.

443
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,269
Isn't he cute?

444
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:15,699
Yes. He's like a cute neighborhood dog.

445
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:18,269
I'm getting jealous.

446
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,180
I didn't know you could describe someone you met for the first time.

447
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,340
There you go again with your nonsense.

448
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,910
I'm serious.

449
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:29,430
The more I get to know him, the more I like him.

450
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,749
He's a hard worker too.

451
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,489
You're like that too.

452
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:35,569
The more I get to know you, the more I like you.

453
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:36,989
And you're good at your job too.

454
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,299
Why are you buttering me up out of the blue?

455
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:46,529
It didn't come out of the blue. It's the truth.

456
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:49,679
When he asked you to teach him swimming and called you his teacher,

457
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,799
he reminded me of you.

458
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:55,039
When you were 18?

459
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,690
- Joo Ik. - So you should go independent now.

460
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,690
You have your own pupil now.

461
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,410
Gosh, no.

462
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,279
I'll cling onto you until the day I die.

463
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,280

464
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,479
- Joo Ik. - Yes?

465
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,840
Do you like rice cakes?

466
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,370
Rice cakes?

467
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:26,940
She doesn't eat rice cakes.

468
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,150
When you get sick from eating some food,

469
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,009
you don't eat them again.

470
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:35,209
But I still like rice cakes.

471
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:38,180
But she hates rice cakes.

472
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,049
I was the one who got sick.

473
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:43,920
She asked me why I came.

474
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:48,289
She asked me why I came back to Korea and the union.

475
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:52,059
But I couldn't say anything.

476
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:54,930
So she told me to leave.

477
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:58,100
She said she wanted me to leave.

478
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:02,680
But you know,

479
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,650
I really didn't want to.

480
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,999
Do you think you can come over now?

481
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,930
I'm stuck on something.

482
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:32,420
(I can't.)

483
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,769
I can't.

484
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,440
Help? As if.

485
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,959
He always says the same thing.

486
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,959
I can't.

487
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,130
I can't go in if you sit there like that.

488
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,499
I'm sorry.

489
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:29,200
No, you don't have to...

490
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,800
Do you like him that much?

491
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,179
- Pardon? - Everyone knows...

492
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:37,539
that you're waiting for a boy from the eighth floor.

493
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,650
So everyone knows.

494
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,269
But Hyun Kyu doesn't know?

495
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,389
That I'm waiting here?

496
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:44,209
He went to Japan for his studies.

497
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:46,320
He's not even here. Why are you waiting for him here?

498
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,960
Then, where should I wait for him?

499
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,150
This is the only spot I can wait for him.

500
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:52,599
This is the only place I know. Where else could I wait for him?

501
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:55,249
So what if you see him? What will you do then?

502
00:35:55,969 --> 00:35:57,260
I don't know.

503
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:00,360
I'm just...

504
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,099
I'm just sad about everything.

505
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,530
What's making you sad?

506
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,300
We haven't had a chance to drink beer at the Han River yet.

507
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:13,409
And we haven't gone to Itaewon on Halloween.

508
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,740
And we haven't even shared a kiss yet.

509
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:23,979
Okay.

510
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:57,143
What?

511
00:36:57,212 --> 00:36:59,112
I'm going to stop writing my novel.

512
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:02,452
What? What are you talking about?

513
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,752
The end date and number of episodes are specified on the contract.

514
00:37:04,752 --> 00:37:06,252
Why all of a sudden...

515
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:08,893
Did you get another offer?

516
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,433
Are the terms better?

517
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:12,953
No, it's not that. I'm sick.

518
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:15,922
I have ovarian cancer.

519
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:17,993
It's at Stage Three.

520
00:37:20,442 --> 00:37:24,732
Well, uploading the episodes irregularly isn't ideal either.

521
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:27,283
Tell your agency that my novel is halted indefinitely...

522
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:29,382
because of a personal reason.

523
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:31,603
I'll post an announcement for my readers.

524
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:35,212
Well, I...

525
00:37:36,752 --> 00:37:39,462
Don't say anything if you're going to wish me luck.

526
00:37:39,462 --> 00:37:41,363
I don't have the energy to thank you for that...

527
00:37:41,363 --> 00:37:42,982
or force a smile.

528
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:48,652
I'm getting weaker every day.

529
00:37:48,763 --> 00:37:50,332
I already have a nasty personality,

530
00:37:50,332 --> 00:37:52,192
but it's only getting worse.

531
00:37:53,873 --> 00:37:55,192
I hope you understand.

532
00:37:59,113 --> 00:38:00,512
The team dinner is tonight, right?

533
00:38:00,513 --> 00:38:02,473
You'll probably hear about it then.

534
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:05,572
Jijo King has a big mouth.

535
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:08,572
He's college friends with my ex-husband.

536
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:10,323
I wanted to tell you myself...

537
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:12,013
rather than have you hear it from that jerk.

538
00:38:14,223 --> 00:38:17,132
I should've been more considerate.

539
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:19,202
I'm sorry.

540
00:38:19,203 --> 00:38:21,853
Why are you sorry? I'm the one who's sorry.

541
00:38:23,332 --> 00:38:25,362
You should take care of your health.

542
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,732
Or just live your life however you want to.

543
00:38:28,343 --> 00:38:30,232
Now that I'm sick, I'm starting to regret things.

544
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:33,272
You regret things?

545
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:35,303
Yes, I do.

546
00:38:35,652 --> 00:38:38,603
I should've been more honest about the stuff I like and hate.

547
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:40,623
I should've cared more about what I wanted...

548
00:38:40,623 --> 00:38:42,112
rather than what others wanted.

549
00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:44,882
I should've complimented myself...

550
00:38:45,152 --> 00:38:47,612
rather than wasting time complimenting others.

551
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:55,053
That's all I have to say.

552
00:38:55,672 --> 00:38:56,893
I'll be off now.

553
00:39:04,312 --> 00:39:06,402
I like your outfit today.

554
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:09,203
- You look pretty. - What?

555
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:11,743
You were always pretty.

556
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,743
I figured I might regret it if I didn't tell you.

557
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,342
Don't see me out.

558
00:39:24,232 --> 00:39:26,592
Cheers to Life Story!

559
00:39:27,703 --> 00:39:29,022
Cheers.

560
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:38,042
You look so much younger than the last time we met.

561
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,333
Thank you for coming today amid your busy schedule.

562
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:42,542
Wait.

563
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:46,323
Here. It's just a small gesture.

564
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:47,922
My gosh, you're unbelievable.

565
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:50,313
You're embarrassing me.

566
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:55,933
Gosh, this is so nice. I don't think I'd ever be able to drink it.

567
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:57,863
You deserve to drink something nice like this.

568
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:00,092
You're the reason I make a living.

569
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:06,663
I'm telling you. 10 writers answered my calls,

570
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:08,862
and six of them said "okay".

571
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:11,663
That doesn't exactly mean they're going to come.

572
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:14,732
Forget it. Writers usually don't attend dinners like this.

573
00:40:15,183 --> 00:40:17,482
That jerk is the only one who comes every single time.

574
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:19,053
My dream is to become a writer.

575
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:20,352
Then I won't have to attend the team dinners.

576
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:22,542
My dream is to become the CEO, so I can get rid of team dinners.

577
00:40:24,192 --> 00:40:26,462
Hey, what's your dream?

578
00:40:26,462 --> 00:40:27,712
My dream?

579
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:29,882
To live however I want to.

580
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:32,832
By the way,

581
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:35,522
did you all hear about Dalgona?

582
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:39,042
I don't think it's something appropriate to talk about.

583
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:41,743
Gosh, come on. The editors need to know.

584
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:42,772
What if they make a mistake?

585
00:40:42,772 --> 00:40:45,203
That's all I'm worried about.

586
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:50,272
I heard she has ovarian cancer.

587
00:40:50,613 --> 00:40:52,522
That's why she hasn't been writing lately.

588
00:40:52,522 --> 00:40:54,252
- Are you serious? - Her husband ran away...

589
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,922
because he didn't want to take care of her.

590
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:59,853
I know this because her husband and I are friends from school.

591
00:41:00,163 --> 00:41:02,933
This shows that you need to be nice.

592
00:41:02,933 --> 00:41:05,332
That writer has a nasty personality.

593
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:08,553
I would've run away too if I were her husband.

594
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:15,243
My gosh, what's with the atmosphere?

595
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:18,203
I'm just making jokes.

596
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:23,743
Ms. Tak. Ms. Tak.

597
00:41:24,553 --> 00:41:26,683
Ms. Tak, you should also try to be nice.

598
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:28,772
- If you don't... - Then what?

599
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:32,252
- What? - What if I'm not nice?

600
00:41:32,252 --> 00:41:33,493
What's with her?

601
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,123
Hey, Dong Kyung. Are you drunk?

602
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:37,691
What do you care whether I'm drunk or not?

603
00:41:37,692 --> 00:41:38,692
What?

604
00:41:38,692 --> 00:41:40,602
I told you it's inappropriate.

605
00:41:40,602 --> 00:41:41,763
- What did you say? - He said it with respect.

606
00:41:41,763 --> 00:41:43,632
I heard how he said it.

607
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:45,263
He said it politely.

608
00:41:45,552 --> 00:41:46,742
What's wrong with you?

609
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:51,893
Gosh, kids these days are unbelievable.

610
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:54,753
Why is everyone reacting so sensitively to a joke?

611
00:41:55,762 --> 00:41:57,722
You won't be able to get married with that kind of personality.

612
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:01,563
Sir, that's a little out of line.

613
00:42:03,402 --> 00:42:04,773
Oh, you guys are the same age.

614
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,213
Are you taking her side because you're in the same situation?

615
00:42:06,213 --> 00:42:07,463
Hey.

616
00:42:10,342 --> 00:42:11,342
"Hey"?

617
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:14,682
Who are you to judge my life?

618
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:17,282
Who gave you the right to be so nosy?

619
00:42:17,282 --> 00:42:19,322
- You little... - Dong Kyung!

620
00:42:19,322 --> 00:42:21,342
If you want to revise something, just revise your own writing.

621
00:42:22,023 --> 00:42:24,662
But then again, I bet you don't even do that.

622
00:42:24,663 --> 00:42:25,853
Hey.

623
00:42:26,032 --> 00:42:28,552
Hey! Are you crazy?

624
00:42:30,032 --> 00:42:31,253
A little.

625
00:42:31,932 --> 00:42:35,262
I might not get married, but I'm surely headed somewhere.

626
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:41,662
I have cancer, so I'll be dead in three months.

627
00:42:42,882 --> 00:42:46,443
I'm headed to the afterlife way before I can get married.

628
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:51,572
I guess it's because I wasn't very nice like you said I should be.

629
00:42:53,193 --> 00:42:55,613
Have fun, you guys. I'm going to go now.

630
00:43:00,432 --> 00:43:02,253
What's her problem?

631
00:43:47,313 --> 00:43:48,563
Recharge.

632
00:43:49,313 --> 00:43:50,932
Why couldn't you cross the street?

633
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:53,773
- I was too scared. - Then you should've called me.

634
00:43:54,313 --> 00:43:56,972
- How? - However.

635
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:05,912
I'm really scared.

636
00:44:06,262 --> 00:44:08,552
I'm really scared to cross the street.

637
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:10,523
Darn it.

638
00:44:11,063 --> 00:44:12,333
You told me to call you whenever I got scared.

639
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:14,863
You told me to call you however.

640
00:44:24,842 --> 00:44:26,032
Fine.

641
00:44:26,152 --> 00:44:28,372
So this isn't enough to make you show up?

642
00:44:29,983 --> 00:44:33,842
Hey, look where I'm standing.

643
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:36,113
Look where I'm standing right now.

644
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,153
I'm going to jump.

645
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,132
You saw me last time.

646
00:44:40,132 --> 00:44:43,592
I don't bluff. I'm really going to jump.

647
00:44:47,972 --> 00:44:49,392
My gosh.

648
00:44:50,443 --> 00:44:53,072
I swear I'm...

649
00:44:53,072 --> 00:44:55,762
I'm really going to jump.

650
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:58,173
I'm seriously going to...

651
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:15,423
What a mean jerk.

652
00:45:15,893 --> 00:45:17,753
It's almost midnight.

653
00:45:19,302 --> 00:45:20,563
My gosh.

654
00:46:01,413 --> 00:46:02,702
Horrible jerk.

655
00:46:10,483 --> 00:46:12,613
I swear I'll kill him.

656
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,692
I'm the one who ended up getting hit by the stone...

657
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,063
that I threw.

658
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:25,065
Why you...

659
00:49:07,075 --> 00:49:08,373
Did you hear?

660
00:49:08,374 --> 00:49:11,064
Life Story was flipped upside down yesterday.

661
00:49:11,244 --> 00:49:14,305
I hear one of their editors is sick.

662
00:49:14,545 --> 00:49:15,805
Don't cry.

663
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:18,175
Don't you cry.

664
00:49:18,814 --> 00:49:20,874
I said not to cry.

665
00:49:26,655 --> 00:49:29,184
(Dong Kyung)

666
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,555
Please pick up.

667
00:49:52,684 --> 00:49:54,004
Dong Kyung!

668
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:59,215
Dong Kyung! Dong Kyung!

669
00:50:01,025 --> 00:50:02,414
Dong Kyung!

670
00:50:07,135 --> 00:50:08,325
Dong Kyung.

671
00:50:09,064 --> 00:50:10,365
Dong Kyung!

672
00:50:10,365 --> 00:50:12,724
- How may we help you? - She's Lee Hyun.

673
00:50:13,474 --> 00:50:15,905
Let's talk outside. Ms. Tak didn't come in today.

674
00:50:15,905 --> 00:50:18,735
Did you know that she was sick?

675
00:50:19,045 --> 00:50:21,765
I didn't. I found out yesterday.

676
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:29,604
You idiot.

677
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:31,615
You stupid idiot.

678
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:35,285
How did I not know?

679
00:50:36,724 --> 00:50:38,314
How?

680
00:50:39,195 --> 00:50:42,925
You idiot. Why didn't I know?

681
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:50,095
Let's go outside.

682
00:50:52,345 --> 00:50:54,765
I'll tell you everything that I know.

683
00:50:58,215 --> 00:51:00,274
I had no idea.

684
00:51:00,885 --> 00:51:02,405
Last time,

685
00:51:02,584 --> 00:51:06,215
she asked what I'd want to do if I were dying in 100 days.

686
00:51:07,894 --> 00:51:09,715
I was clueless,

687
00:51:09,724 --> 00:51:12,254
and asked jokingly, "Are you dying?"

688
00:51:12,795 --> 00:51:14,055
Seriously.

689
00:51:15,264 --> 00:51:16,794
I'm a bad friend.

690
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:19,204
When you put it that way, I'm a bad supervisor.

691
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,825
Seriously.

692
00:51:24,244 --> 00:51:26,604
Stop thinking about things you couldn't do.

693
00:51:26,615 --> 00:51:28,865
Think about things you can do for her from now on.

694
00:51:40,755 --> 00:51:42,425
- I'll go now. - Now?

695
00:51:42,425 --> 00:51:44,515
I don't have enough time to do everything I want to for her.

696
00:51:50,604 --> 00:51:51,794
What are you looking for?

697
00:51:52,204 --> 00:51:54,404
- My car key. - Did you drive here?

698
00:51:54,405 --> 00:51:56,374
Yes. I'm sorry.

699
00:51:56,374 --> 00:51:58,135
I'm just out of it.

700
00:51:58,474 --> 00:51:59,813
Where is it?

701
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:01,244
Let's go. I'll take you.

702
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,215
No, it's okay.

703
00:52:03,215 --> 00:52:04,675
I'm really okay.

704
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:12,044
Look at me.

705
00:52:14,354 --> 00:52:17,285
Let me take you. I'm worried, that's why.

706
00:52:18,264 --> 00:52:20,584
How can you see with your eyes so swollen?

707
00:52:30,675 --> 00:52:32,635
(Life Story)

708
00:52:35,675 --> 00:52:36,874
Where's your car?

709
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:40,805
Back there...

710
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:02,325
Dong Kyung...

711
00:53:02,735 --> 00:53:04,135
Dong Kyung...

712
00:53:11,385 --> 00:53:12,675
Dong Kyung...

713
00:54:15,914 --> 00:54:18,434
The high intracranial pressure was the cause.

714
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:20,544
We need to run a thorough examination,

715
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,905
so please page me once she wakes up.

716
00:54:25,555 --> 00:54:26,814
Okay.

717
00:54:27,994 --> 00:54:29,245
Thank you.

718
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:54,004
(Our Auntie)

719
00:55:27,314 --> 00:55:29,604
You've been here all day.

720
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:35,584
What are you thinking about?

721
00:55:36,764 --> 00:55:38,184
Nothing.

722
00:55:41,994 --> 00:55:44,825
Good. Don't go.

723
00:55:46,334 --> 00:55:48,564
You decided not to see her.

724
00:55:49,075 --> 00:55:50,434
Good call.

725
00:55:51,175 --> 00:55:53,564
Don't see her ever again.

726
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:57,604
Whether she dies or lives,

727
00:55:58,684 --> 00:56:00,035
don't see her again.

728
00:56:01,755 --> 00:56:03,245
That's how you should live.

729
00:56:04,555 --> 00:56:06,615
Do you think you can live...

730
00:56:08,454 --> 00:56:09,745
like that?

731
00:56:26,045 --> 00:56:29,465
A child must rebel against his or her parent to grow.

732
00:56:31,084 --> 00:56:35,745
And love must suffer hardship to burn hotter.

733
00:58:29,664 --> 00:58:31,254
I knew you would come.

734
00:58:32,805 --> 00:58:34,595
It was inevitable.

735
00:58:44,184 --> 00:58:45,805
Did you think I wouldn't be able to...

736
00:58:46,445 --> 00:58:48,374
find you if you hide?

737
00:58:50,354 --> 00:58:53,985
I told you I could see right through you.

738
00:58:54,925 --> 00:58:56,445
That you're a good guy.

739
00:58:57,295 --> 00:58:58,615
I know that.

740
00:59:00,834 --> 00:59:04,095
You can't run away before you grant me my wish.

741
00:59:05,764 --> 00:59:08,164
I said you could go after you grant me my wish.

742
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:10,275
- Don't you remember? - Tak Dong Kyung.

743
00:59:10,275 --> 00:59:12,235
I'm going to kill...

744
00:59:24,385 --> 00:59:27,544
I have been struggling to turn my life around for better luck...

745
00:59:28,124 --> 00:59:30,715
and waiting for my answer...

746
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:33,015
all these years.

747
00:59:35,334 --> 00:59:38,224
(Toshino, Recruiting New and Experienced Employees)

748
00:59:39,635 --> 00:59:40,825
Tak Dong Kyung.

749
00:59:44,945 --> 00:59:47,215
(Testing Location 6 for District 94)

750
00:59:47,215 --> 00:59:48,635
Well done!

751
00:59:50,814 --> 00:59:52,035
Good job.

752
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:54,115
- Good work. - Great job!

753
00:59:54,115 --> 00:59:56,144
- Good work. - Good work.

754
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,184
- You guys are amazing! - Good work!

755
00:59:58,184 --> 00:59:59,414
Tak Dong Kyung!

756
00:59:59,985 --> 01:00:02,215
- Good job. - Great job.

757
01:00:02,624 --> 01:00:04,184
Well done!

758
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:11,925
Tak Dong Kyung!

759
01:00:23,115 --> 01:00:24,305
Tak Dong Kyung.

760
01:00:25,144 --> 01:00:26,434
In the end,

761
01:00:27,115 --> 01:00:28,845
they will call for me.

762
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,814
That's my answer.

763
01:00:53,505 --> 01:00:56,405
At times, misery and luck come with the same face.

764
01:01:01,385 --> 01:01:04,374
And I still cannot distinguish...

765
01:01:05,325 --> 01:01:06,914
the two.

766
01:01:32,345 --> 01:01:36,445
(Doom at Your Service)

767
01:01:36,814 --> 01:01:38,414
You don't have to use that wish.

768
01:01:38,784 --> 01:01:41,644
I don't care about anyone but you now.

769
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:43,115
It's so beautiful...

770
01:01:43,724 --> 01:01:45,385
that it might disappear.

771
01:01:46,894 --> 01:01:48,354
I needed to talk to you.

772
01:01:48,965 --> 01:01:50,624
I can't keep this any longer.

773
01:01:51,805 --> 01:01:53,394
I want everyone...

774
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:56,195
to forget about me.

775
01:01:56,534 --> 01:01:57,945
Where's Tak Dong Kyung?

776
01:01:57,945 --> 01:01:59,495
You don't have much time left.

777
01:01:59,604 --> 01:02:01,135
You must choose.

778
01:02:01,244 --> 01:02:02,535
I want to live.

779
01:02:03,644 --> 01:02:04,974
I'll let you live.

780
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:06,874
I'm going to let her live.
