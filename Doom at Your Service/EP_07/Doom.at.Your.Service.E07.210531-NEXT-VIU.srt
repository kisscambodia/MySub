(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,149
I have a wish.

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,260
I want you...

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,260
to love me.

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,999
Can I...

7
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,269
wish for that too?

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,900
No.

9
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,650
What is it?

10
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:05,120
(Episode 7)

11
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,080
Ms. Tak.

12
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:07,479
Ms. Tak?

13
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,360
- Ms. Tak. - What? Yes?

14
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,590
- Mr. Park is asking for you. - Okay.

15
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,700
What? Mr. Park who? Who is it?

16
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,659
Mr. Park, our CEO.

17
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:21,529
Right. You weren't in the office earlier.

18
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,200
He came to work when you were out.

19
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:25,839
Is it because he's been away?

20
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,670
He looks like a different guy.

21
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,909
What's gotten into her?

22
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,580
Maybe, I should have set her up with some guy.

23
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,580
Hey.

24
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:42,849
"Hey"?

25
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,990
Hooray!

26
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,700
Mr. Park is back at last!

27
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,469
I feel so reassured.

28
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:51,539
Right?

29
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,729
The company isn't doing well without me, right?

30
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:57,059
That's the burden my position comes with.

31
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,710
So you wanted to see me.

32
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,110
Book a restaurant for a get-together.

33
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,879
A get-together? All of a sudden? For what?

34
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm back. It's a welcome-back party.

35
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,520
The writers must've been so nervous when I was away.

36
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,879
Just like you,

37
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,779
to make them feel reassured, I should show them I'm back.

38
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,719
Okay.

39
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,150
Call and invite everyone that can attend the get-together.

(Jijo King)

41
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:22,359
Hey.

42
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,729
Yes. I was about to set up a meet. Yes.

43
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:27,429
Right.

44
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:31,729
That's right. I only ended up draining my energy.

45
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,469
I don't get why women want to...

46
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,088
I'm on a break for now.

47
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,479
I have to go back to the dorm later tonight.

48
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,549
I decided to spend my valuable time coming here.

49
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:53,919
Right.

50
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,929
I wonder why you decided to spend your valuable time here.

51
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,630
You said you wouldn't write anymore.

52
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,500
Ms. Tak, are you upset?

53
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:07,669
How can I get upset at work?

54
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,380
If things don't work out, that's it.

55
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,210
And once it's over, we're no better than strangers.

56
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,219
I wonder why this stranger came to my office.

57
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:15,840
That's what I want to know.

58
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,950
I'll keep writing.

59
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:24,349
- What? - I'll keep writing.

60
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,330
I don't have a lot left to write about anyway.

61
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,260
I'll cut it short and finish it.

62
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,489
But you cannot tell anyone.

63
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,239
Right now, people think I'm an innocent boy...

64
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,830
who doesn't even know how to use the Internet.

65
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,630
Well, why did you change your mind?

66
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,330
I keep having weird dreams.

67
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,580
Dreams?

68
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,900
Some weird guy keeps popping up in my dream.

69
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,450
He keeps threatening me that I can't debut if I don't finish.

70
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,779
He pushed me off the cliff.

71
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,650
He locked me up in an elevator and made it fall.

72
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,340
He made the plane I was on crash.

73
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,359
My mom tells me it's a dream...

74
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,880
that will make me taller, so I shouldn't worry.

75
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,479
But these dreams are on another level.

76
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,529
I always wake up in fear.

77
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,320
I can't sleep because I'm scared that I'll dream again.

78
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,890
Since I can't sleep, I can't remember all of my lines.

79
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,429
I'm really worried that I'll ruin my chance.

80
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,630
Let me keep writing.

81
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:15,169
Do you think this is funny? I'm serious.

82
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,739
It's not funny. I'm serious too.

83
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,390
It's about that man who showed up in your dreams.

84
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,380
Did he say who he was?

85
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,779
He said...

86
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:31,419
he was a jerk.

87
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,489
Jerk.

88
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,190
What? Was that for me?

89
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,200
No. That man in your dream is.

90
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,330
The man who just disappeared.

91
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,830
Gosh, where did he go?

92
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:53,369
Seriously. Where is he?

93
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,830
Where am I?

Sir! Sir!

97
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,140
Wait!

98
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,840
She can't see you.

99
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,260
This isn't real.

100
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,659
I brought a piece from the past for education purposes.

101
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:08,919
It's to teach you something.

102
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,690
It's not real, but at the same time, it is.

103
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,719
What do you think? Doesn't it feel pretty real?

104
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,840
- My gosh. - What was that?

105
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,739
- My goodness. - Gosh.

106
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,050
I'm sorry, everyone. We have a flat tire.

107
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,159
- You need to get off. - I can't believe this.

108
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,900
- Hurry up and let us out. - My gosh, seriously.

109
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm sorry, everyone.

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,489
- You can take the next bus. - My gosh.

111
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,619
This isn't good.

112
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,470
Excuse me. Excuse me.

113
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,599
I'm candidate number 127. Am I too late?

114
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,999
Candidate number 127...

115
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,449
- Ms. Tak Dong Kyung? - Yes.

116
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:08,340
It was your turn ages ago.

117
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,210
Numbers 207, 208, and 209. Please go inside.

118
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,130
Excuse me. The thing is,

119
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,529
the bus I was on suddenly got a flat tire.

120
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:22,529
And it was really hard to get a cab.

121
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,169
I'm late for a reason.

122
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:26,930
We need to follow the rules. I'm sorry.

123
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,330
Wait.

124
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,169
Can you please give me a shot?

125
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,700
I'm sorry.

(Toshino, Recruiting New and Experienced Employees)

127
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,700
Poor girl. It was all because of you.

128
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,540
What do you think you were doing this day?

129
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:12,639
Yes, I know.

130
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,779
The bus would've gotten a flat tire one way or another...

131
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,379
as long as you existed.

132
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,149
Unfortunately, it just had to happen at that very moment.

133
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,299
The third exam of the 2012 CSAT will begin...

134
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,770
after lunchtime.

135
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,309
All test takers must be seated in their seats...

136
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,469
10 minutes before the exam begins.

137
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,318
Once again,

138
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:51,780
the third exam of the 2012 CSAT will begin after lunchtime.

139
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,429
All test takers must be seated in their seats...

140
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:57,550
10 minutes before the exam begins.

141
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,259
What did you do this day?

142
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,859
But then again, I guess it's not that important.

143
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:14,229
Everything happens due to your existence.

144
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,969
It doesn't matter what you do.

145
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,840
It wasn't just her lunch box.

146
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,278
Tons of other things happened because of you.

147
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,840
Every minute and second of the day.

148
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,019
But I'm sure you already know...

149
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,550
that everything happens for a reason.

150
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,659
It's not your fault.

151
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:32,749
It's essential that you exist in this world.

152
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,539
I always sat here like this...

153
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,808
whenever I wanted to cry...

154
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,440
ever since I was a child.

155
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,479
Hello?

156
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,589
Is there an adult at home?

157
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,559
Mom and Dad will be home soon.

158
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,699
Who's this?

159
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:09,389
This is Tak Jong Won and Kang Soo Ha's home, right?

160
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,169
This is a hospital. There's been an accident.

161
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:13,930
Is there an adult I can call?

162
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,210
You're responsible for everything that disappears.

163
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:28,780
But I'm sure you already know that.

164
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,450
Stop.

165
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:54,229
You seemed to be lost.

166
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,099
Are you done being angry?

167
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:26,700
- You... - Do you finally see...

168
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,599
what you've done to her?

169
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,609
You're going to let her love you so you can disappear?

170
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:38,180
So you're telling me...

171
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,219
you're going to be loved by her? You?

172
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,849
What a grand dream.

173
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,169
I... I'm...

174
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:56,160
I'm sure you were also busy doing something...

175
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:58,499
the day a lump started growing in her brain.

176
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:02,269
You may go now if you're done.

177
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,300
I have nothing more to say.

178
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,899
People who are nice always disappear.

179
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:37,869
It was always like that for me.

180
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,869
There was never an exception.

181
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,449
It's like they were nice to me because they knew...

182
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,139
they were going to disappear.

183
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:55,149
Why... Where...

184
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,320
How... What...

185
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:05,899
In the end, there's absolutely nothing...

186
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,999
I can do.

187
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,469
I finally get why you always looked so sad...

188
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,469
as you saw things disappear.

189
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,109
The look on your face...

190
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,710
was the look of helplessness.

191
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:56,680
Where were you?

192
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:01,180
Did you run away?

193
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,180
I was kicked out.

194
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,320
You were kicked out?

195
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,629
By whom? To where?

196
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,629
From your life to your life.

197
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:17,439
Can you explain it more simply?

198
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,300
No, I can't.

199
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,500
Plus, you won't be able to understand it anyway.

200
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,540
Hey.

201
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:29,219
Why are you angry? I'm the one who should be angry.

202
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:30,879
I'm not angry at you.

203
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,609
Then what's the matter?

204
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,849
Why are you angry at yourself?

205
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,689
Because I forgot everything.

206
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,090
That's what makes me so angry.

207
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,800
I can't understand anything you say.

208
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,530
You don't plan to tell me, do you?

209
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,409
Fine.

210
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,109
I got it, so let's go to your home.

211
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,179
- We are. - No.

212
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,519
Let's go through your front door,

213
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,429
not through my front door.

214
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,720
You must have a front door too.

215
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,189
When you disappeared,

216
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,399
I had nowhere to look.

217
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,399
Tell me where you live.

218
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,150
That way, even if you're kicked out again,

219
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,800
I'll have a place to go look.

220
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,459
So, it's a real place that actually exists?

221
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,300
This is my house.

222
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,300
Okay.

223
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,330
Your house is closer than I thought.

224
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,669
I'll be able to come next time.

225
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,139
No, you can't.

226
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:42,879
If I get kicked out again,

227
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,480
I won't be here.

228
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,919
What happened?

229
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,379
- You need to tell me... - I was wrong.

230
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:58,060
It was the incorrect conclusion.

231
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,260
What...

232
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,359
- do you mean? - You were right.

233
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:05,970
You must not love me.

234
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,369
You cannot.

235
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:13,970
That's why I can't grant you...

236
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:17,209
your wish.

237
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,590
It's cold. Let's go inside.

238
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,949
Let's talk inside.

239
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:27,449
It's impossible for me to love you.

240
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,129
Let's stop it.

241
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,770
Let's stop...

242
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,270
living together.

243
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,510
What are you doing, sir?

244
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,980
I wasn't doing anything.

245
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,349
- Sir. - Yes?

246
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:01,810
Do you have a crush?

247
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,149
No.

248
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,720
It isn't a crush.

249
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,090
- It's my first love. - What?

250
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,669
First love? How old are you?

251
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:16,099
When was your first love?

252
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,470
When I was about 18?

253
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,570
I was madly in love.

254
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,249
I have only half of a heart left...

255
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:25,840
because I burned the other half back then.

256
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,550
That's when it started for me too.

257
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,439
And it's still ongoing?

258
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,909
Yes. I met her again recently.

259
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:34,379
Awesome. How?

260
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
No. That's not important.

261
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,449
Why did you break up?

262
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,199
Why we broke up...

263
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:42,419
matters more than meeting her again?

264
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,389
Of course.

265
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,859
I need to know the reason to gauge it.

266
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,399
Gauge what?

267
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,830
Whether it's possible or impossible.

268
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:54,530
Why did you break up?

269
00:22:58,509 --> 00:22:59,519
("The Perspective of the Forest")

270
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,350
Come on. Do it for me.

271
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,139
I'm too nervous to talk to her.

272
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,949
Come on.

273
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:09,390
Teacher!

274
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,619
You call me "Teacher" only at times like this.

275
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:14,130
Why should I say what you should say? No.

276
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,169
I don't know what I should say, that's why.

277
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:17,999
What do I say?

278
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:20,060
Just tell her the truth.

279
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,509
How can I do that?

280
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,760
I can never. It's way too humiliating.

281
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:27,500
Darn it.

282
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,470
This is all your fault!

283
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,540
How is it my fault?

284
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,850
This is because I got sick from the rice cake you gave me...

285
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,650
and bombed the CSAT.

286
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,719
That's why this happened.

287
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:39,989
It's not my fault you lost your temper...

288
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:41,419
and said you were studying abroad...

289
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,729
without telling your girlfriend...

290
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:44,189
just because your friends teased you.

291
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,560
Those jerks were talking about whether I can go to college,

292
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,199
and how I can't get into an athletics program...

293
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:51,060
with my medal from 10th grade. That's why I got angry and...

294
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:52,389
And...

295
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,330
Whatever. This is all your fault.

296
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:57,399
Come on.

297
00:23:58,409 --> 00:23:59,970
Teacher!

298
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,609
You keep screening my calls.

299
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,679
Are you really going to Japan?

300
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,390
Where are you?

301
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,649
Are you ignoring me?

302
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:17,989
Sorry for not telling you before.

303
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,449
Let's talk in person.

304
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,959
Will you meet with her?

305
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,169
No. Let's just get past today for now.

306
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:24,889
I'll fix it for real later.

307
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,359
Sorry, but I can't right now.

308
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,399
I'll be there in 10 minutes. Come out.

309
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,770
Don't come. I can't go out.

310
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:37,139
I'll wait until you come.

311
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:38,740
I can't go.

312
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,139
Why are you suddenly using proper grammar?

313
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:44,639
- Do you not use proper grammar? - No. Why?

314
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,609
Did she catch on?

315
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:53,729
Couldn't you misspell a few words?

316
00:24:53,729 --> 00:24:55,449
Seriously.

317
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,820
My grammar lessons were wasted on you.

318
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,389
I'll contact you later.

319
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,560
Are you breaking up with me?

320
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,399
If you don't respond, I'll assume we're breaking up.

321
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,399
You decide from this moment on.

322
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,110
What?

323
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,120
Hey. Where are you going?

324
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,840
Hey! But...

325
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,519
(If you don't respond, I'll assume we're breaking up.)

326
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,949
What did you say in response?

327
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,790
I couldn't respond.

328
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,929
Are you kidding me? And you call yourself a man?

329
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:28,228
That's inhumane.

330
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:30,419
I was hurt just now.

331
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,590
My heart shrank to a third.

332
00:25:34,939 --> 00:25:36,730
I had only half to begin with.

333
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,599
Why did you do it?

334
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,110
What do you mean?

335
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,740
You must've had a reason.

336
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,580
I like her...

337
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:54,349
too much.

338
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:58,919
That's why I was too ashamed of myself.

339
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,090
Why should you be ashamed? You both liked each other.

340
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:06,359
That's how adult relationships are. It's complicated.

341
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,730
Adult? Whatever. You were a teen back then.

342
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:11,840
I'm more of an adult now than you were back then.

343
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,979
Is that right?

344
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:14,979
Then can my adult employee...

345
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:17,869
gauge the situation or no?

346
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,810
This is tough.

347
00:26:20,449 --> 00:26:21,820
A girl I know...

348
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,639
was also dumped via text.

349
00:26:24,189 --> 00:26:26,209
It stayed with her for years.

350
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,890
Every time she got drunk,

351
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,179
she said she'd kill the rat and then that she missed him.

352
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,149
He should be dead by now.

353
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,030
If you can't figure it out, let's go home.

354
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:45,730
We have no choice.

355
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,570
Your heartbreaking situation right now...

356
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,040
has moved my heart.

357
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,740
I'll provide a special service...

358
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,909
and give you love counseling.

359
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,849
Hello.

360
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:06,958
But... Who are you?

361
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,689
That's what I'd like to ask.

362
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,419
Hey. You're home.

363
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,030
He's the good-looking employee I told you about.

364
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:15,129
And as I told you before, he's...

365
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,629
Wait. I didn't tell you. He's my roommate.

366
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,449
Don't you work for that company?

367
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:25,139
I saw you a few times at the cafe.

368
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,050
What a great memory.

369
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,479
You remember customers' faces already?

370
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,679
Is it you?

371
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,409
Then you must work at the same company as my sister.

372
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,149
- Your sister? - Your sister?

373
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:37,750
Do you know Tak Dong Kyung? She's my big sister.

374
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:46,169
- What's your name? - Tak Sun Kyung.

375
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,681
So you're Tak Dong Kyung's brother?

376
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,579
Yes. I'm her brother.

377
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,569
Calm down. Easy, easy.

378
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:57,740
I can fix this. Right.

379
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,069
You can do it, Lee Hyun Kyu.

380
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,579
So...

381
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:08,210
it sounds like I know your secret.

382
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,720
Right, brother?

383
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,519
Right, brother.

384
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,519
What's important between brothers?

385
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,770
Loyalty.

386
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,759
Then, how can you show your loyalty to me?

387
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:23,460
Keeping this secret.

388
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,700
Hey, you hired a good one. He's smart.

389
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,999
Of course.

390
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,740
Just look at his face.

391
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,879
He looks so considerate and tight-lipped.

392
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,710
He's good. I'm serious.

393
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,680
As you can see, my looks say everything about me.

394
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,279
Right. They sure do.

395
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,359
You know what happened today?

396
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,629
He wanted to help me out with my dating life.

397
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:46,500
So he's staying behind.

398
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,899
- To help your dating life? - Yes.

399
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:51,819
Gosh. You know, I'm pretty smooth in that area.

400
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:58,999
When I was in Jeju, I was pretty famous for it.

401
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:02,269
Gosh. I can just picture it.

402
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:04,609
I bet all the girls were looking out the hallway windows...

403
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,319
when you were in the hallway...

404
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,348
and screamed their hearts out. Am I right?

405
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:09,609
It was just like that for me.

406
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,419
I went to an all-boys school.

407
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,849
I see. I didn't know that.

408
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:18,450
Anyway, let me continue from where I left off.

409
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,359
To be honest, men are about the same when it comes to love and dating.

410
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,859
But women are different. That's my point.

411
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,390
Here's an example.

412
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,299
Let's say there are 1,000 women.

413
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:32,430
Then, they are all different.

414
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,700
And you must target what makes them...

415
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,299
different.

416
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,140
So what is that exactly?

417
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:43,640
Well,

418
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,309
what could that be?

419
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,210
Just pray.

420
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:51,650
- What? - Pray that you'll look handsome.

421
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,150
How do you do that?

422
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,990
Right. There's no right answer for that.

423
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,130
So tell me. How do I do that exactly?

424
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:05,669
This is why there's no point coaching someone's love life.

425
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:08,769
You are so not in my league.

426
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,769
Right?

427
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:18,839
That's bitter.

428
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,380
Whether it's dating or life, nothing is easy.

429
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,620
What is it? Is there something that's troubling you?

430
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:28,249
Everyone has a sad story.

431
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,559
What is it?

432
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,169
Tell your boss... I mean...

433
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:35,859
Tell me about it. I'm your friend too. Okay?

434
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:39,029
Later.

435
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,170
I'll tell you when we get a bit closer.

436
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,569
You know, Hyun Kyu can be such a softie.

437
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,579
I'm so worried about you.

438
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,789
It's about your first crush too.

439
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,410
I just asked a few questions and you told me the whole story.

440
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,059
You and I met not long ago.

441
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:59,279
When people ask you serious stuff, you should be on your guard.

442
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,690
He's got a point for the first time.

443
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,069
Isn't he cute?

444
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:16,499
Yes. He's like a cute neighborhood dog.

445
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:19,069
I'm getting jealous.

446
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,980
I didn't know you could describe someone you met for the first time.

447
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,140
There you go again with your nonsense.

448
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,710
I'm serious.

449
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,230
The more I get to know him, the more I like him.

450
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,549
He's a hard worker too.

451
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,289
You're like that too.

452
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:36,369
The more I get to know you, the more I like you.

453
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:37,789
And you're good at your job too.

454
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,099
Why are you buttering me up out of the blue?

455
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:47,329
It didn't come out of the blue. It's the truth.

456
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:50,479
When he asked you to teach him swimming and called you his teacher,

457
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,599
he reminded me of you.

458
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,839
When you were 18?

459
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,490
- Joo Ik. - So you should go independent now.

460
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,490
You have your own pupil now.

461
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,210
Gosh, no.

462
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,079
I'll cling onto you until the day I die.

463
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,080
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E07 'Doom at Your Service'</font>

464
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,279
- Joo Ik. - Yes?

465
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,640
Do you like rice cakes?

466
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,170
Rice cakes?

467
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:27,740
She doesn't eat rice cakes.

468
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,950
When you get sick from eating some food,

469
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,809
you don't eat them again.

470
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:36,009
But I still like rice cakes.

471
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:38,980
But she hates rice cakes.

472
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:40,849
I was the one who got sick.

473
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,720
She asked me why I came.

474
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:49,089
She asked me why I came back to Korea and the union.

475
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:52,859
But I couldn't say anything.

476
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:55,730
So she told me to leave.

477
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,900
She said she wanted me to leave.

478
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,480
But you know,

479
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,450
I really didn't want to.

480
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,799
Do you think you can come over now?

481
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,730
I'm stuck on something.

482
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,220
(I can't.)

483
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,569
I can't.

484
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,240
Help? As if.

485
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,759
He always says the same thing.

486
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,759
I can't.

487
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,930
I can't go in if you sit there like that.

488
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,299
I'm sorry.

489
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:30,000
No, you don't have to...

490
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,600
Do you like him that much?

491
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,979
- Pardon? - Everyone knows...

492
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:38,339
that you're waiting for a boy from the eighth floor.

493
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,450
So everyone knows.

494
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,069
But Hyun Kyu doesn't know?

495
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,189
That I'm waiting here?

496
00:34:43,189 --> 00:34:45,009
He went to Japan for his studies.

497
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:47,120
He's not even here. Why are you waiting for him here?

498
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,760
Then, where should I wait for him?

499
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,950
This is the only spot I can wait for him.

500
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:53,399
This is the only place I know. Where else could I wait for him?

501
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,049
So what if you see him? What will you do then?

502
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,060
I don't know.

503
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:01,160
I'm just...

504
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,899
I'm just sad about everything.

505
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,330
What's making you sad?

506
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:10,100
We haven't had a chance to drink beer at the Han River yet.

507
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:14,209
And we haven't gone to Itaewon on Halloween.

508
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,540
And we haven't even shared a kiss yet.

509
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:24,779
Okay.

510
00:35:56,832 --> 00:35:58,093
What?

511
00:35:58,162 --> 00:36:00,062
I'm going to stop writing my novel.

512
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:03,402
What? What are you talking about?

513
00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:05,702
The end date and number of episodes are specified on the contract.

514
00:36:05,702 --> 00:36:07,202
Why all of a sudden...

515
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:09,843
Did you get another offer?

516
00:36:09,843 --> 00:36:11,383
Are the terms better?

517
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:13,903
No, it's not that. I'm sick.

518
00:36:15,552 --> 00:36:16,872
I have ovarian cancer.

519
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:18,943
It's at Stage Three.

520
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:25,682
Well, uploading the episodes irregularly isn't ideal either.

521
00:36:26,122 --> 00:36:28,233
Tell your agency that my novel is halted indefinitely...

522
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,332
because of a personal reason.

523
00:36:30,332 --> 00:36:32,553
I'll post an announcement for my readers.

524
00:36:33,903 --> 00:36:36,162
Well, I...

525
00:36:37,702 --> 00:36:40,412
Don't say anything if you're going to wish me luck.

526
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:42,313
I don't have the energy to thank you for that...

527
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:43,932
or force a smile.

528
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:49,602
I'm getting weaker every day.

529
00:36:49,713 --> 00:36:51,282
I already have a nasty personality,

530
00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:53,142
but it's only getting worse.

531
00:36:54,823 --> 00:36:56,142
I hope you understand.

532
00:37:00,063 --> 00:37:01,462
The team dinner is tonight, right?

533
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:03,423
You'll probably hear about it then.

534
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:06,522
Jijo King has a big mouth.

535
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:09,522
He's college friends with my ex-husband.

536
00:37:09,943 --> 00:37:11,273
I wanted to tell you myself...

537
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:12,963
rather than have you hear it from that jerk.

538
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:18,082
I should've been more considerate.

539
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:20,152
I'm sorry.

540
00:37:20,153 --> 00:37:22,803
Why are you sorry? I'm the one who's sorry.

541
00:37:24,282 --> 00:37:26,312
You should take care of your health.

542
00:37:26,923 --> 00:37:28,682
Or just live your life however you want to.

543
00:37:29,293 --> 00:37:31,182
Now that I'm sick, I'm starting to regret things.

544
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:34,222
You regret things?

545
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:36,253
Yes, I do.

546
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:39,553
I should've been more honest about the stuff I like and hate.

547
00:37:40,273 --> 00:37:41,573
I should've cared more about what I wanted...

548
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:43,062
rather than what others wanted.

549
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:45,832
I should've complimented myself...

550
00:37:46,102 --> 00:37:48,562
rather than wasting time complimenting others.

551
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:56,003
That's all I have to say.

552
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:57,843
I'll be off now.

553
00:38:05,262 --> 00:38:07,352
I like your outfit today.

554
00:38:07,593 --> 00:38:10,153
- You look pretty. - What?

555
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,693
You were always pretty.

556
00:38:13,233 --> 00:38:15,693
I figured I might regret it if I didn't tell you.

557
00:38:17,972 --> 00:38:19,292
Don't see me out.

558
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:27,542
Cheers to Life Story!

559
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:29,972
Cheers.

560
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:38,992
You look so much younger than the last time we met.

561
00:38:38,992 --> 00:38:41,283
Thank you for coming today amid your busy schedule.

562
00:38:42,293 --> 00:38:43,492
Wait.

563
00:38:44,432 --> 00:38:47,273
Here. It's just a small gesture.

564
00:38:47,273 --> 00:38:48,872
My gosh, you're unbelievable.

565
00:38:48,872 --> 00:38:51,263
You're embarrassing me.

566
00:38:54,313 --> 00:38:56,883
Gosh, this is so nice. I don't think I'd ever be able to drink it.

567
00:38:56,883 --> 00:38:58,813
You deserve to drink something nice like this.

568
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:01,042
You're the reason I make a living.

569
00:39:03,082 --> 00:39:07,613
I'm telling you. 10 writers answered my calls,

570
00:39:07,753 --> 00:39:09,812
and six of them said "okay".

571
00:39:10,162 --> 00:39:12,613
That doesn't exactly mean they're going to come.

572
00:39:13,262 --> 00:39:15,682
Forget it. Writers usually don't attend dinners like this.

573
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:18,432
That jerk is the only one who comes every single time.

574
00:39:18,432 --> 00:39:20,003
My dream is to become a writer.

575
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:21,302
Then I won't have to attend the team dinners.

576
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:23,492
My dream is to become the CEO, so I can get rid of team dinners.

577
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:27,412
Hey, what's your dream?

578
00:39:27,412 --> 00:39:28,662
My dream?

579
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:30,832
To live however I want to.

580
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:33,782
By the way,

581
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:36,472
did you all hear about Dalgona?

582
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:39,992
I don't think it's something appropriate to talk about.

583
00:39:39,992 --> 00:39:42,693
Gosh, come on. The editors need to know.

584
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:43,722
What if they make a mistake?

585
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:46,153
That's all I'm worried about.

586
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:51,222
I heard she has ovarian cancer.

587
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:53,472
That's why she hasn't been writing lately.

588
00:39:53,472 --> 00:39:55,202
- Are you serious? - Her husband ran away...

589
00:39:55,202 --> 00:39:57,872
because he didn't want to take care of her.

590
00:39:57,872 --> 00:40:00,803
I know this because her husband and I are friends from school.

591
00:40:01,113 --> 00:40:03,883
This shows that you need to be nice.

592
00:40:03,883 --> 00:40:06,282
That writer has a nasty personality.

593
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:09,503
I would've run away too if I were her husband.

594
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:16,193
My gosh, what's with the atmosphere?

595
00:40:16,193 --> 00:40:19,153
I'm just making jokes.

596
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:24,693
Ms. Tak. Ms. Tak.

597
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:27,633
Ms. Tak, you should also try to be nice.

598
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,722
- If you don't... - Then what?

599
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:33,202
- What? - What if I'm not nice?

600
00:40:33,202 --> 00:40:34,443
What's with her?

601
00:40:34,443 --> 00:40:36,073
Hey, Dong Kyung. Are you drunk?

602
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:38,641
What do you care whether I'm drunk or not?

603
00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:39,642
What?

604
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:41,552
I told you it's inappropriate.

605
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:42,713
- What did you say? - He said it with respect.

606
00:40:42,713 --> 00:40:44,582
I heard how he said it.

607
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:46,213
He said it politely.

608
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:47,692
What's wrong with you?

609
00:40:49,772 --> 00:40:52,843
Gosh, kids these days are unbelievable.

610
00:40:52,843 --> 00:40:55,703
Why is everyone reacting so sensitively to a joke?

611
00:40:56,712 --> 00:40:58,672
You won't be able to get married with that kind of personality.

612
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:02,513
Sir, that's a little out of line.

613
00:41:04,352 --> 00:41:05,723
Oh, you guys are the same age.

614
00:41:05,723 --> 00:41:07,163
Are you taking her side because you're in the same situation?

615
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:08,413
Hey.

616
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:12,292
"Hey"?

617
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:15,632
Who are you to judge my life?

618
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:18,232
Who gave you the right to be so nosy?

619
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:20,272
- You little... - Dong Kyung!

620
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:22,292
If you want to revise something, just revise your own writing.

621
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:25,612
But then again, I bet you don't even do that.

622
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:26,803
Hey.

623
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:29,502
Hey! Are you crazy?

624
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:32,203
A little.

625
00:41:32,882 --> 00:41:36,212
I might not get married, but I'm surely headed somewhere.

626
00:41:40,093 --> 00:41:42,612
I have cancer, so I'll be dead in three months.

627
00:41:43,832 --> 00:41:47,393
I'm headed to the afterlife way before I can get married.

628
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:52,522
I guess it's because I wasn't very nice like you said I should be.

629
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:56,563
Have fun, you guys. I'm going to go now.

630
00:42:01,382 --> 00:42:03,203
What's her problem?

631
00:42:48,263 --> 00:42:49,513
Recharge.

632
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:51,882
Why couldn't you cross the street?

633
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:54,723
- I was too scared. - Then you should've called me.

634
00:42:55,263 --> 00:42:57,922
- How? - However.

635
00:43:05,073 --> 00:43:06,862
I'm really scared.

636
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:09,502
I'm really scared to cross the street.

637
00:43:10,283 --> 00:43:11,473
Darn it.

638
00:43:12,013 --> 00:43:13,283
You told me to call you whenever I got scared.

639
00:43:13,283 --> 00:43:15,813
You told me to call you however.

640
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:26,982
Fine.

641
00:43:27,102 --> 00:43:29,322
So this isn't enough to make you show up?

642
00:43:30,933 --> 00:43:34,792
Hey, look where I'm standing.

643
00:43:35,143 --> 00:43:37,063
Look where I'm standing right now.

644
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:39,103
I'm going to jump.

645
00:43:39,843 --> 00:43:41,082
You saw me last time.

646
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:44,542
I don't bluff. I'm really going to jump.

647
00:43:48,922 --> 00:43:50,342
My gosh.

648
00:43:51,393 --> 00:43:54,022
I swear I'm...

649
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:56,712
I'm really going to jump.

650
00:43:56,993 --> 00:43:59,123
I'm seriously going to...

651
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:16,373
What a mean jerk.

652
00:44:16,843 --> 00:44:18,703
It's almost midnight.

653
00:44:20,252 --> 00:44:21,513
My gosh.

654
00:45:02,363 --> 00:45:03,652
Horrible jerk.

655
00:45:11,433 --> 00:45:13,563
I swear I'll kill him.

656
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,692
I'm the one who ended up getting hit by the stone...

657
00:46:50,703 --> 00:46:52,063
that I threw.

658
00:47:24,314 --> 00:47:26,065
Why you...

659
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:09,423
Did you hear?

660
00:48:09,424 --> 00:48:12,114
Life Story was flipped upside down yesterday.

661
00:48:12,294 --> 00:48:15,355
I hear one of their editors is sick.

662
00:48:15,595 --> 00:48:16,855
Don't cry.

663
00:48:17,765 --> 00:48:19,225
Don't you cry.

664
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:21,924
I said not to cry.

665
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:30,234
(Dong Kyung)

666
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,605
Please pick up.

667
00:48:53,734 --> 00:48:55,054
Dong Kyung!

668
00:48:57,375 --> 00:49:00,265
Dong Kyung! Dong Kyung!

669
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:03,464
Dong Kyung!

670
00:49:08,185 --> 00:49:09,375
Dong Kyung.

671
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,415
Dong Kyung!

672
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,774
- How may we help you? - She's Lee Hyun.

673
00:49:14,524 --> 00:49:16,955
Let's talk outside. Ms. Tak didn't come in today.

674
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:19,785
Did you know that she was sick?

675
00:49:20,095 --> 00:49:22,815
I didn't. I found out yesterday.

676
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:30,654
You idiot.

677
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:32,665
You stupid idiot.

678
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:36,335
How did I not know?

679
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,364
How?

680
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:43,975
You idiot. Why didn't I know?

681
00:49:49,825 --> 00:49:51,145
Let's go outside.

682
00:49:53,395 --> 00:49:55,815
I'll tell you everything that I know.

683
00:49:59,265 --> 00:50:01,324
I had no idea.

684
00:50:01,935 --> 00:50:03,455
Last time,

685
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:07,265
she asked what I'd want to do if I were dying in 100 days.

686
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:10,765
I was clueless,

687
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,304
and asked jokingly, "Are you dying?"

688
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:15,105
Seriously.

689
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:17,844
I'm a bad friend.

690
00:50:18,084 --> 00:50:20,254
When you put it that way, I'm a bad supervisor.

691
00:50:20,254 --> 00:50:21,875
Seriously.

692
00:50:25,294 --> 00:50:27,654
Stop thinking about things you couldn't do.

693
00:50:27,665 --> 00:50:29,915
Think about things you can do for her from now on.

694
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,475
- I'll go now. - Now?

695
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:45,565
I don't have enough time to do everything I want to for her.

696
00:50:51,654 --> 00:50:52,844
What are you looking for?

697
00:50:53,254 --> 00:50:55,454
- My car key. - Did you drive here?

698
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:57,424
Yes. I'm sorry.

699
00:50:57,424 --> 00:50:59,185
I'm just out of it.

700
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:00,863
Where is it?

701
00:51:00,864 --> 00:51:02,294
Let's go. I'll take you.

702
00:51:02,294 --> 00:51:04,265
No, it's okay.

703
00:51:04,265 --> 00:51:05,725
I'm really okay.

704
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:13,094
Look at me.

705
00:51:15,404 --> 00:51:18,335
Let me take you. I'm worried, that's why.

706
00:51:19,314 --> 00:51:21,634
How can you see with your eyes so swollen?

707
00:51:31,725 --> 00:51:33,685
(Life Story)

708
00:51:36,725 --> 00:51:37,924
Where's your car?

709
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:41,855
Back there...

710
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,375
Dong Kyung...

711
00:52:03,785 --> 00:52:05,185
Dong Kyung...

712
00:52:12,435 --> 00:52:13,725
Dong Kyung...

713
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:19,484
The high intracranial pressure was the cause.

714
00:53:19,665 --> 00:53:21,594
We need to run a thorough examination,

715
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,955
so please page me once she wakes up.

716
00:53:26,605 --> 00:53:27,864
Okay.

717
00:53:29,044 --> 00:53:30,295
Thank you.

718
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:55,054
(Our Auntie)

719
00:54:28,364 --> 00:54:30,654
You've been here all day.

720
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,634
What are you thinking about?

721
00:54:37,814 --> 00:54:39,234
Nothing.

722
00:54:43,044 --> 00:54:45,875
Good. Don't go.

723
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,614
You decided not to see her.

724
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,484
Good call.

725
00:54:52,225 --> 00:54:54,614
Don't see her ever again.

726
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:58,654
Whether she dies or lives,

727
00:54:59,734 --> 00:55:01,085
don't see her again.

728
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:04,295
That's how you should live.

729
00:55:05,605 --> 00:55:07,665
Do you think you can live...

730
00:55:09,504 --> 00:55:10,795
like that?

731
00:55:27,095 --> 00:55:30,515
A child must rebel against his or her parent to grow.

732
00:55:32,134 --> 00:55:36,795
And love must suffer hardship to burn hotter.

733
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:32,304
I knew you would come.

734
00:57:33,855 --> 00:57:35,645
It was inevitable.

735
00:57:45,234 --> 00:57:46,855
Did you think I wouldn't be able to...

736
00:57:47,495 --> 00:57:49,424
find you if you hide?

737
00:57:51,404 --> 00:57:55,035
I told you I could see right through you.

738
00:57:55,975 --> 00:57:57,495
That you're a good guy.

739
00:57:58,345 --> 00:57:59,665
I know that.

740
00:58:01,884 --> 00:58:05,145
You can't run away before you grant me my wish.

741
00:58:06,814 --> 00:58:09,214
I said you could go after you grant me my wish.

742
00:58:09,484 --> 00:58:11,325
- Don't you remember? - Tak Dong Kyung.

743
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:13,285
I'm going to kill...

744
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:28,594
I have been struggling to turn my life around for better luck...

745
00:58:29,174 --> 00:58:31,765
and waiting for my answer...

746
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:34,065
all these years.

747
00:58:36,384 --> 00:58:39,274
(Toshino, Recruiting New and Experienced Employees)

748
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:41,875
Tak Dong Kyung.

749
00:58:45,995 --> 00:58:48,265
(Testing Location 6 for District 94)

750
00:58:48,265 --> 00:58:49,685
Well done!

751
00:58:51,864 --> 00:58:53,085
Good job.

752
00:58:53,464 --> 00:58:55,165
- Good work. - Great job!

753
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:57,194
- Good work. - Good work.

754
00:58:57,935 --> 00:58:59,234
- You guys are amazing! - Good work!

755
00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:00,464
Tak Dong Kyung!

756
00:59:01,035 --> 00:59:03,265
- Good job. - Great job.

757
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:05,234
Well done!

758
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:12,975
Tak Dong Kyung!

759
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:25,355
Tak Dong Kyung.

760
00:59:26,194 --> 00:59:27,484
In the end,

761
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:29,895
they will call for me.

762
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:39,864
That's my answer.

763
00:59:54,555 --> 00:59:57,455
At times, misery and luck come with the same face.

764
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:05,424
And I still cannot distinguish...

765
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:07,964
the two.

766
01:00:33,395 --> 01:00:37,495
(Doom at Your Service)

767
01:00:37,864 --> 01:00:39,464
You don't have to use that wish.

768
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:42,694
I don't care about anyone but you now.

769
01:00:42,745 --> 01:00:44,165
It's so beautiful...

770
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:46,435
that it might disappear.

771
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,404
I needed to talk to you.

772
01:00:50,015 --> 01:00:51,674
I can't keep this any longer.

773
01:00:52,855 --> 01:00:54,444
I want everyone...

774
01:00:55,325 --> 01:00:57,245
to forget about me.

775
01:00:57,584 --> 01:00:58,995
Where's Tak Dong Kyung?

776
01:00:58,995 --> 01:01:00,545
You don't have much time left.

777
01:01:00,654 --> 01:01:02,185
You must choose.

778
01:01:02,294 --> 01:01:03,585
I want to live.

779
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,024
I'll let you live.

780
01:01:06,535 --> 01:01:07,924
I'm going to let her live.
