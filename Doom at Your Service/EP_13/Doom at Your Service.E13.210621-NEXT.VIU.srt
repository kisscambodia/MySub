3
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:45,710
Tak Dong Kyung.

4
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,079
How do you know my name?

5
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,479
Who are you?

6
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,589
Then, who are you?

7
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:00,898
It's cold tonight.

8
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,699
Why did she leave? She could catch a cold. Goodness.

9
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,830
Tak Dong Kyung.

10
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:08,398
First floor. The doors are closing.

11
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:09,669
Going down.

12
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:15,579
- What was that about? - My aunt.

13
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,248
If she sees us, things will get complicated.

14
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:19,079
If we want to talk, I can't let her catch us.

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,210
Talk about what?

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,649
Aren't you here because you needed to talk to me?

17
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,418
I doubt that you came back because you missed me...

18
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,720
since we just saw each other.

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,589
Why did you ask me who I was?

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,489
You even know my name.

21
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,699
Then, what about your question?

22
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:38,399
I explained to you who I am and what I do.

23
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:42,270
I don't know.

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,070
Something feels weird.

25
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,309
Second basement floor.

26
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,809
- Where are we going? - To the parking lot.

27
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,550
This will be a long conversation.

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,759
(Episode 13)

29
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,040
I need to ask you something.

30
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,010
It's cold out here. Let's talk inside.

31
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,180
I can't do that inside.

32
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,309
I'll lose there...

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,779
because it's your turf.

34
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,550
- Then, this place works for you? - No.

35
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,659
There isn't such a place.

36
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:37,890
I picked this place...

37
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,029
because it'd be easier to run away if I wanted.

38
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,670
Let's stop skirting around it now.

39
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,050
- Joo Ik. - Yes.

40
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,719
Did you kiss her?

41
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:04,819
Did you...

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,020
kiss her 10 years ago?

43
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,390
- Yes. - Why?

44
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:13,890
To get her out of there.

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,499
So you two wouldn't get back together.

46
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,369
Why?

47
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,369
She cried there every single day.

48
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,409
If I didn't make her leave that day,

49
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,210
she would have cried, sitting on that step for days and months.

50
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:35,020
I didn't want her...

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,819
to come back again, sit there, and cry.

52
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:42,890
- That's why I did it. - Did you think about me?

53
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,589
- Did you? - I did.

54
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:48,760
All the more reason why I did it.

55
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,629
You knew that she was waiting for you.

56
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,269
You knew, but you never went out to see her...

57
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,469
because you were embarrassed.

58
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,338
You left Korea as if you were never going to come back,

59
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,409
but you came back only after a few months because it was tough.

60
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,409
You didn't want her to find out.

61
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,550
Say something.

62
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,189
Curse me out if you want. I'll handle it.

63
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,920
I won't run away.

64
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,260
Why are you brutally honest?

65
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,360
You could have avoided answering it,

66
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,959
apologized, and moved on.

67
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,400
You have a way with words too.

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,540
Why are you brutally honest with me?

69
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,740
Because I like you.

70
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:35,980
You are...

71
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,550
one of a few people I actually like.

72
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:41,650
I don't want to be a coward in front of you.

73
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,819
I've hidden it for too long.

74
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:48,160
And all these years,

75
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,129
it had been bothering me too.

76
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,170
This is so annoying.

77
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,740
You still make me feel worthless even in this moment.

78
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,650
You're so annoying.

79
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:16,550
Where are you going?

80
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,389
- To the cafe. - Why?

81
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,389
I don't think I can sleep in the same house with you tonight.

82
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,400
I regret every moment of it.

83
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,100
Running away, taking too long,

84
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,809
and asking you.

85
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,110
Everything.

86
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,259
I was crying.

87
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:05,498
I looked in the mirror after I came back.

88
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,829
And I was crying.

89
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:09,699
But I didn't even know I was crying.

90
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,740
When I looked in the mirror, I was crying.

91
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,550
Why was I crying?

92
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,819
Get in.

93
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,029
Where are we going?

94
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,629
You'll be safe. Get in.

95
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,540
Have you seen...

96
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:46,568
a girl who's about this tall and has hair coming up to here?

97
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:47,910
Have you?

98
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,349
A girl who's about this tall and has hair coming up to here?

99
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,409
That description fits so many girls.

100
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,550
Have you met someone like her at the hospital?

101
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,519
- Are you talking about her? - Have you met her?

102
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,559
What did she do to you?

103
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,519
She didn't do anything. I did something for her.

104
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:05,689
I opened a bottle for her.

105
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,559
What else?

106
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:09,329
What else?

107
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,698
After that, she thanked me and told me to go to the rooftop.

108
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:15,939
She said the view there was nice.

109
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,139
- Anything else other than that? - No.

110
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:23,410
Think again. I'm sure she did something to you.

111
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,549
What did she do?

112
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,550
That's what I don't know. So think again.

113
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:36,889
I don't know.

114
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,159
What do you know then?

115
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,530
What does she have to do with us?

116
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,900
Does she know me?

117
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,328
I can't remember her either?

118
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:48,169
Perhaps, your brain has just gone bad, not sick.

119
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,600
No need to talk about yourself now.

120
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,569
Right. I'm not exactly kind.

121
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,249
All good, right? It's my turn now.

122
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:02,019
You weren't crying?

123
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:06,949
Why won't you answer my question?

124
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,759
I asked if you weren't crying. Was I the only one who cried?

125
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,059
I'm not done with my questions yet.

126
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,400
Who were you calling earlier?

127
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,300
Exactly. That's really weird.

128
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,040
I was crying.

129
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,240
But I couldn't get that thought out of my head.

130
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,840
"I must call you."

131
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,910
- "You"? - But...

132
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,680
I don't know who that person is.

133
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,419
That person's number is saved on my cell phone.

134
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,989
But I have no idea who it is.

135
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:44,459
Call that number again.

138
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,250
Whoever it is isn't picking up. Whose number is this?

139
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,849
"Human". Who's "Human"?

140
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,719
Who knows? At least I know it's not me.

141
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,260
I should go now.

142
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,959
What about me?

143
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:19,729
What?

144
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,399
Aren't you going to drive me back?

145
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,499
It's nearby.

146
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,000
Walk back. It's only five minutes by foot.

147
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,099
Gosh, if he were human I would've taught him a lesson.

148
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,109
Who could it be?

149
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,079
"Human".

150
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,449
Why do you fall so easily?

151
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,559
Watch where you're going.

152
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,919
I thought you were leaving.

153
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,189
Yes, I was on my way.

154
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,969
My gosh. Seriously.

155
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,329

Oh, hey. Gosh.

You're here.

169
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,468
Did you sleep here?

170
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:15,370
- Yes. - Why?

171
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:17,699
Did you fight with your friend?

172

No.

173
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,880
Then what?

174
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:24,809
We're still fighting.

They're always fighting. It's like they're a married couple.

What are you talking about? Does it look like I fought with him?

I guess you guys didn't have a fistfight yet.

I'm not going to fight him. Plus, I'd win anyway.

00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:56,339
Is that so? You think you'll win? Are you sure about that?

182
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:58,650
So you lost.

183
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,819
- We haven't fought yet. - Then go ahead and fight.

184
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,620
You won't know who will win until you actually fight him.

185
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,250
Do you want me to go around fighting people?

186
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,319
Do you know why I adore Hyun Kyu so much?

187
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,359
Maybe it's because he grew up as an athlete,

188
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:17,229
but behind that smile of his, I can tell he's very competitive.

189
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,370
I really like that about him.

190
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,269
Whatever.

191
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,770
You're nothing like him.

192
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,669
When he's in for a competition,

193
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,309
he does everything he can to win, but look at you.

194
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:30,640
You always just yield as if it doesn't even matter.

195
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,409
I bet he's pretty irritated though.

196
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,819
You always let him win without even putting up a fight.

197
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,589
Things are a bit different this time.

198
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:43,620
How so?

199
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,790
We're not fighting.

200
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,890
But I need to take something from him.

201
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,930
Really?

202
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,900
Then I guess you'll win this time.

203
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,438
I've never seen you fail to get what you want.

204
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,640
And the same goes with this.

205
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,540
I'm looking forward to it.

206
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:06,879
If you lose but refuse to admit to it,

207
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,379
that would make you a bad mentor.

208
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,519
But if he loses and doesn't back off,

209
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,890
that would mean you didn't teach him well.

210
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,790
So whatever happens, it's all on me.

211
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,289
If you're going to be the bad guy no matter the result,

212
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,800
you should at least win.

213
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:37,680
You did this, didn't you?

214
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,250
What exactly is my relationship with her?

215
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,089
You're not going to tell me?

216
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,929
If you don't want to tell me, then don't.

217
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,760
I'll figure it out myself.

218
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,170
I didn't think you'd tell me anyway.

219
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:06,140
Instead, don't resent me even if something happens.

220
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,069
You kept going on about ghosts,

221
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,839
and now you're even watching ghost dramas?

222
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,968
What? What did you say?

223
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:43,338
You're awfully energetic for someone who's fasting.

224
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:46,279
Why are you starting the day watching such a scary drama?

225
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,849
Aunt, I'm not watching this for fun.

226
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,520
I'm studying right now.

227
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,260
I need to study ghosts in order to... Wait a minute.

228
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,089
What? Why does this situation feel so familiar?

229
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:01,390
- My goodness. - Is it a deja vu?

230
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,339
What? What are you doing here?

231
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,938
Hey, watch it. Why are you talking that way to your doctor?

232
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,040
"Doctor"? Who? Him?

233
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,579
I'm sorry. She's still half-asleep.

234
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:20,180
It's okay.

235
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,549
She's not very healthy right now.

236
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,318
So that could cause her to become hysterical and rude.

237
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,848
What? "Rude"?

238
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:28,160
Let me check your condition.

239
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,229
Hey, wait. Wait.

240
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,829
Everything seems fine.

241
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,559
Oh, gosh. Wait a minute.

242
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,670
And that's fine too.

243
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:41,400
Goodness, thank you, sir.

244
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:43,938
Aunt, am I the only one who finds this weird? Really?

245
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:44,939
Am I being strange right now?

246
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:45,939
Yes, you're acting strange.

247
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,439
We just need to take a few basic tests.

248
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:50,979
Bye then.

249
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,280
Unbelievable.

250
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,979
What's with you?

251
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:00,589
But he...

252
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:07,330
You again?

253
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:09,899
Stop chatting and sit.

254
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,229
I can't believe this. Why do you keep following me around?

255
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,469
- Hey. - Stay still. Don't move.

256
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,478
Do you even know how to work this thing?

257
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,640
Stop talking.

258
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,849
Seriously, why are you doing this...

259
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,989
Hold your breath.

260
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,860
Good girl.

261
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,739
How many jobs do you have?

262
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,339
Why are you doing this to me?

263
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,679
I'm here to save your life.

264
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,009
What are you talking about?

265
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:04,820
My gosh.

266
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:10,219
If you go in there with this, you'll die.

267
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,288
Do you know how expensive it is to fix this thing?

268
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,430
I saved your life.

269
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,798
So you're worried about the machine, not me?

270
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,198
- Lie down. - Hey.

271
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,299
Stop talking.

272
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,269
Why does he keep telling me to stop talking?

273
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,379
Hey. The more I think about it,

274
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,948
I really don't know why I need to take this from you...

275
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:14,188
Oh my gosh.

276
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:17,089
Hey. Stop right there. I'm talking to you.

277
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,958
- Hey! - Tak Dong Kyung?

278
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,830
- Yes? - Let's go take your blood sample.

279
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,299
Okay.

280
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,170
Darn it.

281
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,729
Ms. Tak!

282
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,038
(Get well soon.)

283
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,708
You need to bring fruit to someone in a hospital,

284
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:34,110
so I picked out this and that.

285
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,938
Can you even eat?

286
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,080
- My fasting just ended. - What good timing.

287
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:41,110
Is the hospital starving you?

288
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,248
You need to eat well when you're sick.

289
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,649
Eat. Eat everything.

290
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,089
Say the word. I'll get it for you.

291
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,449
I'm on standby 24 hours a day.

292
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,860
I'll send you the pictures of hot guys that I collected.

293
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:55,028
You must be bored here.

294
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,298
I ask because I don't know.

295
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,830
Does it make you less bored if you look at hot guys?

296
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,999
Yes, it makes life enjoyable.

297
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,539
They've gotten close.

298
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:04,839
I know, right?

299
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,268
I'm so proud. So proud.

300
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:08,810
- We're not close. - We're not close.

301
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,709
Didn't you bring anything?

302
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,649
You're the building owner's son.

303
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,518
What? Come on.

304
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,719
I'm sure he prepared at least a line.

305
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:21,120
How have you been?

306
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,729
Not that.

307
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:31,458
Well... Tell me if you need cash.

308
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:32,829
- Awesome. - Awesome.

309
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,900
He's so cool.

310
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:37,439
How is that cool?

311
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,340
Anyways, do you want to try this?

312
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,718
Let's have some fruit.

313
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,789
- Don't open it yet. - Eat with me.

314
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:54,048
You eat it all. They're expensive.

315
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:55,060
They are?

316
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:59,059
I need to go. Something urgent came up.

317
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,390
- What? So suddenly? - Sorry. I'll call you.

318
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,170
I'm going drinking with Hyun Kyu.

319
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,380
Go ahead.

320
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,749
Shouldn't you stop me? You say you like me.

321
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,748
What if I do something bad?

322
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:22,779
Like what?

323
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,948
Do it.

324
00:21:25,949 --> 00:21:27,590
It won't change my feelings.

325
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,789
I wouldn't have told you how I felt if it were that flippant.

326
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:35,400
Do you really like me?

327
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,430
- Since when? - Since the beginning.

328
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,229
When was that?

329
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:43,900
Since the beginning.

330
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,779
You're insane.

331
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:55,479
How could someone like you make such a stupid decision?

332
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,150
I know.

333
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,320
But losing what I want is what's truly stupid.

334
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:06,360
Losing what you want is stupid, Ms. Na.

335
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,560
Don't call me stupid.

336
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:12,930
I thought about it for a long time.

337
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,400
Why did I kiss someone I don't know?

338
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,269
Why did it bother me so much...

339
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,110
to see someone I don't know cry?

340
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,080
The answer was there from the beginning.

341
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,380
I told myself it was wrong, that's all.

342
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,489
Does Hyun Kyu know too?

343
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,890
What?

344
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,529
That we kissed?

345
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,830
Or...

346
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,400
that I like you?

347
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:54,310
He knows everything. He knew everything.

348
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,180
That's why I can't back down.

349
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,820
What do you think?

350
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,189
Can I win?

351
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,219
I don't know.

352
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:09,860
Why don't you know anything?

353
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:15,330
- Like you know? - I do.

354
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,410
Spill it.

355
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,820
I don't know. I'm going crazy.

356
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,320
How did I become the bad girl?

357
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,689
You're no bad girl.

358
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,390
You're finally being rewarded.

359
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:45,659
- I'm being rewarded? - No, it's an award.

360
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,458
Mr. Cha is an award.

361
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,459
Whatever.

362
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,100
You always complained about him.

363
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,998
I always thought...

364
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:54,070
that jerk was a real pain,

365
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:56,199
but he isn't a bad person.

366
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,170
He doesn't give his heart that easily.

367
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:02,339
That's why he still hasn't opened his heart to me.

368
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,539
That annoying jerk.

369
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,679
It's the end of Ji Na's tearjerker love stories.

370
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,519
Finally, you met a good guy.

371
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,119
That's right. You don't know, do you?

372
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
What?

373
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:16,890
He's...

374
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,590
- mad loaded. - Really?

375
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,059
No, no. It doesn't matter.

376
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,559
Why doesn't it matter?

377
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,600
To be honest, he's pretty good-looking.

378
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,670
And this is a secret.

379
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:31,640
I never said it in case he'd think I like him.

380
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,009
To be honest,

381
00:24:34,469 --> 00:24:36,910
he's really funny at times.

382
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,708
He really is funny.

383
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,549
I bet he'll make you laugh every day if you go out with him.

384
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,149
I don't know. Should I see a fortune-teller?

385
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,620
A fortune-teller? Should we go together?

386
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,320
- You too? Why? - Some freak...

387
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,688
No, a doctor...

388
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:54,129
No, no. I don't know how to describe this.

389
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,429
What is it? Is a doctor hitting on you?

390
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,729
Yes. He keeps saying let's end the world together.

391
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,329
Oh my gosh. He says...

392
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,130
he'll love only you even if the world ends?

393
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,999
When did I say that?

394
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,439
- That's not it... - Awesome.

395
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,208
A hot doctor falls for a patient at first sight...

396
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:09,739
and begs for her love.

397
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:12,179
What an amazing hospital romance.

398
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,449
It is not!

399
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:15,249
Hey.

400
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,080
Forget it. Just forget it.

401
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,411
- Sir. - Yes?

402
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,981
Why did you open a cafe?

403
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,251
You were a swimmer.

404
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:30,850
You even studied abroad.

405
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,721
Why do you ask?

406
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:37,761
I sincerely like working at a cafe.

407
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,300
You look like you were born to own a cafe.

408
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,770
But I'm not sure about myself.

409
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:46,270
Well...

410
00:25:46,971 --> 00:25:49,039
After I got injured while studying abroad,

411
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,741
I was completely lost.

412
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:53,011
I suddenly missed Korea like crazy.

413
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:56,350
So I stopped by a cafe...

414
00:25:57,651 --> 00:25:59,280
and that was when I realized...

415
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:01,850
that coffee was the same there or in Korea.

416
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,491
Is that how you fell in love with coffee?

417
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:07,060
No, that's a lie.

418
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,360
It looks cool to own a cafe.

419
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,859
Don't wait for destiny.

420
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,401
It won't hit you on the head saying it's fate.

421
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,171
I never knew I'd run a cafe either.

422
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:22,941
If you like it, do it.

423
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:25,441
Don't make plans and make a big deal out of it.

424
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,211
Just do it.

425
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:29,810
You'll become good at it eventually.

426
00:26:30,481 --> 00:26:33,050
Then you'll think you were meant for it.

427
00:26:36,391 --> 00:26:38,691
You're good. You're doing well.

428
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:47,431
Don't you think it was a waste?

429
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,931
What can I do though?

430
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,000
I wasn't good enough to make the national team.

431
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:54,671
Not that. Your first love.

432
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,879
If you knew you were meant to run a cafe,

433
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,241
you wouldn't have left to study abroad.

434
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:04,050
Then you may have stayed together.

435
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:07,780
And you wouldn't be hurt like this.

436
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:10,491
She's the one...

437
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,921
who was hurt, not I.

438
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,931
I just...

439
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,100
I just kept running away.

440
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,070
It's okay.

441
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,370
Just don't run away anymore.

442
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:31,671
What? Do I look like a fool to you?

443
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:34,211
A bit.

444
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,850
You punk.

445
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,151
My gosh. Who put away the beans like that?

446
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,550
It was me. Gosh. I'm so stupid. I'm such a fool!

447
00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:03,641
(Ji Na)

448
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:12,921
Hello?

449
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:15,350
Drink with me tonight.

450
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,330
Sure. Let's do that.

451
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,201
Mr. Lee, what do I do with the expired beans...

452
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:40,810
Let me go and get changed.

453
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:50,421
You were working at this cafe?

454
00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:54,191
Yes. This is the cafe. But why are you...

455
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,431
Athlete, swimmer, and running away...

456
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,529
I sort of figured it out.

457
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,400
But let me ask just one question to confirm it.

458
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:06,441
What?

459
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:09,010
Is my boss number 1 or 2?

460
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:10,070
What?

461
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:14,280
You told me you wanted to kill two guys. Which one is he?

462
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,280
- Number one. - Gosh. Mr. Lee.

463
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:21,951
Lock up for me. Thanks.

464
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:23,491
- Let's go. - Okay.

465
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,290
- I... - Shut it.

466
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,620
Bye.

467
00:29:44,011 --> 00:29:45,610
Slow down.

468
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,441
You might do something you'll regret.

469
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:55,421
Sure. Do whatever you want. I'll forget about it.

470
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:02,991
I guess that's easy for you.

471
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:09,300
You said you came back to Korea and attended the reunion to see me.

472
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,900
Yes.

473
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:12,971
Same here.

474
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,610
I went to the reunion to see you every year.

475
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:20,981
- Let's drink. Drink up. - Okay.

476
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,280
"What if he doesn't come?"

477
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:28,451
"But what if he really came?" That's all I thought about.

478
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:31,420
I was disappointed every time,

479
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:33,590
anticipating seeing you as I sat there.

480
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,530
That's not all.

481
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,930
I couldn't go to your house.

482
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:43,100
So I roamed around your neighborhood.

483
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:47,201
I sat at a cafe near your house too.

484
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,640
(Danger, No Entry)

485
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,410
I used to get off at a subway station...

486
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:53,941
near your house and sit on the bench.

487
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,619
Whenever the doors opened, just in case you got off,

488
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,360
I was nervous and tense.

489
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,260
In case I ran into you by chance,

490
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:11,891
I kept roaming around your streets.

491
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:17,100
- I didn't know. - I don't resent you.

492
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:19,540
Don't look so guilty.

493
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:22,711
I just wanted to tell you...

494
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,280
that I had been loving you for a very long time by myself.

495
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,951
In my head,

496
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:33,721
I had always loved you by myself.

497
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:37,520
But...

498
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,020
seeing you again lately made me wonder...

499
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:44,830
if the person I loved...

500
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:48,401
was truly you.

501
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,671
What do you mean?

502
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,870
I don't know anything about you.

503
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:56,540
I realized it when I started to see you again.

504
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,280
I had been in love with...

505
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:02,310
the 18-year-old you.

506
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,751
I had been waiting for you on the same spot...

507
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:11,891
when you had walked away.

508
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,461
It's the same with me.

509
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,830
I don't know anything about you either.

510
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,300
- Yes. That's why... - But I don't care.

511
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,530
I won't run away now.

512
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,701
- Our relationship ended long ago. - It ended?

513
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:31,610
I had been a swimmer for over 10 years.

514
00:32:32,011 --> 00:32:35,280
Going back to the starting line isn't that hard for me.

515
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,550
I can go back over and over again.

516
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:49,089
Cha Joo Ik and I kissed.

517
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,491
I know. I don't care.

518
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:52,261
I care.

519
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,671
I think...

520
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:04,911
it matters to me.

521
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,820
Na Ji Na.

522
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,960
You're horrible.

523
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:35,241
You're crying again.

524
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:37,840
Why...

525
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,541
are you here?

526
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:42,141
I don't know.

527
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,280
How long have you been waiting here?

528
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,181
I don't know.

529
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:51,190
What if I didn't show up?

530
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:53,190
I don't know that either.

531
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,630
Seriously.

532
00:33:58,761 --> 00:33:59,930
You're ridiculous.

533
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:01,360
I get that a lot.

534
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:04,471
You never disappoint me with your unexpected behaviors.

535
00:34:06,271 --> 00:34:07,541
You confuse me.

536
00:34:07,701 --> 00:34:08,940
I confuse you?

537
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:12,511
I don't think so.

538
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,420
Don't be confused.

539
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:27,161
I came here because I wanted to see you and I like you.

540
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,891
What was that?

541
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,630
I didn't want to drink because if I did,

542
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:09,170
I might do something that I would regret.

543
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,411
Ms. Na.

544
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,480
Ms. Na.

545
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:23,940
Limit your regrets only to me.

546
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,940
Your regrettable action...

547
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:29,181
could destroy me.

548
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,780
You crazy wench, Na Ji Na!

549
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,820
Gosh. Come on.

550
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,021
- What? My hair? - Yes.

551
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:16,260
You'll be going through chemo and radiation therapy.

552
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:17,460
Your hair will fall out quickly.

553
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:19,761
You've seen it on TV, right?

554
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:21,629
You might cope better...

555
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,201
if you take care of your hair beforehand.

556
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,500
And that's what I recommend too.

557
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:29,241
Seeing your hair falling out...

558
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:32,440
could be harder to watch.

559
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:48,090
Ever since you were young, you had a nice shaped head.

560
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,930
So whenever I gave you a short haircut,

561
00:37:50,931 --> 00:37:53,161
all the elders in the neighborhood...

562
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:57,371
would say you look like a cute chestnut...

563
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,670
and give you tons of compliments.

564
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:01,541
You remember that, right?

565
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:04,041
Yes, I remember.

566
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,610
Your hair...

567
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:09,351
will grow.

568
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:12,081
It'll grow back really fast.

569
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,550
They also sell shampoos that help your hair grow faster.

570
00:38:16,221 --> 00:38:17,249
Right.

571
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,121
Should I also get a haircut?

572
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:22,991
We can make Sun Kyung shave his head too.

573
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:28,629
Don't you remember he did that when he went to the army?

574
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,331
He was really ugly.

575
00:38:31,471 --> 00:38:33,041
He looks decent thanks to his hair, so he can't shave his head.

576
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,910
Shaving my head is already enough. Let's not do it to anyone else.

577
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:38,940
Okay, Auntie?

578
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,081
Gosh, you charming girl. You're such a good girl.

579
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:49,621
I should go and buy you some hats.

580
00:38:51,021 --> 00:38:52,649
I'll get you pretty ones.

581
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,390
Don't bother. I have a lot of hats.

582
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:57,060
You even bought me one last time.

583
00:38:57,061 --> 00:38:58,830
Gosh, that's too big.

584
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:00,530
You have a tiny head.

585
00:39:01,261 --> 00:39:02,971
Let me take a look.

586
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:07,601
It's about this big.

587
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,210
I'll be right back.

588
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,800
(Absolute rest)

589
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:56,911
How should I style your hair?

590
00:40:58,911 --> 00:41:00,820
Well...

591
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:05,121
I want to look like a celebrity.

592
00:41:05,491 --> 00:41:07,060
- Pardon? - Something that celebrities do.

593
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:10,830
I want a perm that looks really extravagant.

594
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:11,860
Just like that.

595
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,161
Miss.

596
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,030
That was done with a curling iron.

597
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,170
I want that hairstyle.

598
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:26,380
There. You're all done.

599
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,311
To be honest, I was a little worried because you came in a patient gown.

600
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:35,621
We get a few patients from the hospital nearby,

601
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,420
and they come to shave their heads.

602
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,690
This hair looks great on you.

603
00:41:42,491 --> 00:41:45,561
Can we take a photo and upload it on our website?

604
00:41:46,061 --> 00:41:48,101
Your face won't show. It'll just be your hair.

605
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:50,630
- Just your hair. - Okay.

606
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:53,840
The curls came out great.

607
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,180
- Are you done? - Wait. Just one more.

608
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:03,181
I'll take it from here.

609
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:06,521
It looks so pretty.

610
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,780
You're all done now.

611
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:10,650
Okay then.

612
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,061
You can shave my head now.

613
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:15,561
What?

614
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:20,561
Just shave everything off my head.

615
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:26,170
I'm sorry. I know you put in a lot of effort to do this for me.

616
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:29,610
But I wanted to try it one last time.

617
00:42:31,141 --> 00:42:33,380
It won't be your last time. You should come again.

618
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,310
I'll do this for you again.

619
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:37,050
I'll make sure it comes out even better than today.

620
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:41,780
Actually, I bet you'll look good with short hair too.

621
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:45,319
Now that I think of it, it wasn't the hair that came out nice.

622
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,460
You're just pretty to begin with.

623
00:42:50,561 --> 00:42:52,030
Will you be okay?

624
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,900
Yes.

625
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,980
I'll cut it now.

626
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,750
Okay.

627
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:16,891
- Your nose is bleeding. - My goodness.

628
00:43:17,351 --> 00:43:19,350
- Are you okay? - Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

629
00:43:19,351 --> 00:43:20,490
- Get her a tissue. - I'm fine.

630
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:22,291
Just a second. Get her a tissue.

631
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,560
Don't cry.

632
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,739
Don't cry.

633
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,469
Don't cry.

634
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,799
Please don't cry.

635
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,819
I'm sorry.

636
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:37,389
I'm so sorry.

637
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:16,319
What's going on?

638
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,659
Where am I?

639
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,488
My house.

640
00:48:20,489 --> 00:48:22,489
Why am I in your house?

641
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,559
Was I kidnapped?

642
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,630
Something like that.

643
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,670
Since I dragged you into this dream without your consent.

644
00:48:31,799 --> 00:48:32,870
Dream?

645
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,580
This is a dream?

646
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,489
What... Wow.

647
00:48:50,859 --> 00:48:52,489
It feels so real.

648
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,060
That's right.

649
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:03,429
What?

650
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,179
(Les Miserables)

651
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,650
You're giving me a headache.

652
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:29,230
Is this jail?

653
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:31,529
Did you lock me up?

654
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:34,529
Is that all you can say to the person who saved your life?

655
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,429
What?

656
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:38,500
You saved me?

657
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,670
Wasn't that a dream?

658
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,810
No, it wasn't.

659
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,480
Then that dream... No.

660
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,278
That was a dream. It was definitely a dream.

661
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,679
It was a dream. So why...

662
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,389
That dream?

663
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:58,219
You were crying in my dream earlier.

664
00:49:58,889 --> 00:49:59,960
It was a dream.

665
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:02,929
I don't eat, sleep, or cry.

666
00:50:03,489 --> 00:50:06,900
I died and you came to my funeral.

667
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:11,600
You looked at my picture and cried...

668
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,549
I'm not sad.

669
00:50:32,259 --> 00:50:33,889
I'm not sad no matter how much I look at you.

670
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:37,630
Hey. You startled me.

671
00:50:39,029 --> 00:50:40,999
- Smile. - What?

672
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,629
Smile at me.

673
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:43,698
Why should I?

674
00:50:43,699 --> 00:50:45,900
I need to know who and what you are.

675
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,310
Will you know if I smile?

676
00:50:58,779 --> 00:50:59,920
Smile again.

677
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,500
I have no idea.

678
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:16,469
Where are you going?

679
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,399
Where are you going?

680
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,469
Outside.

681
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:23,210
We need to go somewhere open. It's too dangerous here.

682
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,949
Gosh. Why? Do you think I'll do something to you?

683
00:51:28,009 --> 00:51:31,179
No. I'm afraid I'll do something to you.

684
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,019
Like what?

685
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,120
Who knows? Since I don't know who you are.

686
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:39,619
Run away if I do.

687
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,130
Run as hard as you can.

688
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,830
Are you sure it's safer outside?

689
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:50,770
There's nothing dangerous...

690
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:54,069
since nothing there is alive.

691
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:11,690
- What is this place? - My subconscious.

692
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,690
Subconscious?

693
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,730
It's like your ocean.

694
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:38,949
- That was why. - What?

695
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:41,319
You say this is like my ocean.

696
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,389
So this was how you felt.

697
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,130
That was why you were so prickly.

698
00:52:48,529 --> 00:52:51,159
Don't talk gibberish. Just remember.

699
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:53,968
Do you really not know me?

700
00:52:53,969 --> 00:52:55,270
No, I don't.

701
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:58,068
Think before you speak.

702
00:52:58,069 --> 00:53:00,039
Why do I need to think about something like that?

703
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,210
I just know.

704
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:09,009
I don't need to think to know that you're pretty.

705
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,190
Hey.

706
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:18,989
Have you been here before?

707
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,460
Obviously, not.

708
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,359
You should think before you talk.

709
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,460
Why? Do you remember seeing me here?

710
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:34,770
You really must have seen me before.

711
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,710
I have not.

712
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:39,810
- Then why... - I don't know.

713
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:45,020
Seriously. You need to learn how to speak again.

714
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,659
You need to make sense. Talk in longer sentences.

715
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,988
What's the use in reading books all the time?

716
00:53:52,989 --> 00:53:55,529
Hey. Be honest with me.

717
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,500
You don't read, do you? You just hold them, don't you?

718
00:54:01,569 --> 00:54:03,230
There's a line that the author wrote.

719
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,770
"Dying is nothing."

720
00:54:06,299 --> 00:54:09,370
"What is frightening is not living to the fullest."

721
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,309
Are you saying that to me?

722
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,210
No. To myself.

723
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,650
Because I'm nothing.

724
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,650
Because I'm not alive.

725
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,230
There's another famous quote by that author.

726
00:54:28,429 --> 00:54:31,230
"The reduction of the universe to one person,"

727
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,659
"and the expansion of one person to a deity."

728
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,799
"That is love."

729
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:42,770
Remember beautiful things from now on.

730
00:54:43,339 --> 00:54:46,509
Then this place may become...

731
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,679
a little nicer.

732
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:36,359
Why...

733
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:40,259
What is this...

734
00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:49,739
Will you choose to do that?

735
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,850
There's not much time.

736
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,350
You need to make a choice.

737
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,040
I'll do it.

738
00:56:30,279 --> 00:56:31,420
I'll do it.

739
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,540
(Ask the world to end before dying.)

740
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,980
(Doom, person I love the most)

741
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,650
(Doom, person I love the most)

742
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,350
Oh, no.

743
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,319
I must be going crazy.

744
00:59:52,819 --> 00:59:54,190
I must be really sick.

745
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:12,699
(Ms. Soo Ja)

746
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:17,579
- Auntie. - Where are you?

747
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,509
I left something at my house.

748
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,049
I'll be there soon.

749
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,779
Okay.

750
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:38,159
(Human)

751
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,080
Hello?

752
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:34,989
You...

753
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:38,219
How could you...

754
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,330
How could you forget about me?

755
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,029
Right back at you.

756
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,870
Even if I made that decision,

757
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:50,969
you should have recognized me right away.

758
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,799
You should have remembered me.

759
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:55,770
That's my fault?

760
01:01:56,469 --> 01:01:58,080
Who told you to make that decision?

761
01:01:59,509 --> 01:02:02,678
You did whatever you wanted without talking to me.

762
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,119
You know what? Even when you lost your memory,

763
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,980
your nasty temper didn't go away.

764
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,620
Did you find me handsome even when you lost your memory?

765
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,299
(Doom at Your Service)

766
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,239
We can't escape...

767
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:34,339
our fate, right?

768
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:39,239
So we should accept it now.

769
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,880
Will it hurt a lot when I die?

770
01:03:42,409 --> 01:03:46,350
You knew that I would be making this decision, right?

771
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:50,819
I don't know what I will decide.

772
01:03:52,219 --> 01:03:53,389
We should go.

773
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,159
Bye.

774
01:03:56,259 --> 01:03:57,929
I didn't give up yet.

775
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,799
- Help us. - Accept it.

776
01:04:01,969 --> 01:04:03,069
I love you.

777
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,739
Thank you for loving me.
