(All characters, locations, organizations, religions,)

(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:22,604
(Episode 11)

4
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:26,944
Tell me everything.

5
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:37,654
Tell me, Dong Kyung.

6
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:47,894
I want to live.

7
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:51,995
I really...

8
00:00:55,464 --> 00:00:57,534
I really, really want to live.

9
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:03,044
I...

10
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:09,345
I want to live with you, Sun Kyung,

11
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:13,754
my aunt, Ji Na,

12
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:18,554
and everyone else that I love.

13
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:21,065
I really do.

14
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:25,465
I really want...

15
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:28,435
I want to live so badly.

16
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:42,015
Me too.

17
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:44,815
Me too, Dong Kyung.

18
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:55,864
I want to be alive...

19
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,394
so I can...

20
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:05,705
So I can die with you.

21
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:40,005
When Sun Kyung and I were young,

22
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:41,605
he asked me where our parents had gone.

23
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:43,205
I told him that they were up there.

24
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:45,844
But when he asked me why they had left,

25
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:48,114
I had nothing to tell him.

26
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:52,255
So one day, I sat here to no end.

27
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:57,325
When I kept staring at the sky, I realized it.

28
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:01,265
We all go back to where we came from.

29
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:05,894
People say that our bodies come from the stars...

30
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:10,404
because all the energy that make up our bodies is from the stars.

31
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:15,475
So when we go back, deeper and deeper into the past,

32
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:19,015
we basically originate from the same place.

33
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:22,084
We all go back to the same place...

34
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:27,084
and meet there again.

35
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:41,735
So we will never be apart.

36
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:40,395
Hey!

37
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:41,925
Bring Lee Hyun here right now.

38
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:43,165
Make her apologize.

39
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:45,665
Where's Mr. Cha?

40
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:46,764
Mr. Cha!

41
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,335
- Where is he? He should be working. - He's working outside the office.

42
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:50,804
Call him.

43
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:52,434
Gosh.

44
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:59,374
I heard that you made the situation worse.

45
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:01,085
He was about to go and see a plastic surgeon.

46
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:02,384
I barely managed to stop him.

47
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:05,054
- Why did you do that? - Why did I...

48
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:08,954
Hey, our company will go bankrupt with him.

49
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:10,824
If losing a writer would bankrupt the company,

50
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:12,225
the company was bound to fail then.

51
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:13,295
Hey!

52
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,194
"Hey." "You." "That." "This."

53
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:19,264
I told you not to address people like that.

54
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:23,035
Anyway, call Lee Hyun right now.

55
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:25,434
If she can't apologize, pay for the laptop, at least.

56
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,605
Just deduct it from my pay.

57
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:28,645
Your pay?

58
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:31,374
Gosh. You don't even make that much money. It's chicken feed.

59
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,475
So you know that what you pay me is chicken feed.

60
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,785
You think this job is easy because you get paid...

61
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:39,254
every month without doing so much.

62
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:40,884
Go check out the job market.

63
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,824
There's a line of people...

64
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:44,954
who are willing to work for your chicken feed.

65
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,194
Seriously. Kids these days have no love for their company.

66
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:50,324
You should treat the company as yours...

67
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:52,665
and work as if you're running your own business.

68
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:53,965
You should be frugal like you are with your own money.

69
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:56,564
How can I treat it as my company when it's not?

70
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:01,504
You're not successful because of that attitude.

71
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,004
Mr. Cha.

72
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:05,175
Don't you want to be more like me?

73
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:08,215
Do you want to end your life after earning...

74
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:09,545
that chicken feed all your life?

75
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,954
Gosh. I can't put up with this ridiculous job.

76
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:17,895
- What? - I can't put up with this dumb job.

77
00:06:18,324 --> 00:06:20,295
I'm sure you know what I mean by that.

78
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:24,434
I'm quitting.

79
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,165
Deduct the laptop price from my severance pay.

80
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:29,504
My gosh. Your severance pay isn't even that much.

81
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:33,134
Hey. I've lived my life 10 more years than you.

82
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:35,045
I've seen a lot of guys...

83
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:36,744
ruining their lives because of their petty pride.

84
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:38,475
Since you're the team leader here,

85
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:40,145
you must think other companies would hire you.

86
00:06:40,614 --> 00:06:44,314
Listen, young man. The world out there is a tough place.

87
00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:46,585
You have a long way of saying that you're a dinosaur.

88
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:48,554
Hey, Cha Joo Ik.

89
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:52,855
Are you really quitting?

90
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:54,525
What are you going to do with your life then?

91
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,434
Seriously. People might think your dad owns several buildings.

92
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:02,004
What? How did you know that?

93
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:03,364
What?

94
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:07,105
My dad owns buildings.

95
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:08,845
This building, too.

96
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:17,285
Ji Na came here on her school trip.

97
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:18,855
Remember the hotel we passed by on our way here?

98
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,155
That's where she stayed.

99
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:23,655
I was doing my side job to make some pocket money.

100
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:25,425
What was the side job?

101
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:27,665
It was just a job.

102
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,764
It was a way to make memories when I was in school.

103
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,364
Gosh. It was a good side job.

104
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:35,864
I had never seen anyone jump over the wall...

105
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:37,004
as cool as she did.

106
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:39,105
She said that she liked me when we first met.

107
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:41,244
What did she like about you?

108
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,314
She liked me for my bubbly personality.

109
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:47,785
Anyway, we exchanged numbers and stayed in touch.

110
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:50,145
And she told me to apply to her school.

111
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:51,684
But don't you know how smart I am?

112
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,554
And I got into her school just like that.

113
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:58,295
Our food is here.

114
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:01,864
This is great.

115
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:08,235
It looks delicious. Thank you for the food.

116
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:23,314
Look at you eat.

117
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:25,254
Do you know how many times Sun Kyung changed his mind...

118
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,285
on what he wanted to become?

119
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:27,384
One day, he wants to become this.

120
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:28,925
The next day, he wants to become something else.

121
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,355
But you know what's funny? He means it every time.

122
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:34,694
And in the end, I'm the one who deals with it.

123
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:38,165
Sun Kyung would go to internet cafes after telling me he's off to study.

124
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:40,365
My job was to go around looking for him.

125
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:43,265
It's like everyone in your family either chases or gets chased.

126
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:45,804
The one getting chased always ends up getting caught.

127
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:47,875
You saw how my aunt caught me by my collar, right?

128
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,104
As for me, I used to drag Sun Kyung by his ear.

129
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:59,314
Hello!

130
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:02,354
Hi.

131
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:12,265
What?

132
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:13,795
It's nothing.

133
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:18,734
When my aunt and uncle were dating,

134
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:21,275
they ran into Sun Kyung on a path like this.

135
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,304
Sun Kyung called me that day...

136
00:09:23,304 --> 00:09:26,214
and cried his eyes out saying we lost our aunt forever.

137
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:28,415
So do you know what I did?

138
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:30,684
I looked for a job.

139
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:32,984
I figured I should hurry up and start making money...

140
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:35,324
in order to help my aunt get married quickly.

141
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,785
I started working at the publishing company...

142
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:37,895
because they called me first.

143
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:39,594
But I had no idea I'd end up working there for so long.

144
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:41,495
What does your earning money...

145
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:42,995
have anything to do with your aunt getting married?

146
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:45,334
I had to have the ability to earn money...

147
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,934
so my aunt would feel at ease and live her own life...

148
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:49,604
thinking I was all grown up.

149
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:52,834
Otherwise, she would've spent her entire life looking after us.

150
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:56,645
So tell me. Are you all grown up?

151
00:10:17,224 --> 00:10:20,365
No, I'm still growing up.

152
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:45,724
I'm no longer alone.

153
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:14,655
I once saw a dolphin here.

154
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:19,255
Later on, I found out it was an Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin.

155
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:22,495
They're an endangered species. Isn't that sad?

156
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,594
I can't say that's not my fault,

157
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:29,165
but you humans need to work on it too.

158
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:33,074
Yes, you're right. It's our fault.

159
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,844
But for your information, I wasn't blaming you.

160
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,545
Why are you laughing?

161
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:40,574
Because I find it funny.

162
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,515
What's so funny?

163
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:44,454
You.

164
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,184
What's so funny about me?

165
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:51,194
What's funny about me?

166
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:01,464
We're heading somewhere together.

167
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:07,074
As we sympathize with and love each other.

168
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:08,875
We're in this together.

169
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:31,064
Is something bothering you?

170
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:09,035
How about a bet?

171
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:12,734
The winner gets to ask for whatever he wants from the other person.

172
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,645
- What do you want? - Your car.

173
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:19,974
Or...

174
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,184
maybe something else.

175
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:27,015
Sure. Let's do it.

176
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:10,564
Tell me.

177
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:12,464
What do you want?

178
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,505
I'll save it.

179
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:18,175
I'll tell you once there's something I want.

180
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:21,604
Why? Don't you want anything from me yet?

181
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:52,905
You asked for my car, right?

182
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:57,545
You can have it.

183
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:03,045
Don't give it to me like you're being nice.

184
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:07,785
I'm going to win it.

185
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:27,505
I'll save it.

186
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,245
I'll tell you once there's something I want.

187
00:15:33,574 --> 00:15:34,645
Welcome...

188
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,025
Let's go on a date.

189
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:47,425
- What? - Let's go on three dates.

190
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:50,464
I want to know if these are just lingering feelings...

191
00:15:50,464 --> 00:15:51,594
or if I actually still like you.

192
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:54,064
Let's decide after three dates.

193
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:00,604
- Sure. - Don't ever call me first.

194
00:16:00,604 --> 00:16:02,145
And don't visit without calling.

195
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:03,844
Okay.

196
00:16:04,145 --> 00:16:06,115
I'll be the one to call, so wait until I do.

197
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:08,184
Okay, I will.

198
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:11,354
- It might take some time. - I'll still wait.

199
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:13,515
I'm going to go now.

200
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:19,954
I'm going to wait, okay?

201
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:37,804
- Hello? - I just asked Hyun Kyu...

202
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:39,675
to go on a date with me.

203
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:04,135
Let's cancel our contract.

204
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:07,305
Don't worry. You won't have to pay a penalty.

205
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:09,774
I'm guessing you won't want to see me again.

206
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:13,075
You won't ever see me again because of work.

207
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:15,345
No.

208
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:19,055
Why?

209
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:20,885
Because I want my novel to fall into the top 10.

210
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:23,355
Is that the only reason?

211
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:26,694
Yes.

212
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,494
Then either email me or text me.

213
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,004
If you break our contract,

214
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:40,504
I'm going to tell Hyun Kyu that you kissed me.

215
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:43,204
- Can you really do that? - Do you think I won't be able to?

216
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:45,415
I don't think you can.

217
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:49,345
If you can, go ahead and tell him.

218
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:54,184
Seriously.

219
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:56,325
He's so annoying.

220
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:13,274
Make sure you don't get exposed to these elements.

221
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:28,625
What is it?

222
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:31,524
What?

223
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:35,264
I'm coming. Fine. I'll be right there.

224
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:47,135
My aunt left my place as is.

225
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:49,305
She says I need a place to return to.

226
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,014
I didn't know I'd end up coming here with you though.

227
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,764
I have a wish.

228
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:13,934
A wish?

229
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:17,464
- My birthday wish. - That's...

230
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:20,434
Not the one I made then. Something else.

231
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:26,214
- Forgive me. - For what?

232
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:39,224
I told them that you were here.

233
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:43,524
I thought they'd worry.

234
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:45,095
Dong Kyung!

235
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:48,365
What? Let go!

236
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:51,805
Darn it.

237
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:58,315
Auntie.

238
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:19,895
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

239
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:50,523
I asked you out here because I wanted to talk to you.

240
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:53,994
I think I must be a real coward.

241
00:20:54,664 --> 00:20:57,194
Jeju is beautiful. Look at the sea.

242
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:01,634
I couldn't even run away for real.

243
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:03,634
All I did was hurt everyone.

244
00:21:05,204 --> 00:21:06,674
This is where I got my family.

245
00:21:09,374 --> 00:21:11,644
I don't know what to do.

246
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,613
If I live, he dies.

247
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:17,414
If I save him, we all die.

248
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:19,984
What should I do?

249
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:22,724
What do I do?

250
00:21:23,853 --> 00:21:24,964
"What do I do?"

251
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:28,494
Don't worry. We're family.

252
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,863
I want you to think of me as family and lean on me.

253
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:34,833
- Family? - Yes, family.

254
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:36,833
I know how you feel.

255
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:39,404
Let me do my best to find a great hospital.

256
00:21:40,573 --> 00:21:43,813
The best option was for me to die by myself.

257
00:21:44,674 --> 00:21:46,984
That was why I came here.

258
00:21:48,184 --> 00:21:50,613
But I can't not love, Kevin.

259
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:51,884
I love you too, Dong Kyung.

260
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:55,194
I love everything Soo loves.

261
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:58,363
Just hang in there. Everything is going to be better.

262
00:21:59,964 --> 00:22:00,994
Love.

263
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:04,194
Yes. That's what scares me.

264
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:08,434
My love is too burdensome.

265
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:09,803
You're welcome.

266
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:11,674
Family doesn't have to say, "Thank you."

267
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:12,843
"I love you" is enough.

268
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:37,664
Doctor.

269
00:22:39,134 --> 00:22:42,833
Would you get me the onions from those groceries over there?

270
00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:55,613
Wash them over here.

271
00:23:08,164 --> 00:23:09,234
Thank you...

272
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:11,593
for telling me.

273
00:23:12,164 --> 00:23:13,464
I thought you'd worry.

274
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:15,974
Dong Kyung was worried too.

275
00:23:18,674 --> 00:23:20,704
- She was? - All day long,

276
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:24,043
she talked about her aunt, brother, and Ji Na.

277
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:31,353
Know something? My motto in life is "Go all in."

278
00:23:34,323 --> 00:23:35,853
Only our faces were the same.

279
00:23:36,654 --> 00:23:38,763
My sister and I had opposite personalities.

280
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:43,793
It was like she gave me all the bad temper.

281
00:23:45,363 --> 00:23:48,134
She was calm and soft.

282
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,303
When I heard that she had died,

283
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:56,874
I felt like I lost half of me.

284
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:01,113
My other half left them to me.

285
00:24:01,113 --> 00:24:02,654
How could I not go all in?

286
00:24:04,214 --> 00:24:06,384
Naturally, I lived for them.

287
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:10,323
But she...

288
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:14,124
Dong Kyung was like that ever since she was a child.

289
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:16,734
She won't tell me if she's struggling.

290
00:24:17,363 --> 00:24:19,003
She always went somewhere and hid.

291
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,934
Then I'd have to go look for her.

292
00:24:24,634 --> 00:24:27,704
Whenever I found her, she was sitting by the sea.

293
00:24:28,073 --> 00:24:29,244
It was heartbreaking.

294
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:33,214
She acted like she had no home.

295
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:43,694
I guess she has a home now.

296
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:51,293
Given how she came back here.

297
00:25:19,224 --> 00:25:21,263
I'm glad she doesn't look like she's in pain.

298
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,234
Her heart is the problem, not her body.

299
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:25,664
Keep a close eye on her.

300
00:25:26,164 --> 00:25:28,303
You know how good she is at pretending to be okay.

301
00:25:29,103 --> 00:25:31,303
Why is she so good at pretending to be fine?

302
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,303
That was her all her life.

303
00:25:35,414 --> 00:25:37,144
She hates being a burden on other people,

304
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:38,343
so she's always anxious.

305
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:41,043
That must be why she came here.

306
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:42,654
So she wouldn't burden us.

307
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:50,323
Stop crying.

308
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:54,194
I'm not crying. The wind is cold, that's why.

309
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:56,894
I tear up when the wind is cold.

310
00:25:58,033 --> 00:25:59,303
I was born this way.

311
00:26:08,674 --> 00:26:09,714
Hello, Mr. Lee.

312
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:13,013
Yes, I saw my sister.

313
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:16,454
I'm sorry for calling out all of a sudden.

314
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:19,724
The beans?

315
00:26:20,654 --> 00:26:22,124
They're arriving in the morning.

316
00:26:23,323 --> 00:26:25,624
Yes. Good night, boss.

317
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:28,964
Boss? Do you have a job?

318
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:31,134
Yes, at a cafe.

319
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:32,164
A cafe?

320
00:26:32,964 --> 00:26:34,833
Every schmo has a cafe nowadays.

321
00:26:35,603 --> 00:26:38,103
It's always about a guy when you get angry like this.

322
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:41,904
Remember that guy I said I would kill?

323
00:26:42,444 --> 00:26:43,944
I saw him again recently.

324
00:26:44,214 --> 00:26:45,313
He owns a cafe.

325
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:47,684
I'm so jealous. I want to run a cafe too.

326
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:49,753
- He wants to get back together. - Oh my gosh.

327
00:26:49,753 --> 00:26:51,353
- So I said okay. - Oh my gosh.

328
00:26:51,954 --> 00:26:53,384
I'm so annoyed.

329
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:55,053
I wanted to kill him,

330
00:26:55,053 --> 00:26:57,753
but when I saw his smile, my heart just melted.

331
00:26:58,664 --> 00:26:59,793
That's good.

332
00:26:59,793 --> 00:27:00,994
Rage is never good for you.

333
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,263
But the problem is...

334
00:27:02,263 --> 00:27:04,563
there's another guy I want to kill.

335
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,634
- Another guy? - And they know each other.

336
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:10,134
They even live together, but he didn't tell me.

337
00:27:10,134 --> 00:27:11,734
He was totally toying with me, right?

338
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,073
Gosh, that's confusing.

339
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:16,813
So you decided to date the guy you originally wanted to kill.

340
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:19,283
And then, there's another guy you want to kill. Is that it?

341
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:20,313
Yes.

342
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:23,184
What? Does it mean you like the guy?

343
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,484
- Which guy? - The second guy.

344
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:27,454
No. I decided to date the first guy.

345
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:30,394
Why are you dating the 1st guy when you like the 2nd guy?

346
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:33,494
You're so stupid. You got low scores on language art, right?

347
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:35,763
What are you talking about? You're the fool here.

348
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:38,063
When you like someone, you say you want to kill that guy.

349
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:45,234
You wanted to kill the first guy. That's in the past tense.

350
00:27:45,234 --> 00:27:48,444
You want to kill the second guy now. That's the present tense.

351
00:27:49,714 --> 00:27:50,714
Gosh.

352
00:27:53,043 --> 00:27:55,283
Stop talking nonsense. And bring the side dishes.

353
00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:04,823
Why isn't this coming off?

354
00:29:31,273 --> 00:29:32,944
Hey. It's snowing!

355
00:29:44,154 --> 00:29:45,323
It's snowing!

356
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:47,563
It's so beautiful.

357
00:29:48,124 --> 00:29:49,333
Do you want to make a snowman?

358
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,363
Let's make a snowman. I want to make a snowman!

359
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:25,033
I ran away to this place because I wanted to leave everyone.

360
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:27,363
But it turned out I wasn't running away.

361
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:31,003
I thought I ran away from you guys, but once I got here,

362
00:30:31,734 --> 00:30:33,974
I had everything I loved right here.

363
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:35,914
So...

364
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:40,013
I really missed all of you.

365
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:43,553
You need the experience to run away from your family.

366
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:45,853
You always live your life,

367
00:30:45,853 --> 00:30:48,484
ready to tackle the world. You're never going to be that type.

368
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,853
I can't run away with you.

369
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:55,664
But I'll always be on your side when you're tackling the world.

370
00:30:59,063 --> 00:31:00,803
By the way, this place looks amazing.

371
00:31:01,063 --> 00:31:03,073
I don't remember the last time I'd been on Jeju Island.

372
00:31:03,974 --> 00:31:07,003
There's no one here because it's a weekday. I love it here.

373
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:10,813
This is why people love to be freelancers or unemployed.

374
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,244
Let's continue our friendship until our hair turns gray...

375
00:31:13,244 --> 00:31:15,984
and travel around the world when other people are working.

376
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:17,783
What? Are you telling me I should be unemployed...

377
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:18,984
for the rest of my life?

378
00:31:18,984 --> 00:31:20,484
Just spend money like water.

379
00:31:20,484 --> 00:31:22,083
I'll make money like a slave.

380
00:31:26,823 --> 00:31:27,924
Take out your phone.

381
00:31:28,323 --> 00:31:30,263
The weather is amazing. Let's take a photo.

382
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:31,734
Sure.

383
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:36,874
All right. You can take the photo.

384
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:43,144
Let me see.

385
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:47,444
By the way, what happened the other day?

386
00:31:47,813 --> 00:31:49,714
What do you mean?

387
00:31:49,714 --> 00:31:51,313
You left after getting a call.

388
00:31:52,323 --> 00:31:54,224
Oh, that? It's nothing.

389
00:31:54,224 --> 00:31:56,654
I cursed him out, broke the laptop, and scared him a bit.

390
00:31:56,994 --> 00:31:58,023
What?

391
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:01,263
That jerk, Jijo King, accused me of plagiarizing his stuff.

392
00:32:01,263 --> 00:32:02,333
What?

393
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:05,363
It's fine. I handled it.

394
00:32:09,674 --> 00:32:11,934
By the way, the laptop was Mr. Cha's.

395
00:32:14,603 --> 00:32:15,613
Ji Na.

396
00:32:17,313 --> 00:32:19,244
Do you like Mr. Cha?

397
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:20,783
What?

398
00:32:21,184 --> 00:32:23,783
Do you think I'm crazy? I'm dating Lee Hyun Kyu again.

399
00:32:23,783 --> 00:32:25,853
What? Lee Hyun Kyu? The Lee Hyun Kyu I know?

400
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:26,954
Do you know what's crazier?

401
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:28,583
He works at the cafe on the first floor of your company building.

402
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,224
Who knew he would be so close?

403
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:34,863
Are you talking about the handsome cafe owner?

404
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:38,333
The guy who could be in movies and whose smile lights up the room?

405
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:41,204
I guess he is handsome.

406
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:44,103
Ji Na, how are you going to fix this?

407
00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:45,904
You like Mr. Cha.

408
00:32:45,904 --> 00:32:47,503
No, I don't!

409
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:53,283
It's obvious!

410
00:32:57,984 --> 00:32:59,283
Goodness.

411
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:58,613
Are you going somewhere?

412
00:33:59,343 --> 00:34:01,244
- I'll see you inside. - Okay.

413
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:04,783
I'll be back.

414
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:06,653
Where are you going?

415
00:34:08,084 --> 00:34:09,193
The hospital.

416
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:13,093
Something happened to her, right?

417
00:34:14,024 --> 00:34:16,633
I won't take long. I'll be back soon. Wait for me.

418
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:18,064
Let me go with you.

419
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:19,704
No. You should go first.

420
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:22,704
I'll leave right after you. I'll be with you.

421
00:34:56,403 --> 00:34:57,474
You're here.

422
00:34:58,334 --> 00:34:59,604
Why didn't you tell me?

423
00:35:00,144 --> 00:35:01,204
I'm okay.

424
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:05,013
Everything is predetermined.

425
00:35:06,943 --> 00:35:09,713
I remembered why I didn't want to be in love.

426
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:13,383
Love brings pain.

427
00:35:14,854 --> 00:35:16,653
When your loved ones are gone,

428
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:19,294
the pain is unbearable.

429
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:23,963
Creations by humans are indeed great.

430
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:26,633
Sins and love...

431
00:35:27,463 --> 00:35:29,604
always turn the world upside down.

432
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:36,113
I shouldn't have fallen in love with anyone.

433
00:35:43,013 --> 00:35:46,153
It's okay. Everything is okay.

434
00:35:48,724 --> 00:35:51,394
I will be born again.

435
00:35:53,624 --> 00:35:55,093
What should I do?

436
00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:56,934
I'm sure you know.

437
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,633
Don't pretend to be clueless. Just tell me.

438
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:03,303
Deities are meant to live for humanity.

439
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:07,204
That's the purpose behind their birth.

440
00:36:08,244 --> 00:36:10,244
They live for the people...

441
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:12,783
and leave the world for the people.

442
00:36:14,814 --> 00:36:16,084
That's our duty.

443
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:13,774
What are you doing?

444
00:37:14,903 --> 00:37:15,943
Consoling you.

445
00:37:17,274 --> 00:37:18,914
Just like how you consoled me.

446
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:40,263
Is it bad?

447
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:43,934
She doesn't have much time left.

448
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:47,544
It's okay.

449
00:37:48,274 --> 00:37:49,673
This always happened.

450
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:53,684
Really? What do you want for dinner?

451
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:55,644
Your dad's calling.

452
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,564
- Sweetheart! - Mom!

453
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:11,564
Oh, dear.

454
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,803
Thank you. Thank you.

455
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,394
Are you...

456
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,633
- allowed to do that kind of stuff? - No.

457
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:47,363
What?

458
00:38:47,363 --> 00:38:49,033
I'm not allowed, but I couldn't help it...

459
00:38:49,903 --> 00:38:51,403
because you were watching.

460
00:38:56,173 --> 00:38:58,443
Sometimes, I find myself portraying you in things.

461
00:39:00,314 --> 00:39:03,283
Now that I love you, I sometimes find myself...

462
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,423
pitying humans...

463
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:08,653
and loving them.

464
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:12,423
I think I finally understand...

465
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,823
why she loves humans so much.

466
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:46,763
(Incoming call, Unknown Number)

467
00:39:49,164 --> 00:39:51,664
- Hello? - You're finally picking up.

468
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:53,704
Dong Kyung, where are you right now?

469
00:39:54,403 --> 00:39:55,533
Mr. Park?

470
00:39:56,004 --> 00:39:57,474
I want you at the office right now.

471
00:39:57,474 --> 00:40:00,244
If you don't come, I'm going to sue Lee Hyun.

472
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:06,613
Should I keep up what I've been doing?

473
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:09,084
- Just say the word. - No.

474
00:40:09,883 --> 00:40:11,084
This one's mine.

475
00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:13,254
I'll deal with him myself.

476
00:40:27,763 --> 00:40:28,863
Follow me.

477
00:40:45,483 --> 00:40:47,224
Can you help me just this once?

478
00:40:47,224 --> 00:40:48,354
What are you doing?

479
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:49,624
Get off me.

480
00:40:49,624 --> 00:40:51,294
Please. I'm dying here.

481
00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:54,394
Will you please let go first?

482
00:40:55,224 --> 00:40:58,193
I mean, now that you and Mr. Cha are both gone,

483
00:40:58,193 --> 00:41:01,204
none of the writers are willing to renew their contracts.

484
00:41:01,204 --> 00:41:02,874
This is really killing me.

485
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:05,033
Why are you asking me for help?

486
00:41:06,104 --> 00:41:07,303
This is all your fault.

487
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:10,443
You must've really convinced all those writers...

488
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:13,144
What? What did you just say?

489
00:41:13,983 --> 00:41:15,013
No, I mean...

490
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:18,483
You must've worked really hard...

491
00:41:18,483 --> 00:41:19,783
seeing that they're all acting that way.

492
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:21,653
No one wants to work with a bad guy.

493
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,153
It's like that wherever you go.

494
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:26,053
- I bet the writers have had enough. - Of course.

495
00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:27,963
I wasn't able to take your side that day...

496
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:29,494
because I was too flustered.

497
00:41:29,494 --> 00:41:31,763
But I was always on your side.

498
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:33,133
It's so nice to see you again.

499
00:41:33,604 --> 00:41:35,204
How's your health?

500
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:36,403
Is everything okay?

501
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:39,874
I knew he'd get himself in trouble one day.

502
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:42,403
This is how hard it is to make a living, Dong Kyung.

503
00:41:42,943 --> 00:41:44,414
There are people I need to take care of...

504
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:46,244
regardless of how much I hate him.

505
00:41:46,244 --> 00:41:48,443
You have no idea how hard it is for me to humor him.

506
00:41:50,153 --> 00:41:52,383
Think of those guys out there.

507
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:54,883
At this rate, I won't even be able to give them their monthly pay.

508
00:41:54,883 --> 00:41:57,423
If my company goes bankrupt, the same will happen to them.

509
00:41:57,423 --> 00:42:00,064
They're still young. Don't try to ruin their lives, too.

510
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:01,693
You're right. I'm the bad guy.

511
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:02,863
Dong Kyung. Dong Kyung.

512
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:04,263
- My gosh. - Okay.

513
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:08,604
I'm begging you. Please do me a favor.

514
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:11,974
Please meet up with Mr. Cha.

515
00:42:11,974 --> 00:42:15,044
Meet up with him just this once and try to convince him.

516
00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:16,814
I get that you can't work here anymore...

517
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:18,013
because of your health.

518
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:19,684
But that's not the case for Mr. Cha.

519
00:42:21,783 --> 00:42:23,383
If you refuse to cooperate,

520
00:42:23,383 --> 00:42:25,254
I'll have no choice but to sue Lee Hyun.

521
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:27,124
Sue her for what?

522
00:42:27,124 --> 00:42:28,684
For damaging our property and obstructing our business.

523
00:42:28,684 --> 00:42:29,954
You know I'm a man who keeps his word, right?

524
00:42:29,954 --> 00:42:30,954
I mean, how...

525
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:33,064
How do you expect me...

526
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:34,524
to meet a guy who quit?

527
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:35,564
Mr. Cha...

528
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:42,504
Mr. Cha has always been near us.

529
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:44,434
What?

530
00:42:44,874 --> 00:42:47,544
Up there. That's where he lives.

531
00:42:47,803 --> 00:42:48,943
Mr. Cha...

532
00:42:50,274 --> 00:42:51,814
is the landlord's son.

533
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:57,483
Can I have some money?

534
00:42:58,354 --> 00:43:00,254
Money? Why?

535
00:43:00,254 --> 00:43:02,184
I got myself in trouble. I need to deal with it.

536
00:43:06,363 --> 00:43:08,263
I didn't buy new golf clubs to beat you with them.

537
00:43:08,263 --> 00:43:09,633
I'll pay you back once I succeed.

538
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:11,294
How are you going to succeed?

539
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:14,403
How much are you asking for?

540
00:43:16,204 --> 00:43:17,474
I'm going to start a company.

541
00:43:17,474 --> 00:43:19,274
Why would you start a company?

542
00:43:19,533 --> 00:43:21,504
Then who's going to take care of that building?

543
00:43:21,504 --> 00:43:23,573
I'll continue to take care of it.

544
00:43:23,774 --> 00:43:24,874
The company will be like a hobby for me.

545
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:27,244
You punk. Who starts a company for fun?

546
00:43:27,244 --> 00:43:29,213
It won't be as expensive as your hobby,

547
00:43:29,383 --> 00:43:30,513
and it'll surely make more money.

548
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:32,454
You never lose an argument.

549
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:35,923
How much are you going to pay in interest?

550
00:43:35,923 --> 00:43:37,854
Why would you ask your own son for interest?

551
00:43:37,854 --> 00:43:39,724
Then ask the bank for money.

552
00:43:39,923 --> 00:43:41,263
Okay, fine.

553
00:43:41,263 --> 00:43:43,934
I'll pay you enough interest.

554
00:43:44,363 --> 00:43:45,693
Now we're talking.

555
00:43:48,434 --> 00:43:50,604
If only you were as good of a businessman as Hyun Kyu...

556
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:54,004
By the way, why did he behave like that on that day?

557
00:43:54,303 --> 00:43:56,044
- What day? - The day he suddenly...

558
00:43:56,044 --> 00:43:58,173
hugged me and called me "Dad".

559
00:43:58,374 --> 00:44:00,843
Oh, he did it to protect me.

560
00:44:01,084 --> 00:44:02,084
My gosh.

561
00:44:03,483 --> 00:44:05,053
Having taken care of him must be paying off.

562
00:44:05,783 --> 00:44:07,653
I shouldn't have taken such good care of him

563
00:44:07,653 --> 00:44:08,684
Why?

564
00:44:08,684 --> 00:44:10,894
Is he rude to you now that he's all grown up?

565
00:44:11,294 --> 00:44:12,294
Well...

566
00:44:13,593 --> 00:44:14,763
He doesn't make things easy.

567
00:44:16,593 --> 00:44:19,033
That means he's ready to compete with you.

568
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:23,474
Go ahead.

569
00:44:25,334 --> 00:44:28,144
(Tak Dong Kyung)

570
00:44:35,684 --> 00:44:36,754
Welcome.

571
00:44:38,914 --> 00:44:40,084
Unbelievable.

572
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,821
So this is why you always came to work early...

573
00:45:01,821 --> 00:45:03,861
and went home late.

574
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,330
Are you talking to yourself, or are you omitting honorifics now?

575
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,330
I must say, this is a scary world.

576
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:15,040
I guess I really can't trust anyone.

577
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,310
This time, I can tell you're just omitting honorifics.

578
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:20,741
Are you really the landlord?

579
00:45:20,741 --> 00:45:22,310
No, not me. My dad is.

580
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:27,321
Then is the sports car parked in the basement...

581
00:45:27,321 --> 00:45:29,250
- also yours? - Yes.

582
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,920
Does your father own buildings other than this one?

583
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,431
Yes.

584
00:45:38,091 --> 00:45:39,361
This is the smallest one.

585
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,100
My brother and dad manage the rest.

586
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:43,600
If you're the landlord's son,

587
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,571
why did you work for a company that pays so little?

588
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:47,040
Because it was close to home.

589
00:45:48,971 --> 00:45:50,270
How clever.

590
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,181
Why did you quit in the first place?

591
00:45:56,111 --> 00:45:58,781
The same reason as yours. I couldn't take it.

592
00:45:59,151 --> 00:46:00,420
You've been good at taking it.

593
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,920
You're right.

594
00:46:05,051 --> 00:46:06,491
But I can't these days.

595
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:10,230
Why not? Because Mr. Park criticized Ji Na?

596
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,361
She told me everything.

597
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,201
I doubt she told you everything.

598
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,500
I guess there really was something as I suspected.

599
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,640
I guess she told you enough for you to suspect it.

600
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,611
So? What do you plan to do?

601
00:46:24,611 --> 00:46:25,770
I'm going to start a company.

602
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,480
That's why I wanted to see you.

603
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:32,111
Recover quickly.

604
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,580
I'll make you a team leader if you come to me.

605
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,551
That wasn't my question.

606
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,361
Forget it.

607
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:48,500
Furthermore, I'm going to demand an insanely high salary.

608
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,830
I'll just give you a higher title. How about director?

609
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,000
No, thanks. I want a high salary.

610
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,140
What's your current salary?

611
00:46:57,071 --> 00:46:59,870
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

612
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,440
You had your reasons.

613
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,881
I'll work even harder.

614
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,381
Is your sister doing better?

615
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,781
No.

616
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:10,951
But she will.

617
00:47:11,821 --> 00:47:12,890
I'm sure.

618
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,661
Sis.

619
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,301
Are you Sun Kyung's sister?

620
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,770
I saw you several times before.

621
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,870
Why are you here? Did you come to see me?

622
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,801
I'm working hard.

623
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:31,511
He's a very good worker.

624
00:47:31,511 --> 00:47:32,940
He works hard and...

625
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,580
It's fine. I was just passing by and dropped in.

626
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,611
I was just passing by.

627
00:47:38,611 --> 00:47:41,520
Okay. Would you like some coffee? On the house.

628
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,651
Sure. Yes, please. Thank you.

629
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,761
Why didn't I realize?

630
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:52,830
Pardon?

631
00:47:53,361 --> 00:47:54,600
What? Nothing.

632
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,201
I was wondering why I didn't realize...

633
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:01,000
how nice this cafe was.

634
00:48:03,201 --> 00:48:04,241
What is it?

635
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:09,040
Here's your coffee. You like iced Americano, right?

636
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,151
You always got that.

637
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,810
You have a good memory.

638
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,321
Oh my.

639
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:20,120
Coffee made by people who studied abroad tastes different.

640
00:48:20,591 --> 00:48:24,261
How did you know I studied abroad?

641
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,801
It smelled. I smell a runaway.

642
00:48:28,261 --> 00:48:30,531
Oh dear. My mistake.

643
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:31,870
The coffee scents.

644
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,100
What's wrong with you?

645
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:36,241
Do you feel sick? Do you need a doctor?

646
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,471
Are you confusing your words?

647
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:40,310
I'm not sick. I'm fine.

648
00:48:40,911 --> 00:48:43,080
The coffee woke me right up.

649
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,651
I heard that you used to swim.

650
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,321
Where did you hear about that?

651
00:48:50,551 --> 00:48:52,991
Just from people who heard from people.

652
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:57,131
It wasn't me. I didn't tell her.

653
00:48:57,861 --> 00:49:01,000
If you swim, are you good at submerging too?

654
00:49:02,361 --> 00:49:05,500
Well... It's probably easier for me than regular people.

655
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:07,500
It's easier.

656
00:49:08,241 --> 00:49:11,210
That must be why it's easy for you to submerge and disappear.

657
00:49:12,011 --> 00:49:13,040
Pardon?

658
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:14,480
What do you think...

659
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,810
about people who ghost girlfriends to break up with them?

660
00:49:18,651 --> 00:49:19,980
I think...

661
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,551
they are cowards...

662
00:49:23,651 --> 00:49:26,091
Right? It's totally cowardly, isn't it?

663
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,790
Why do people do something so cowardly?

664
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,230
What's wrong with you?

665
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,161
Did Myul Mang ghost you?

666
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:35,661
No.

667
00:49:38,971 --> 00:49:42,440
I was just passing by...

668
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,040
and dropped in,

669
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:45,640
so I'll go now.

670
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:47,810
What's wrong with you?

671
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:49,411
Why did you come?

672
00:49:49,411 --> 00:49:51,580
Are you leaving? I'll see you again.

673
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,520
What's wrong with her?

674
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:03,321
Your sister seems fine.

675
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,330
Sure.

676
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,301
Ji Na. All you care about is looks.

677
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,850
I am stopping the series for personal reasons.

678
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:29,821
I'd like to thank all the viewers who read my story, flaws and all.

679
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,721
I'll see you again with a new story.

680
00:50:33,451 --> 00:50:34,920
(Notice of Termination of Series)

681
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,301
I read all of your novels.

682
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:43,131
And you need one thing.

683
00:50:43,631 --> 00:50:44,701
A new male character.

684
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,701
A new male character.

685
00:51:04,591 --> 00:51:05,721
(Who said)

686
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:08,920
Who said first loves never work out?

687
00:51:10,261 --> 00:51:12,290
Ji Woo was overcome with the desire...

688
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:14,531
to find the person who said that and kill him.

689
00:51:15,801 --> 00:51:19,301
Although it wasn't his fault that her love failed,

690
00:51:19,531 --> 00:51:21,140
that was what she wanted to do.

691
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,011
Because she couldn't kill her first love.

692
00:51:26,241 --> 00:51:27,381
But then again,

693
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:30,181
she may not have the energy to kill him even if she met him.

694
00:51:31,411 --> 00:51:33,980
Ji Woo was sitting, crying, in front of her first love's home...

695
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,350
for three hours.

696
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:38,221
(For three hours)

697
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:39,290
I can't.

698
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,031
"What?" The unfamiliar voice made her look up,

699
00:51:44,431 --> 00:51:46,960
and a man with an equally unfamiliar face...

700
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,361
was standing in front of her.

701
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,631
The man that she saw with her blurred vision...

702
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:53,431
distorted by the rain and tears...

703
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:57,710
showed no emotion on his face and simply looked down at her.

704
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,881
I can't go in if you sit there like that.

705
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:05,850
Her first kiss with the man she first met...

706
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,281
tasted like a rain shower.

707
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,091
Ji Woo knew right then and there.

708
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:16,190
"I won't be able"...

709
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,631
"to avoid him"...

710
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:21,431
"or loving him."

711
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,350
Yes, I'm almost home.

712
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,750
Are you home?

713
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:43,991
No.

714
00:52:44,551 --> 00:52:48,190
I was able to hold back and didn't commit murder.

715
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:52,931
My aunt?

716
00:52:53,431 --> 00:52:56,531
She said she had to go somewhere, so she isn't coming over.

717
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,940
Really?

718
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:14,151
Seriously.

719
00:53:21,821 --> 00:53:24,531
This reminds me of old times.

720
00:53:25,131 --> 00:53:26,230
It wasn't that long ago.

721
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,161
It was quite recent.

722
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:33,471
Your problem is that you nitpick about everything I say.

723
00:53:33,471 --> 00:53:35,401
You are such a mood killer.

724
00:53:35,801 --> 00:53:38,341
I'm not nitpicking. I'm pointing out the truth.

725
00:53:40,611 --> 00:53:43,511
You haven't changed. Not at all.

726
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,080
You were a real jerk back then too.

727
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,951
Why was I a jerk?

728
00:53:48,951 --> 00:53:50,651
For a bunch of reasons.

729
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:53,651
But you were cute every once in a while.

730
00:53:55,321 --> 00:53:57,591
Cute? Me?

731
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:02,531
I know you turned off the lights for me that night.

732
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,551
I always thought...

733
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,960
the darkness was scary and frightening.

734
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:29,690
But for the first time,

735
00:54:30,261 --> 00:54:33,261
I realized that sometimes, kindness and consideration...

736
00:54:33,261 --> 00:54:35,230
are dark.

737
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,330
You're wrong.

738
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,600
I turned them off because I liked the dark.

739
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,670
Hey. I said to stop killing the mood.

740
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,020
You're not even reading.

741
00:54:58,491 --> 00:54:59,951
I flipped the page.

742
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:01,120
You're not reading, are you?

743
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,991
Want one?

744
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:06,960
I don't eat.

745
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:10,830
You pretend to though.

746
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:12,770
- Want me to play along? - Yes.

747
00:55:14,471 --> 00:55:16,540
There's no one by that name.

748
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,940
That can't be.

749
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:22,681
I met with that doctor just a few days ago.

750
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:27,321
This is the list of neurosurgeons...

751
00:55:27,321 --> 00:55:28,750
at our hospital.

752
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:31,850
Why isn't he on this list?

753
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:34,361
I'm positive.

754
00:55:34,361 --> 00:55:36,960
My niece and I met with Dr. Lee Yoon Ho.

755
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:41,531
He said she was on the list of patients for the new drug.

756
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,330
You seem to be mistaken.

757
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:47,170
Why don't you talk to your niece?

758
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,301
That can't be.

759
00:55:49,301 --> 00:55:51,870
I'm positive I spoke with him.

760
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,040
Soo, what's wrong?

761
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,540
I apologize.

762
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,080
Right now, there's nothing I can do for you.

763
00:55:58,451 --> 00:55:59,551
What...

764
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:03,321
What?

765
00:56:03,821 --> 00:56:05,221
That's not possible.

766
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,290
I definitely talked to him.

767
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:08,460
Why isn't he here?

768
00:56:11,031 --> 00:56:13,890
Kevin, something is off.

769
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,631
I definitely...

770
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,131
I definitely saw him and talked to him here.

771
00:56:20,131 --> 00:56:21,241
But how...

772
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:25,210
My gosh. That ghost must have been sighted again.

773
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,080
Excuse me?

774
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,480
There's a ghost roaming around this hospital.

775
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:33,681
- A ghost? - Yes.

776
00:56:34,051 --> 00:56:35,881
This rumor has been going around for several years.

777
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:38,451
A lot of people had seen that doctor.

778
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,920
My guess is that people here are exhausted,

779
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,560
so it's easier to get bewitched by the ghost.

780
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:45,261
You should look for another hospital.

781
00:56:45,261 --> 00:56:46,531
But I have no choice now.

782
00:56:47,091 --> 00:56:48,830
What are you talking about? A ghost?

783
00:56:50,261 --> 00:56:52,000
That's ridiculous.

784
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,901
If that's not it, you must've been conned.

785
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,770
So if you're the one who's been deceived,

786
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,640
those two must have been in on it together.

787
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,710
But you said she's your niece.

788
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:03,640
Why would she want to deceive you?

789
00:57:05,181 --> 00:57:08,250
But is that possible to pull off at a big hospital like this?

790
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,151
The security guards must be watching.

791
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,091
Gosh. I'm telling you. It must've been the ghost.

792
00:57:20,491 --> 00:57:21,600
Gosh.

793
00:57:28,301 --> 00:57:29,741
What's wrong?

794
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:31,911
- What's wrong with you? - Doctor.

795
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:34,011
Doctor! We need help over here.

796
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,511
- What's wrong? - Are you okay?

797
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:43,181
I love this place because the moon is so big and bright.

798
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:47,051
- When it's the same moon. - Right.

799
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,420
Even when it's the same moon,

800
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,931
it looks a lot more beautiful from here.

801
00:57:56,901 --> 00:57:58,500
If I were to be born again,

802
00:57:59,131 --> 00:58:01,471
I want to be born as a moon like that.

803
00:58:04,741 --> 00:58:08,381
You know, inanimate things like the sun, moon, stars, and wind.

804
00:58:09,411 --> 00:58:12,011
They just exist instead of living.

805
00:58:13,681 --> 00:58:15,480
I want to be one of those things in my next life.

806
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:22,821
Then, what would you be if you could go back?

807
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:25,991
If you could go back in time?

808
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,670
- I'm not sure. - Even if I go back in time,

809
00:58:35,241 --> 00:58:36,640
I'll make the same decision.

810
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:39,511
Meeting you,

811
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:41,210
falling in love with you,

812
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,580
and walking out here like this.

813
00:58:49,881 --> 00:58:52,250
I know. You probably won't make the same decision.

814
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:00,431
I don't have any regrets.

815
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:07,031
My world changed after getting to know you.

816
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,411
This...

817
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:17,580
I got this from the girl at the hospital.

818
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:22,520
She said everything inside this depends on my love.

819
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,221
She asked me if I was scared.

820
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,690
I was scared.

821
00:59:31,931 --> 00:59:32,991
But...

822
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,401
I'm not scared anymore.

823
00:59:49,841 --> 00:59:52,551
I'm not scared.

824
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:55,350
Not anymore.

825
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,600
Hello?

826
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:23,580
Aunt!

827
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,181
I'm fine. Don't make a fuss.

828
01:00:28,651 --> 01:00:31,020
It was a stress-induced stomach cramp.

829
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,091
A stomach cramp? Does it hurt a lot?

830
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:35,261
Should I go outside and buy you some porridge?

831
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,321
Kevin didn't have any food either, right?

832
01:00:45,301 --> 01:00:46,301
Tak Dong Kyung.

833
01:00:48,241 --> 01:00:49,270
Yes?

834
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,370
I came to the hospital...

835
01:00:52,741 --> 01:00:54,480
and heard something that didn't add up.

836
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:59,181
- Okay. - I want you to explain it.

837
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:03,681
I came back to meet with the doctor we met the other day.

838
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:08,221
But I was informed there was no such doctor here.

839
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:11,830
Then,

840
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:15,801
everything the doctor told me cannot be true.

841
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,431
- Well, Aunt... - I don't want to hear it.

842
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:21,471
Don't argue with me. Let's get you admitted.

843
01:01:21,971 --> 01:01:23,870
Kevin will look for a new hospital.

844
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,011
Aunt.

845
01:01:26,111 --> 01:01:28,181
The new hospital will be as good as this one.

846
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,210
We already booked an appointment. Go get admitted there.

847
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:32,810
- And get all the exams. - Aunt.

848
01:01:36,551 --> 01:01:37,551
I will...

849
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,420
die even if I stay in the hospital.

850
01:01:45,161 --> 01:01:46,931
How could you say that to me now?

851
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:48,761
I will...

852
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,801
die...

853
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,401
even if I get the surgery.

854
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:00,741
Why...

855
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,381
Why are you dying?

856
01:02:04,241 --> 01:02:06,651
- Why are you dying? - Soo, take it easy.

857
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:12,151
Let's get you admitted to this hospital right now.

858
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,790
Please. Let's get you treated, Dong Kyung. Please?

859
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:21,460
Stay in the hospital.

860
01:02:22,361 --> 01:02:24,531
You must get admitted now!

861
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,741
- Aunt. Aunt... - My gosh.

862
01:02:30,401 --> 01:02:31,571
Are you okay?

863
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,640
Doctor!

864
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:36,540
Dong Kyung, please get admitted.

865
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:39,250
Let me check her first.

866
01:02:40,151 --> 01:02:41,221
Aunt.

867
01:02:48,221 --> 01:02:49,821
Right now, Soo needs...

868
01:02:50,591 --> 01:02:52,690
to be stable.

869
01:02:53,661 --> 01:02:55,361
Soo and Dong Kyung...

870
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:00,531
If you guys stay together, it won't be good.

871
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,600
Just...

872
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,640
Maybe, you should go somewhere and wait until she calms down.

873
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,241
And then, I'll call you. Okay?

874
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,911
I'm sorry, Dong Kyung.

875
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:22,761
(Registration, Payment, Admittance and Discharge)

876
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:39,931
This is way too hard.

877
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,170
Please help me.

878
01:04:47,111 --> 01:04:48,511
Help me.

879
01:04:50,611 --> 01:04:52,511
I don't know what to do.

880
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:54,620
There's no way to explain...

881
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:57,151
that I will die no matter what I try.

882
01:04:57,551 --> 01:05:00,850
If I didn't know that... If I didn't know that would be my fate...

883
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:01,960
I'll help you.

884
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:07,761
Will you let me live?

885
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:09,861
No.

886
01:05:10,861 --> 01:05:12,571
I can't do that.

887
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,370
That is your fate.

888
01:05:18,411 --> 01:05:19,471
But...

889
01:05:22,011 --> 01:05:24,681
I can change his fate and yours a bit.

890
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,250
I can remove you from his fate, and vice versa.

891
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,321
As if you had never met.

892
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,661
Then, you will die as fated...

893
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,161
without knowing anything.

894
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:43,500
Like any other patient, you'll get treated and try to get better.

895
01:05:44,301 --> 01:05:46,701
You will slowly face your death.

896
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:50,440
You won't remember each other, and the contract will be void.

897
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:54,681
But instead, your choice...

898
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:59,350
won't make the world collapse or bring death to the one you love.

899
01:06:05,151 --> 01:06:06,350
Will you choose to do that?

900
01:06:14,931 --> 01:06:16,401
There's not much time.

901
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,600
Hurry.

902
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:20,970
You need to make a choice.

903
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:56,130
(Doom At Your Service)

01:07:57,161 --> 01:07:59,001
I don't remember much.

905
01:07:59,571 --> 01:08:00,730
It comes with the illness.

906
01:08:01,501 --> 01:08:02,840
She knows nothing.

907
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:06,510
I want a clear answer.

908
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:09,480
- Will you take? - Or forget?

909
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,741
Or love on your own.

910
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:12,651
Dong Kyung.

911
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:17,781
Tell me what you did to me.

912
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:21,321
I didn't do anything to you. I did something to her.

913
01:08:21,461 --> 01:08:22,560
Help me.

914
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:26,430
Who are you?
