(Episode 10)

4
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:35,901
What's wrong?

5
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:38,242
What happened?

6
00:00:49,787 --> 00:00:50,952
I love you.

7
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:55,961
I am...

8
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:59,191
in love with you.

9
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:12,911
Then, let's date.

10
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:17,411
- What? - Let's date starting today.

11
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:22,182
Tak Dong Kyung.

12
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:24,196
It's cold outside. Where did she go?

13
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:26,351
- Tak Dong Kyung. - Aunt.

14
00:01:26,497 --> 00:01:28,891
I'm on my phone. I'll be right in.

15
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:32,292
You should go. I'll call you tomorrow.

16
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:43,971
Get home safely.

17
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:00,292
Are you seeing anyone?

18
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:03,661
- What? - Are you seeing anyone?

19
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,991
- No. - Or are there any guys you like?

20
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:11,071
Even if there are, date me.

21
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,971
I don't care who that guy is. We met first.

22
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:17,975
I liked you first.

23
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:19,071
And...

24
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:22,642
I still like you.

25
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:32,892
You're so annoying.

26
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:36,191
You drive me mad!

27
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:44,671
Don't smile.

28
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:51,312
- You're so annoying. - It's your laundry.

29
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:08,962
I decided to date him.

30
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:11,432
Lee Hyun Kyu came to me yesterday.

31
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:14,131
That Lee Hyun Kyu?

32
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:16,201
So what did you do? Did you beat him up?

33
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:18,135
Wait. "Him"? Who's him?

34
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:20,575
Why did he come? What does he want from you?

35
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,142
Answer my question first. Who are you talking about?

36
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:27,041
You know, the guy you saw the other day.

37
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,041
He says he loves me.

38
00:03:30,717 --> 00:03:31,851
What?

39
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:35,522
Then, you guys lived together when you weren't even dating?

40
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:37,492
Is that what happened?

41
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,825
Back then, I didn't know this would happen...

42
00:03:39,826 --> 00:03:41,522
when I asked him to move in with me.

43
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:47,902
We're officially dating now, but we can't live together anymore.

44
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,332
Because of my aunt.

45
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:53,302
Who are you?

46
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:55,601
You surprise me quite often now.

47
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:57,716
Don't tell my aunt.

48
00:03:57,717 --> 00:04:00,041
Which one? That you guys lived together or you're dating now?

49
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:03,881
Why are you thinking? Of course, it's the former.

50
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:06,011
Is that so?

51
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:08,351
What's up with you?

52
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:11,791
What about you? Did you beat up Lee Hyun Kyu?

53
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:16,392
I didn't, but I did something similar to that.

54
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:18,092
I did throw stuff at him.

55
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:20,731
What? Like your heart?

56
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:26,801
I could tell that he just came without giving it much thought.

57
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:29,101
But I crumbled in front of him like a fool.

58
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,741
I was that 18-year-old girl again when he smiled.

59
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:39,411
I'm so pathetic. So pathetic.

60
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:41,955
You're not pathetic.

61
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:43,255
I loved how...

62
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:45,392
the 18-year-old Na Ji Na was so brave when it came to love.

63
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,166
- Tak. - Of course, I love...

64
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,392
the 29-year-old Na Ji Na too.

65
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,036
- I love you too, Tak. - Hey, you'll spill it.

66
00:04:55,037 --> 00:04:56,332
Tak.

67
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:59,231
When will you go to the hospital?

68
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,445
Didn't my aunt tell you?

69
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:08,111
- I... - You should still go anyway.

70
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:12,255
I'm going to lose it if I see you pass out like that...

71
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:13,582
ever again.

72
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:17,892
- I won't do that. - Why don't you want to go?

73
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:20,096
I'm not avoiding it.

74
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:22,692
I just need to sort things out.

75
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,765
I need to meet some people...

76
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,092
and things to do.

77
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:27,736
That's why.

78
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:29,306
Will you go to the hospital...

79
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:31,502
after you meet them and do whatever you need to do?

80
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:36,671
Hold on.

81
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:42,142
Yes. This is Lee Hyun.

82
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:45,351
What?

83
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:47,311
Okay.

84
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:49,525
I need to get going.

85
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:51,892
- What's wrong? - No, you don't need to worry.

86
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:52,927
No.

87
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:55,825
- I should drop you off first. - Forget it. Please.

88
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:58,596
- I have a boyfriend too. - Right. You do.

89
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:01,161
Tell him to pick you up. The guy who pretends to be cool.

90
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:03,406
Call me if there's anything.

91
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,002
I got it.

92
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:06,676
Do you think I'm a kid?

93
00:06:06,677 --> 00:06:08,346
You'll always be a kid in my eyes.

94
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,801
A 17-year-old girl wearing a hoodie.

95
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:13,671
Bye.

96
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:16,442
Ji Na.

97
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:18,212
Yes?

98
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:20,681
Thank you.

99
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:23,522
Don't mention it. Bye.

100
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:05,731
Hi.

101
00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:15,272
I didn't know you would just show up here.

102
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:17,971
Even so, you're still a guest here.

103
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:21,541
Okay. Right. I'm a guest.

104
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:24,085
I thought about calling you.

105
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:25,252
You should have.

106
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,686
I just thought coming here would be better.

107
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:31,392
You could have called before coming over.

108
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:37,262
I guess you are very committed when you're in a relationship.

109
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,135
- In a relationship? - What? What did I just say?

110
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:43,635
By the way, you're like one of us now.

111
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:45,132
You can be patient now.

112
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:49,301
That's my specialty. Being patient and observing.

113
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:53,512
But I won't do that anymore.

114
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:56,212
- Why not? - It's a waste of time.

115
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:09,962
- Why did you move down? - In case you needed more space.

116
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:12,065
We slept on that small bed together.

117
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:13,392
You asked me to do that.

118
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,436
No. It wasn't small.

119
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:18,272
Your bed was very spacious.

120
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:29,382
My gosh. Look at this. How much is this?

121
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:31,282
Put it down. Let's talk then.

122
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:32,911
Hey.

123
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:34,756
You're worried that I might break it, right?

124
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:35,921
Because you don't want to waste it?

125
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,152
Put it down and talk.

126
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:41,291
What? Why? I don't want to put it down.

127
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:49,961
I guess this is incredibly expensive.

128
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,232
It's not that.

129
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:55,142
You don't have any free hands.

130
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:57,075
What?

131
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:58,341
And there's a wall behind you.

132
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,622
Hey, I'll break this if you come near me.

133
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:10,026
That thing's really expensive.

134
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,721
The price is astronomical.

135
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,932
I'm getting a call.

136
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:26,731
And?

137
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,672
I need to answer it.

138
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:52,961
Hey, Sun Kyung.

139
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:55,762
I should've gotten rid of Sun Kyung to begin with.

140
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:57,231
Hey.

141
00:10:08,246 --> 00:10:10,042
So exactly which part...

142
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:12,711
are you saying was plagiarized?

143
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:15,125
The part where the students eat tteokbokki? This part?

144
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:17,556
That's completely absurd.

145
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:20,395
If you call that plagiarism, no writer would feel free...

146
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:21,865
to write what he or she wants.

147
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:23,022
What?

148
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:27,066
Didn't you call me here to tell me I plagiarized your work?

149
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:29,135
You seem to have trouble understanding things...

150
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:30,461
even though you're a writer.

151
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:32,372
When did I ever say you plagiarized my work?

152
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:35,571
I just told you there were suspicions.

153
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:36,876
You clearly told me...

154
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:39,015
A few of my fans...

155
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:40,741
can be like this sometimes.

156
00:10:41,386 --> 00:10:42,782
You can't call this plagiarism.

157
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,385
If anyone raises an issue,

158
00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:46,851
I'll say I gave you permission.

159
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:48,721
What?

160
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:50,625
I was just worried...

161
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:53,556
that you might end up getting hurt by this.

162
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:56,762
I was so worried that I couldn't even sleep.

163
00:10:57,396 --> 00:10:59,491
That's why I wanted to meet you.

164
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:07,406
Are you always this shy?

165
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:08,902
Are you normally very quiet?

166
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:15,215
But I must say, the rumours are true. You really are beautiful.

167
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,081
I finally get why Ms. Tak refused to introduce me to you.

168
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:21,252
The more expensive the jewellery, the more you should hide it.

169
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:22,422
I totally get it.

170
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:24,622
Hey, listen.

171
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:26,656
There's no need to feel uncomfortable around me.

172
00:11:26,657 --> 00:11:29,591
I'm only a famous writer on the internet.

173
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:34,162
I'm normally just an average kind of guy.

174
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:36,032
Listen.

175
00:11:36,636 --> 00:11:40,302
I heard you refused to renew your contract with this company.

176
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:43,406
I'm very close with the CEO of Books Box.

177
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,571
I'll help you meet him.

178
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:49,682
So how about we eat... No.

179
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:51,512
Let's drink before that.

180
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:53,481
I know a great place.

181
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,495
Why did Mr. Cha have to go to a meeting?

182
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:03,461
Should I try talking to him nicely?

183
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:06,196
I think it'd be quicker for me to talk some sense into him.

184
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:07,591
That guy won't listen to anyone.

185
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:10,836
Why are you all gathered together?

186
00:12:10,837 --> 00:12:12,576
What took you so long, Mr. Cha?

187
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:14,172
The meeting lasted a long time. Why?

188
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:16,806
Jijo King called Lee Hyun to the office...

189
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:18,611
saying she plagiarized his work.

190
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:20,471
Just think of me as a close friend...

191
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,412
Gosh, what's with you and all your nonsense?

192
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:28,156
- What? - Do you think I'm easy?

193
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:29,326
We've never even met before.

194
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:31,926
We just met today. Who do you think you are to hit on me?

195
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:33,755
What... What? Are you crazy?

196
00:12:33,756 --> 00:12:35,696
No, I'm sane as ever.

197
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:37,166
If I was crazy, I wouldn't have thrown the laptop.

198
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,936
I would've punched you in the face first.

199
00:12:38,937 --> 00:12:40,066
What's with you?

200
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:42,105
Drag this crazy wench out of here. Drag her out of here right now!

201
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:43,235
Did you call me a crazy wench?

202
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:46,176
- Gosh, calm down. - Hey, calm down.

203
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:47,302
Hey!

204
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:48,642
Get off me.

205
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:50,601
- Calm down. - Get down from the desk.

206
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:56,111
My gosh.

207
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:58,412
This is all because of you.

208
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:08,762
Consider yourself lucky.

209
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:11,561
What a complete jerk.

210
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,836
Gosh, I finally get it now.

211
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:16,861
No wonder all your novels end up as failures.

212
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:18,676
There's no way you can write anything good...

213
00:13:18,677 --> 00:13:20,132
with that kind of personality.

214
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:21,672
You little jerk.

215
00:13:29,047 --> 00:13:31,556
Well, that explains why your work is always the same.

216
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:33,351
It's a reflection of yourself.

217
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:34,981
What?

218
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:37,186
What's wrong with my work?

219
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:38,821
The stuff you write is... How should I put it?

220
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:40,851
It's very ugly.

221
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,292
Mr. Cha!

222
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:48,666
Whose side are you on?

223
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,061
The winning side.

224
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:53,236
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:55,201
I have trouble controlling my anger when it comes to guys like him.

226
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:58,816
Hey, call the cops.

227
00:13:58,817 --> 00:13:59,975
Call the police right now.

228
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:02,046
Just compensate for the laptop. Let's not make an issue.

229
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:03,416
What are you talking about?

230
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:05,855
Hey, call the police! Call them now!

231
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:07,656
Why would I compensate for his laptop?

232
00:14:07,657 --> 00:14:08,956
Hey, I told you to call the police.

233
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:10,625
Who am I talking to? Am I talking to myself?

234
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:13,522
You should compensate for the laptop because it's mine.

235
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:17,392
What?

236
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,061
That's right.

237
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:29,046
This is unbelievable.

238
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:30,201
My gosh.

239
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:33,272
You know what?

240
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:35,211
We should meet out in the open.

241
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,215
Do you think that makes things less dangerous?

242
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:39,985
At least I can run away.

243
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:41,922
Are you sure you can run away from me?

244
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:44,725
You talk as if you're going to chase after me.

245
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:46,122
That's my profession.

246
00:14:57,506 --> 00:14:59,672
- The moon is pretty. - You're prettier.

247
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:02,071
My gosh, stop it.

248
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:05,372
What?

249
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:08,546
You should think before you talk.

250
00:15:08,547 --> 00:15:11,081
I don't need to think to know that you're pretty.

251
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:13,882
My goodness.

252
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:27,532
Is your garden still the same?

253
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:29,802
What do you mean?

254
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:33,502
Is it still lonesome and solitary there?

255
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:35,272
No, not anymore.

256
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:37,372
You're here now.

257
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:44,382
I think that's when it started.

258
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:48,481
What?

259
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:55,461
Hey, don't look at me like that.

260
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,831
I also think that's when it started.

261
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:06,132
What?

262
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:10,971
My heart started aching for you, and I began pitying you.

263
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:14,311
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

264
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:20,752
You? Pitying me?

265
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,382
Don't look at me like that either.

266
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:26,892
How exactly am I looking at you?

267
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:28,961
Your eyes look sad.

268
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:33,591
Hey, the moon is pretty. How about we celebrate with a kiss?

269
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:35,831
What?

270
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:37,731
I'm kidding.

271
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:45,276
By the way, is your pottery really expensive?

272
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:46,412
Yes.

273
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,786
- How much is it? - I'm kidding.

274
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:50,941
What?

275
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,426
It feels weird...

276
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:57,122
to have you walk me home like this.

277
00:16:57,787 --> 00:16:59,355
I walked you home quite often.

278
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:01,595
Things are different now.

279
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:03,691
Why? Because I'm your boyfriend now?

280
00:17:04,997 --> 00:17:08,105
You're very straightforward with certain words.

281
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:09,801
Meanwhile, you're hesitant with certain words.

282
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:14,036
Then maybe it's time for me...

283
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:16,672
to say something like this.

284
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:25,751
Would you like to come in for some ramyeon?

285
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:34,352
I don't eat or sleep.

286
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:37,021
My gosh, that's not what I meant.

287
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:41,665
You'd be pretty flustered if I actually play along.

288
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,261
You're one scary guy.

289
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:46,675
Where did you learn this kind of stuff?

290
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:47,832
Humans.

291
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:50,441
I've been watching you guys for a very long time.

292
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:54,842
Hey, where do you think you're going?

293
00:17:55,247 --> 00:17:56,511
I thought you wanted to eat ramyeon.

294
00:17:56,717 --> 00:17:58,612
Hey! My gosh.

295
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,551
Hey... What?

296
00:18:05,257 --> 00:18:06,991
What the...

297
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:18,872
Would you like to stay for some pork belly?

298
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:27,216
Do we really have to eat outside?

299
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:29,145
If we cook inside, the entire place will stink.

300
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:30,781
Do you want to go to bed smelling like pork belly?

301
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:32,981
Just eat.

302
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,582
Open your mouth. Here.

303
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:37,422
Here you go.

304
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:43,362
Eat up, Doctor.

305
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:46,665
Brother, eat up.

306
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,862
Here.

307
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,432
Here.

308
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:56,142
It's delicious.

309
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:04,582
Uncle, what are you doing?

310
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:08,922
Kevin must want to have a drink with your boyfriend.

311
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:12,791
Kevin. This is...

312
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:15,761
I never got your name.

313
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:18,996
- What's your name? - His name is...

314
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:21,195
Human. Kim Human.

315
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:23,961
What? What kind of name is that?

316
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:25,971
Right?

317
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:29,041
This is...

318
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:31,271
Human.

319
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:33,041
Boyfriend. Boyfriend.

320
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:36,441
There's an old saying.

321
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:39,251
Only alcohol can reveal the real you.

322
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:41,412
What did he say?

323
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:45,221
He says you need to make a man drink.

324
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:46,892
Come on, Uncle.

325
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:51,622
I... Me... I did it all before.

326
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:54,862
It's over. The end. Understand?

327
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,902
Kevin.

328
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:03,572
I should've studied English,

329
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:06,372
- but I quit school early. - Just eat.

330
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:09,415
I bought beer earlier. I'll go get them.

331
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,746
I'll get them.

332
00:20:10,747 --> 00:20:12,711
You don't even drink them. Stay here.

333
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:30,332
Where is the bottle opener?

334
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:56,791
Seriously.

335
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:59,132
That looks good.

336
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:01,092
Yum.

337
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:03,902
What's taking her so long? Is she looking for something?

338
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:06,902
We can just drink this.

339
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:49,842
- Where's Auntie? - She'll be right out.

340
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:51,481
Okay.

341
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:55,251
Yum.

342
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:06,266
Beer goes the best with meat.

343
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:09,761
Beer. That's great.

344
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:11,801
They're done.

345
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:17,441
Shall we have soju bombs? Yes?

346
00:22:17,646 --> 00:22:19,541
- Yes. - Soju bombs!

347
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:21,572
Beer. Soju. Soju. Soju.

348
00:22:22,587 --> 00:22:24,481
Beer and soju!

349
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:26,382
Here, here.

350
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:31,451
Real soju. Yes.

351
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:46,836
Thanks for playing along...

352
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:48,971
when you don't even eat or sleep.

353
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:52,511
Say it.

354
00:22:54,477 --> 00:22:55,582
What?

355
00:22:55,946 --> 00:22:58,582
"Thank you"? I just did.

356
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,721
Not that. What you feel.

357
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:05,592
I won't know if you don't say it,

358
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:08,892
since I can't see or hear what you feel.

359
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,822
That's how feelings are.

360
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,095
So tell me.

361
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:16,162
What do you want me to say?

362
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:22,041
"I love you."

363
00:23:35,886 --> 00:23:37,021
Is that too hard?

364
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:44,521
Then let's start with something easy.

365
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:47,991
Just how not okay you are.

366
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:50,301
How sad you are.

367
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:55,541
How much you want to live.

368
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:57,801
How scared...

369
00:23:58,846 --> 00:24:00,072
you are.

370
00:24:05,717 --> 00:24:07,412
You can go on your own from here.

371
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:53,536
Have a seat. Let's talk.

372
00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:55,332
I told Ji Na.

373
00:24:56,606 --> 00:24:57,905
I said let's go out again.

374
00:24:57,906 --> 00:25:00,175
I said let's talk upstairs that day.

375
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:01,832
And I said I had somewhere to go.

376
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:13,281
It's true. I didn't tell you.

377
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:16,281
I didn't think I had to,

378
00:25:16,656 --> 00:25:18,481
and I thought it would be best that you don't meet.

379
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:24,062
I was out of line.

380
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,932
Is that all?

381
00:25:39,176 --> 00:25:41,172
Go to sleep. I'm going to sleep.

382
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:53,491
(Na Ji Na - You said you needed to tell me something.)

383
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:57,892
You said you needed to tell me something.

384
00:25:58,126 --> 00:25:59,362
What is it?

385
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,549
(Sun Kyung, Aunt Soo Ja, Ji Na)

386
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,589
(Bucket list)

387
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,054
Dong Kyung, what are you doing? Come eat.

388
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:20,284
Okay.

389
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,224
Okay.

390
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,135
- Are you going out? - Yes.

391
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:34,605
Auntie's rolled omelet!

392
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:37,135
Where's Uncle?

393
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,378
Did he go to the hotel?

394
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:42,044
Yes. It's too uncomfortable for him to stay here.

395
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:44,375
Where are you going?

396
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,415
I'm just meeting someone.

397
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:03,865
Looking for me?

398
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,504
What is that?

399
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,774
I thought you may need it.

400
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,905
I've always...

401
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,575
resented the deity.

402
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,575
But...

403
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:56,615
the entity that I had resented is so tiny and frail.

404
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,885
I didn't know...

405
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,358
that a deity would have to...

406
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:07,524
carry the burden of the world on those small shoulders.

407
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,405
I've been hearing a lot of things I've been wanting to hear.

408
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,445
That's all.

409
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,185
I wanted to say that to you before I left.

410
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,625
The only person that can help you is yourself.

411
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:43,865
Love him.

412
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:48,534
Be madly in love and live your life.

413
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:54,405
He was born for you anyway.

414
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,044
I created him for humanity.

415
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,625
Thanks for the present.

416
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,645
Ms. Tak.

417
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,855
I know what you're going to tell me.

418
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:46,365
No. I bet you don't.

419
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,895
I'm...

420
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,294
getting married.

421
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,435
Pardon?

422
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:07,289
(It's the most important day of my life.)

423
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,289
(And I want to share my first step of joy with you.)

424
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,655
It's in three months.

425
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,385
Please come to my wedding.

426
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,395
That's what I wanted to ask you.

427
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,294
I don't have any friends.

428
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,935
I see.

429
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:29,204
I bet you didn't see this coming. Right?

430
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,645
See? I said you wouldn't guess it.

431
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,415
Are you getting married?

432
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,625
What? Why are you here?

433
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,395
- Who's that jerk? - What?

434
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:50,925
Isn't that a wedding invitation?

435
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,064
Luckily, you're not the bride.

436
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,108
Why are you here?

437
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:05,279
Are you following me?

438
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,448
You might have forgotten,

439
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:08,809
but doom is all over this place.

440
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,249
Before you showed up here, this used to be...

441
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,314
my perfect shelter and hiding place.

442
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,915
Your face stands out too much and doesn't blend in.

443
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:21,529
Only for you.

444
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,994
(Emergency Medical Center)

445
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,355
Why are you following me?

446
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:27,024
No, I'm not.

447
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,135
Go away.

448
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:31,064
I'm not following you.

449
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,504
- Are you really coming? - Yes.

450
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,835
I'm not following you. I'm coming with you.

451
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:37,979
Why?

452
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,605
Because I want to be with you.

453
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:42,814
You're never shy to say stuff like that.

454
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,885
- Thanks for the compliment. - It wasn't.

455
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:48,214
- I know you like it. - No, I don't.

457
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:05,905
- Ms. Jo. - Do you want to go on a date?

458
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,810
What?

459
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:09,534
I regretted that.

460
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,244
You gave us enough hints.

461
00:32:14,109 --> 00:32:17,375
I couldn't read between the lines when my job is to edit novels.

462
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,688
- Ye Ji. - You asked me what I would...

463
00:32:22,689 --> 00:32:26,155
wish for if someone could grant me a wish before I die.

464
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,355
Since we're talking about our wishes,

465
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,559
what would you wish for...

466
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,595
if you could make one wish before dying?

467
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:35,794
I picked money back then.

468
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:39,034
I want to change it. I want you to be healthy.

469
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,375
I'll use my wish to get your health back.

470
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,145
Sorry.

471
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:51,974
I've never done this before.

472
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,814
I didn't know how to bring this up.

473
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,085
So I missed my window.

474
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:00,325
It's my first time too.

475
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,254
So I don't even know if I'm saying the right thing.

476
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,464
Are my hands shaking?

477
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,894
Ms. Jo, you always give me the right answers.

478
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:15,508
Without you, I'm staying late too many nights.

479
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:19,039
And Mr. Park is such a jerk. Mr. Cha is so mean too.

480
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,979
Gosh. Seriously.

481
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,678
Work is the evil of our society.

482
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,618
By the way,

483
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:26,118
who is that man...

484
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,484
that's been staring at us all this time?

485
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:36,995
My boyfriend.

486
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,464
- Pretend he's not there. - What? Boyfriend?

487
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:42,394
Ms. Tak.

488
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,635
Hey.

489
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,195
What took you so long?

490
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,008
Mr. Park told us to buy him dental floss for him...

491
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:48,865
at the convenience store out of the blue.

492
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,209
I was running an errand.

493
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,008
That man hasn't changed.

494
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:53,274
Ms. Tak.

495
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:55,475
Are you all right?

496
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,618
I'm all right.

497
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,249
Ms. Tak. Seriously.

498
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,644
I missed you.

499
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,885
Stop.

500
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,385
That guy over there is scowling at you like he's going to kill you.

501
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,854
What?

502
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:09,124
Who?

503
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,394
I'm not sure. Is he a hitman?

504
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,599
- He's her boyfriend. - What?

505
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,825
Anyway, you owe me your life.

506
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:22,205
I'm buying today.

507
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:27,374
Is this goodbye?

508
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,579
No. When will we meet again?

509
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,445
I'll miss you.

510
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:35,584
I never thought you would say stuff like this.

511
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:39,354
If I bought you yangjangpi, you would have said you loved me.

512
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:41,588
Whatever that is, I'll say that too.

513
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:44,099
Stop it. We're not saying goodbye for good.

514
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,425
We'll see her again.

515
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,999
You're not answering me again.

516
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,535
We'll meet very often. I'm declaring it now.

517
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,238
Meet everyone you need to.

518
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,908
And when you have some time left, call me.

519
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,104
Okay?

520
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:00,745
Me too. Call me too.

521
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,579
I really miss you...

522
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,675
Are you getting in?

523
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:06,385
I'm coming.

524
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,015
I should go.

525
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,059
Everyone, don't work so hard. Take it easy.

526
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,214
Okay?

527
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,568
- His boyfriend is kind of old. - What?

528
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:26,265
Doesn't he look young for his age?

529
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:29,379
He does. But I wish he was taller.

530
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,575
- He's pretty tall. - Yes.

531
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,079
He's short. He's much shorter than me.

532
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,475
- He was much taller. - He was much taller.

533
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,318
If you keep making your presence known,

534
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:41,319
I can let you tag along.

535
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,789
What did I do?

536
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,189
You were like a puppy protecting his owner.

537
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,388
You glared like this.

538
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:47,885
A puppy can't protect its owner because it's too small.

539
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:50,595
Gosh. You never let me have the last word.

540
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,294
Hey. Make a left turn.

541
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,238
Sometimes, you think I'm your driver.

542
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,738
I know that you're not.

543
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:02,535
You're my boyfriend. My boyfriend is driving me.

544
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,249
You're never shy to say stuff like that.

545
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,144
I had a great teacher.

546
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:23,254
I'm really busy.

547
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,195
Why do you keep asking to meet?

548
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,164
Do you like me?

549
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,568
I didn't pester you to meet with me.

550
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:31,964
You came to our last meeting on your own will.

551
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,064
And I don't work there anymore.

552
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,305
What is it?

553
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,644
Are you here to blackmail me? Or challenge me?

554
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,745
I need your autograph.

555
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,689
Ms. Tak, do you really like me?

556
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,814
You said you were busy. Hurry.

557
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:54,885
Make it to Writer Dalgona.

558
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:05,195
Does Writer Dalgona like me?

559
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,968
Is it important that people like you?

560
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:09,879
It's not important, per Se. It just makes me feel good.

561
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,975
(To Writer Dalgona)

562
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,774
I'm glad you're happy.

563
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:14,504
"P.S."

564
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,975
"I hope you recover quickly and come back with your next novel."

565
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,714
How is she sick?

566
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,184
She has cancer.

567
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,955
She's about to get her surgery.

568
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,359
She's sick and might die soon.

569
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,329
But you make her smile.

570
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,524
Draw two hearts.

571
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:43,675
(I hope you recover quickly and come back with...)

572
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:47,575
I heard you were sick too.

573
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,975
Yes.

574
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,149
Two hearts.

575
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,245
(I hope you recover quickly and come back with your next novel.)

576
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,354
Three hearts.

577
00:37:57,489 --> 00:37:58,955
Give me your hand.

578
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:11,995
What is this?

579
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,035
Apparently, my autograph is like a talisman.

580
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,109
A fan of mine got really good grades...

581
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,579
after she got an autograph from me.

582
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,874
She even got a part-time job.

583
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,604
So this will make you better too.

584
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,115
By the way, did you really stop writing because of me?

585
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,555
- Why? - I'm very loyal.

586
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,655
You bought me tons of food.

587
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,225
I'm a guy who knows how to show gratitude.

588
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:35,925
That's just how I am.

589
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:42,064
Tteokbokki is so expensive.

590
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,195
The tteokbokki we had that day was really good, wasn't it?

591
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,144
- Hey. - Yes?

592
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,814
I need a writer's opinion.

593
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:02,214
If you choose the person you love, the world will perish.

594
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,785
If you choose to protect the world,

595
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,124
the person you love will die.

596
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,425
If that was the theme of the story,

597
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:13,865
how would it have a happy ending?

598
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,274
Everything will be fine as long as the protagonist doesn't love anyone.

599
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:29,305
I'm sure it'll be sad,

600
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,374
but that's what he or she has to bear with as the chosen one.

601
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:41,584
Would you call it a happy ending even if the protagonist is sad?

602
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,329
Instead, everyone else will get to be happy...

603
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,825
in a world that the protagonist tried so hard to protect.

604
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:48,564
That's the fate of protagonists.

605
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,334
Whose story is this?

606
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,774
I totally get why you made it into the top 10.

607
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,805
That's quite sudden.

608
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,144
By the way,

609
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,115
I've been meaning to ask you this for a while.

610
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,414
Are you dating the owner of the tteokbokki restaurant?

611
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:14,225
What?

612
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,524
He's been staring at us for a while now.

613
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,064
To be more exact,

614
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,365
it started when I signed my autograph onto your hand.

615
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:27,765
Well, yes.

616
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,805
Unbelievable.

617
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:33,774
I didn't know you were the type who went for looks.

618
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:39,544
(Manager)

619
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,714
I think I should go.

620
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,615
He's obviously calling to ask me where I am.

621
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,854
Thank you.

622
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:48,684
You can thank me by telling people to vote for me.

623
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,999
- Bye, Dong Kyung. - "Dong Kyung"?

624
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,455
You're no longer an editor.

625
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,425
So I'm calling you by your name now.

626
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,805
My gosh.

627
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,178
You're so immature.

628
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,675
I have long legs.

629
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,445
Why aren't you at your restaurant?

630
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,914
Did it go bankrupt?

631
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,389
Just quietly leave.

632
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,455
No. I'm going to be loud.

633
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:22,285
- You little punk. - My gosh, stop it.

634
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,428
He's a kid.

635
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:26,524
He's a very rude kid.

636
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:28,995
Must you fight with a kid?

637
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,738
Whose side are you on?

638
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:35,164
I'm obviously on your side. Let's go.

639
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,604
Are you sure?

640
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,575
Are you just saying that to make me drive?

641
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,908
(Number 1 Park Young)

642
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:44,749
(To Dalgona)

643
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,644
(I hope you recover quickly and come back with your next novel.)

644
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:50,155
I'm so happy right now.

645
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,354
I'm glad to hear that.

646
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,754
Thank you, Ms. Tak. I mean it.

647
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:02,524
How are you?

648
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:04,434
What? What do you mean?

649
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:06,434
Are you happy these days?

650
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:13,905
You seemed...

651
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,714
very hesitant that day.

652
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,189
It felt like you were wondering...

653
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,718
whether to eat the candy in front of you...

654
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,214
that could make you happy.

655
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:27,055
And I urged you to eat it.

656
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,294
Dalgona.

657
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,325
Yes?

658
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,434
I'm having...

659
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,964
so much fun living my life.

660
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,814
What should I do?

661
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,184
I...

662
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:01,024
I find it so much fun.

663
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:23,104
Hey!

664
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,445
My gosh.

665
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,044
Are you kidding?

666
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,959
You startled me.

667
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,629
Have you lost your mind?

668
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,354
Why would you smoke this? It's no good for you.

669
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:38,495
Why? This is a smoking area.

670
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:41,198
So what if it's a smoking area.

671
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:43,099
It's like you're trying to do everything that's not good for you.

672
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,499
You already knew I smoked.

673
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,934
Let's say I didn't. Plus, I don't want you to anymore.

674
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,334
Do you want to get married?

675
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,238
- What? - We held hands, kissed,

676
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:53,345
and started dating.

677
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:55,004
Isn't marriage what comes next?

678
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,849
What made you think of...

679
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,548
People get married when they meet someone...

680
00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:00,144
they want to spend the rest of their lives with.

681
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:05,984
Do you want to live with me forever?

682
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,425
I'm not sure.

683
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,925
But if I were to die soon...

684
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,425
Yes, I'd want to marry you.

685
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,138
It's as if you're applying for college...

686
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:26,374
right after graduating from elementary school.

687
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:27,749
What's that supposed to mean?

688
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,445
It means you skipped too many steps.

689
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:32,515
There are tons of stuff to do before marriage.

690
00:44:32,779 --> 00:44:33,984
Like what?

691
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,414
Get in the car first.

692
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,754
(Kang Soo Ah)

693
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,564
They're my mom and dad.

694
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,964
You should say hello to them before getting married.

695
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,365
It's that photo from before.

696
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:55,664
Yes.

697
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,908
(Kang Soo Ah)

698
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:03,544
(Tak Jong Won)

699
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,124
We should leave now.

700
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,455
Just like that?

701
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:23,365
- What else is there to do? - You should say something.

702
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,805
I already talked to them through my heart.

703
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,805
But they can't hear you.

704
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:33,544
It's not like they can hear me even if I say it out loud.

705
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,475
It's best to just think what you want to say.

706
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:38,675
Hello.

707
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:42,115
I'm her boyfriend.

708
00:45:43,049 --> 00:45:44,814
I proposed to her today, but she turned me down.

709
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,555
- What are you doing? - Let me marry your daughter.

710
00:45:48,989 --> 00:45:51,225
I promise I'll make her happy for the rest of her life.

711
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:54,464
You've really picked up a few lines.

712
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:58,365
- Should I also get on my knees? - Why are you still standing?

713
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:02,504
What did you say, Dad? That you'll never approve of him?

714
00:46:02,739 --> 00:46:05,874
I'm never going to marry someone my parents disapprove of.

715
00:46:09,009 --> 00:46:10,144
It's sad.

716
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,515
Why? Because you got rejected?

717
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:14,385
No, I was talking about you.

718
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:16,484
Why? What's so sad about me?

719
00:46:17,889 --> 00:46:19,955
Why do you always suppress what you want to say?

720
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:24,354
Don't be absurd.

721
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,365
I always say what I want to say.

722
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:31,064
That's enough. Let's go. The place will close.

723
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,205
What? What place?

724
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,484
What are you doing? Hurry up and blow it out.

725
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,684
- What is this for? - It's to celebrate your birthday.

726
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:53,729
You told me it was your first time...

727
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,825
hearing someone wish you a happy birthday that day.

728
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,428
So I figured you also probably never received a cake...

729
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:00,495
or celebrated like this.

730
00:47:00,799 --> 00:47:02,725
Let's skip the happy birthday song.

731
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,365
That part is a bit embarrassing.

732
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,738
Hurry up and blow out the candle.

733
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:12,705
And your wish. Don't forget to make a wish.

734
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,689
Happy birthday.

735
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,044
That includes all the birthdays you missed.

736
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,325
Who's going to grant me my wish?

737
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:32,394
Me.

738
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,695
Go ahead and tell me. I'll grant you whatever.

739
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,595
Except for marriage.

740
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,894
My wish...

741
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:45,004
I want you to live.

742
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,414
I wish I can make you live.

743
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:00,684
You're doing that already.

744
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,925
You're...

745
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,495
making me live for real already.

746
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,365
Then...

747
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,975
What about living happily with things that you love...

748
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,975
in the world that you love?

749
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,814
For as long as possible.

750
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,655
And think about me...

751
00:48:33,529 --> 00:48:35,155
once in a while.

752
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,618
Buy presents.

753
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:00,988
(Buy presents.)

754
00:49:00,989 --> 00:49:03,914
Thank Ji Na.

755
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:06,655
Meet with the editing team.

756
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:11,794
Get Park Young's autograph and give it to Dalgona.

757
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,664
Celebrate his birthday with him.

758
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:24,138
(Celebrate his birthday with him.)

759
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:26,635
(Celebrate his birthday with him.)

760
00:49:37,759 --> 00:49:40,725
You were nice to me as if you were going to disappear.

761
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,455
People who are nice to me always disappear.

762
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:45,894
It was always like that with me.

763
00:49:56,065 --> 00:49:57,490
What did you want to tell me?

764
00:49:58,735 --> 00:49:59,964
It's...

765
00:49:59,965 --> 00:50:02,434
That's right. About that umbrella.

766
00:50:02,435 --> 00:50:05,030
Did you leave it here? The red one.

767
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:07,205
Yes. When I gave you that umbrella before,

768
00:50:07,206 --> 00:50:09,441
I wasn't lending it to you. I was giving it to you.

769
00:50:10,246 --> 00:50:12,140
I didn't intend to get it back,

770
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:14,740
and I didn't think I could get it back.

771
00:50:15,016 --> 00:50:16,714
Since I took something I gave you,

772
00:50:16,715 --> 00:50:19,010
I thought I should put something back in its place.

773
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,821
I thought a ghost had left it.

774
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:27,620
- Would a ghost do that? - I'm glad a ghost did not.

775
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,825
Do you have proof that I'm human?

776
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,560
Stop that. You're scaring me.

777
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,171
I'll compensate you as soon as I can...

778
00:50:37,806 --> 00:50:39,930
for your laptop.

779
00:50:40,005 --> 00:50:42,941
It's fine. I only said that to settle the situation.

780
00:50:44,145 --> 00:50:46,171
If it weren't for that dirtbag.

781
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:49,544
That jerk Jijo King didn't say anything since, did he?

782
00:50:49,545 --> 00:50:50,914
What could he say?

783
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:53,155
That happened because he was being shady.

784
00:50:53,156 --> 00:50:55,251
Does everyone think I'm an easy target now?

785
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,291
Why are so many jerks doing that to me?

786
00:50:59,096 --> 00:51:01,195
Why? What did he do?

787
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:04,495
He said he was close to a CEO and that he'd introduce me...

788
00:51:04,496 --> 00:51:05,660
Not that.

789
00:51:06,136 --> 00:51:07,361
Lee Hyun Kyu

790
00:51:12,676 --> 00:51:15,041
(Lee Hyun Kyu)

791
00:51:19,315 --> 00:51:20,441
Don't answer that.

792
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:26,310
Me first. I have something to say.

793
00:51:30,156 --> 00:51:33,591
(Lee Hyun Kyu)

794
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:36,064
I live with Hyun Kyu.

795
00:51:36,065 --> 00:51:37,760
I've known him for a long time.

796
00:51:42,136 --> 00:51:43,205
What?

797
00:51:43,206 --> 00:51:45,571
Even when we kissed nine years ago.

798
00:52:10,465 --> 00:52:11,591
Hey.

799
00:52:12,335 --> 00:52:14,705
Why are you soaked? Didn't you have an umbrella?

800
00:52:14,706 --> 00:52:17,231
- Where are you going? - To the convenience store.

801
00:52:17,976 --> 00:52:19,635
It's pouring out. Go later.

802
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,970
I have an umbrella.

803
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,571
You'll still get wet. Go once it stops.

804
00:52:23,605 --> 00:52:24,711
But...

805
00:52:25,815 --> 00:52:27,310
Okay.

806
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,021
(Lee Hyun Kyu)

807
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:35,720
(Missed call, Lee Hyun Kyu)

808
00:52:36,355 --> 00:52:39,051
You would've seen him that day if I hadn't kissed you.

809
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:43,265
Then did you do it on purpose...

810
00:52:43,266 --> 00:52:45,330
Because I didn't want him to see you.

811
00:52:45,536 --> 00:52:48,530
Because I was sure you wouldn't come back if I did that.

812
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,071
I don't regret it.

813
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:54,071
I'd do it again if I had the chance.

814
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,501
I need a conviction before I do anything.

815
00:52:57,516 --> 00:52:58,910
I had a conviction...

816
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,015
that she needed Hyun Kyu out of her life...

817
00:53:02,016 --> 00:53:05,010
for her to live a proper life as herself.

818
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:08,455
- What did you know... - Do I need to know to help?

819
00:53:08,456 --> 00:53:10,481
Did you love him because you knew everything?

820
00:53:11,326 --> 00:53:14,160
Did you know that he'd keep running away like that...

821
00:53:14,196 --> 00:53:15,620
from the start?

822
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:21,060
I knew, but I liked him anyway.

823
00:53:21,105 --> 00:53:22,330
That scumbag.

824
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:28,075
Then if it weren't for you, Hyun Kyu and I...

825
00:53:28,076 --> 00:53:29,441
Would you have been happy?

826
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:34,410
I highly doubt that.

827
00:53:42,226 --> 00:53:43,955
- Don't you feel bad? - Not at all.

828
00:53:43,956 --> 00:53:45,524
Then why are you telling me?

829
00:53:45,525 --> 00:53:46,751
To bow out.

830
00:53:47,965 --> 00:53:49,890
Because I'm starting to feel bad.

831
00:53:50,735 --> 00:53:51,961
And I don't like that.

832
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:17,794
(Breaking up.)

833
00:54:17,795 --> 00:54:19,120
Breaking up.

834
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,461
I must love none of them...

835
00:55:00,366 --> 00:55:02,801
in order to save all of them.

836
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:31,930
Going somewhere?

837
00:55:39,505 --> 00:55:40,941
What are you doing here?

838
00:55:41,145 --> 00:55:42,801
I asked if you were going somewhere.

839
00:55:51,286 --> 00:55:52,611
Did you know?

840
00:55:52,915 --> 00:55:54,821
I can tell if I look at you and think.

841
00:55:55,956 --> 00:55:59,321
I can tell what you're thinking and how you feel.

842
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:13,171
You always looked like you were saying bye.

843
00:56:14,906 --> 00:56:16,100
Even now.

844
00:56:17,005 --> 00:56:18,410
The way you're looking at me.

845
00:56:29,226 --> 00:56:30,321
You're right.

846
00:56:31,156 --> 00:56:32,720
Let's break up.

847
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:38,961
Let's break up and never meet again.

848
00:56:41,465 --> 00:56:43,060
That's what people do.

849
00:56:44,306 --> 00:56:45,970
Once you go out and break up,

850
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,001
you never meet again.

851
00:56:49,976 --> 00:56:51,711
Let's get married later.

852
00:56:52,715 --> 00:56:54,441
After I've survived.

853
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,381
After that, let's hold hands,

854
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:02,720
kiss,

855
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:05,120
date,

856
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:08,890
and get married.

857
00:57:13,335 --> 00:57:16,330
This is what you had in mind when you wanted to date me.

858
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:22,771
This is my only way to save you.

859
00:57:23,476 --> 00:57:24,740
If we break up...

860
00:57:25,545 --> 00:57:26,740
and leave like this,

861
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:29,711
do you think you can forget me?

862
00:57:33,415 --> 00:57:34,620
I'll try.

863
00:57:36,355 --> 00:57:37,521
What about Tak Sun Kyung?

864
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:43,361
What about your aunt? Na Ji Na?

865
00:57:48,036 --> 00:57:49,430
Can you forget all of them?

866
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:52,401
Everyone you love?

867
00:57:55,406 --> 00:57:56,571
I will...

868
00:57:57,446 --> 00:57:58,810
also try.

869
00:57:59,215 --> 00:58:00,245
What if you can't?

870
00:58:00,246 --> 00:58:04,111
For the time I have left, I will try my best.

871
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:07,151
I fell in love with you.

872
00:58:17,636 --> 00:58:19,160
I fell in love...

873
00:58:20,465 --> 00:58:21,631
with you.

874
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:26,870
I'm sorry...

875
00:58:28,045 --> 00:58:29,271
for falling in love with you.

876
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,381
Tak Dong Kyung.

877
00:58:56,706 --> 00:58:58,970
Thank you for everything.

878
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:02,571
Bye.

879
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:17,041
To save everyone...

880
01:00:17,585 --> 01:00:19,310
and you,

881
01:00:21,025 --> 01:00:23,151
I must be alone.

882
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:14,941
(Mom. Dad. I love you. From Dong Kyung)

883
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:22,780
(Mom. Dad. I love you.)

884
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:41,430
Sun Kyung.

885
01:01:42,235 --> 01:01:43,560
You'll get hurt.

886
01:02:23,476 --> 01:02:24,771
Oh my gosh.

887
01:02:27,645 --> 01:02:29,041
You don't look like you go to our school.

888
01:02:29,585 --> 01:02:30,810
Do you live here?

889
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,051
Good.

890
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,850
Do you know where the closest grocery store is?

891
01:02:47,136 --> 01:02:49,135
- That hurts. - Come here.

892
01:02:49,136 --> 01:02:50,504
My gosh. Let go of me first.

893
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:52,504
Is this your prep school? My goodness.

894
01:02:52,505 --> 01:02:54,104
If I don't go, I'll have no friends!

895
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:56,104
- You always talk back to me. - Come on.

896
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,874
Wait. I think I lost my hearing.

897
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:58,945
Gosh.

898
01:02:58,946 --> 01:03:02,510
You're unbelievable, Sun Kyung. Seriously.

899
01:03:03,545 --> 01:03:05,981
You're awful. Stop giving Aunt a hard time!

900
01:03:25,576 --> 01:03:27,571
I'm buying. Pick everything you want.

901
01:03:27,676 --> 01:03:30,044
- Everything? - Yes. From here and there.

902
01:03:30,045 --> 01:03:31,414
Then, I want...

903
01:03:31,415 --> 01:03:34,044
the chilli pepper fritters and dried laver fritters.

904
01:03:34,045 --> 01:03:35,084
Okay.

905
01:03:35,085 --> 01:03:37,955
We want the chilli pepper fritters and dried laver fritters.

906
01:03:37,956 --> 01:03:40,180
- And tteokbokki. - Okay. Great.

907
01:03:40,315 --> 01:03:42,124
One serving of tteokbokki.

908
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:44,521
- Fishcake? A serving of fishcake. - Yes.

909
01:04:32,105 --> 01:04:37,501
(Breaking up.)

910
01:04:41,786 --> 01:04:44,385
But to stay alive,

911
01:04:44,386 --> 01:04:45,615
(Breaking up.)

912
01:04:45,616 --> 01:04:48,981
if I must run away from everyone I love,

913
01:04:50,085 --> 01:04:53,450
what is the point of living such a life?

914
01:04:57,295 --> 01:04:58,560
I can do it.

915
01:05:02,136 --> 01:05:03,301
I can do this.

916
01:05:04,806 --> 01:05:07,001
Do you think an open space would make it less dangerous?

917
01:05:13,016 --> 01:05:15,410
Do you think you can get away from me?

918
01:05:17,616 --> 01:05:19,780
- You... - I told you following people...

919
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,021
was my expertise.

920
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:26,191
Why are you doing this to me?

921
01:05:26,826 --> 01:05:28,560
I said I didn't want to see you again.

922
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:33,060
It's midnight.

923
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:41,100
I told you.

924
01:05:42,446 --> 01:05:43,700
When we break up,

925
01:05:45,016 --> 01:05:46,711
we will not see each other again.

926
01:05:46,846 --> 01:05:47,981
No.

927
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:49,881
You didn't say it.

928
01:05:51,145 --> 01:05:52,251
You never said...

929
01:05:53,056 --> 01:05:55,180
what you had been thinking.

930
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:57,990
Not even once.

931
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:01,361
Even when you were sitting there at the age of 10,

932
01:06:01,866 --> 01:06:03,760
when you found out that you were dying,

933
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,660
and when you first met me,

934
01:06:06,366 --> 01:06:08,631
and when you ended up hating me and loving me.

935
01:06:14,076 --> 01:06:16,140
You had never told me how you felt in any of those times.

936
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,881
Tell me everything.

937
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:34,891
Tell me, Dong Kyung.

938
01:07:04,956 --> 01:07:06,421
I want to live.

939
01:07:09,065 --> 01:07:10,620
I really...

940
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:16,160
I really, really want to live.

941
01:07:20,506 --> 01:07:21,671
I...

942
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,671
I want to live with you,

943
01:07:26,975 --> 01:07:28,381
Sun Kyung,

944
01:07:29,885 --> 01:07:31,141
my aunt,

945
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,181
Ji Na,

946
01:07:35,525 --> 01:07:38,490
and everyone else that I love.

947
01:07:40,925 --> 01:07:42,261
I really do.

948
01:07:44,565 --> 01:07:46,830
I really want...

949
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:50,200
I want to live so badly.

950
01:08:00,675 --> 01:08:01,780
Me too.

951
01:08:03,185 --> 01:08:04,610
Me too, Dong Kyung.

952
01:08:21,706 --> 01:08:23,160
I want to be alive...

953
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:26,730
so I can...

954
01:08:31,246 --> 01:08:33,110
So I can die with you.

955
01:09:21,395 --> 01:09:24,591
(Doom at Your Service)

956
01:09:26,196 --> 01:09:29,700
Even if I go back in time, I'd do everything all over again.

957
01:09:30,006 --> 01:09:33,230
I will meet you and love you.

958
01:09:33,605 --> 01:09:35,045
I'm no longer afraid.

959
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:37,171
You changed my world.

960
01:09:37,906 --> 01:09:40,644
I just met with Hyun Kyu and agreed to start seeing him.

961
01:09:40,645 --> 01:09:42,480
Let's cancel our contract.

962
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:45,980
You won't ever see me again because of work.

963
01:09:46,286 --> 01:09:47,410
Auntie.

964
01:09:47,456 --> 01:09:48,851
Dong Kyung.

965
01:09:49,925 --> 01:09:51,650
What should we do now?

966
01:09:51,696 --> 01:09:53,690
Please just tell me what to do.

967
01:09:53,895 --> 01:09:55,160
I will help you.

968
01:09:55,666 --> 01:09:58,330
Just erase each other from each of your destinies.

969
01:10:07,076 --> 01:10:08,076
Don't forget.

970
01:10:08,077 --> 01:10:10,274
We were born with a special kind of fate.

971
01:10:10,275 --> 01:10:11,344
This is Derek.

972
01:10:11,345 --> 01:10:12,615
Tell me everything you know about the culprit.

973
01:10:12,616 --> 01:10:13,715
This may be hard to believe,

974
01:10:13,716 --> 01:10:15,384
but the culprit has a special kind of hearing ability.

975
01:10:15,385 --> 01:10:17,610
If you're wrong, she will be in danger.

976
01:10:17,845 --> 01:10:19,255
Will you take responsibility for what you just said?

977
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:21,181
(Voice 4, The first episode will air at 10:50pm on Friday, June 18.)
