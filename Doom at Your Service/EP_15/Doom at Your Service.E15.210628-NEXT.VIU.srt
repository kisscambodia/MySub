00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:16,246
(All characters, locations, organizations, religions,)

2
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:18,947
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:19,217 --> 00:00:22,485
(3 months later)

4
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:25,426
This is a miracle.

5
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:28,797
Look.

6
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:33,466
(Episode 15)

7
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,997
How is this possible?

8
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:38,066
How could this actually happen?

9
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,806
How can your tumor get smaller...

10
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,676
every time we take the scans?

11
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:44,977
Right?

12
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,406
By next week, it will be gone.

13
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:49,977
Is this possible?

14
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:53,087
Did I misdiagnose you?

15
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:55,256
No, you didn't.

16
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:59,027
- I'm sure you didn't. - I've been a doctor for decades,

17
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:02,556
but I've never seen a case like yours.

18
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:06,167
I've never read anything like this in any of the medical papers.

19
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:09,265
I guess I was lucky.

20
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:11,266
Have you been taking something else in secret?

21
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:17,077
Did you tell your family?

22
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:18,906
I bet they are over the moon.

23
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:21,346
What did your boyfriend say? Isn't he so happy?

24
00:01:22,347 --> 00:01:25,616
Seeing your scan, you can have the wedding you postponed.

25
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:28,715
I'm going to postpone that a bit more.

26
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:29,757
Why?

27
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:33,456
He...

28
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,827
went away far from here.

29
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:02,657
Was everything a dream?

30
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:14,167
Did all of that...

31
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:17,366
truly happen?

32
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:22,607
Were you really...

33
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:25,507
in my life?

34
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:32,216
Tak!

35
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,766
How did you get my number?

36
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:50,365
You never changed your number.

37
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:53,435
But still. You don't get to call me so carelessly like this.

38
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:55,377
I wasn't careless. I was very careful.

39
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:57,076
I told you who I was in a text message.

40
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,276
You said I could call you, so I called you.

41
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:02,716
Whatever. I won't sign with you.

42
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,947
Can I ask why you won't?

43
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,656
Isn't it obvious?

44
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:10,157
I made a debut.

45
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:12,026
I don't have time to write.

46
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:16,856
I'll be in trouble if people find out that I'm a writer.

47
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:17,895
You will be?

48
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:20,266
Of course. The reputation I built...

49
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:25,306
Forget it. Anyway, my answer is the same. End of the story.

50
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:30,707
If you'll be in trouble, I have the upper hand.

51
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:31,945
What?

52
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,616
Then, you must get on my good side.

53
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,416
What did you just say?

54
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,016
You're not on social media or the Internet.

55
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:45,325
And you had no intention of becoming a celebrity...

56
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,227
or an actor. Isn't that the reputation you built?

57
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:49,925
But it turns out that innocent guy, Park Young,

58
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:51,467
was a superstar online writer.

59
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:56,837
Do you even know what "superstar" means?

60
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,467
But you're not supposed to know these words.

61
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:03,306
And he picked Young Prince as his pen name himself.

62
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:09,777
Did you just laugh at me? You're mocking me, right?

63
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:13,485
I didn't pick my pen name.

64
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,787
My mom did.

65
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:18,126
Well, it suits you. It does.

66
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:22,227
Anyway, I might share what I know with some people.

67
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:23,727
And you'll be in trouble.

68
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,195
Are you blackmailing me?

69
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:29,366
Blackmail? No, I'm trying to appease you.

70
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:31,466
Look. My hands are empty.

71
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,536
You don't need a weapon to blackmail people.

72
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:34,636
Yes, you do.

73
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:43,116
Do you think your scary tactic will work on me?

74
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:47,957
I clearly told you where I stand that day.

75
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:49,956
I won't work with anyone...

76
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,385
other than Ms. Tak Dong Kyung.

77
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:53,227
I see. Is that all you need?

78
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,397
(Tak Dong Kyung)

79
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:02,266
(Tak Dong Kyung)

80
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:03,897
Yes. What do you want?

81
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:05,966
This is Cha Joo Ik.

82
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,666
I know. What?

83
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,536
Come as soon as you're done with work, my dear chief manager.

84
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:10,607
What?

85
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:13,707
Are we good?

86
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:25,857
I hope I'll get a positive answer from you.

87
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:27,486
I must get going. I'm busy.

88
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:40,506
Gosh. Seriously.

89
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,977
What's up with this guy?

90
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,547
- Who was that? - Cha Joo Ik.

91
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:51,217
How come he hasn't changed even a bit?

92
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,456
He must still think that he's my senior colleague.

93
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:57,926
Seriously. He can be so rude.

94
00:05:58,087 --> 00:05:59,986
Why did he tell me to come to him without any explanation?

95
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:06,326
Gosh. And he wants me to come to his house.

96
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:09,266
Ji Na, can you drop me off somewhere in that vicinity?

97
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:11,537
I'll do you one better. I'll drop you off at his house.

98
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:15,336
Ji Na. Why don't you come with me?

99
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,707
You've met Mr. Cha before.

100
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:19,407
I'm good.

101
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,847
- Ji Na. - What?

102
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:26,587
You're not talking to him anymore?

103
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:31,426
- You know... - You know what?

104
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,027
You don't talk to him?

105
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:37,196
- I'm sorting things out. - Why?

106
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:41,436
He and I both need some time.

107
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:44,565
I don't think he's going to call you...

108
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:46,606
until you call him first.

109
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,936
Probably. That's what he's like.

110
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:50,537
Is that why you like him?

111
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:52,407
Don't try to get in my head.

112
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,146
You won't fall for it.

113
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:57,047
You're all grown up now.

114
00:06:57,886 --> 00:07:00,185
I've been driving you around from and to the hospital...

115
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,556
for three months as your guardian. So I'm a grown woman now.

116
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,856
I'll pay you back for everything...

117
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:10,626
throughout my life in installments.

118
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:12,696
There's no need. You already did.

119
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:15,366
Your recovery is good enough for me.

120
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:19,107
I'm so proud of you and grateful to you.

121
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:22,907
Same here. Thank you.

122
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:25,047
I'm grateful to you,

123
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:28,176
my auntie, and Sun Kyung.

124
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:29,547
And...

125
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:46,896
So you already signed all the writers you just listed?

126
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:49,297
No. I plan to sign them.

127
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,336
I found an office.

128
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:55,136
The name of the company will be Top 10 Media. What do you think?

129
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:57,805
Is being in the top 10 publishing house your goal or something?

130
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:00,345
No. I'm declaring my resolution that I'll only sign writers...

131
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,916
that would be in the top 10.

132
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,616
Whom are you declaring that to?

133
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,686
You.

134
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:08,086
I heard you've been feeling good lately, so it's my official offer.

135
00:08:09,216 --> 00:08:11,116
Come work for me. I'll take good care of you.

136
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,586
How will you do that?

137
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:14,626
I have a lot of money.

138
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,027
I could brag all I want as well if I never had to prove it.

139
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:19,366
Fine.

140
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:22,367
I'll show you my bragging has teeth through your salary and position.

141
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:25,206
Do you want to be my supporting evidence?

142
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:26,867
Chief Manager Tak?

143
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,507
Gosh.

144
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:31,907
I guess you must be confident that you can sign all those writers.

145
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:34,606
Well, I guess I am confident.

146
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:38,846
How come you didn't include Lee Hyun on the list?

147
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:43,216
You know that her rank is going up every day, right?

148
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:47,555
- I do. - Then, why won't you sign her?

149
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:48,997
It's not that.

150
00:08:51,726 --> 00:08:52,997
I'm letting her be for a while.

151
00:08:53,297 --> 00:08:55,036
Why would you do that?

152
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:56,965
She's not some cultural asset or artwork.

153
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,136
She's a human being.

154
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,136
Go and snatch her whether as your girlfriend or writer.

155
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:01,676
Don't regret it later.

156
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:04,806
She probably needs some time now.

157
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:07,747
Gosh. Why are you both...

158
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:11,175
Time is overrated.

159
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,646
Do you think you'll have all the time in the world?

160
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:15,757
You are taking it for granted.

161
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:18,355
I've been in your shoes,

162
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,386
but you don't need time.

163
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:21,797
You need courage.

164
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:28,897
Hey, that was pretty cool.

165
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,936
I can't believe I'm giving advice to Cha Joo Ik.

166
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:37,306
- "Cha Joo Ik"? - You're not my boss yet.

167
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,776
I'm leaving.

168
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:42,616
I'll get back to you on your offer after I think about it thoroughly.

169
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:44,546
Hey, that's not how I trained you.

170
00:09:44,547 --> 00:09:46,646
Don't think about it thoroughly. Just do it half-heartedly.

171
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:49,157
Yes. This is how you trained me.

172
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:51,256
You're the one who needs to do things without so much care.

173
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,257
Think about it briefly and make your move quickly.

174
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,257
But don't some feelings...

175
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:58,997
get clearer as time goes by?

176
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,436
Like what?

177
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,667
Longing.

178
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:08,075
Seriously. You always have a comeback.

179
00:10:08,076 --> 00:10:09,507
That's how I made my living.

180
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:13,305
Gosh. I thought I would be the one schooling you today.

181
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:15,117
Goodness. I'm so sick of getting schooled.

182
00:10:15,877 --> 00:10:17,776
You always teach me something.

183
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:19,987
And I always end up learning from you.

184
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,617
- What? - I'm leaving.

185
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:25,326
Bye.

186
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,767
Gosh, kids these days.

187
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:04,966
Recharge.

188
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,537
Why couldn't you cross the street?

189
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,747
Dong Kyung.

190
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:30,085
Are you crazy?

191
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:32,027
- Dong Kyung. - Why are you holding my hand?

192
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:36,027
Wait up.

193
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,366
Gosh. You've completely recovered now. You're so strong.

194
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,997
So what? Are you not happy?

195
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:43,667
No. I'm happy.

196
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:47,306
See? I'm wearing the shoes you bought me!

197
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:52,776
What do you think? I'm wearing blue and gray today.

198
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:53,846
You look good.

199
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,517
Gosh, that was so mean!

200
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,476
Why did you say it like you don't even care?

201
00:11:57,877 --> 00:11:59,715
This shirt means so much to me.

202
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:01,586
Treat it nicely.

203
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:04,886
Look. Doesn't the shirt make me look so fresh?

204
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:07,355
Yes, it does. It looks like only you're in summer.

205
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:08,556
Aren't you cold?

206
00:12:08,956 --> 00:12:11,695
That brings me to my question. Can you give me your cardigan?

207
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:12,696
What?

208
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:14,867
Forget it.

209
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:16,935
Your cardigan won't match...

210
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,507
my overall outfit today.

211
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:22,306
See? I have a really sensitive sense of color.

212
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:25,246
If I were a professional colorist...

213
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:26,247
Hey.

214
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:29,176
It's not too late.

215
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:30,845
Do you want to go to school for that?

216
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:33,047
Forget it. I was just joking.

217
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:37,216
I have a real dream now.

218
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,627
A real dream? What is it?

219
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,926
I won't tell you until I fulfill it.

220
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:44,527
Hey.

221
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:49,267
I think it's too small for you. Do you want the cardigan?

222
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:51,266
- Gosh, you don't have to. - Okay.

223
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:52,637
- Fine. - What?

224
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,667
- Give me your cardigan. - Forget it!

225
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,975
Touch my arm. It's so cold!

226
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,306
It's cold!

227
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,206
This is why you catch a cold!

228
00:13:01,277 --> 00:13:02,845
- I won't catch a cold. - Don't be silly.

229
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:05,146
My body is strong. This is how I can stay strong.

230
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:08,656
- You're embarrassing me. - Ta-da!

231
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:11,787
To me, everything feels like a miracle.

232
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:14,685
Whenever I wake up every morning,

233
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:17,256
I wonder if I'm dreaming or not.

234
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:18,725
I sometimes sit there and think.

235
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:20,326
We're not dreaming.

236
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,996
Dong Kyung, you had all the herbal tonics I gave you, right?

237
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:24,297
I'm telling you. That must've been it.

238
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:26,537
- Is that it? - No.

239
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:29,377
No? Then,

240
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,676
is it because of your cooking?

241
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:32,806
Is that it?

242
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:35,575
I think that might be possible.

243
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:39,186
"Might be"? Then, what is it? What's the secret?

244
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:43,216
- Love. - "Love"?

245
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:46,825
Right.

246
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,826
This is all thanks to my biggest love for you.

247
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,167
After going through this,

248
00:13:53,627 --> 00:13:54,997
I realized a lot.

249
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:58,465
So I'm going to move back to Korea.

250
00:13:58,466 --> 00:13:59,806
- What? - All of a sudden?

251
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:02,537
It's not sudden. I was planning to move back.

252
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:04,576
Kevin is settling everything in Canada.

253
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,806
No matter how much I think about it, I can't bring myself to leave you.

254
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:10,547
I can't go back now.

255
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:13,686
What about Kevin? Is he okay with the move?

256
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:16,386
He's totally on board.

257
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:19,287
He values family a lot as you know.

258
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,455
He's so excited to live with you guys.

259
00:14:22,456 --> 00:14:23,527
No way.

260
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:25,926
Then, I get to eat your food every day?

261
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:27,596
Yes.

262
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:31,196
Ask me to cook for you all the time. That's what I live for.

263
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,566
Since we're sharing, I have to tell you something.

264
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:38,137
I'm going back to work.

265
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:41,206
- What? - What? Already?

266
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,277
No.

267
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:45,517
Right. It's too soon.

268
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:48,555
I want to work.

269
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,315
My doctor said I'm fine now.

270
00:14:50,316 --> 00:14:52,787
Did we ask you to go out and make money?

271
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:55,996
You should rest. It's okay to take a break.

272
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:57,297
Right, Dong Kyung.

273
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,825
Or do you want some money?

274
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:02,335
That money was yours, to begin with. Use that money for now.

275
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,167
I'm sick of just lounging around.

276
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,206
Well, scratch that. I didn't mean it.

277
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:12,576
I'm not sick of lounging around,

278
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:16,277
but I want to have fun while working.

279
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:18,017
I guess I need work in my life.

280
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:20,586
No.

281
00:15:21,117 --> 00:15:22,455
Her work ethics is making her life harder.

282
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:25,456
- No. But still. - I'm really okay, Auntie.

283
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:28,286
I can't live my life like some sick person all my life...

284
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:29,696
when I'm so strong.

285
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:31,596
I'm eating a lot too.

286
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:33,367
She has a point.

287
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:35,266
She twisted my wrist.

288
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,867
She was super-strong.

289
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:40,205
Why did you make her twist your wrist?

290
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,606
That must've been exhausting for her.

291
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:44,476
Auntie. Are you serious?

292
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,906
She twisted my wrist. I'm the one in pain.

293
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:47,907
Why would she be tired?

294
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:50,476
Be quiet. Just eat. Eat up.

295
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:53,186
Zucchini again?

296
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:56,657
- You're killing me. - When do you start?

297
00:16:06,826 --> 00:16:10,797
The photo of her and her boyfriend is still her phone wallpaper.

298
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:14,466
I don't think they broke up.

299
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:18,006
Then, what? What happened between them?

300
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:19,177
I don't know.

301
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:20,947
She never talks about him.

302
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:24,576
She just told us that he had to go back to the States.

303
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:26,287
That's all she said.

304
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:27,487
Let it go.

305
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:30,155
If she didn't tell us, there must be a good reason for it.

306
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,257
Exactly.

307
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:34,187
Exactly. What's the reason?

308
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:38,027
Can you ask her? I'm too scared to ask.

309
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:40,166
Hey, I'm scared too.

310
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:42,437
No. Let it go.

311
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:46,537
She just started getting better. Let's not upset her.

312
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:50,237
Stress is the cause of all illnesses.

313
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:51,636
Right.

314
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:08,957
Your package has been shipped out.

315
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,766
Your package was left at your door.

316
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,336
What on earth did I buy so much of?

317
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:33,547
Even so. How come I haven't heard from him all this time?

318
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:43,626
Gosh. That can't be.

319
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,396
No way.

320
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,066
It can't be, right?

321
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:53,737
Right.

322
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:03,576
The look on your face tells me you were doubtful it'd be me.

323
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:06,916
Was I right?

324
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:13,556
Someone told me...

325
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,626
that I needed courage, not time.

326
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,297
I don't know if she's right,

327
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:23,066
but I want to take a chance with what she said.

328
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,207
So I came.

329
00:18:28,437 --> 00:18:29,606
That must've been Dong Kyung.

330
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:33,277
Why? Did she tell you the same thing?

331
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:35,876
Yes.

332
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:37,447
But...

333
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,246
I couldn't muster up my courage.

334
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:41,916
I don't think that's the case. I just beat you to it.

335
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,886
- I didn't call you because... - Sign with me.

336
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:49,325
You broke the contract first.

337
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:50,856
You want another contract?

338
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:58,467
Let's start working together first.

339
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:01,467
I can't go a day without seeing you again.

340
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:05,846
I know you feel uncomfortable and I caused all of it.

341
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:08,677
But I won't apologize for it.

342
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:12,247
I'll be the bad guy.

343
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:16,987
Follow my lead and go with the flow.

344
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:20,987
You're not a bad guy.

345
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:25,197
You can't even leave a crying girl alone.

346
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:30,767
So sign with me.

347
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,306
I'm a kind man.

348
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,635
No. I don't think I can write romance novels anymore.

349
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:39,076
- Why not? - I don't think it's my thing.

350
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:44,547
You can't write a romance novel based on me.

351
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:46,516
- That's not what I meant. - No?

352
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:47,717
No!

353
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:51,487
I've been thinking about this a lot,

354
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:54,356
but I don't think I have a knack for writing romance.

355
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:56,927
You read it too.

356
00:19:57,156 --> 00:19:58,726
I'm a writer. I must create stories.

357
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:00,767
But why do I always write based on my life?

358
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:03,737
So what we have between us is romance?

359
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,166
- What? - If it is, drink with me.

360
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,406
- All of a sudden? - Make another mistake.

361
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:11,207
I'll put up with all of your mistakes.

362
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,106
Make a mistake with me.

363
00:20:21,017 --> 00:20:22,316
It wasn't a mistake.

364
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:26,787
I didn't make a mistake.

365
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:31,656
What I did wasn't a mistake.

366
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:34,566
That's how I felt.

367
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,666
Your story is romantic.

368
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,037
My heart just skipped a beat.

369
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:47,276
That won't get me to sign with you.

370
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:48,947
That's not what I was asking.

371
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:52,646
If you didn't get it, forget it.

372
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,086
Let's stop here. I'll come back another time.

373
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:59,556
Another time? When?

374
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:01,586
When you want to sign with me?

375
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:04,156
Or...

376
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:08,297
when you want to kiss me again.

377
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,096
Auntie.

378
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,277
Aren't you going to work?

379
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:00,747
How come you're not answering me?

380
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:20,537
At this rate, you'll be unemployed forever.

381
00:22:33,447 --> 00:22:34,616
What's wrong?

382
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,287
What I said about you being unemployed made you this sad?

383
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:40,187
I'm not dreaming, right?

384
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:42,757
Did you have a dream?

385
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:45,326
I didn't go to your dream.

386
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:51,866
I missed you.

387
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:55,576
I really...

388
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:58,136
I really wanted to see you.

389
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:01,576
Then, you can see me.

390
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:04,076
Look at me all you want.

391
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:09,056
We were apart for one night. Why did you miss me this much?

392
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:10,916
What are you marking every day?

393
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:12,816
You know...

394
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:16,816
- Good days. - Good days?

395
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,326
Of course. Every day is a good day.

396
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,326
Are you going to eat before you go?

397
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:25,927
You said you're meeting your old colleagues today.

398
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:29,896
Ms. Tak, how long has it been?

399
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:32,536
It's been so long since we met. And the first thing you tell me...

400
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,906
is that you're working for Mr. Cha.

401
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:38,007
- It sort of happened that way. - What?

402
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:40,507
I'm a chief manager now.

403
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:43,415
I'm going to steal all of your best writers.

404
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,415
You'd better be on your toes.

405
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,746
Why would we be?

406
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:48,217
Steal them. Go ahead.

407
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,316
Mr. Park is the one going under, not me.

408
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:53,227
There are tons of publishing houses we can work at.

409
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,287
Is Mr. Cha recruiting more employees?

410
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:57,356
We're just starting out.

411
00:24:57,656 --> 00:24:59,726
He'll probably need more people once we get things going.

412
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:01,996
- Then, scout me first. - Scout me next.

413
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:03,037
Then,

414
00:25:04,197 --> 00:25:05,467
I'll stay here.

415
00:25:07,136 --> 00:25:09,836
I'll stay here and aim for a higher position.

416
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:12,075
Did you hear him?

417
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:13,845
He's always on the lookout to get a promotion.

418
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,676
I guess he wants to boss us around with the promotion.

419
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:18,277
Gosh. Your company seems to be doing so well.

420
00:25:18,747 --> 00:25:21,345
It's hard to see such an ambitious man these days.

421
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:23,487
Wouldn't Mr. Park prefer someone like him?

422
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:25,355
Good for him.

423
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:26,486
Since we're talking about him,

424
00:25:26,487 --> 00:25:29,626
let me tell you how crazy it's been with Mr. Park lately.

425
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:31,596
What? What's going on?

426
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:36,835
So you're telling me that Ms. Jo here...

427
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,896
is going to be in charge of my novel, right?

428
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:41,537
I'm a chief manager now.

429
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:44,335
Hey, this isn't right.

430
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:45,436
I told you a thousand times.

431
00:25:45,437 --> 00:25:48,145
To writers, their novels are like their babies.

432
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,815
And my baby is very shy around strangers.

433
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:51,846
I see.

434
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:56,516
Gosh, come on.

435
00:25:56,517 --> 00:25:58,355
Ms. Jo is great at her job.

436
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,325
Why don't you work with my beautiful editor here?

437
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,696
She has to be beautiful for me to work with her.

438
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:04,625
Come on, man. Goodness.

439
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:07,096
That ugly man always asks for pretty editors.

440
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:09,766
Seriously. He never changes. Hence, his pen name.

441
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:10,895
- Hey. - What?

442
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:12,805
What did you say to me when I told you...

443
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:14,206
- that I was quitting? - What?

444
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:15,776
You told me this kind of incident would never happen again.

445
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:17,575
I only stayed because you promised me that.

446
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,646
"This kind of incident"? What do you mean by that?

447
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:23,677
What? Did you already forget what you did to Ms. Tak?

448
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:27,987
How could you have not learned anything after that incident?

449
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:30,315
I'm so sick of this man. I quit!

450
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:33,426
Ms. Jo. Don't be like that. Sit down.

451
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:35,926
Why are you begging her to stay?

452
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,155
Let her quit.

453
00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:38,456
She's not the only editor in Korea.

454
00:26:38,457 --> 00:26:40,596
Hey, man. Be quiet!

455
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,095
Hey, did you just yell at me?

456
00:26:43,096 --> 00:26:45,536
Listen. Don't be like that, Ms. Jo. Sit down, please.

457
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,565
Hey, are you bringing in that coffee or not?

458
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,676
Did you go to Blue Mountain to grind the coffee beans?

459
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:52,507
I'm upset as it is because my rank has been going down lately.

460
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,575
Both of you are getting on my nerves. Darn it.

461
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:55,606
Gosh.

462
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:01,116
Goodness.

463
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:05,886
Jijo King.

464
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,385
Do you really not know why the ranking of your novel...

465
00:27:08,386 --> 00:27:09,826
has been going down lately?

466
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:12,256
How can anyone tell you the truth...

467
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,026
when you can't work with anyone?

468
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:15,835
What kind of nonsense is that?

469
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:18,436
The readers these days have low standards in novels.

470
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,305
They just don't understand my sophisticated novel.

471
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,805
That's why that loser,

472
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,276
Shanghai Park's novel has been topping the list lately.

473
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:26,207
Hey, Shanghai Park...

474
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:28,707
What are you still doing here?

475
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:31,316
What are you staring at?

476
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:33,287
Are you staring at me?

477
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:38,355
This is driving me crazy.

478
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,956
These new editors are looking down on me these days.

479
00:27:41,957 --> 00:27:43,155
Gosh, no way.

480
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:45,596
I'm not looking down on you. You were talking about me.

481
00:27:48,697 --> 00:27:50,767
"That loser, Shanghai Park".

482
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,197
That's me.

483
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:53,805
- What? - What?

484
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:56,537
Should I explain to you why my novel is topping the list?

485
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:59,447
Or why readers nowadays don't read your novels?

486
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:03,116
What? You were Shanghai Park?

487
00:28:03,477 --> 00:28:05,517
Seriously. You never see what's in front of you.

488
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,345
Right.

489
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:09,786
Every editor tried out writing at least once.

490
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:11,457
I was so surprised.

491
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:14,226
So after that incident, whenever Mr. Park sees her,

492
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:16,896
he always tries to read her...

493
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:24,336
What? What's up with him?

494
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:26,836
I don't know. What's up with him?

495
00:28:27,237 --> 00:28:29,106
How come you didn't tell me?

496
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:32,506
- What? - The promotion and Shanghai Park.

497
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:33,605
Well...

498
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:35,707
Didn't I tell you? I'm the chief manager now.

499
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:36,947
Ms. Jo...

500
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,846
Okay. I can understand why she didn't tell me.

501
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,247
But at least, you should have told me.

502
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,016
- "You"? - "You"?

503
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:44,055
Well, sweetheart.

504
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,086
- "Sweetheart"? - "Sweetheart"?

505
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:48,026
Since everyone shared something,

506
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,896
I'll share my secret now.

507
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:51,356
I'm...

508
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,467
dating her.

509
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,166
- What? - What?

510
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:00,507
Did you know about them, Mr. Cha?

511
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:03,037
What? That Da In was Shanghai Park?

512
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:06,007
No. That Da In and Jung Min are dating.

513
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,345
What?

514
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:10,616
Gosh. I didn't see that coming at all. Kids these days are sneaky.

515
00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:13,116
Anyway, let's talk in person.

516
00:29:13,846 --> 00:29:15,187
In person? Where?

517
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:16,885
Your office.

518
00:29:16,886 --> 00:29:18,517
Send me your address. I'll head over now.

519
00:29:18,787 --> 00:29:20,957
- Hey. Wait. - Bye.

520
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:35,166
Will you marry me?

521
00:29:41,707 --> 00:29:44,247
- How much is this flower here? - Hold on.

522
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,156
What's this?

523
00:29:52,517 --> 00:29:54,086
Is this the office?

524
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:55,656
How is this...

525
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:58,526
You said you got an office. So I came.

526
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:00,096
But you only have two desks here?

527
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:02,027
It's a modest office, isn't it?

528
00:30:02,326 --> 00:30:04,737
I prefer keeping things simple these days.

529
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,237
I don't have a vase at the office.

530
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:10,976
What are you talking about?

531
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,845
I didn't get this for you.

532
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:15,177
Why would an employee buy a flower for the CEO?

533
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,247
Then did you get it from someone?

534
00:30:18,977 --> 00:30:20,947
I obviously...

535
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:23,287
bought it for myself.

536
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:27,226
You even buy flowers for yourself? What a life.

537
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:28,885
Are you being sarcastic?

538
00:30:28,886 --> 00:30:30,497
No, I'm just relieved.

539
00:30:31,427 --> 00:30:34,096
I'm just relieved to see that you have a happy life.

540
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,395
Stop changing the subject.

541
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:39,466
You said I was going to be the chief manager.

542
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:42,236
That's why I came. But what's this?

543
00:30:42,237 --> 00:30:45,007
You are the chief manager. You're Chief Manager Park.

544
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,006
Then where's my team?

545
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:50,977
You're the manager...

546
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:53,517
and a member of your team.

547
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:55,687
Chief Manager Park.

548
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,356
That's how startups work these days. You should know that.

549
00:30:59,556 --> 00:31:01,226
And what's this news about Da In and Jung Min going out?

550
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:02,456
Oh, right. You won't believe it.

551
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:04,756
Da In's last name is Kim, right?

552
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:07,197
So I found it weird that her pen name was Shanghai Park.

553
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:10,437
And it turns out she used "Park" because it's Jung Min's last name.

554
00:31:10,997 --> 00:31:14,166
I saw them almost break up and make up again.

555
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:15,707
It was unbelievable.

556
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:18,177
Are all writers like that?

557
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:21,106
Why do they create their pen names based on the person they like?

558
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,277
- Did you meet Ji Na? - What?

559
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:29,217
Yes, I did.

560
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,017
But she told me she doesn't want to write romance novels.

561
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,487
Apparently, she's not up for it anymore.

562
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:35,456
So what? Are you're going to give up on romance?

563
00:31:35,457 --> 00:31:37,527
What else can I do? She says she's not up for it.

564
00:31:38,927 --> 00:31:40,895
But judging by her behavior,

565
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:42,866
she doesn't seem completely uninterested.

566
00:31:43,797 --> 00:31:45,437
I guess you haven't given up on romance.

567
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:49,237
I encourage writers to write whatever genre they want to write.

568
00:31:49,606 --> 00:31:53,447
No, not that. I was talking about the romance between you and her.

569
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,645
At this rate,

570
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:02,286
you guys will fight and end up going to Bali to reconcile.

571
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,287
"Bali"?

572
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:06,385
I prefer Hawaii to Bali.

573
00:32:06,386 --> 00:32:08,957
I obviously wasn't being literal.

574
00:32:09,187 --> 00:32:12,197
Do you lose your common sense when you like someone?

575
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:15,596
I didn't know that about myself, but I guess so.

576
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:19,365
Forget it. Give me the contract. I'll make her sign it.

577
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:20,767
I already gave her the contract.

578
00:32:21,237 --> 00:32:22,777
But you didn't get her to sign it?

579
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:26,346
I wouldn't put it like that. Let's just say I postponed it.

580
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,345
What are you doing? Are you playing hard to get?

581
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:30,375
Yes.

582
00:32:30,376 --> 00:32:34,146
But deep down inside, I'm trying to lure her to sign it.

583
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:36,517
That's what he said.

584
00:32:37,187 --> 00:32:39,217
I think I picked the wrong guy.

585
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,527
I agree.

586
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:43,596
How are you going to beat that guy?

587
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:46,427
How did you end up liking a guy like him?

588
00:32:47,727 --> 00:32:49,866
- I don't... - What? You don't like him?

589
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:51,166
I do.

590
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:54,767
You're finally acknowledging your feelings.

591
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,606
You're all grown up now.

592
00:32:58,707 --> 00:33:00,645
I have no idea what to do.

593
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:01,677
Ji Na.

594
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:04,947
Once you reach an ending, it means it's time to write a new novel.

595
00:33:05,846 --> 00:33:07,846
But who knows how that one's going to end?

596
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:10,916
How would anyone know? You'll only know once you're there.

597
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,555
What if I give up and never finish it?

598
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:15,556
That's still okay. You can always write a new novel.

599
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,197
Some stories just don't have a clear ending.

600
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:22,266
That kind of stuff sometimes end up attracting more attention.

601
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:24,895
You know Young Prince, right?

602
00:33:24,896 --> 00:33:27,867
After he suddenly stopped writing, he suddenly got more subscribers.

603
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:32,036
Because he stopped, he ended up becoming a legend.

604
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:36,476
So just do it. Give it a try.

605
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:39,347
I'll always be there to support you.

606
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:45,086
What about you? What happened to that guy?

607
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:46,856
The doctor.

608
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:50,697
I'm waiting.

609
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:52,657
You're waiting?

610
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:54,927
Yes.

611
00:33:55,927 --> 00:34:00,006
He went somewhere really far away.

612
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:01,836
It's somewhere I can't follow.

613
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:04,177
Plus, he wouldn't want that either.

614
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:08,847
So I'm going to stay healthy and happy until we meet again.

615
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:12,887
Otherwise, he might nag at me as soon as we meet.

616
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:14,717
He wants me...

617
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:18,186
to be happy for as long as I live.

618
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:24,757
Hey. The weather's nice today. How about we go for a drive?

619
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:27,027
Sure.

620
00:34:27,827 --> 00:34:29,225
Did you think I'd say that?

621
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:30,797
You're not done writing.

622
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,236
Can't I just leave it here?

623
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,506
No, finish it.

624
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:36,536
Finish writing that and sign the contract.

625
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:37,777
That's what I'm waiting for.

626
00:34:37,936 --> 00:34:39,646
You're like a thief.

627
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:42,146
- Are you threatening me? - Ji Na.

628
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:55,927
You were determined to do anything for me.

629
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:59,597
Did you forget how determined you were that day?

630
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,097
Did you?

631
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:09,606
I already signed it. Take it.

632
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,177
Thank you, Ji Na.

633
00:35:13,876 --> 00:35:15,976
Now go ahead and write your next episode.

634
00:35:17,277 --> 00:35:19,216
Hey, you should try writing a novel.

635
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,447
Don't be absurd.

636
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:23,656
I heard all editors have experience writing novels.

637
00:35:23,657 --> 00:35:24,815
I heard you guys get motivated...

638
00:35:24,816 --> 00:35:26,526
to write your own stuff as you edit manuscripts.

639
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:29,225
Gosh, but I had absolutely no idea that Da In...

640
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:31,226
would actually put that into action.

641
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,395
You used to be a good writer back when you were in school.

642
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:34,396
You should also...

643
00:35:34,626 --> 00:35:36,637
give it a try so we can share this pain together.

644
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:38,395
I don't know if your goal is to make me write...

645
00:35:38,396 --> 00:35:40,006
or if it's to give me pain.

646
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:43,436
But I can see that "pain" is the object of the sentence.

647
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:46,076
Forget it. I have nothing to write about.

648
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,346
What do you mean?

649
00:35:47,347 --> 00:35:48,946
Just think of it as a diary.

650
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,746
At first, we all start by writing about ourselves.

651
00:35:51,347 --> 00:35:53,816
I see. Like you?

652
00:35:53,947 --> 00:35:56,356
And how did that work out for you?

653
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:58,657
Forget it.

654
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:00,786
I dug up my own grave.

655
00:36:05,626 --> 00:36:08,327
But what's that flower? Who gave it to you?

656
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:14,336
I'm just going to think that I got it from someone.

657
00:36:18,077 --> 00:36:19,606
I see. It's pretty.

658
00:36:20,146 --> 00:36:22,606
Yes, it's pretty, right?

659
00:36:30,617 --> 00:36:31,855
What should I do now?

660
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,725
If you're done with work, you can get ready to go home.

661
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:34,786
No, not that.

662
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:37,726
I mean, from now on.

663
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:42,297
My sister's okay now,

664
00:36:42,626 --> 00:36:44,467
so there's nothing more I ask for.

665
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:47,705
But after having experienced something so big,

666
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,867
it really makes me think a lot.

667
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:51,875
Think a lot about what?

668
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,676
Just about what I should do from now on.

669
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:57,047
What I should do for a living. Stuff like that.

670
00:36:58,077 --> 00:36:59,246
Should I help you out with that?

671
00:37:01,447 --> 00:37:04,786
How would you like to run a second location?

672
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:08,186
- What? - You told me you enjoy this job.

673
00:37:08,557 --> 00:37:10,856
I've been watching you, and you're good at this.

674
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,967
I'll give you a hefty paycheck. What do you say? Interested?

675
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,796
Do you need time to think about it?

676
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:18,766
What's there to think about? I'm totally up for it.

677
00:37:19,297 --> 00:37:20,706
I'm totally grateful.

678
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,907
- Hey, Mr. Lee. - Yes?

679
00:37:33,246 --> 00:37:35,186
I actually have something to confess.

680
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,185
Sit down for a second.

681
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:39,157
You have something to confess? What's that?

682
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:42,387
I'm fine as long as it's not a love confession.

683
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:44,996
Well, it's kind of similar.

684
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:46,527
What?

685
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,097
To be honest,

686
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:52,867
I'm friends with Ji Na.

687
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:55,737
- Your first love. - What?

688
00:37:57,036 --> 00:37:58,277
How do you know her?

689
00:37:58,436 --> 00:38:01,046
She's close with my sister, so I've known her for 10 years.

690
00:38:01,047 --> 00:38:02,347
And now she's like a sister...

691
00:38:03,777 --> 00:38:05,447
She's like a brother to me.

692
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,486
I didn't know from the beginning. I found out later on.

693
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:12,785
But I couldn't find the right time to tell you,

694
00:38:12,786 --> 00:38:14,126
which is why I haven't.

695
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:15,327
I'm sorry.

696
00:38:16,057 --> 00:38:17,496
You don't need to be sorry.

697
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:19,696
I'm not trying to make excuses,

698
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,427
but after I found out you were that jerk...

699
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:26,065
I mean, after I found out you were that guy,

700
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:28,307
I really wanted things to work out between you two.

701
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:31,077
I mean, you're a really great guy.

702
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,106
Thank you.

703
00:38:34,206 --> 00:38:35,476
I'm serious.

704
00:38:35,976 --> 00:38:37,745
Every time I saw you spacing out,

705
00:38:37,746 --> 00:38:39,245
I got really upset.

706
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:40,416
Did I do that?

707
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:43,387
I should've made more of an effort to help you out.

708
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:47,027
It's okay. There's no point.

709
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:50,226
That's what I think these days.

710
00:38:51,557 --> 00:38:54,927
It wouldn't have worked out even if anyone tried to help.

711
00:38:55,827 --> 00:38:57,867
After all, I brought this upon myself.

712
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:00,936
Mr. Lee.

713
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,706
- You sound like an adult. - Hey.

714
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,436
I'm already older than you.

715
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:10,717
But you're okay now, right?

716
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,886
Yes, of course. I'm always okay.

717
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:16,145
I'm done thinking about the past.

718
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,015
I'm going to run toward the future...

719
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,186
Is everything also okay with your friend?

720
00:39:23,557 --> 00:39:26,356
- What? - It's just that...

721
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:29,996
I don't want you to end up losing a friend as well.

722
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,266
Gosh, I'm sorry. That was out of line.

723
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:18,146
How about we go for a game?

724
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,237
You win.

725
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,066
You're right. That's a first.

726
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:53,176
You said you wanted my car, right?

727
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:55,947
No, let's just forget about that bet we made.

728
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:01,126
I want to start over again.

729
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:03,327
Sure.

730
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:08,027
Neither of us should go easy on the other person.

731
00:41:18,237 --> 00:41:19,536
How's your new place?

732
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,376
It's okay, I guess.

733
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:26,987
Do you need anything?

734
00:41:28,516 --> 00:41:29,547
Joo Ik.

735
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:32,557
I'm sorry, but I can't give you that.

736
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:41,967
Joo Ik.

737
00:41:43,797 --> 00:41:45,766
Let's play ball from time to time.

738
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,007
Not too often.

739
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:50,307
And we can go for some drinks afterward.

740
00:41:53,106 --> 00:41:54,476
Wouldn't that be impossible?

741
00:41:56,376 --> 00:41:57,916
I like that answer of yours.

742
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:00,217
You sound determined to beat me.

743
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:08,527
But I really hope that happens one day.

744
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:26,996
Hey.

745
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:29,367
Are you doing well?

746
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:33,097
I'm...

747
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:37,137
doing okay. It's the same every day.

748
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:41,376
The flowers you gave me have wilted.

749
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:46,447
And looking at them made me feel sad.

750
00:44:47,586 --> 00:44:50,786
So I got myself a new one pretending like I got it from you.

751
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:52,887
It's pretty, isn't it?

752
00:44:56,286 --> 00:44:58,296
Once this one wilts,

753
00:44:58,297 --> 00:45:02,297
I'll buy a new one and pretend like you got it for me again.

754
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:05,036
I'll do that again and again.

755
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:08,467
That's how I'll continue to live.

756
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:13,876
That's okay, right?

757
00:45:40,706 --> 00:45:44,105
One day, Doom came through my front door.

758
00:45:44,106 --> 00:45:45,976
(One day, Doom came through my front door.)

759
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,177
Hello.

760
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:50,217
Who are you?

761
00:45:54,646 --> 00:45:55,686
Myul Mang.

762
00:46:06,327 --> 00:46:08,225
The world had come to a stop,

763
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:10,566
and Doom and I were the only ones that could move.

764
00:46:11,336 --> 00:46:14,205
Doom, standing across the street, slowly walked toward me...

765
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:16,336
as if he was taking a walk.

766
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:20,777
I stared at him as if I was bewitched.

767
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:23,506
I was down on my knees,

768
00:46:23,507 --> 00:46:25,246
and he held out his hand.

769
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:27,387
"Choose."

770
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:30,146
Choose. Will you die here and now?

771
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:32,016
Or will you take my hand?

772
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:36,356
I just sat there and stared into his eyes.

773
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:39,697
His deep, yet emotionless eyes.

774
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:43,366
"Is this hand of yours the long-awaited answer..."

775
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,737
"to my question?"

776
00:46:45,996 --> 00:46:49,266
My hand trembled as I held his hand.

777
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:54,646
And he gave me a smile of satisfaction.

778
00:46:58,347 --> 00:47:02,717
And just like that, I held Doom's hand.

779
00:47:23,836 --> 00:47:24,936
Here.

780
00:47:25,606 --> 00:47:28,876
How could you not even give me a heads up?

781
00:47:29,307 --> 00:47:32,216
That CEO of yours has huge eyes,

782
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,987
pale white skin, and really tall.

783
00:47:35,246 --> 00:47:36,487
I was really scared, you know.

784
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:40,157
I thought he wanted to meet me to suck my blood out.

785
00:47:41,786 --> 00:47:43,327
He does suck your blood dry.

786
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:46,026
- What? - He really does that.

787
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:47,467
He sucks your blood dry.

788
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,536
I'm not going to sign this contract.

789
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:52,696
How do you expect me to sign a deal after hearing that?

790
00:47:52,697 --> 00:47:55,606
No, he'll suck your blood dry if you don't sign the contract.

791
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:59,137
He doesn't mess with people who are on his side.

792
00:48:04,617 --> 00:48:08,447
Instead, you'd better make sure no one finds out who I am.

793
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,816
My goodness, of course.

794
00:48:11,217 --> 00:48:13,657
Should I order something else for you?

795
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:16,657
No, it's okay. I'm on a diet.

796
00:48:17,757 --> 00:48:20,156
You're eating tteokbokki when you're on a diet?

797
00:48:20,157 --> 00:48:22,196
What? Do you have a problem with that?

798
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:25,596
Gosh, no. I'm just really worried. That's all.

799
00:48:25,597 --> 00:48:27,565
"How can he eat nothing else but tteokbokki?"

800
00:48:27,566 --> 00:48:29,736
"I feel so bad for him."

801
00:48:29,737 --> 00:48:32,206
That's what I meant.

802
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:34,206
You little punk.

803
00:48:35,007 --> 00:48:37,316
Oh, by the way, I read that novel.

804
00:48:38,117 --> 00:48:40,217
You know the storyline you told me about last time?

805
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,186
If you choose the person you love, the world comes to an end.

806
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,757
If you choose to protect the world, the person you love has to die.

807
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:50,157
What was it called again?

808
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:52,026
I have no idea.

809
00:48:52,027 --> 00:48:55,927
Anyway, that story about doom is the story you mentioned, right?

810
00:48:57,027 --> 00:48:59,197
Dong Kyung, are you close with the writer?

811
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,967
What? Why do you ask?

812
00:49:02,967 --> 00:49:05,205
Because I can already tell that it's going to be a sad ending.

813
00:49:05,206 --> 00:49:06,807
I want it to have a happy ending.

814
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:10,347
Can you ask the writer if it's going to be a sad or happy ending?

815
00:49:10,746 --> 00:49:13,077
I cry easily, so I can't read it if it's going to be sad.

816
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,487
If it's going to be a sad story, I shouldn't even start reading it.

817
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,186
Aren't you close with the writer?

818
00:49:21,757 --> 00:49:22,827
Forget it then.

819
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:45,447
So live.

820
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:48,387
As you live life, you'll realize one day...

821
00:49:50,016 --> 00:49:52,487
that there was a reason behind everything you went through.

822
00:49:53,217 --> 00:49:55,356
You'll find out that it was a happy ending.

823
00:49:57,726 --> 00:49:59,995
I still have no idea...

824
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:02,266
what kind of ending I'm going to have.

825
00:50:02,827 --> 00:50:06,637
I just stand here imagining myself holding hands with you...

826
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:09,637
and having my body wrapped around your arms.

827
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:14,277
Because this world is still filled with things that disappear.

828
00:50:15,876 --> 00:50:18,416
It's filled with you.

829
00:50:24,257 --> 00:50:26,257
Auntie, where are you?

830
00:50:26,987 --> 00:50:28,356
Should we all meet up for a meal?

831
00:50:30,086 --> 00:50:31,126
Here.

832
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:33,726
How did you find this place?

833
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,466
I know, right?

834
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:37,027
I love this place.

835
00:50:37,737 --> 00:50:39,597
I'm using the bag Dong Kyung got me...

836
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,467
for the first time today.

837
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:43,066
Ta-da.

838
00:50:43,936 --> 00:50:46,536
Me too. The sneakers Dong Kyung bought me. Number eight.

839
00:50:47,007 --> 00:50:48,746
I didn't bring mine because it's a pen.

840
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,446
But I'll pay for dinner.

841
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:52,875
- Come on. - No.

842
00:50:52,876 --> 00:50:54,886
I have good news. I want to pay.

843
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:56,286
Good news? What?

844
00:50:57,557 --> 00:50:59,487
It's too soon to say.

845
00:50:59,617 --> 00:51:02,056
I'll tell you once it's all set,

846
00:51:02,057 --> 00:51:04,426
so wait a little.

847
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:07,526
I'm the oldest though. I should pay.

848
00:51:07,527 --> 00:51:08,966
It's okay, all of you.

849
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:12,036
Since it's my celebration, I'm buying.

850
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:14,407
What are you celebrating?

851
00:51:14,907 --> 00:51:17,476
Being healthy? Getting a new job?

852
00:51:19,507 --> 00:51:20,507
No.

853
00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:23,807
Celebrating spending a day that was full and healthy.

854
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,217
Celebrating how sunny it was today.

855
00:51:26,646 --> 00:51:28,516
- Cheers. - Cheers.

856
00:51:29,617 --> 00:51:31,856
True. It really was nice out today.

857
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:33,356
Me too.

858
00:51:33,516 --> 00:51:35,286
I worked super hard.

859
00:51:35,987 --> 00:51:38,256
The laundry dried really nicely.

860
00:51:38,257 --> 00:51:39,356
It felt good.

861
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:49,507
Well... It would've been nice if he...

862
00:51:50,677 --> 00:51:51,777
could've joined us.

863
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:54,706
I know. I miss him.

864
00:51:56,677 --> 00:51:57,876
Is he doing well?

865
00:52:01,146 --> 00:52:02,745
Should I book a flight right now?

866
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:05,315
Let's fly over there. I got 900 on the TOEIC.

867
00:52:05,316 --> 00:52:06,856
He thinks he's all that because he's American?

868
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:08,956
I'll tell him...

869
00:52:09,257 --> 00:52:10,996
that you all miss him.

870
00:52:11,456 --> 00:52:14,466
Are you doing a video call? When? Let me join you.

871
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:15,995
Stay out of it.

872
00:52:15,996 --> 00:52:18,066
You'll just whine as soon as you see him.

873
00:52:18,436 --> 00:52:20,296
Let me join. I'll scold him...

874
00:52:20,297 --> 00:52:21,436
Enough.

875
00:52:21,637 --> 00:52:23,007
Just eat.

876
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:27,507
- Eat. Eat up. - Eat up.

877
00:53:26,566 --> 00:53:28,535
I know you don't want to do this, but try to smile.

878
00:53:28,536 --> 00:53:30,206
It's not that I don't want to do it.

879
00:53:30,976 --> 00:53:32,106
But what's the purpose?

880
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,876
- What? - To look at it from time to time?

881
00:53:36,976 --> 00:53:40,516
Yes. To look at it from time to time.

882
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:10,105
(Human)

883
00:54:10,106 --> 00:54:12,217
(Message)

884
00:54:13,347 --> 00:54:16,415
I had dinner with everyone tonight...

885
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:18,217
and they all say they miss you.

886
00:54:41,777 --> 00:54:45,777
(New Messages)

887
00:54:47,146 --> 00:54:49,186
I saw you in my dream today.

888
00:54:50,117 --> 00:54:52,016
I saw you in my dream again today.

889
00:54:53,887 --> 00:54:55,027
I miss you.

890
00:54:57,186 --> 00:55:00,327
It's just that I never tried before. Now that I did, I can figure it out.

891
00:55:02,797 --> 00:55:06,237
I thought a lot about what to send in my first text...

892
00:55:08,637 --> 00:55:09,766
You're happy, right?

893
00:55:11,777 --> 00:55:13,007
I trust you are.

894
00:55:17,146 --> 00:55:18,547
You couldn't do it.

895
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,316
You couldn't send it.

896
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:28,557
(Send)

897
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:19,637
I'll be back.

898
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:13,487
Hi.

899
00:58:14,456 --> 00:58:15,586
How have you been?

900
00:58:20,126 --> 00:58:21,566
How about you?

901
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:23,597
You weren't in the hospital.

902
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,496
I got surgery.

903
00:58:26,237 --> 00:58:27,266
Surgery?

904
00:58:35,007 --> 00:58:36,077
Can you feel it?

905
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:40,717
It's beating well.

906
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:44,186
Human heart is very warm.

907
00:58:44,617 --> 00:58:46,416
It's strong and keeps beating.

908
00:58:48,856 --> 00:58:51,496
I think it'll be the longest life yet thanks to you.

909
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:57,266
I'm glad.

910
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,737
Thank you for being alive.

911
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:05,436
That's what I wanted to say.

912
00:59:06,907 --> 00:59:08,347
You beat me to it.

913
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:14,916
I should go since I saw you were doing well.

914
00:59:15,646 --> 00:59:16,816
See you again.

915
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:35,035
Take this. It's raining.

916
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:36,066
What about you?

917
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:37,467
Me?

918
00:59:40,036 --> 00:59:41,976
It's close. I can run.

919
01:00:11,907 --> 01:00:15,206
It's so pretty and growing nicely.

920
01:00:26,016 --> 01:00:27,057
Hey, there.

921
01:00:27,186 --> 01:00:28,856
Don't give me that.

922
01:00:34,726 --> 01:00:35,766
How is she?

923
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:37,766
Is she doing well?

924
01:00:39,467 --> 01:00:42,166
She's doing well and not well.

925
01:00:45,737 --> 01:00:49,177
Don't be sad. Today is a happy day.

926
01:00:55,646 --> 01:00:56,816
It grew well.

927
01:00:57,746 --> 01:00:59,387
You've become a good kid.

928
01:01:12,137 --> 01:01:14,266
You've grown a very pretty flower.

929
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:18,336
- What do you mean? - You're a butterfly.

930
01:01:19,436 --> 01:01:21,476
A butterfly for flowers in my garden.

931
01:01:25,277 --> 01:01:26,717
Do you think the butterfly knew...

932
01:01:27,246 --> 01:01:30,586
that once it died, it would become a flower as well?

933
01:01:33,617 --> 01:01:34,686
No.

934
01:01:35,226 --> 01:01:37,427
You didn't know, but that was what you chose.

935
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,226
For your one and only flower.

936
01:01:42,467 --> 01:01:44,096
This flower bloomed...

937
01:01:44,097 --> 01:01:45,867
from the dead butterfly turning into fertilizer.

938
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:51,376
You made this flower bloom.

939
01:01:52,907 --> 01:01:53,976
It's you.

940
01:01:55,547 --> 01:01:57,106
You're no longer a butterfly.

941
01:01:57,777 --> 01:02:00,816
You're the first flower that I created.

942
01:02:11,496 --> 01:02:14,027
- This is me? - That's right.

943
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:15,697
So...

944
01:02:18,036 --> 01:02:19,466
my real fate is...

945
01:02:19,467 --> 01:02:21,507
Living happily in this garden.

946
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:27,336
Not as a butterfly, but as a flower. As a human being.

947
01:02:28,476 --> 01:02:30,206
Was this your plan from the start?

948
01:02:32,177 --> 01:02:34,916
- Did you know from the start... - I didn't know,

949
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:37,316
but I always believed in you two.

950
01:02:39,086 --> 01:02:40,157
Sorry,

951
01:02:40,617 --> 01:02:42,456
but I always had faith and hoped.

952
01:02:49,367 --> 01:02:50,496
So go.

953
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,536
You can resent me and regret later.

954
01:02:55,266 --> 01:02:56,666
She's waiting.

955
01:02:58,307 --> 01:02:59,706
I don't resent you.

956
01:03:01,777 --> 01:03:02,907
I'm simply...

957
01:03:09,816 --> 01:03:10,916
happy.

958
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:15,757
Because...

959
01:03:22,027 --> 01:03:23,496
I can see her again.

960
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:26,367
Good.

961
01:03:28,766 --> 01:03:31,166
I've always wanted to see you smile like that.

962
01:03:32,507 --> 01:03:33,876
I'm good now that I saw it.

963
01:03:34,746 --> 01:03:35,947
Since I got to see it.

964
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,847
Let's say bye here.

965
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:43,686
Go. Don't stop.

966
01:03:44,316 --> 01:03:46,316
When you get there, love. Don't stop.

967
01:03:47,316 --> 01:03:48,757
Live happily like that.

968
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:53,596
But you'll be alone again if I leave.

969
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:56,597
No. We're always together.

970
01:03:58,066 --> 01:03:59,737
I'm always with you.

971
01:04:00,836 --> 01:04:03,566
I'll always watch over you, water you, and raise you.

972
01:04:04,137 --> 01:04:06,307
Always hoping you'll be happy.

973
01:04:07,836 --> 01:04:12,117
Let's meet again later. Much later. Here.

974
01:04:15,387 --> 01:04:16,447
Smile.

975
01:04:17,686 --> 01:04:20,456
I always want you to smile.

976
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:22,456
Don't forget that.

977
01:04:31,996 --> 01:04:34,197
Take this with you. It's raining there.

978
01:04:38,106 --> 01:04:40,777
Get going. She's waiting.

979
01:04:53,987 --> 01:04:55,186
Happy birthday.

980
01:05:10,566 --> 01:05:11,606
Goodbye,

981
01:05:12,907 --> 01:05:14,007
Human.

982
01:05:30,057 --> 01:05:32,396
Hi. How are you?

983
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:35,496
Everything's good with me as usual.

984
01:05:35,797 --> 01:05:37,827
Thank you. Come again.

985
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,705
- Hi. - One gimbap please.

986
01:05:41,706 --> 01:05:43,436
I smile at times...

987
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:48,006
The event is as I described last week...

988
01:05:48,007 --> 01:05:49,806
Hello? Hello?

989
01:05:49,807 --> 01:05:51,516
Did you hang up? Hello?

990
01:05:54,217 --> 01:05:55,246
Seriously!

991
01:05:56,887 --> 01:05:58,415
I get angry at times.

992
01:05:58,416 --> 01:05:59,617
Darn it.

993
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:11,766
I get bored at times.

994
01:06:21,706 --> 01:06:23,705
(You've fully paid off your loan.)

995
01:06:23,706 --> 01:06:25,915
(We'd like to thank you and congratulate you.)

996
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:27,846
Then at times,

997
01:06:27,847 --> 01:06:30,316
there are moments that feel like gifts.

998
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:49,336
There are also moments that are excruciating.

999
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:54,976
But I still live...

1000
01:06:55,606 --> 01:06:57,577
because you gave me this life.

1001
01:06:59,376 --> 01:07:02,686
But I still walk because that is life.

1002
01:07:08,827 --> 01:07:10,456
I wonder where you are.

1003
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:14,597
I wonder what you're passing by right now.

1004
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:27,536
Perhaps you've already come to me.

1005
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:33,547
With a completely different face, with a completely different look.

1006
01:07:34,677 --> 01:07:37,347
As a completely different being.

1007
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:40,517
When I think about that,

1008
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:44,057
I end up looking carefully at every person's face that I see.

1009
01:07:45,126 --> 01:07:49,166
I end up looking into every person's life that I meet.

1010
01:07:50,696 --> 01:07:51,866
I wonder...

1011
01:07:53,137 --> 01:07:55,467
"Is that him?" "Is that him?"

1012
01:08:30,067 --> 01:08:31,977
If I walk past you,

1013
01:08:32,307 --> 01:08:36,246
will you take my hand as you always did?

1014
01:08:37,776 --> 01:08:39,576
Even if it's only briefly.

1015
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:43,086
It's okay if it's only for a brief moment.

1016
01:08:45,156 --> 01:08:46,317
Please hold my hand.

1017
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,326
Please hold me.

1018
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:29,126
Do you have an umbrella?

1019
01:09:30,097 --> 01:09:31,467
It's raining out.

1020
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,637
What...

1021
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:36,866
What's your deal?

1022
01:09:44,276 --> 01:09:45,416
I'm your hand holder.

1023
01:10:27,187 --> 01:10:31,187
(Doom at Your Service)

1024
01:10:31,387 --> 01:10:32,996
I no longer bring doom.

1025
01:10:33,427 --> 01:10:36,726
I am human just like you.

1026
01:10:36,727 --> 01:10:38,196
This isn't a dream, is it?

1027
01:10:38,797 --> 01:10:39,897
Hey!

1028
01:10:40,467 --> 01:10:41,467
Are you listening?

1029
01:10:41,468 --> 01:10:43,606
Are you sleeping?

1030
01:10:43,607 --> 01:10:46,177
So? Will you be my girlfriend?

1031
01:10:46,406 --> 01:10:47,576
What if I refuse?

1032
01:10:48,547 --> 01:10:49,776
How's life?

1033
01:10:51,717 --> 01:10:52,717
It's nice.

1034
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,416
Live with me forever.

1035
01:10:55,116 --> 01:10:56,517
I thought it was the end...

1036
01:10:57,616 --> 01:10:59,187
since destiny doesn't change.

1037
01:10:59,387 --> 01:11:02,086
Don't disappear on me. Ever.
