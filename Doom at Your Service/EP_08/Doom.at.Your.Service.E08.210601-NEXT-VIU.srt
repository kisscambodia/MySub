00:00:12,938 --> 00:00:15,948
(All characters, locations, organizations, religions,)

2
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:18,614
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:23,314
(Episode 8)

4
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,714
I knew you would come.

5
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:52,684
It was inevitable.

6
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,665
Did you think I wouldn't be able to...

7
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,164
find you if you hide?

8
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,474
I can't stop myself. I can't.

9
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,944
I cannot.

10
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,144
I told you I could see right through you.

11
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,955
That you're a good guy.

12
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,185
I know that.

13
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,955
This feeling of inability to stop myself...

14
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,424
What should I call it?

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,724
You can't run away before you grant me my wish.

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,664
I said you could go...

17
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:36,694
after you grant me my wish.

18
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,235
Don't you remember?

19
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:40,875
I do not know the answer to that.

20
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,605
So I can just...

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,705
- Tak Dong Kyung. - I'm going to kill...

22
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,985
So the only thing I could do is call it you.

23
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,694
You've gone mad.

24
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,065
- Why did you cut the bracelet? - Have you gone mad?

25
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:41,800
Why didn't you come to me sooner?

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,069
And how could you put a pillow under my head and leave?

27
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,435
That's infuriating.

28
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,004
What infuriated you?

29
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,379
Not showing up or putting a pillow under your head?

30
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,875
Putting a pillow under my head.

31
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:54,474
Gosh.

32
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:02,984
Did you just smile?

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,655
How can you smile right now?

34
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:07,754
You're smiling too.

35
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:10,824
You're smiling too.

36
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,895
Gosh. What an attention-seeker.

37
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,939
If you were going to stay away, you should've done it right.

38
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,264
Why leave me a hint?

39
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,175
I was trying not to do it.

40
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:26,805
For how long?

41
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,544
As long as I could.

42
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,284
You must've forgotten.

43
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,585
I don't have that much time on my hands.

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,694
I'll tell you.

45
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,275
I will tell you everything.

46
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,834
It's all my fault.

47
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,875
You losing your parents.

48
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:35,875
All the time you had to spend at the beach.

49
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,685
All the misfortunes.

50
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,615
And your illness. Everything.

51
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,964
You know what? You need to learn how to communicate first.

52
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,109
Why does everything you tell me sound like a riddle?

53
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:00,979
Or give me better hints at least.

54
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:02,535
Make it more understandable for me.

55
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:07,344
I'm saying you're miserable...

56
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,579
because I exist.

57
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,485
So are you saying you're winter, darkness, and the end of everything?

58
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,685
Yes.

59
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,995
Hey. I like winter.

60
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,324
I like the darkness of the night, and I like it when things end.

61
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:26,770
If you think about it,

62
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,735
spring, morning, and new beginnings also come because of you.

63
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,065
It means you're responsible for both my misery and happiness.

64
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,805
I guess...

65
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:39,404
it's kind of like you're teasing me.

66
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,280
I get mad when you bring me misery,

67
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,944
but I become grateful when you bring me happiness.

68
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,014
I don't like it when it rains,

69
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:49,084
but rain is needed sometimes.

70
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:58,324
That's what you are. You should say that.

71
00:05:58,999 --> 00:05:59,999
To whom?

72
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:03,464
To the person who kicked you out of my life into my life.

73
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:07,875
It's not your fault.

74
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:11,105
Tell that person I said that.

75
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,045
I got the answer right, didn't I?

76
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,154
I solved your crossword puzzle.

77
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,725
Hey. Don't even think about it.

78
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,704
I know it's what guys do when they flirt.

79
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,834
Hey, I...

80
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,384
Who are you?

81
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,488
Where's Dong Kyung?

82
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:35,055
What? Whom?

83
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,065
What the...

84
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:46,764
What... Who are you?

85
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,134
Excuse me? Hello?

86
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,285
Where am I?

87
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:09,894
We meet again.

88
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:15,894
Come here.

89
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,904
I'm on my way. Okay.

90
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:21,535
No, I don't want a hot dog. I want a fish cake bar.

91
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,274
Hey, they're completely different.

92
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:27,545
Okay. Get it for me. I'll be right over.

93
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,849
Where's your sister?

94
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:32,118
My gosh, you startled me. Who are you?

95
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,885
Where's Dong Kyung?

96
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,984
What? Who's Dong Kyung?

97
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:42,224
Tak Dong Kyung. She's your older sister.

98
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,055
"Older sister"?

99
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:46,065
I don't have an older sister.

100
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,234
I'm an only child.

101
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,204
What's his problem?

102
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,840
Hey. I have no idea.

103
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,074
This guy suddenly stopped me and asked me where my sister is.

104
00:08:58,649 --> 00:08:59,874
He's so freaky.

105
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,545
What? Whom?

106
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:10,555
Tak Dong Kyung. Is she not here?

107
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,084
"Tak Dong Kyung"?

108
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,194
Is there a writer named Tak Dong Kyung?

109
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,834
Who are you?

110
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,665
She sits there.

111
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,234
I'm looking for Tak Dong Kyung That's her seat.

112
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,744
I think you've come to the wrong place.

113
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:36,815
Hey.

114
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,785
Who's Tak Dong Kyung?

115
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,964
That's my seat.

116
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:23,724
No one...

117
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,864
No one knows Dong Kyung.

118
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,334
She no longer exists in this world.

119
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,474
Where is this place?

120
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:39,305
I swear I was at the hospital.

121
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,614
Is this a dream?

122
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:43,714
It's not a dream.

123
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,214
I just stole you for a moment.

124
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:49,015
From this guy.

125
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,854
You wanted to know what I planted in this pot.

126
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,954
What is it?

127
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,224
Possibility.

128
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,665
It fed off of your misery.

129
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:09,704
I wanted to show it to you. You helped it grow.

130
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,149
I helped it grow?

131
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:15,244
It's the first time he pitied someone more than himself.

132
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,234
(Be careful not to fall)

133
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,084
"How did you become an adult so quickly?"

134
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,185
"That's a secret."

135
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,824
"Please tell me."

136
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,055
"I also want to become an adult."

137
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,354
"I'm still just a kid."

138
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:07,824
"But you can't become an adult."

139
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:09,935
"Why not?"

140
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:12,935
"Because you're not qualified."

141
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:14,775
"No."

142
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,005
"I'm sick of living as a puppet."

143
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,775
"I want to grow up and become an adult."

144
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,844
"You can become an adult."

145
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,844
"But in order to do so, you need to become qualified."

146
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,185
"What do I need to do?"

147
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,155
"It's simple."

148
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:35,525
"You just always need to try your best to be nice."

149
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,224
I guess it's you.

150
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,435
You made him become like that.

151
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,204
You kicked him out.

152
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:51,604
You told him he's responsible for all my misery.

153
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:54,844
- Yes, it was me. - Why did you do that?

154
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,344
For you.

155
00:12:57,649 --> 00:12:58,849
What's that supposed to mean?

156
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:01,755
You will become heartbroken no matter what you choose to do.

157
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,560
Whether you make the world come to an end...

158
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,185
or kill someone you love in order to live.

159
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,324
But you see, I love him too.

160
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,525
That's why I did this.

161
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,464
What are you?

162
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,964
Me?

163
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,535
I'm the order of this world that's been around for many years.

164
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:25,844
A loner that's been around for a very long time.

165
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,244
I'm a long friend of yours.

166
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,885
I've watched over this world longer than he has.

167
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:34,960
And I always longed for you to be happy.

168
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,889
Then why can't you just let us be happy?

169
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:39,685
Then what kind of meaning would it have?

170
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:43,925
What if you could easily have everything you want forever?

171
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:48,395
You'll find out that kind of life is meaningless.

172
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,964
So what do you want from me?

173
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,379
What's that doing here?

174
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:05,944
What do I want?

175
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,255
What about you? What do you want?

176
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:22,864
The fate of everything that's inside depends on your love.

177
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,535
Isn't that scary?

178
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,805
You should no longer be miserable because of him.

179
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,474
That's what I wanted to tell you.

180
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,214
No.

181
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,720
He doesn't make me miserable.

182
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,084
Don't say that to me or him.

183
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,624
I was never miserable because of him.

184
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,964
I always liked your answer.

185
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,464
Although I must say, it's quite straightforward.

186
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,374
I'm guessing this was enough to blackmail him.

187
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,574
Go. He's at the end of the road.

188
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:14,420
Knock lightly before you open the door.

189
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,584
You know that, right?

190
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,305
You really...

191
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:16,645
You really are here.

192
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,515
Hi.

193
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,285
What's your deal?

194
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:27,160
- Why are you... - I don't know either.

195
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,295
I opened my eyes, and I was here.

196
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,265
She said to keep walking this way...

197
00:16:58,447 --> 00:16:59,641
The deity's garden.

198
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,931
That's where you were. The deity's garden.

199
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:11,971
Wow. She's really a deity?

200
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:15,772
That's good.

201
00:17:16,646 --> 00:17:18,312
I denied it.

202
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:21,042
I said my being miserable was absolutely not your fault.

203
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:22,457
Hold on.

204
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:25,052
Did I or did I not say "absolutely"?

205
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,481
I feel like I did, at least in my mind.

206
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,092
- What did she say? - She laughed.

207
00:17:31,356 --> 00:17:33,421
Why did she laugh? That little runt.

208
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,461
Probably because it was funny. Even I find it funny.

209
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:39,836
- You're fearless. - I wish.

210
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:41,566
I was terrified.

211
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:43,237
I wondered if I was in paradise...

212
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:44,532
or in the land of torment.

213
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:46,876
Still, I had to say what I thought.

214
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:48,142
Me too.

215
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:51,612
I was scared...

216
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:54,211
because no one remembered you.

217
00:18:07,596 --> 00:18:08,691
Dong Kyung!

218
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:10,937
I knew it.

219
00:18:10,937 --> 00:18:12,832
You broke out of the hospital to come home?

220
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:17,201
What's wrong with this place?

221
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:25,511
What is all of this?

222
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,142
What is this?

223
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:29,481
What... What is this?

224
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:33,052
Darn it.

225
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:41,892
What is this?

226
00:18:56,947 --> 00:19:01,981
So... You are... You're a deity?

227
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:04,082
Is that it?

228
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:06,757
Not a deity. Doom.

229
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:09,151
That's the same thing.

230
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,592
It's actually not the same thing. Speaking from experience.

231
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,392
That's probably easier for him to understand.

232
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:16,566
Is it?

233
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,802
What do you people take me for?

234
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:20,866
Give it a rest!

235
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:22,572
I'm not stupid.

236
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:26,401
You're teasing me, aren't you?

237
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:28,741
Who are you people?

238
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:32,247
Keep your head on straight.

239
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:33,582
Don't fall for this.

240
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:35,911
"Keep your head on straight."

241
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,481
"Don't fall for this."

242
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:40,181
Did I say that out loud?

243
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:43,751
No. It was just a coincidence. Yes, a coincidence.

244
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:47,122
"No. It was just a coincidence. Yes, a coincidence."

245
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,731
You both like coincidences so much. Is it in your blood?

246
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:53,661
Can you see into my heart?

247
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:55,937
Don't look.

248
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:57,477
To be more precise,

249
00:19:57,477 --> 00:19:59,146
it's more like he hears it.

250
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:01,642
- That's right. - Don't listen.

251
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,272
Did you plan this with him?

252
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:06,187
Have I lost my mind?

253
00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:08,282
Did I lose it because I was overwhelmed?

254
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:11,011
Look at me.

255
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:12,822
Do I look sane to you?

256
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:15,592
How many fingers do you see?

257
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,622
- 2. - You see 2?

258
00:20:18,257 --> 00:20:19,461
It's three.

259
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:23,731
- It's 3? - It's 2, idiot.

260
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,632
Do you still see your sister?

261
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,731
Don't make him cry.

262
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:33,542
You're worse than I am.

263
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:36,416
Do something. He can't handle it.

264
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,586
Do what? He'll have to accept it as you did.

265
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:39,846
You know, what you always do.

266
00:20:39,846 --> 00:20:42,112
What do I always do? I don't know what you mean.

267
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:44,451
Are you really a deity?

268
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:48,751
Are you doom or something like that?

269
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:54,062
That means... Are you here...

270
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:57,666
to take my sister away?

271
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,267
Why are you saying that?

272
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:01,362
No.

273
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:04,401
I'm here to save her.

274
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:12,681
Do you mean it? Will you really save her?

275
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:16,812
Yes. My prayers worked.

276
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:18,552
That's not why.

277
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:21,251
Your prayers don't come to me. They go elsewhere.

278
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:24,951
Are there departments and stuff like that?

279
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:27,191
Yes, so...

280
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,461
forget everything and sleep.

281
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,302
What?

282
00:21:33,237 --> 00:21:35,901
Forget everything and sleep.

283
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:42,142
I did something.

284
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:04,961
Are you up?

285
00:22:07,437 --> 00:22:08,562
Dong Kyung!

286
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:10,471
Dong Kyung!

287
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:14,872
Are you okay?

288
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:17,777
I was so scared when I got the call.

289
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:20,882
I thought I'd never see you again.

290
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:23,312
So why did you worry the kid?

291
00:22:25,787 --> 00:22:27,181
You were here?

292
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:30,757
What took you so long to come?

293
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:32,421
I was so scared all alone...

294
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:35,461
I was scared.

295
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:41,731
Why do I feel like I was with him until just now?

296
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:44,572
- You must've had a dream. - A dream?

297
00:22:44,937 --> 00:22:48,401
My brother-in-law must like me a lot.

298
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,511
Yes, I do.

299
00:22:50,747 --> 00:22:52,542
If you're done professing your love, let's go.

300
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:55,241
Go? Go where?

301
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:57,411
- Home. - Yes, home.

302
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:00,181
Why would we go home?

303
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:03,027
Wait. Why are you changed?

304
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:04,427
I'm fine now.

305
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:05,666
You are not fine.

306
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,921
The doctor said he needed to run more tests.

307
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,961
- Sun Kyung. - Stop her.

308
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:15,261
What? Are you two in on it together?

309
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:20,707
No! I won't go! Definitely not!

310
00:23:20,707 --> 00:23:22,211
I won't budge!

311
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:23,576
Sun Kyung?

312
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,316
Why are you doing this too?

313
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:27,211
- If you keep doing this, I... - I'm a doctor.

314
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:34,122
A doctor?

315
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:37,721
Dong Kyung.

316
00:23:38,227 --> 00:23:39,461
Ji Na!

317
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:40,967
Ji Na, the thing is...

318
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:43,666
I couldn't tell you back then, but I planned to tell you...

319
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,366
Seriously, you...

320
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:47,761
Seriously, I wanted to tell you several times.

321
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:52,701
What do you want to eat?

322
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:55,247
What do you want to do?

323
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,241
What do you want to have? Where do you want to go?

324
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:00,342
I'll do it all for you from now on.

325
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:02,751
So tell me.

326
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:04,951
Say the word. What should I do for you?

327
00:24:11,027 --> 00:24:13,721
Hey, how could you do this to me?

328
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:16,731
How could you ask me that?

329
00:24:17,197 --> 00:24:19,037
You said you'd do everything I asked.

330
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:20,767
I really want to go home.

331
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,477
I'm really fine.

332
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:24,707
- Hey, turn left here. - I know.

333
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:26,171
I'm not fine.

334
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:27,506
Turn the car around.

335
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,246
Do it now!

336
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:31,941
Gosh. She's so loud that I can't focus on driving.

337
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:33,247
At this rate, the four of us will die.

338
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:35,711
- Don't talk about dying! - Don't talk about dying!

339
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:40,721
I guess you have a type for the people you keep around.

340
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:44,092
Hold on.

341
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,761
He's been getting on my nerves.

342
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:49,297
Who is that guy? Why does he keep dropping his honorifics to me?

343
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:51,395
- I never talked to you. - Hey.

344
00:24:51,396 --> 00:24:54,306
I'm sorry. Picking up a fight with people is his habit.

345
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:55,572
Hey.

346
00:24:55,737 --> 00:24:57,477
Who are you? Answer me.

347
00:24:57,477 --> 00:25:01,547
Listen. You shouldn't approach this so emotionally.

348
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:03,447
I know everything because I've tried it all.

349
00:25:03,447 --> 00:25:05,612
- You should... - Shut it.

350
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:11,582
Stop it! Gosh.

351
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,292
What did your doctor exactly say?

352
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:26,666
I have glioblastomas.

353
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:29,971
And I have about three months left. No.

354
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:32,642
I probably have two months left by now.

355
00:25:33,977 --> 00:25:35,816
Get up right now. Let's go to the hospital now.

356
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:37,376
Let's go and get that surgery.

357
00:25:37,376 --> 00:25:39,842
Ji Na. Actually,

358
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:41,547
that guy over there is a doctor.

359
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:43,586
I don't care if he's a doctor or not.

360
00:25:43,586 --> 00:25:46,086
You're her brother. You should try to stop her. What are you doing?

361
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,522
The surgery can't guarantee that I'll live.

362
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:51,156
I could die from the surgery too. On the table.

363
00:25:51,156 --> 00:25:52,292
- Hey. - Dong Kyung.

364
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:54,022
I'll save her.

365
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:57,431
I'll save her life.

366
00:26:02,037 --> 00:26:04,931
Why do you look so surprised? I already told you that.

367
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:12,511
Who is he?

368
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:14,616
Why does he keep trying to sound cool without the honorifics?

369
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,852
I can hear you.

370
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:18,585
He's Dong Kyung's boyfriend. He's a doctor.

371
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:19,951
That's even louder.

372
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:21,326
A doctor?

373
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:23,352
Are you sure? Did you check him out?

374
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:26,721
Well, I didn't check him out.

375
00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:28,365
But he is her boyfriend for sure.

376
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:30,961
And they are head over heels for each other.

377
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:33,066
What? No way.

378
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:36,001
If she fell in love, she would have told me right away...

379
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:38,901
He's the guy.

380
00:26:39,277 --> 00:26:42,447
The guy from the hospital... The funeral!

381
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,542
The guy you said you wanted to fall in love with.

382
00:26:45,816 --> 00:26:47,882
You talked about me a lot.

383
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:51,582
What? What happened at the funeral?

384
00:26:52,116 --> 00:26:53,322
How come I don't know about it?

385
00:26:53,326 --> 00:26:55,122
Is there anything you actually know?

386
00:26:56,556 --> 00:26:58,951
Right. You don't know anything.

387
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:00,326
You didn't even know that you should've called me...

388
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:02,066
when you found out about her condition.

389
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:04,896
No, that's not it. Dong Kyung told me not to tell anyone.

390
00:27:04,896 --> 00:27:07,461
Since when did you do what your sister told you?

391
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:08,937
But I still told you...

392
00:27:08,937 --> 00:27:10,876
even when she told me not to tell you.

393
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,177
You couldn't even look me in the eye before,

394
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:13,677
but you're raising your voice at me now.

395
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:16,042
- So you're a man now. Is that it? - Stop it.

396
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:18,711
You two should go now.

397
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:21,181
You want us to go?

398
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:24,782
Who did you mean by "you two"? Were you talking to these two?

399
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,221
You two.

400
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:28,156
I can't leave.

401
00:27:28,156 --> 00:27:30,026
I can't leave you all alone.

402
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:31,421
I won't be alone.

403
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:34,421
I live with him.

404
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:40,461
I'm going to sleep with him again today.

405
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,302
What?

406
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:54,011
I never knew she was so bold.

407
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:57,552
She changed after getting diagnosed with her condition.

408
00:27:58,217 --> 00:28:00,582
But she has the right to do that.

409
00:28:01,386 --> 00:28:03,626
He knew about her condition from the get-go,

410
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:05,151
but he's still seeing her.

411
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:10,135
- Tak Sun Kyung. - Yes?

412
00:28:10,136 --> 00:28:11,491
You changed a bit.

413
00:28:11,596 --> 00:28:13,136
What? Me?

414
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:15,876
Gosh, no. I never change.

415
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,802
I didn't get to finish what I told you earlier.

416
00:28:23,116 --> 00:28:24,642
You're way more mature now.

417
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:26,981
Nicely done.

418
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:30,616
- What? - I'm patting you on the back...

419
00:28:30,616 --> 00:28:32,852
for going through this alone. You must've been in pain.

420
00:28:34,527 --> 00:28:36,451
From now on, let's suffer together.

421
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:39,297
Let's try hard in where we are and give it our all.

422
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:40,461
Okay?

423
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:44,392
Don't get scared just because you think you're alone.

424
00:28:44,737 --> 00:28:47,501
You're Dong Kyung's brother. So you're a brother to me too.

425
00:28:50,406 --> 00:28:52,037
So keep an eye on her and call me right away...

426
00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:53,977
if something happens. Okay?

427
00:28:53,977 --> 00:28:56,612
If you don't call me, I'll crush your fingers.

428
00:28:57,517 --> 00:28:58,642
No.

429
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:01,411
You really got it wrong. It's not fair.

430
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:02,852
What?

431
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:07,487
Ma'am. It's not fair, ma'am. Gosh.

432
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:08,885
You little...

433
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:10,552
- She's the little one. - Hey!

434
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:12,927
- Goodness. You startled me. - Do you have a death wish?

435
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:14,421
As if!

436
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:16,737
Hey. I told you to stop getting cheeky with me.

437
00:29:16,737 --> 00:29:18,037
What are you talking about?

438
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:19,136
I'm letting you have your way.

439
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:20,731
You're unbelievable.

440
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:36,156
What a hectic day.

441
00:29:36,156 --> 00:29:37,687
I still have to clean up even on a hectic day.

442
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:39,187
This is so not fair.

443
00:29:39,187 --> 00:29:40,822
So why did you cause trouble?

444
00:29:41,326 --> 00:29:42,656
You're saying this is my fault?

445
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,421
It's your fault. It's because you disappeared on me.

446
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:48,626
I didn't know that you'd take such an extreme approach.

447
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:51,666
You'd better watch out. If you don't listen to me...

448
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:54,132
I didn't know you'd use yourself as leverage.

449
00:29:57,076 --> 00:29:59,241
And I didn't know it would work on me.

450
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,441
How come you don't know so many things?

451
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:11,352
- You're right. - There's so much I must teach you.

452
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:16,921
- What? - Your hand.

453
00:30:26,922 --> 00:30:31,922

454
00:30:41,947 --> 00:30:43,481
Let's live together.

455
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:47,981
Let's continue to live together.

456
00:30:51,856 --> 00:30:53,161
We can...

457
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,132
sleep together again today.

458
00:31:46,747 --> 00:31:50,812
The fate of everything that's inside depends on your love.

459
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,522
Isn't that scary?

460
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:12,602
Good evening.

461
00:32:13,646 --> 00:32:14,842
Are you having fun?

462
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:17,772
I'm not bored.

463
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:19,646
Leave her alone.

464
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,741
I left her alone.

465
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,651
I just got in your way.

466
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:25,787
What is it that you want?

467
00:32:25,787 --> 00:32:27,122
I was wrong.

468
00:32:28,687 --> 00:32:30,721
She loves you.

469
00:32:32,257 --> 00:32:33,991
She scolded me.

470
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:36,661
She said she was never miserable because of you.

471
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:41,161
I always wish that I'm wrong.

472
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:44,072
I hope you guys are right.

473
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:49,241
But we're always wrong.

474
00:32:50,076 --> 00:32:51,542
And you're always right.

475
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:13,902
False hope is hope too.

476
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:16,031
False love is still love.

477
00:33:29,935 --> 00:33:32,389
Have you tried calling Ms. Tak?

478
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:34,564
She won't even answer Mr. Park's calls,

479
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:35,960
so I'm sure she won't answer mine.

480
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:38,900
- This is crazy. - Should I try calling her?

481
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:41,440
You sound awfully confident.

482
00:33:41,675 --> 00:33:43,745
Then how about we go visit her at the hospital?

483
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:45,639
She won't let us in.

484
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:50,009
She probably needs time, and so do we.

485
00:33:51,454 --> 00:33:54,980
I bet Ms. Tak's going through a hard time right now.

486
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:57,420
I wonder what she's doing.

487
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:06,265
- It's not there. - We need to see it now.

488
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:07,529
Let's see it!

489
00:34:07,535 --> 00:34:09,699
(It's too high up. I want to...)

490
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:12,070
It's too high up here

491
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:14,940
I want to

492
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:18,210
"It's too high up here." Yes, that's what it is.

493
00:34:18,215 --> 00:34:19,385
I didn't get to hear the second part.

494
00:34:19,385 --> 00:34:20,840
Hey, did you hear it?

495
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:24,015
At least wipe your hand before touching the remote.

496
00:34:24,015 --> 00:34:26,449
My hand is clean. This doesn't have crumbs.

497
00:34:28,954 --> 00:34:31,725
Oh, my, my, my

498
00:34:31,725 --> 00:34:34,290
I want to share everything with you

499
00:34:35,965 --> 00:34:37,130
By the way,

500
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:40,400
you didn't have to get me flowers.

501
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:42,259
I didn't buy them.

502
00:34:42,704 --> 00:34:44,570
- Then? - I came across them.

503
00:34:46,874 --> 00:34:49,040
How cliche.

504
00:34:50,745 --> 00:34:52,115
"I came across them."

505
00:34:52,115 --> 00:34:53,880
Where did you learn that line?

506
00:34:54,144 --> 00:34:55,409
My gosh.

507
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:10,759
(Dalgona)

508
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:12,900
Hey, Ms. Dalgona.

509
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,230
I heard the news.

510
00:35:19,405 --> 00:35:22,044
I heard you fought with Jijo King at the team dinner.

511
00:35:22,044 --> 00:35:23,274
I feel like it's my fault.

512
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:26,445
What are you talking about? It's not your fault at all.

513
00:35:26,445 --> 00:35:28,009
Yes, it is.

514
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:31,380
I heard you quit. So I quit too.

515
00:35:31,954 --> 00:35:32,954
What?

516
00:35:32,954 --> 00:35:35,750
I decided not to renew my contract with Life Story.

517
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:40,664
But then again, I guess that won't matter...

518
00:35:40,664 --> 00:35:41,759
if I fail to recover.

519
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,090
Recover from what?

520
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:47,860
I'm getting surgery next month.

521
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,369
I'm going to try chemotherapy.

522
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:54,570
There's a story I really want to write.

523
00:35:55,274 --> 00:35:57,845
I'm going to write it and sell it, so they can turn it into a drama.

524
00:35:57,845 --> 00:35:59,170
The genre is teenage romance.

525
00:35:59,814 --> 00:36:01,980
I've already come up with the characters.

526
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:08,779
(I love you, Park Young!)

527
00:36:09,655 --> 00:36:10,989
(I love you, Park Young!)

528
00:36:13,164 --> 00:36:15,119
Yes, it's him.

529
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:18,730
He's the character I chose.

530
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:22,969
Do you find it funny that a middle-aged lady likes him?

531
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:24,799
What? No.

532
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:26,900
I don't care if you find it funny.

533
00:36:27,945 --> 00:36:29,070
The thing is,

534
00:36:29,774 --> 00:36:31,869
he's the only person that makes me smile.

535
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:38,949
It's not funny. I don't find it funny at all.

536
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:42,949
What's funny about that? I think it's amazing.

537
00:36:43,754 --> 00:36:45,349
Once I finish writing this,

538
00:36:45,595 --> 00:36:47,860
you can be the first person to read it.

539
00:36:49,995 --> 00:36:51,460
Probably around next year.

540
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:55,199
We both would've gotten our surgeries by then.

541
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:59,374
People get tingles in their hearts when cherry blossoms bloom.

542
00:36:59,374 --> 00:37:00,869
That's when romance novels are very popular.

543
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:05,610
- But the thing is... - Ms. Tak, you see,

544
00:37:06,445 --> 00:37:09,139
you feel the urge to live if you find yourself smiling a lot.

545
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:12,980
So you should love someone.

546
00:37:14,124 --> 00:37:16,590
Love someone who makes you smile.

547
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,340
- What's going on? - What do you mean?

548
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:46,719
What are you doing here?

549
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:49,690
- I came to pick you up. - You came to pick me up?

550
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:51,520
I was worried you might run away.

551
00:37:53,425 --> 00:37:54,790
Stop being funny.

552
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:56,989
I'm glad you found it funny.

553
00:38:05,834 --> 00:38:08,144
Don't get the wrong idea. This is just...

554
00:38:08,144 --> 00:38:09,770
I know. You're recharging.

555
00:38:10,715 --> 00:38:11,975
No.

556
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:14,279
I'm holding your hand because I want to.

557
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:16,854
Do you know something?

558
00:38:16,854 --> 00:38:19,750
Tons of people come here in spring.

559
00:38:20,184 --> 00:38:22,380
- Why? - To see cherry blossoms.

560
00:38:22,725 --> 00:38:26,119
Cherry blossoms bloom starting from here to all the way over there.

561
00:38:28,294 --> 00:38:29,934
If I knew I was going to die,

562
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,389
I would've gone out last spring a lot more often to see flowers.

563
00:38:32,965 --> 00:38:34,960
I had no idea that was going to be my last time.

564
00:38:50,484 --> 00:38:53,219
What is this? Did you just do this?

565
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:54,779
Yes.

566
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:00,159
It really feels like spring.

567
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:03,130
It really is spring. Although it won't last long.

568
00:39:04,495 --> 00:39:06,164
We just flew back in time a little.

569
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:08,259
It's nothing much.

570
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:10,799
Yes, you're incredible. I'll give you that.

571
00:39:15,845 --> 00:39:18,009
It's beautiful.

572
00:39:20,584 --> 00:39:23,110
I only have good memories of spring.

573
00:39:23,314 --> 00:39:25,515
A long time ago, when there were cherry blossoms just like now,

574
00:39:25,515 --> 00:39:26,984
my parents, Sun Kyung, and I...

575
00:39:26,984 --> 00:39:29,119
went to ride the Ferris wheel together.

576
00:39:29,484 --> 00:39:32,420
I'm as happy as I was that day.

577
00:39:40,064 --> 00:39:41,159
Hey.

578
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:46,029
I like you.

579
00:39:56,215 --> 00:39:58,610
I said I like you.

580
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:04,989
It feels nice to get that off my chest. See you.

581
00:40:06,524 --> 00:40:08,325
I'm not coming home tonight.

582
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:09,860
I'm sleeping over at Ji Na's.

583
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:36,520
Ji Na!

584
00:40:37,024 --> 00:40:38,854
What is that? What's that in your mouth?

585
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,920
No, I... I didn't even light it up. It was just in between my lips.

586
00:40:42,195 --> 00:40:44,265
I told you not to smoke.

587
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:46,389
It's going to make you die early. I told you to quit.

588
00:40:46,965 --> 00:40:49,204
I didn't know you'd be here.

589
00:40:49,204 --> 00:40:50,429
My gosh, seriously.

590
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,540
Is there something wrong? Are you sick?

591
00:40:59,144 --> 00:41:01,409
I just missed you.

592
00:41:01,885 --> 00:41:04,579
I missed you so much that I thought I might die.

593
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:06,380
Don't ever say you might die.

594
00:41:09,354 --> 00:41:10,454
Ji Na.

595
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:12,854
You told me you'll do anything I want, right?

596
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:14,659
Yes. What do you want? Just say it.

597
00:41:15,664 --> 00:41:17,290
Just treat me like usual.

598
00:41:17,965 --> 00:41:18,965
What?

599
00:41:18,965 --> 00:41:21,064
Forget that I'm sick.

600
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:23,774
Just treat me like you usually do. Talk to me about random things,

601
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:26,504
eat with me, and nag at me.

602
00:41:26,504 --> 00:41:27,969
That's how I want you to treat me.

603
00:41:29,774 --> 00:41:33,040
That's what I want from you.

604
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:39,150
I'm hungry. Should we order jokbal?

605
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:41,279
Jokbal sounds great.

606
00:41:42,254 --> 00:41:43,420
A medium-sized serving or large?

607
00:41:43,655 --> 00:41:46,325
A large. Obviously.

608
00:41:46,325 --> 00:41:48,159
- And order buckwheat noodles. - Got it.

609
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:52,029
- It's going to taste amazing. - I was going to go on a diet.

610
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:57,434
My gosh.

611
00:41:57,434 --> 00:42:00,969
We haven't shopped for groceries together in ages.

612
00:42:03,544 --> 00:42:05,009
Buy your beer with your own money.

613
00:42:08,245 --> 00:42:09,710
By the way, who was that girl?

614
00:42:12,785 --> 00:42:16,349
You know, that girl from work.

615
00:42:17,254 --> 00:42:18,650
You guys looked pretty close.

616
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:31,734
Hello.

617
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:33,400
- Hello. - Hello.

618
00:42:40,215 --> 00:42:41,340
What's wrong?

619
00:42:43,555 --> 00:42:45,849
- There was a car behind you. - A car?

620
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:48,349
What car? There's no car.

621
00:42:48,885 --> 00:42:51,049
There was one just now. It was actually a baby stroller.

622
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,290
Did I almost get hit by a baby stroller?

623
00:42:55,894 --> 00:42:58,590
We both almost got hit by it.

624
00:42:59,365 --> 00:43:01,599
I wanted to see her face.

625
00:43:01,734 --> 00:43:04,429
But I couldn't because I had to greet customers.

626
00:43:09,204 --> 00:43:10,274
Aren't you going to introduce me?

627
00:43:10,274 --> 00:43:12,509
- It's not like that. - Then what is it?

628
00:43:12,774 --> 00:43:14,480
- Just... - Just what?

629
00:43:15,084 --> 00:43:16,615
Just a writer.

630
00:43:16,615 --> 00:43:18,814
Stop lying to me, will you?

631
00:43:18,814 --> 00:43:20,719
I saw the look on your face.

632
00:43:21,624 --> 00:43:23,624
You always do that.

633
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:25,750
You act first, then find out later.

634
00:43:26,055 --> 00:43:28,159
Your brain is slower than your body.

635
00:43:28,495 --> 00:43:30,360
It's not good to be too smart.

636
00:43:32,865 --> 00:43:34,360
Hello? What...

637
00:43:36,035 --> 00:43:37,170
Hello?

638
00:43:37,774 --> 00:43:38,900
Hey.

639
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:43,099
Where are you? Okay.

640
00:43:45,015 --> 00:43:46,369
I have to go.

641
00:43:46,515 --> 00:43:48,584
- Where? - The kid just called,

642
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,754
and he's out of it. He's bawling and losing it.

643
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:52,484
- What kid? - Sun Kyung.

644
00:43:52,484 --> 00:43:54,279
Later. See you at home.

645
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:56,020
Hey.

646
00:43:57,325 --> 00:44:00,320
Whenever I vented

647
00:44:00,624 --> 00:44:03,829
Because I was lonely

648
00:44:04,695 --> 00:44:09,799
You came to me with love

649
00:44:11,204 --> 00:44:14,369
And with your pretty smile

650
00:44:14,644 --> 00:44:17,969
With your pretty love

651
00:44:18,374 --> 00:44:25,084
You embraced my heart

652
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:29,119
My sister

653
00:44:30,595 --> 00:44:33,049
Hey. Why aren't you answering your phone?

654
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,590
What are you doing here?

655
00:44:36,024 --> 00:44:37,489
You called me.

656
00:44:37,664 --> 00:44:38,759
I did?

657
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:41,099
I called you?

658
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:45,670
You're right, I did.

659
00:44:46,405 --> 00:44:47,969
This kid's wasted.

660
00:44:48,475 --> 00:44:50,810
What's wrong? What is it?

661
00:44:52,215 --> 00:44:54,139
- Sir. - Yes?

662
00:44:54,215 --> 00:44:56,579
Sir!

663
00:44:57,715 --> 00:45:01,049
Gosh. What is it? What?

664
00:45:02,254 --> 00:45:03,949
Were you dumped?

665
00:45:04,794 --> 00:45:07,219
Don't do anything you'll regret.

666
00:45:08,425 --> 00:45:11,135
You know, the thing is...

667
00:45:11,135 --> 00:45:13,929
"Later" is all useless.

668
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:17,029
You have to do it now. You'll regret it if you don't.

669
00:45:17,075 --> 00:45:19,104
So don't push things off to later.

670
00:45:19,104 --> 00:45:21,170
Do it all now. Now.

671
00:45:21,975 --> 00:45:23,340
Got that?

672
00:45:24,374 --> 00:45:27,779
You'll regret it. You'll regret it all your life.

673
00:45:27,785 --> 00:45:29,579
You'll keep regretting it.

674
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:31,579
You'll really, really regret it.

675
00:45:34,184 --> 00:45:35,779
Why are you talking down to me?

676
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:39,449
I'm so drunk.

677
00:46:01,515 --> 00:46:02,880
Ji Na, your phone.

678
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,449
Your phone's ringing.

679
00:46:17,794 --> 00:46:18,929
This is nice.

680
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:20,860
Should I take it?

681
00:46:24,975 --> 00:46:26,130
Who could that be?

682
00:46:34,984 --> 00:46:36,279
Mr. Cha.

683
00:46:39,814 --> 00:46:41,150
Your hair looks nice.

684
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:43,320
So...

685
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:46,349
the two of you...

686
00:46:46,925 --> 00:46:49,889
entered into a contract separately on your own.

687
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:53,064
What happened was...

688
00:46:53,064 --> 00:46:54,334
It was a waste.

689
00:46:54,334 --> 00:46:57,570
It was obvious she'd do well with some guidance.

690
00:46:58,675 --> 00:47:01,440
- You were being thoughtful. - It was sympathy.

691
00:47:01,805 --> 00:47:03,104
Are you just working together?

692
00:47:03,104 --> 00:47:05,374
Of course. Don't be silly.

693
00:47:05,374 --> 00:47:07,785
You must do things other than work with your writers.

694
00:47:07,785 --> 00:47:09,914
Yes. I eat with them, have coffee with them,

695
00:47:09,914 --> 00:47:11,555
and take walks with them at times.

696
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:14,184
I'm not saying the two of you should do that.

697
00:47:14,184 --> 00:47:16,624
I'll keep that in mind if I want to do something else.

698
00:47:16,624 --> 00:47:19,454
See that? This jerk never lets you have the last word.

699
00:47:19,454 --> 00:47:20,524
- Right. - "This jerk"?

700
00:47:20,524 --> 00:47:22,960
I quit, remember? When else can I give you an attitude?

701
00:47:23,164 --> 00:47:25,635
Anyway, I'm done questioning you.

702
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,199
I'll bow out now.

703
00:47:28,035 --> 00:47:30,299
- You're leaving? Already? - Yes.

704
00:47:30,535 --> 00:47:33,604
I have someone waiting for me at home as well.

705
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:34,799
Later.

706
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,210
I put you down as on leave.

707
00:47:37,675 --> 00:47:40,945
Tell them to fire me. I want to collect unemployment.

708
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:43,540
Tell Mr. Park yourself. Stop screening his calls.

709
00:47:44,354 --> 00:47:46,055
When else can I screen his calls?

710
00:47:46,055 --> 00:47:47,219
I'm out for real.

711
00:47:48,225 --> 00:47:49,320
Bye.

712
00:47:49,925 --> 00:47:51,020
Bye.

713
00:47:56,794 --> 00:47:59,659
She seems pretty well for now.

714
00:47:59,695 --> 00:48:02,529
I don't know if she's well or pretending to be.

715
00:48:05,104 --> 00:48:06,869
What brings you here, Mr. Cha?

716
00:48:07,274 --> 00:48:09,405
Am I "Mr. Cha" to you too?

717
00:48:09,405 --> 00:48:12,340
- You were worried about me, right? - I was worried about the series.

718
00:48:14,445 --> 00:48:16,880
Sorry for making you see that the other day.

719
00:48:17,115 --> 00:48:18,310
Sorry.

720
00:48:18,655 --> 00:48:21,079
I said I was worried about the series.

721
00:48:22,385 --> 00:48:23,549
Did you write a lot?

722
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:27,960
You always catch me at my worst.

723
00:48:29,725 --> 00:48:30,995
Why does that always happen?

724
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:32,460
It's because I'm kind.

725
00:48:33,465 --> 00:48:35,265
- What? - Because of my great character.

726
00:48:35,265 --> 00:48:37,203
I can't ignore a woman who's crying.

727
00:48:37,204 --> 00:48:39,699
You could sense a kind person.

728
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:43,369
You could sense that, and I happened to be there.

729
00:48:43,374 --> 00:48:44,540
Every time.

730
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:46,610
You're so funny.

731
00:48:46,644 --> 00:48:48,110
I hear that often.

732
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:50,449
I didn't mean you're actually funny.

733
00:48:50,515 --> 00:48:52,009
Can't you pick up on sarcasm?

734
00:48:52,285 --> 00:48:54,779
Well... I heard that often as well.

735
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,989
I didn't come to talk about nonsense like this.

736
00:49:03,794 --> 00:49:05,389
I came to tell you something.

737
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:08,265
I didn't think I should hold off any longer, or...

738
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:09,360
What is it?

739
00:49:12,334 --> 00:49:14,869
I don't know where to start.

740
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,840
I didn't intend it from the start.

741
00:49:21,914 --> 00:49:23,009
Just a minute.

742
00:49:23,715 --> 00:49:25,480
Dong Kyung must've forgotten something.

743
00:50:08,064 --> 00:50:09,659
Sorry for not showing up.

744
00:50:10,095 --> 00:50:11,290
You startled me.

745
00:50:14,064 --> 00:50:16,599
But you really are a troublemaker.

746
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:18,599
How could you say you'll jump?

747
00:50:21,204 --> 00:50:24,840
Wait. So you heard me but you didn't come?

748
00:50:27,914 --> 00:50:29,610
Face forward. The light changed.

749
00:50:53,745 --> 00:50:55,199
What is this?

750
00:50:57,644 --> 00:51:00,070
You said you were happy that day.

751
00:51:22,405 --> 00:51:26,529
Seriously. You are very useful.

752
00:51:34,144 --> 00:51:35,785
Why do you keep staring?

753
00:51:35,785 --> 00:51:36,814
Because you're in front of me.

754
00:51:36,814 --> 00:51:39,779
Then what? Should I go next to you?

755
00:51:40,885 --> 00:51:42,820
I can't. It'll mess up the balance.

756
00:51:50,225 --> 00:51:51,690
How pretty.

757
00:51:52,595 --> 00:51:54,759
Like it'll disappear.

758
00:51:56,734 --> 00:51:59,270
Everything that disappears is usually beautiful.

759
00:52:09,885 --> 00:52:11,750
When I disappeared,

760
00:52:13,055 --> 00:52:15,449
you said no one remembered me.

761
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:17,590
Yes.

762
00:52:21,164 --> 00:52:22,920
I hope that happens...

763
00:52:24,535 --> 00:52:26,329
when I die.

764
00:52:28,465 --> 00:52:30,329
I want the people I leave behind...

765
00:52:31,305 --> 00:52:33,400
to forget all about me.

766
00:52:34,274 --> 00:52:36,739
So they wouldn't be sad because of me.

767
00:52:38,874 --> 00:52:41,079
I hope I will...

768
00:52:41,584 --> 00:52:45,610
disappear like that. As if I'm evaporating.

769
00:52:54,894 --> 00:52:56,389
By any chance...

770
00:52:58,965 --> 00:53:00,130
can I...

771
00:53:02,104 --> 00:53:04,429
make a wish for that...

772
00:53:42,044 --> 00:53:44,009
You always surprise me like that.

773
00:53:44,814 --> 00:53:45,940
What do you mean?

774
00:53:47,245 --> 00:53:49,385
- You know... - Is it about the kiss?

775
00:53:49,385 --> 00:53:53,949
My gosh. You didn't have to specify it like that.

776
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:56,980
Don't use your wish for other people.

777
00:54:06,164 --> 00:54:09,400
I can do some things for you like today.

778
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,770
So I want you to think harder about it and use it for yourself.

779
00:54:13,075 --> 00:54:14,270
So you have no regrets.

780
00:54:18,345 --> 00:54:21,009
I already tried to use the wish for myself.

781
00:54:23,644 --> 00:54:25,610
But you didn't grant me that wish.

782
00:54:27,285 --> 00:54:28,420
I want you...

783
00:54:30,155 --> 00:54:32,049
to love me.

784
00:54:34,794 --> 00:54:38,290
Can I wish for that too?

785
00:54:40,035 --> 00:54:41,159
No.

786
00:54:41,704 --> 00:54:44,599
You said no to my wish.

787
00:54:52,044 --> 00:54:54,040
You don't have to wish for that.

788
00:54:57,684 --> 00:54:59,079
What did you mean by that?

789
00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:01,549
Sorry...

790
00:55:02,184 --> 00:55:03,480
Are you okay?

791
00:55:04,425 --> 00:55:05,590
Are you okay?

792
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:10,619
Are you okay?

793
00:55:20,405 --> 00:55:22,540
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

794
00:55:24,015 --> 00:55:26,710
- Dong Kyung. Sun Kyung. - Mom!

795
00:55:28,544 --> 00:55:30,814
All right. Let's have some cotton candy...

796
00:55:30,814 --> 00:55:33,150
and get on the Ferris wheel.

797
00:55:37,155 --> 00:55:39,790
(1,894 days with you at Kyungjun World)

798
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,619
I thought you'd want to see them.

799
00:55:56,704 --> 00:55:58,610
You could see them only for a brief moment.

800
00:56:03,814 --> 00:56:06,480
Did I mess up again?

801
00:56:12,825 --> 00:56:13,920
No.

802
00:56:15,425 --> 00:56:17,060
I'm happy.

803
00:56:19,234 --> 00:56:20,529
I am happy.

804
00:56:22,234 --> 00:56:23,799
I was happy just now.

805
00:56:25,135 --> 00:56:26,529
I was utterly happy.

806
00:56:34,215 --> 00:56:35,310
Tak Dong Kyung.

807
00:56:36,445 --> 00:56:38,949
- Yes? - Like me.

808
00:56:44,024 --> 00:56:45,320
It's okay to like me.

809
00:56:47,124 --> 00:56:49,790
I don't care about anyone but you now.

810
00:56:52,135 --> 00:56:53,730
You don't have to wish for it.

811
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,429
That's my answer.

812
00:56:55,604 --> 00:56:57,360
- So... - Tak Dong Kyung!

813
00:57:04,245 --> 00:57:05,369
Mom?

814
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:26,360
Aunt!

815
00:57:36,504 --> 00:57:37,909
So choose.

816
00:57:39,475 --> 00:57:40,739
Choose yourself and the world.

817
00:58:20,655 --> 00:58:24,690
(Doom at Your Service)

818
00:58:25,195 --> 00:58:28,225
Life brings me so much joy.

819
00:58:28,225 --> 00:58:29,320
(Human)

820
00:58:29,394 --> 00:58:31,389
Are you free? Let's hang out.

821
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:33,960
I want everything from here and here.

822
00:58:34,164 --> 00:58:36,230
Here it goes. Smile.

823
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,130
- Make a wish. - Living a happy life...

824
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:41,405
in the world you are in.

825
00:58:41,405 --> 00:58:42,599
Are you interested in anyone?

826
00:58:43,405 --> 00:58:44,644
Even if you are, you should date me.

827
00:58:44,644 --> 00:58:46,239
I still like you.

828
00:58:46,515 --> 00:58:49,380
I fell in love with you.

829
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:52,849
So we should break up.
