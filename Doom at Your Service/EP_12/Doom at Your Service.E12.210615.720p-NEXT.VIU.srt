(Episode 12)

4
00:01:06,956 --> 00:01:08,387
Wait. Oh, no.

5
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:42,626
Darn it. Who are you?

6
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,456
A smoker.

7
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:49,326
- What are you doing? - Why do you ask?

8
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:52,935
Is this a no-smoking zone?

9
00:01:52,936 --> 00:01:54,836
What's your problem? Do you think this is funny?

10
00:01:54,837 --> 00:01:55,906
Is this funny?

11
00:01:57,807 --> 00:01:59,176
I need the lighter to smoke.

12
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:02,307
I...

13
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:04,917
Get lost when I ask you nicely.

14
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:07,815
When did you ask me nicely? You were mean to me.

15
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:09,446
Darn you! Get lost!

16
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:11,915
Do you know who I am?

17
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,416
I don't care who you are.

18
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:14,987
Darn you.

19
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,196
Gosh.

20
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:22,797
You jerk. Hey.

21
00:02:28,636 --> 00:02:29,636
Hey!

22
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:33,837
Stop it.

23
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:38,747
Why... Hey.

24
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,286
No.

25
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:48,557
- Do you want me... - No.

26
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:51,156
- to light it up? - No.

27
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:52,927
Or not.

28
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:55,797
Gosh. Let go of me.

29
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:58,596
Who are you?

30
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,467
Why are you doing this to me?

31
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:01,867
Me?

32
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,036
A victim whose right has been violated.

33
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:07,807
Are you the owner of this building or something?

34
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:09,375
No.

35
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:10,876
If I were, I wouldn't have given you a chance to talk.

36
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:13,875
What? You jerk.

37
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,147
Hey. What are you doing?

38
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,856
They are just batteries. Darn it!

39
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:20,386
Darn it.

40
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:26,096
You killed cats first. Next, you set buildings on fire.

41
00:03:26,297 --> 00:03:29,226
After that, you'll go after kids, elderlies, and women.

42
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:32,666
That's how it goes down with scumbags like you.

43
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:34,435
But it has nothing to do with you.

44
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:35,837
You can just go on your way.

45
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,975
Those are losers, anyway. Killing some of them...

46
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:40,375
won't make any difference.

47
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:42,505
I tell her to root out people like you,

48
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:43,807
but she won't even budge.

49
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:47,415
No matter how I look at it, this is a better bargain.

50
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:52,785
Those lowlives started it. They were so loud.

51
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:54,516
I...

52
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,927
Right. It's too loud.

53
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:01,155
What are you doing? Stop it.

54
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:02,226
Why are you doing this?

55
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:07,436
What a useless dog.

56
00:04:17,746 --> 00:04:20,976
Hey. I just arrived at the hospital.

57
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:23,616
Okay. See you soon.

58
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:34,056
- Hello. - Hello.

59
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:57,616
Hello, Ms. Tak. Come on in.

60
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:06,897
You're here.

61
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:16,535
You'll get admitted tomorrow,

62
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,777
get a biopsy, and start the treatment right away.

63
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:21,206
I'll diagnose your illness more accurately...

64
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:22,676
after the biopsy.

65
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:26,277
But usually, people start with chemo and radiation therapy.

66
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,387
Listening about my treatment still feels surreal.

67
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:33,687
There's nothing for you to get nervous about.

68
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,527
If it goes well, you can get treated as an outpatient.

69
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:39,026
You're very young.

70
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:41,456
And seeing how you're not experiencing any symptoms yet,

71
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:42,567
I'm hopeful.

72
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:44,627
Okay, Mr. Jung.

73
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:47,937
Wait, no. I should call you Dr. Jung now, right?

74
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:49,507
Dr. Jung Seung Jun.

75
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:52,276
Yes. I'll be talking to you as your doctor from now on.

76
00:05:52,277 --> 00:05:54,236
As my patient, you'd better brace yourself.

77
00:05:54,777 --> 00:05:57,947
You're a scary doctor.

78
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,017
Liar.

79
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:01,846
If I were, you would've been here long ago.

80
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,317
Do you know how worried I have been for you?

81
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:07,616
I had my reasons.

82
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:09,087
What reasons?

83
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:11,957
I definitely had my reasons,

84
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:16,226
I don't remember them.

85
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:20,096
Well,

86
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,606
you might have a hard time remembering things.

87
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,267
It's one of your symptoms.

88
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:27,476
A symptom.

89
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:29,846
Oh, right. Do you like apples?

90
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:33,377
I didn't want to come here empty-handed.

91
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,717
You should have them with your bride.

92
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:37,915
An old lady was selling apples in front of the hospital.

93
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,956
But a guy on a bicycle flipped her baskets.

94
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:42,785
They weren't on the ground. These are clean apples.

95
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:43,887
The apples from the ground...

96
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:47,197
They're in here. These are for me.

97
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:54,567
You care too much about others.

98
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:56,305
What?

99
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:59,106
I'd tell you to be more selfish.

100
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:03,976
But I guess it's something you can't change.

101
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,176
Just live however you want.

102
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:10,115
If you want to help someone, help them...

103
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:11,817
even if that means you'll lose out.

104
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:15,725
So I won't end up with any regrets just in case?

105
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,757
No.

106
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:20,627
It's just nice to see that you're always so nice.

107
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:25,666
In the end,

108
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:29,236
kindness always wins.

109
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,606
Ms. Tak, you kind soul.

110
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,846
Let's do our best to overcome this.

111
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:40,817
Okay.

112
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:50,086
How is it that these humans, whom you love so much,

113
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:51,587
only get worse with time?

114
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:53,897
Look at yourself.

115
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:56,827
Do you really think they're worth all this?

116
00:07:58,327 --> 00:07:59,397
Yes.

117
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:02,967
They don't know. They know nothing.

118
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:04,707
You don't know either.

119
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:07,577
I do know. I know because I've heard it too many times.

120
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:12,546
I know that the garden isn't yours.

121
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:16,887
And I'm just a butterfly in that garden.

122
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:23,757
- Right. - Butterflies aren't like gardeners.

123
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:26,327
I'm picky with the flowers I sit on.

124
00:08:28,027 --> 00:08:30,366
That means you and I are different.

125
00:08:32,897 --> 00:08:34,596
There's not a single flower that I like.

126
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:38,736
- Not a single one? - Not a single one.

127
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:40,907
Don't you feel sorry for them?

128
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:42,376
Not at all.

129
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,176
And you don't find them endearing?

130
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:46,246
Not once have I felt that way.

131
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:52,217
I see.

132
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:56,226
I'll be off now.

133
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:58,057
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:08,837
It's too late for that.

135
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:18,817
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:35,167
I'm sorry...

137
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,006
Why is he...

138
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:48,476
I know I'm handsome. But I'm busy.

139
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:13,967
Here. I couldn't come empty-handed.

140
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,506
They're clean.

141
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,366
What do you mean they're clean?

142
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:21,837
They're from you, so I don't care even if they're not clean.

143
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:25,006
They're apples. How did you know I love apples?

144
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:28,846
- Thank you. - No problem.

145
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:32,717
Did you decide to get hospitalized?

146
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:34,287
Yes.

147
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,286
But the thought of getting checkups...

148
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:40,256
and treatment at the hospital is starting to scare me a bit.

149
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:41,596
Look at me.

150
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,467
My surgery went great.

151
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,337
You'll be fine too.

152
00:10:46,697 --> 00:10:49,236
I'm relieved that you're recovering well.

153
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:55,006
Why do you look so sad? You used to be bright and cheerful.

154
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:58,047
Who is it? Who made you like this?

155
00:10:58,746 --> 00:11:01,546
"Bright and cheerful"? Me?

156
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:03,687
You told me you enjoy living life.

157
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:05,816
I thought you chose to get hospitalized for treatment...

158
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:07,817
so you could continue to enjoy that life of yours.

159
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:11,996
But why do you look so down? It's making me feel bad for you.

160
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,766
I guess I told you I enjoyed my life.

161
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:23,636
To be honest, I don't really remember.

162
00:11:24,337 --> 00:11:26,207
I've become very forgetful.

163
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:29,047
I heard it's because of my illness.

164
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,406
It scares me to think...

165
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:35,346
that I've started to forget all my happy memories.

166
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:40,856
But apparently, I'm pretty healthy and in good condition.

167
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:43,287
If I'm lucky, I might even become an outpatient.

168
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:45,297
So I'm going to try and be positive.

169
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:49,096
Of course. I'm going to wish you good luck.

170
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:55,866
Thank you for coming, Ms. Tak.

171
00:12:00,707 --> 00:12:02,447
Once I start chemotherapy,

172
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:05,746
I figured I might not be able to see you for a while.

173
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:08,886
I'll visit you. I'll visit often.

174
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:11,886
I'll visit you with delicious food...

175
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:13,516
and pretty things.

176
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:15,786
Even if you forget everything,

177
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:18,157
I'll make sure you keep making happy memories.

178
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,126
Okay.

179
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:25,126
Do you like tulips?

180
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:27,037
Tulips?

181
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:30,436
Someone brought me this earlier,

182
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:32,106
but I don't have a vase.

183
00:12:33,276 --> 00:12:35,746
I don't want to throw them away since they're so pretty.

184
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:39,276
You should take them.

185
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:42,746
Here's one happy memory for today.

186
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:24,457
Things must've been pretty hectic for me.

187
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:30,667
What date is it today?

188
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:36,766
My goodness, this milk is from ages ago!

189
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:39,505
Is this milk that precious to you?

190
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:41,476
Is that why you've been keeping it for so long?

191
00:13:41,707 --> 00:13:42,707
My gosh.

192
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:52,287
You're still in contact with this jerk?

193
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:54,687
- Who? - Your ex-boyfriend.

194
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:59,827
- Hey! - Dong Kyung.

195
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:02,125
You have a boyfriend?

196
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:03,895
No, it's her ex-boyfriend. You won't believe what...

197
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:06,596
I don't have a boyfriend. He's just a crazy jerk.

198
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,037
I heard the news.

199
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,207
It really made me think.

200
00:14:14,707 --> 00:14:17,677
I even wondered if you got sick because I gave you a hard time.

201
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:20,176
After I got divorced and had my hair pulled out because of you,

202
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:22,446
I had to get treated for hair loss.

203
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,657
But now, I've decided to forgive you.

204
00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:26,856
My gosh.

205
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:29,755
Has he lost his mind?

206
00:14:29,756 --> 00:14:31,557
I can't believe he texted me.

207
00:14:34,797 --> 00:14:37,096
Joon Woo, I love you.

208
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:45,807
You know what? Let's be nice. I forgive him.

209
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:47,836
I forgive everything.

210
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:49,176
I should forget bad memories too.

211
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:50,246
"Forgive"?

212
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:51,576
Forgive, my foot.

213
00:14:51,577 --> 00:14:53,446
Why didn't you block him?

214
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:55,176
She really had a boyfriend?

215
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:58,745
He was never my boyfriend. He's just some crazy piece of trash.

216
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:00,057
My gosh, seriously.

217
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:03,927
(Block)

218
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:05,756
Good job.

219
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,495
Let me know if he contacts you again.

220
00:15:07,496 --> 00:15:09,326
I'll deal with him right away.

221
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:10,466
Shut it.

222
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:12,495
I might deal with you before you get a chance to do that.

223
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:14,596
Why are you being so cranky? I'm only looking out for you.

224
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,475
But didn't you also date some other guy?

225
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:20,776
What are you talking about?

226
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:22,276
I mean...

227
00:15:22,677 --> 00:15:26,176
Why does it feel like you were also seeing someone else?

228
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:28,947
Dong Kyung, you must be pretty popular.

229
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:30,716
Two guys at once?

230
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:32,986
No, don't be absurd.

231
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:36,286
Well, I guess I was wrong. You're not capable of doing that.

232
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:38,626
You're really getting on my nerves. Come here.

233
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:43,297
You punk. You never learn unless you get a beating.

234
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:45,496
But I mean, it's true.

235
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:49,606
Come here. You punk.

236
00:16:58,136 --> 00:16:59,177
What's wrong?

237
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:01,476
Are you down?

238
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:04,106
No, it's just...

239
00:17:05,576 --> 00:17:08,016
the thought of leaving the place empty for a while...

240
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:13,657
I'll have to stop by now and then and check on it.

241
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:15,216
If you need anything,

242
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:16,627
I'll bring it to you right away.

243
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:18,756
What about Uncle?

244
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:20,756
Uncle?

245
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:23,996
He's going to Canada to take care of the stuff and move here.

246
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:29,766
Don't worry.

247
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,236
Because of me...

248
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:35,576
Hey.

249
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,746
Don't even think that, okay?

250
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:58,996
(Love Like a Rain Shower)

251
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:26,427
Leave it. Don't clean up.

252
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:29,927
Hey... Nice. You look good in the hospital gown.

253
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:32,897
Is that a cool tone or a warm tone?

254
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:37,166
Auntie went down to pick up some stuff.

255
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,305
She says she'll be back soon.

256
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:40,407
You didn't need to come.

257
00:18:40,776 --> 00:18:41,906
Hey.

258
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:43,647
If I don't come, who will?

259
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:46,116
I'm a freelancer, remember?

260
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:48,975
You have a hard time waking up in the morning.

261
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:50,947
Did you get some sleep? What about your story?

262
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,457
I finished it.

263
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:55,656
Don't lie to me.

264
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:57,055
I log in every day,

265
00:18:57,056 --> 00:18:58,526
and there was no update.

266
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:00,357
Why? Are you stuck?

267
00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:02,927
I'm writing.

268
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:06,236
I keep writing and deleting.

269
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:08,637
My heart isn't in it.

270
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,306
Get it together, will you?

271
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:14,436
You don't write with your heart.

272
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:15,535
You write with your words.

273
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:17,475
- What is a writer? - A technician.

274
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:20,716
Yes. So have a strong cup of coffee,

275
00:19:20,717 --> 00:19:22,447
wake up, and go write.

276
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:25,515
You can't drink coffee.

277
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:27,315
You should drink juice. Freshly squeezed.

278
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,586
Okay, fine. I will.

279
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,525
That's why people say...

280
00:19:32,526 --> 00:19:34,256
this hospital was built on suspicious land.

281
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:37,927
Maybe this used to be a funeral parlor.

282
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:40,436
I heard they knocked down a building...

283
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:42,197
and erected the new wing.

284
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:46,707
That's right. That funeral parlor is brand new.

285
00:19:47,836 --> 00:19:48,877
Gosh.

286
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:50,946
You're right.

287
00:19:50,947 --> 00:19:53,275
So there must be more than one ghost.

288
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,516
There is more than one?

289
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,745
Yes. Sometimes, he's super tall, then tiny.

290
00:19:57,746 --> 00:19:59,515
Sometimes he's old, sometimes he's young.

291
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:00,816
That's what I hear.

292
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:03,785
- The nurse saw a woman. - Oh my gosh.

293
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:04,956
I just got chills.

294
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:09,427
So you two should be careful. Don't walk around at night.

295
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:11,765
I hear he goes around in broad daylight too.

296
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,765
What use is being careful at night?

297
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:16,467
Still, it's scarier at night since it's dark.

298
00:20:16,806 --> 00:20:18,836
Sure, you have a point.

299
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:22,677
I heard you came to this hospital often.

300
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:24,847
Didn't you ever see anything that gave you the creeps?

301
00:20:26,347 --> 00:20:27,617
The creeps?

302
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:31,246
I did see a super good-looking doctor.

303
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:33,957
A good-looking doctor?

304
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,986
He must've been the ghost.

305
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:39,026
What? Why?

306
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:41,857
I've been here for over a year,

307
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:44,867
and I've never seen a good-looking doctor.

308
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:48,137
There's no way we wouldn't remember.

309
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:52,137
We don't get many chances to see a good-looking man.

310
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:54,306
Let's see.

311
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:57,076
How many good-looking men have I seen in my lifetime?

312
00:20:57,947 --> 00:20:59,976
1, 2...

313
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:03,316
3, 4, 5.

314
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:05,086
That's it. Only five.

315
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:09,256
How many of them did I see in this hospital?

316
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:12,286
Zero.

317
00:21:12,826 --> 00:21:15,255
That's not true. I know I saw one.

318
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,726
He was wearing a lab coat.

319
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:20,967
I can't listen anymore. It's too scary.

320
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:22,336
Why?

321
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:25,506
All of the ghosts here...

322
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:28,276
act like they're doctors.

323
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:30,676
Look. There.

324
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:32,407
- Oh my gosh. - That was scary.

325
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,476
Gosh.

326
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:38,617
That scared me.

327
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,187
- Is he a ghost? - He's a person.

328
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,056
How do you know?

329
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:47,756
He's not good-looking.

330
00:21:52,026 --> 00:21:53,896
Go back up. It's cold.

331
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,867
I'll go after I see you leave.

332
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:57,506
What if you see a ghost?

333
00:21:57,736 --> 00:21:59,975
No. I'll take you to your room...

334
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:02,335
Seriously. There are no such things as ghosts.

335
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:04,107
The person I saw was a human being.

336
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:06,276
- Are you sure? - Yes.

337
00:22:06,717 --> 00:22:08,815
He knew he was good-looking.

338
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:09,986
So there's no doubt.

339
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:13,617
A good-looking man who knows he's good-looking.

340
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:15,756
That's so nice. And dangerous.

341
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:20,127
Go home and write your story, will you?

342
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:21,956
Don't come back until you finish.

343
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:22,966
Hey.

344
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,896
Don't "Hey" me.

345
00:22:24,897 --> 00:22:26,167
Just write.

346
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:28,096
Good luck, Ji Na.

347
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,006
It's not like I can't. I choose not to.

348
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:32,565
Fine. I'll write quickly and come back tomorrow.

349
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:34,707
I like your vigor.

350
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:36,746
- Get home safely. - Thanks.

351
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:47,457
Bye.

352
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,427
Did you know my son?

353
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:31,396
I came to see...

354
00:23:31,397 --> 00:23:33,437
what a dad who beats his kid to death looks like.

355
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:35,367
So this is what he looks like.

356
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:47,147
Who are you?

357
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:49,347
Did his mom send you?

358
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:54,357
I don't know what you've heard,

359
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:57,387
but that woman is out of her mind.

360
00:23:57,957 --> 00:23:59,496
This is what I hear from you.

361
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:01,725
"I'm free."

362
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:03,367
"I got rid of annoying baggage."

363
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,066
"I can start over as long as I don't get caught."

364
00:24:06,397 --> 00:24:07,796

365
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:15,306
- You killed him. - What garbage...

366
00:24:16,546 --> 00:24:17,575
Hey.

367
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:19,677
Did that witch say she'll pay you for saying that?

368
00:24:20,316 --> 00:24:21,716
I won't share a dime...

369
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:23,516
of the insurance payout or compensation,

370
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:25,986
Just give your monetary gift and go.

371
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:28,957
Who told you that garbage?

372
00:24:30,187 --> 00:24:31,486
A broken bone in your right leg.

373
00:24:32,486 --> 00:24:33,957
Two broken ribs.

374
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:40,565
You stepped on and broke...

375
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:43,266
that tiny body so badly that it was completely broken.

376
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:48,907
You enjoyed doing as you pleased, didn't you?

377
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,857
Why can't I reach?

378
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,127
Darn it.

379
00:26:13,357 --> 00:26:14,396
I'm sure you didn't know.

380
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:16,897
It's within my authority to destroy, not yours.

381
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,835
You abused my authority without permission,

382
00:26:24,836 --> 00:26:26,377
so I plan to return the favor.

383
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:27,976
What do you say?

384
00:27:13,286 --> 00:27:14,687
What a hassle.

What is this?

397
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:21,579
What is this? Why are you here?

398
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,809
Your story is stuck, right?

399
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,820
Why do you care?

400
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:27,919
You said we wouldn't meet even for work.

401
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,448
That's what you said.

402
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:30,519
Right.

403
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:33,259
I can't seem to stick to what I say.

404
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,229
So why do you keep popping up in my head?

405
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:38,930
- Are you blaming me for it? - Yes.

406
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:44,339
I quit my job.

407
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,869

Partially, yes.

409
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:49,779
So you want to hold me responsible?

410
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,339
What does that have to do with my writing?

411
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,180
No. I feel responsible...

412
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:57,479
because I might be the reason why you're stuck.

413
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,420
Stop speaking nonsense. Just leave.

414
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:02,989

You can go first.

418
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,620
You're not the male lead.

419
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,019
It's your turn.

420
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,729
I'm going to ask you something important now.

421
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,259
Do you like me?

422
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,330
I want a clear answer.

423
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,440
- Why? - So my stance can be clear.

424
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,709
Either to steal you from him...

425
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:59,039
- Or get over me? - No.

426
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,509
To be in one-sided love.

427
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,259
I'm sure you need time to think.

428
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,289
Think about it and get back to me.

429
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,799
Where are you going now?

430
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,469
Home.

431
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,498
- Now? - For the next episode,

432
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:25,340
write about how you met him again after nine years.

433
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:44,789
He's unbelievable.

434
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,410
I don't drink this kind of stuff.

435
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:03,840
- You can't drink coffee? - No.

436
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:08,380
Because it's from the vending machine?

437
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,920
You have a refined palate.

438
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,979
In fact, I don't eat anything.

439
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,189
Is it that you "don't" eat or you "can't" eat?

440
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,559
- I don't. - Then, do you eat food...

441
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,330
from the altar?

442
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,430
- What? - I'm sorry, but can I poke you?

443
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:27,099
Gosh. I can touch you.

444
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,570
Then, you're not a ghost.

445
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:33,199
Then, how did you do that earlier?

446
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:37,079
- "That"? - The cars started to honk...

447
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,239
and the lights were on and off.

448
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:41,278
Is that your specialty?

449
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,180
- Specialty? - Do you deal with machines?

450
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,650
Or electricity?

451
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,488
I mean, I had the same thought when I saw him the other day.

452
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:57,400
But how can a ghost look so handsome?

453
00:32:58,299 --> 00:32:59,330
You.

454
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,799
You've seen me before?

455
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:03,370
What?

456
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:06,339
You and I bumped into each other at the hospital...

457
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,739
when you were wearing your gown. Don't you remember that?

458
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:12,009
You remember my face?

459
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,808
Of course, I do.

460
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:16,110
Your face isn't easy to forget.

461
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,050
That's why the ladies told me they didn't see any handsome guy.

462
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,388
Occupational hazard. I read a lot of web novels.

463
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:27,829
So I'm used to abnormal situations.

464
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:29,090
Don't mind me.

465
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,130
Okay. I don't have to.

466
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,170
But how did I suddenly end up seeing ghosts?

467
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,280
Is hallucination a symptom of brain tumors?

468
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:46,510
Is he a ghost? Or am I seeing things?

469
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,308
- That might be better. - Pardon?

470
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:49,550
Pretend you're hallucinating.

471
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:51,050
Okay. What?

472
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,490
Did you just read my mind?

473
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,888
I don't read people's minds. I just hear them.

474
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:01,728
Why are you eavesdropping on my thoughts?

475
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:02,990
Is that important now?

476
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,030
You're starting to hallucinate now.

477
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,799
Right.

478
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,970
Why do you think I'm hallucinating?

479
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,299
Do you need to talk to me?

480
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,569
Or do I have to help you let go of your grudge?

481
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,538
I saw you chasing someone earlier.

482
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:18,010
Should I help you?

483
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,679
I don't need your pity. It looks like you'll end up like him soon.

484
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:24,880
- Pardon? - You'll die soon.

485
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:32,590
You'll die.

486
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:36,929
Whatever you try, you are fated to die.

487
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,639
- I'm going to die? - Yes.

488
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:51,780
I must get going. I was in the middle of something.

489
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,849
Even if you talk about me with other people,

490
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,720
they'll just think it's one of your symptoms.

491
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,389
So keep your mouth shut.

492
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,459
Wait. Hold on. Hey!

493
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:11,029
What an annoying jerk.

494
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,099
And why did he talk down to me?

495
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:15,099
Gosh.

496
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,929
Why am I so sleepy?

497
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:07,289
Is anyone there?

498
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,190
There's someone in here!

499
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,590
Help!

500
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,760
Help!

501
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,139
How does it feel to be locked up for a change?

502
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,780
I'm sorry. I mean, I'm sorry, sir.

503
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:35,349
Forgive me. Please.

504
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:39,420
You never listened no matter how much he begged.

505
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,058
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

506
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:47,089
No! No! I'm sorry! No!

507
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,590
Did you hear what happened at the hospital yesterday?

508
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:52,529
Some guy came to the ER for consuming rat poison.

509
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,999
He was out of his mind...

510
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,368
and kept saying, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

511
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:57,570
He kept repeating that.

512
00:36:57,869 --> 00:36:59,138
Also, some crazy guy...

513
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:01,440
went inside the morgue last night.

514
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:04,038
He had gone insane when they found him this morning.

515
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,538
He kept saying he killed his own son.

516
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:07,848
Apparently, he just kept talking nonsense.

517
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:10,578
So that's why the police were here.

518
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:11,619
Yes.

519
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,990
Auntie, should we go to another hospital?

520
00:37:16,749 --> 00:37:18,819
No, I should stick with Mr. Jung as my doctor.

521
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,630
But this place is really weird.

522
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:23,459
It's the same everywhere.

523
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,429
It won't be much different at a bigger hospital.

524
00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:27,900
Plus, it's better here since you're acquainted with your doctor.

525
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:30,800
I swear...

526
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,300
there's a ghost here.

527
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,109
Ta-da! Dong Kyung!

528
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,279
Hey, shouldn't you be at work?

529
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,708
What are you doing here at this hour?

530
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:41,708
I dropped by to see you...

531
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:43,650
before I went to work.

532
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:45,450
And my pretty auntie.

533
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:48,920
- My gosh. - You really know how to flatter me.

534
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:50,519
They're walnut pastries.

535
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:53,789
I ran over here so they won't get cold.

536
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,329
They're still pretty warm.

537
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,158
- Hello. - Hi.

538
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,498
I hope you ladies get along with my sister.

539
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:01,228
- Thank you. - Gosh, thank you.

540
00:38:01,229 --> 00:38:02,670
You guys should try some too.

541
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:04,699
- Thank you. - Thanks.

542
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,038
You're one handsome fellow.

543
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:08,339
Gosh, that's nonsense.

544
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,678
You're the most handsome guy I've seen at this hospital.

545
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:11,679
I agree.

546
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,849
You should come by often.

547
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:16,380
Okay, I will. Thank you.

548
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,748
I'm off now. I'll come back after work.

549
00:38:18,749 --> 00:38:20,820
- Don't come. - You're all over the place.

550
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,920
- Dong Kyung. - Just go to work already.

551
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:26,490
My goodness.

552
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,829
- He's second best. - Number two.

553
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,959
Do you know how busy I am?

554
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,030
Yes, I do.

555
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:38,300
What brings a busy man like you to the hospital?

556
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,340
I'm sure you didn't come to eat walnut pastries.

557
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:42,839
I had work nearby, so I thought I'd visit.

558
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,940
I was passing by.

559
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,339
But what made you drop by?

560
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,649
How did you find out?

561
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,979
I asked my mom.

562
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:51,450
I think she asked Mr. Park.

563
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,519
I guess Mr. Park asked Ms. Jo.

564
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,789
Why are you here?

565
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,720
Isn't it obvious?

566
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,329
I came to help you enjoy a more comfortable time here.

567
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:04,599
How can a writer like you...

568
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,498
I mean, how exactly can you help me enjoy...

569
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:12,539
a more comfortable time here?

570
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,869
Can't you see that everyone's looking at us?

571
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,138
Even those ladies from earlier...

572
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:17,940
suddenly looked at us with a smile.

573
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,709
My fans tell me that my good looks are like welfare.

574
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Right.

575
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:29,490
I guess I'm living in a country with amazing welfare.

576
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,289
Be honest. You're here to check your popularity, aren't you?

577
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,459
Well, that's also part of it.

578
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,800
Gosh.

579
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:42,829
How did that story go?

580
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,768
What story?

581
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:46,969
The story where the world gets destroyed if she chooses...

582
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,339
the person she loves,

583
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,139
and if she protects the world, her love ends up dying.

584
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:53,440
Has the writer decided on the ending?

585
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,979
What? I asked you that?

586
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:57,979
What? You forgot already?

587
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:00,650
Gosh, I've been dying to know how it ends.

588
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,360
I thought about it,

589
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,090
and I think it would be a great time-slip story.

590
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:09,029
You turn back time...

591
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,599
so you can avoid having to make that choice.

592
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:14,669
You try your best to avoid the situation,

593
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,598
but fate brings you to fall in love all over again.

594
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,369
And then, you'll have no choice but to make a choice.

595
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:21,638
I see why your time-slip novel...

596
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,869
managed to get into the top 10.

597
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:25,610
You're really letting your talent go to waste.

598
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,450
Do you really not want to keep writing?

599
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,219
- I do. - You do?

600
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,749
But I'm going to do it in secret.

601
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,789
Gosh, I really need to go to work.

602
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:44,559
I'll visit again.

603
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,400
What? You're visiting again?

604
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:48,669
Why? You don't need to.

605
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,228
- I'm going to come. - Why?

606
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:51,369
I don't have friends.

607
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,638
- You don't have friends? - No.

608
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,809
Really? Why?

609
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:57,740
- I'm shy. - You're shy?

610
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,308
How exactly? Are you sure you're shy?

611
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:02,749
Or are you just joking?

612
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,920
You're so funny.

613
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:08,820
I like you because you're funny.

614
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,820
I didn't mean to be funny. It was a serious question.

615
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,090
Gosh, you're hilarious.

616
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:16,059
My gosh.

617
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,400
What's so funny?

618
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,019
Do you like me?

619
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,050
Does he think I'm crazy?

620
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,200
("He Always Smells of Soap")

621
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,079
Lee Hyun.

622
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:08,079
Lee Hyun.

623
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,280
Lee Hyun?

624
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:12,979
- Kyu! - You startled me.

625
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,789
What?

626
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:16,849
Did you forget your name?

627
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,920
Why do you keep mumbling your own name?

628
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,659
Kyu.

629
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,269
Lee Hyun Kyu.

630
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,729
Kyu... Hyun Kyu.

631
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,869
Yes, I get it now.

632
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:35,308
It's Lee Hyun Kyu.

633
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:38,309
Yes, that's right. Your name is Lee Hyun Kyu.

634
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:44,578
Let's eat.

635
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:46,619
Meet me at Stupid Tteokbokki, the place we always used to go.

636
00:42:47,389 --> 00:42:49,748
Hey, I need to go somewhere.

637
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:52,360
- You'll have to do without me. - Where are you going?

638
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:57,090
Hello? Sir?

639
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,659
Where are you going?

640
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:05,539
I can tell he's on his way to meet a woman.

641
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,869
Gosh, everyone's dating but me.

642
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:13,610
- Thanks for coming. - No problem.

643
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:15,450
I'll visit again amid my busy schedule.

644
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,220
I'll see you.

645
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,248
Hang in there, Dong Kyung.

646
00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:24,659
Isn't that Park Young?

647
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:26,959
- You're right. - He's Park Young.

648
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:29,958
The doors are closing.

649
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:31,030
Going down.

650
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:41,010
Should I help you open it?

651
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,050
Here.

652
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:50,880
Hey, wait.

653
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:55,150
Have you been to the rooftop?

654
00:43:56,389 --> 00:43:58,720
- The rooftop? - It's nice there.

655
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:01,059
You should go try it.

656
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:02,829
Okay.

657
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,030
Do you want my autograph?

658
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,030
Who are you?

659
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,829
- Don't you know who I am? - Am I supposed to know?

660
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:42,400
- Then why did you look at me? - What do you care?

661
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,929
How immature.

662
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,740
- What? - You're immature.

663
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:49,339
If you don't know who I am, why did you stop me?

664
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,010
There's enough room to pass by since you're so little.

665
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,079
- Why are you provoking me? - I just want to for some reason.

666
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:57,280
Get out of my way.

667
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:07,159
That annoying punk seems familiar. That little rat.

668
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,229
It's just so weird.

669
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:16,170
Someone recognized me.

670
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,740
- Who? - Isn't that strange?

671
00:45:23,209 --> 00:45:25,179
No one's ever recognized me before.

672
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:28,408
I was having some fun,

673
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:30,280
and some weird girl caught me.

674
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,090
But it doesn't matter. She's going to die next month.

675
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:42,789
By the way, about that plant...

676
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:44,829
What is that? Why are you tending to it so much?

677
00:45:45,229 --> 00:45:46,329
It's almost dead.

678
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,570
You.

679
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,539
Why is that me?

680
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,789
I thought you hated rice cakes.

681
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:11,159
I do.

682
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,789
I'm trying to overcome trauma.

683
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,200
Should we get squid tempura?

684
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:25,999
You loved their squid tempura here.

685
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:28,440
It was good.

686
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,269
But I can't eat squid anymore.

687
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,909
Why not?

688
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,979
When I was 23,

689
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,650
I got indigestion after eating one. Now, I get hives if I eat squid.

690
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,450
Really?

691
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,450
You can get it if you want.

692
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,019
No, it's okay.

693
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,058
You didn't eat tteokbokki back then when you swam...

694
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:50,459
because you had to keep in shape, but I guess not anymore.

695
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,530
Well...

696
00:46:53,459 --> 00:46:55,070
I don't swim anymore, so...

697
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,708
Don't you think their food tastes different now?

698
00:47:05,709 --> 00:47:06,780
Really?

699
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,880
I can't tell. It's still good.

700
00:47:15,389 --> 00:47:16,420
Is it?

701
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:31,170
Wasn't it somewhere here?

702
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,400
Didn't we write on the wall too?

703
00:47:34,409 --> 00:47:36,670
I guess kids still do that even now.

704
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:38,110
How cute.

705
00:47:40,179 --> 00:47:41,749
This is from five years ago.

706
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,320
- Maybe ours is here too. - It's not.

707
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,950
I looked for it when I came a long time ago.

708
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:50,150
Too many people wrote over it, so you can't see it.

709
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,789
What are you doing tomorrow?

710
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:59,760
Tomorrow? I'll probably go to the hospital.

711
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,800
Why? Are you sick?

712
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:03,030
No, someone I know.

713
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,499
Do I know the person too?

714
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,900
No.

715
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,289
It's so weird...

716
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:30,760
being in a car with you driving.

717
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,459
Think of our age.

718
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:35,599
Why didn't you bring your car?

719
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:38,999
What? Well...

720
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:40,539
Because I live so close?

721
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,570
You live far away.

722
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:47,809
Why did you bring yours when you live so close?

723
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:50,579
So I wouldn't drink.

724
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,348
Because if I drink, I become honest,

725
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:56,320
and if I'm honest, I make mistakes.

726
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:57,860
I didn't want to make a mistake.

727
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,970
Do you smoke?

728
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:16,070
Yes.

729
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,309
I didn't know.

730
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,139
You couldn't have known...

731
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,150
since I started it when I was 20.

732
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,249
Right. If you started to smoke when you were 20...

733
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,820
You hated the smell of smoke.

734
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,749
I know.

735
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:34,190
I never imagined I'd become a smoker.

736
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,389
Don't you smoke?

737
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:40,130
No. I smoked a little long time ago, but I quit.

738
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:43,670
I see. True. Athletes usually don't smoke.

739
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:47,909
I'm not an athlete anymore.

740
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,979
That's right.

741
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:15,499
Thanks for the lift.

742
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:19,070
Go in. I'll call you.

743
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,300
Okay.

744
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:28,749
Hey.

745
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:31,920
You said you were a writer, right?

746
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,420
Yes.

747
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,690
What's your pen name?

748
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:39,119
- Why? - Is it Lee Hyun by any chance?

749
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,030
How did you know that?

750
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,260
- Did Joo Ik... - So it was you.

751
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:47,869
He didn't tell me.

752
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,469
The main characters in your stories...

753
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:53,539
Did you read them?

754
00:50:57,539 --> 00:51:00,280
- A few. - Don't read them anymore.

755
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:05,380
Why not? They were all about me.

756
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,749
Why can't I read them?

757
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:11,059
That's why.

758
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,558
Since you know the story anyway.

759
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,220
What about your new story?

760
00:51:15,459 --> 00:51:16,959
Your new story...

761
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:20,530
is about something I don't know.

762
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:24,969
Well... That's...

763
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:25,999
Bye.

764
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,139
I shouldn't have asked.

765
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,840
Hyun Kyu.

766
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,179
Let's grab a drink sometime.

767
00:51:34,909 --> 00:51:37,248
I'll be someone you can make a mistake in front of,

768
00:51:37,249 --> 00:51:38,519
someone you can be honest to.

769
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,479
I wasn't prepared today.

770
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:41,990
Get home safely.

771
00:52:23,564 --> 00:52:25,263
The moon is so bright.

772
00:52:26,134 --> 00:52:27,833
This is really nice.

773
00:52:32,303 --> 00:52:33,303
You again?

774
00:52:39,214 --> 00:52:41,413
You shouldn't smoke in a hospital.

775
00:52:44,013 --> 00:52:45,053
Mind your own business.

776
00:52:46,154 --> 00:52:49,723
It is my own business. Because you'll end up hurting me.

777
00:52:50,053 --> 00:52:51,392
You're the one who will hurt others.

778
00:52:51,393 --> 00:52:53,094
If you want to die, go die somewhere else.

779
00:52:54,723 --> 00:52:56,622
Do you own the entire roof?

780
00:52:56,623 --> 00:52:58,163
Yes, I do.

781
00:52:58,433 --> 00:52:59,864
So die somewhere else.

782
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:01,463
I said it twice now.

783
00:53:01,464 --> 00:53:04,003
Why do you keep saying I'm dying?

784
00:53:04,004 --> 00:53:05,973
When you're already dead.

785
00:53:06,274 --> 00:53:07,333
I'm not a ghost.

786
00:53:07,873 --> 00:53:09,503
Then you should know even better.

787
00:53:09,504 --> 00:53:11,274
All people die.

788
00:53:11,473 --> 00:53:13,043
I never said I was a person either.

789
00:53:13,044 --> 00:53:15,344
You must really be sick.

790
00:53:15,444 --> 00:53:17,083
Don't start up with me.

791
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:19,782
I wish...

792
00:53:19,783 --> 00:53:23,053
the entire world will be destroyed right now.

793
00:53:24,424 --> 00:53:25,924
I like that.

794
00:53:26,094 --> 00:53:28,093
What? What do you like?

795
00:53:28,094 --> 00:53:30,524
That you wish the entire world will be destroyed.

796
00:53:42,703 --> 00:53:44,373
You know what? I like you.

797
00:53:46,044 --> 00:53:47,243
You have potential.

798
00:53:48,844 --> 00:53:50,682
What are you doing? You're scaring me.

799
00:53:50,683 --> 00:53:53,314
You're scared? Now, you're scared?

800
00:53:55,183 --> 00:53:56,353
A little late, don't you think?

801
00:53:57,683 --> 00:53:59,953
People say you're dense, don't they?

802
00:54:06,194 --> 00:54:08,903
Seriously. You must really want me off this roof.

803
00:54:08,904 --> 00:54:10,202
Fine, I'll leave.

804
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:13,433
I'll leave because you disgust me and scare me.

805
00:54:13,703 --> 00:54:14,873
Darn it.

806
00:54:23,114 --> 00:54:25,012
Why are you following me?

807
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:26,254
I'm not following you.

808
00:54:27,413 --> 00:54:30,222
Either be polite or not. Choose one.

809
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:32,053
Fine. I choose not to be polite.

810
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:33,493
What floor?

811
00:54:34,393 --> 00:54:35,424
Who knows?

812
00:54:38,094 --> 00:54:40,694
Fourth floor. Going down.

813
00:54:44,004 --> 00:54:45,333
You'll be in pain soon.

814
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:50,944
What?

815
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,074
What do you mean...

816
00:55:07,594 --> 00:55:09,924
See? I told you so.

817
00:55:24,044 --> 00:55:26,944
No. Hey. Help me.

818
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,913
Is that your wish?

819
00:55:30,484 --> 00:55:32,114
Help me.

820
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,053
I'm asking you if that's your wish.

821
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,553
If I help you, what can you do for me?

822
00:56:18,694 --> 00:56:19,833
Are you okay?

823
00:56:22,603 --> 00:56:24,302
- Yes. - If you're okay,

824
00:56:24,303 --> 00:56:26,734
ask me to destroy the world.

825
00:56:30,174 --> 00:56:31,174
What?

826
00:56:31,714 --> 00:56:33,814
Ask me to grant you that wish.

827
00:56:35,384 --> 00:56:37,743
- What are you... - You'll die soon.

828
00:56:39,114 --> 00:56:40,314
Don't you think it's not fair?

829
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:43,353
A kind girl like you will die so young.

830
00:56:43,623 --> 00:56:45,893
But those who are evil will live much, much longer.

831
00:56:48,163 --> 00:56:51,763
On your way out of this world, let's get rid of evil people...

832
00:56:52,763 --> 00:56:54,033
and this world too.

833
00:56:57,404 --> 00:56:59,174
Let's say I make that wish.

834
00:56:59,274 --> 00:57:01,274
Do you even have the power to grant me that wish?

835
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,444
Why do you keep telling me such nonsense?

836
00:57:05,973 --> 00:57:07,373
How will you explain this?

837
00:57:11,353 --> 00:57:13,783
You're not in pain anymore because I held your hand.

838
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:17,884
It's a coincidence.

839
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,393
I see. A coincidence?

840
00:57:25,094 --> 00:57:26,134
Okay.

841
00:57:28,634 --> 00:57:29,964
Doors are opening.

842
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,484
Then, how will you explain this place?

843
00:57:48,853 --> 00:57:50,053
Is this a coincidence too?

844
00:57:52,623 --> 00:57:53,824
What on earth...

845
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:55,993
How...

846
00:57:56,893 --> 00:57:58,033
You wanted it.

847
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:04,533
Who are you?

848
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:06,574
You're neither a ghost nor a human.

849
00:58:07,873 --> 00:58:10,574
Doom which you've been asking for.

850
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,183
Am I dead now?

851
00:58:16,344 --> 00:58:17,844
Did I die and leave the living realm?

852
00:58:19,283 --> 00:58:22,154
Not now. That will happen soon enough.

853
00:58:23,524 --> 00:58:25,524
So I want to help you a bit.

854
00:58:27,294 --> 00:58:29,623
I'll let you be free of pain until the moment you die.

855
00:58:31,024 --> 00:58:33,694
- How? - I'll hold your hand like earlier.

856
00:58:34,464 --> 00:58:36,364
- What do you want in exchange? - A contract.

857
00:58:37,864 --> 00:58:40,504
You can ask me to destroy the world before you die.

858
00:58:41,274 --> 00:58:42,673
You can do it yourself. Why are you asking me?

859
00:58:42,674 --> 00:58:44,274
If I could, I would've done it long ago.

860
00:58:45,013 --> 00:58:47,344
- You think I can help you do that? - Probably.

861
00:58:47,973 --> 00:58:49,214
- Why? - I don't know.

862
00:58:51,413 --> 00:58:53,654
I don't know. I just...

863
00:58:58,123 --> 00:58:59,294
thought so.

864
00:59:03,094 --> 00:59:04,324
If you're in, hold my hand.

865
00:59:18,643 --> 00:59:19,714
No.

866
00:59:20,344 --> 00:59:21,713
I think I would feel pain...

867
00:59:21,714 --> 00:59:24,444
somewhere else if I hold your hand.

868
00:59:27,154 --> 00:59:29,154
I didn't think you were the doubting type.

869
00:59:30,353 --> 00:59:32,122
I was tempted for a second, though.

870
00:59:32,123 --> 00:59:33,654
I love this place.

871
00:59:34,553 --> 00:59:36,123
You came here when you wanted to cry.

872
00:59:36,393 --> 00:59:37,964
I made a lot of good memories here.

873
00:59:38,294 --> 00:59:39,533
Like what?

874
00:59:42,134 --> 00:59:43,433
I don't see any happy memories.

875
00:59:43,603 --> 00:59:45,404
It must be because of my illness.

876
00:59:48,803 --> 00:59:51,203
I definitely came here with someone.

877
00:59:52,373 --> 00:59:53,614
But I can't remember it.

878
00:59:54,413 --> 00:59:56,384
I think I was really happy here.

879
01:00:00,553 --> 01:00:06,123
As you know, my brain up here isn't working that well now.

880
01:00:10,163 --> 01:00:12,694
- What about the bracelet? - The bracelet?

881
01:00:13,864 --> 01:00:14,933
Oh, this?

882
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:16,904
I don't know.

883
01:00:17,064 --> 01:00:20,174
I just feel anxious when I don't wear it.

884
01:01:14,723 --> 01:01:15,723
What?

885
01:02:05,643 --> 01:02:07,274
You did something to me, didn't you?

886
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,913
Tell me.

887
01:02:13,654 --> 01:02:15,024
What did you do to me?

888
01:02:15,553 --> 01:02:18,223
I didn't do anything to you. It was her.

889
01:02:20,553 --> 01:02:21,663
I did something...

890
01:02:22,623 --> 01:02:23,864
to Tak Dong Kyung.

891
01:02:45,183 --> 01:02:46,254
I knew it.

892
01:02:48,114 --> 01:02:49,924
Some things are inevitable.

893
01:02:59,634 --> 01:03:01,492
(You have 54 contacts.)

894
01:03:01,493 --> 01:03:03,663
(Search, no recent searches)

895
01:03:04,263 --> 01:03:07,603
(Human)

896
01:03:13,714 --> 01:03:20,754
(Human)

897
01:04:04,893 --> 01:04:05,964
Tak Dong Kyung.

898
01:04:08,064 --> 01:04:09,464
How do you know my name?

899
01:04:10,734 --> 01:04:11,873
Who are you?

900
01:04:13,134 --> 01:04:14,274
Then, who are you?

901
01:04:44,234 --> 01:04:46,933
(Doom At Your Service)

902
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,403
You did this, didn't you?

903
01:04:49,404 --> 01:04:51,073
Why do you keep following me?

904
01:04:51,074 --> 01:04:52,113
Oh, gosh.

905
01:04:52,114 --> 01:04:53,344
Let me take a look at you.

906
01:04:54,243 --> 01:04:55,643
Why do you always fall?

907
01:04:56,544 --> 01:04:57,683
I have a question.

908
01:04:58,183 --> 01:04:59,353
Did you kiss her?

909
01:05:00,114 --> 01:05:01,924
I don't want to be a coward with you.

910
01:05:02,384 --> 01:05:03,984
Death is nothing.

911
01:05:05,553 --> 01:05:06,694
How...

912
01:05:07,123 --> 01:05:09,923
It feels really lonely...

913
01:05:09,924 --> 01:05:11,694
to watch something disappear.

914
01:05:13,393 --> 01:05:14,794
Don't cry.

915
01:05:16,303 --> 01:05:17,634
I'm sorry.

916
01:05:25,044 --> 01:05:26,044
Don't forget.

917
01:05:26,045 --> 01:05:28,173
We were born with a special gift.

918
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,313
This is Derek.

919
01:05:29,314 --> 01:05:30,613
Tell me everything you know about the culprit.

920
01:05:30,614 --> 01:05:31,642
This may be hard to believe,

921
01:05:31,643 --> 01:05:33,313
but the culprit has a special hearing ability.

922
01:05:33,314 --> 01:05:35,623
If you turn out to be wrong, my sister will be in danger.

923
01:05:35,884 --> 01:05:37,182
Can you guarantee what you just said?

924
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,924
