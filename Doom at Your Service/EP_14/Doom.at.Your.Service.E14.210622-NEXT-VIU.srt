3
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,166
(Episode 14)

4
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:29,993
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:37,302
Which one are you apologizing for?

6
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:40,707
For deciding to erase our memories?

7
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,672
Or for falling for my looks again?

8
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:45,942
Both.

9
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,412
I'm sorry for everything.

10
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:57,622
No, I'm sorry...

11
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:03,062
for looking so handsome.

12
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:16,243
Come to think of it, that's what I was doing.

13
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:19,243
I think...

14
00:01:20,217 --> 00:01:23,982
everything I did this whole time was to go back to you.

15
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:27,323
I wanted to face the consequence by myself.

16
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:32,222
I thought I would be able to get away.

17
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:36,392
But look where I ended up.

18
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:42,002
What do we do?

19
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:45,672
What should we do now?

20
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:49,872
We finally realized...

21
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:54,683
that whatever we try, we can't escape this.

22
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,353
So we should...

23
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:03,392
acknowledge it.

24
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:07,592
- What? - Our fate.

25
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:10,932
Let's accept it.

26
00:02:15,378 --> 00:02:16,503
Okay?

27
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:19,973
That's your plan, right?

28
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,913
You're planning...

29
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:27,753
to dissipate for me, right?

30
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:33,182
It doesn't matter what I say.

31
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:36,293
It won't change anything.

32
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:40,492
Whatever we try,

33
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:44,033
we won't be able to...

34
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:46,862
escape our fate, right?

35
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:57,443
Right.

36
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:03,152
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:07,952
Why are you apologizing? You didn't do anything wrong.

38
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,362
It's all my fault.

39
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:13,927
If I didn't make such a stupid wish that day...

40
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,962
Then, we wouldn't have met.

41
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,103
And I can't have that.

42
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,172
If we never met,

43
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,202
I would still be nothing.

44
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:28,642
I want to mean something to you.

45
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:31,682
Experiencing that once will be enough for me.

46
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:40,482
So you didn't do anything wrong.

47
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:43,952
It's always been my fault.

48
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:47,022
So let me have my way.

49
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:50,093
Okay?

50
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:06,343
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:10,753
It's all my fault.

52
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:43,233
I looked for you everywhere.

53
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:45,603
What did you need from home?

54
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:47,132
Me.

55
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:51,173
Doctor?

56
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:56,248
Aunt, you remember him?

57
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:59,483
Goodness, Dong Kyung. Of course, I remember him.

58
00:04:59,518 --> 00:05:00,587
What's that supposed to mean?

59
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:03,023
Do you think I've become forgetful due to my age?

60
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:05,157
No, that's not what I meant.

61
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:08,492
It's been a while, so I was worried you might not remember me.

62
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:10,793
That's probably why she asked.

63
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:15,163
Actually, come to think of it, I really haven't...

64
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:17,233
seen you around recently.

65
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:20,632
What were you so busy with?

66
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:23,702
I was busy getting things done.

67
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:25,047
What do you mean?

68
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:28,142
There's a lot to prepare before a wedding.

69
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:31,682
Dong Kyung and I...

70
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:35,452
are going to get married.

71
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:38,622
What?

72
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,452
You're getting married?

73
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:46,833
Let's close the cafe early today.

74
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,302
What? Already?

75
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:50,163
It's not time to close yet.

76
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:53,502
Mr. Lee.

77
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,308
When you run a business,

78
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:58,043
it's crucial to keep the promise we make to our customers.

79
00:06:00,678 --> 00:06:02,083
Mr. Lee, is there something wrong?

80
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:04,258
- Does it look like it? - Yes, very much.

81
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:05,812
I feel like you're about to cry.

82
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:08,653
You look like a man walking in the rain all by himself.

83
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:10,583
The rain...

84
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:14,192
I heard it rained that day.

85
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,723
That day? When?

86
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,432
It didn't rain yesterday.

87
00:06:18,568 --> 00:06:19,793
That day,

88
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:23,638
when she kissed some other guy.

89
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:26,233
What? Who? Ji...

90
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:31,812
I mean, you mean the lady from yesterday?

91
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:36,343
But it doesn't matter.

92
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:39,318
It's all in the past.

93
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:40,983
So that doesn't matter.

94
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:43,583
It doesn't matter?

95
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:45,657
You must really love her.

96
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:48,622
Yes, it doesn't matter.

97
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:52,033
The real problem is...

98
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:00,502
I got dumped yesterday.

99
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:04,378
Just stay as you were. Go on.

100
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:05,572
I'll do everything.

101
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:07,673
Get some rest.

102
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:10,682
Ji Na is unbelievable.

103
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:15,952
Hello. Oh, hey.

104
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:26,593
Come back home.

105
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,002
They know each other.

106
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:35,707
They even live together, but he didn't tell me.

107
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:37,473
He was totally toying with me, right?

108
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:42,312
Number... Number two?

109
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,023
Ji Na.

110
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:52,692
You startled me. You're here early. Did work finish early?

111
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:54,153
Ji Na.

112
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:55,527
What?

113
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:57,093
Did you dump Mr. Lee?

114
00:07:57,498 --> 00:07:58,733
That got around pretty quickly.

115
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:00,163
You really dumped him?

116
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:03,533
- I wouldn't say I dumped him. - And whom did you kiss?

117
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:05,572
How do you know about that?

118
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:08,248
That only happened recently. I can't believe he told you already.

119
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:10,002
It happened recently?

120
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:12,043
Which one are you talking about?

121
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:14,483
From what I heard, it was ages ago.

122
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:16,012
What?

123
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:19,812
You kissed him again recently?

124
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:22,583
Do you go around kissing people?

125
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:25,558
What is it that makes guys fall for you?

126
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:27,657
Whom did you kiss and when?

127
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:28,928
It was with number two, right?

128
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:30,723
I guess it was. It was with number two.

129
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,907
Dong Kyung, Ji Na recently...

130
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:38,632
No, don't listen to him.

131
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:40,973
They're getting married.

132
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,012
No, we're not exactly getting married.

133
00:08:45,878 --> 00:08:46,973
That's the news.

134
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:48,483
No, it's not.

135
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:50,343
It is.

136
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:52,713
Yes, I think it's going to happen.

137
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,527
Can we talk in private?

138
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:58,827
I need to talk to you too.

139
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:00,792
My gosh. But...

140
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:10,162
Is that why you haven't been around lately?

141
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,902
It's not that I wasn't around.

142
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:17,912
It's more so you didn't know.

143
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:21,713
Well, I obviously didn't know you wanted to marry her.

144
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,012
Brother.

145
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:30,282
You're a very magnanimous guy.

146
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:33,292
I'm far from becoming like you.

147
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:38,933
Let's be honest. It's not an easy decision to make.

148
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:43,063
I don't exactly feel comfortable about it.

149
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:47,872
Oh, here.

150
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:51,443
I always kept it with me thinking this was bound to come.

151
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,142
It's the money I saved up ever since I turned 20.

152
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:57,113
Why are you giving me this?

153
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:00,657
I always carried this around wondering when and how...

154
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:03,353
I should give this to my sister.

155
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:07,693
And I think this is the right time.

156
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:10,262
You can use it for the wedding.

157
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:14,233
(Savings account)

158
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:22,303
To be honest, I thought you were a real bum.

159
00:10:23,147 --> 00:10:25,378
You were handsome and seemed rich,

160
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:28,213
so I didn't get why you liked my penniless sister.

161
00:10:30,787 --> 00:10:33,752
I bet you had no idea I thought that about you.

162
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,782
You're right. I had no idea.

163
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:40,652
But now I can't stop thinking that Dong Kyung got really lucky.

164
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:43,363
Maybe it's because she lived such a kind life.

165
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:47,093
You must've been really kind too...

166
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,933
seeing that you ended up meeting my sister.

167
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:01,113
I hope you'll continue...

168
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:04,853
to stay by my sister's side.

169
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:13,922
You'll do that, right?

170
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:22,333
Yes.

171
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:48,762
Seriously? You're getting married?

172
00:11:50,598 --> 00:11:52,093
I guess that's what he wants.

173
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:58,032
What about you?

174
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:00,203
Do you not feel the same way?

175
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:04,642
I want to do everything he wants.

176
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,947
Listen. Marriage isn't...

177
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:11,147
something you do out of loyalty.

178
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,683
No matter how much you love him...

179
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:16,453
Ji Na.

180
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,453
Hey.

181
00:12:22,228 --> 00:12:25,667
I have no choice but to be picky about your marriage.

182
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,193
What am I going to do?

183
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:33,603
Are you crying?

184
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:36,322
No matter how hard I try to end it...

185
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:37,997
No matter how hard I try to run away,

186
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:40,263
I always come back to ground zero.

187
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:43,997
I try to abandon him, but I can't.

188
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,768
And I can't seem to get him out of my mind either.

189
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:47,233
What am I going to do?

190
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:55,072
I'm running out of time, but I don't know what to do.

191
00:12:55,617 --> 00:12:57,273
What am I going to do, Ji Na?

192
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:02,253
- Dong Kyung. - It's all my fault.

193
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:06,222
Everything's my fault.

194
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:10,592
No, it's not your fault.

195
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:12,623
You did nothing wrong.

196
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,493
So just do everything you want.

197
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:17,932
I don't care.

198
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:21,702
Just forget everything I said earlier.

199
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:25,903
I'm fine as long as you're happy.

200
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:29,143
So don't say you're running out of time.

201
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:32,983
Don't ever say that again.

202
00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:50,133
What am I going to do, Ji Na? What can I do?

203
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:54,903
Ji Na...

204
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:18,253
Leave them. I'll do the dishes.

205
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:39,472
I get it now.

206
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:44,273
- What? - This is how you waited for me.

207
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:47,712
I always wondered what you did while you sat here.

208
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:51,283
You always waited for me to finish.

209
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,322
I did not.

210
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,123
You don't have to let me have my way anymore.

211
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:07,663
You don't have to wait for me anymore.

212
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:26,158
You've raised me well.

213
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:28,353
- Hyun Kyu. - I want to stop bothering you.

214
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:30,993
I need to grow up now.

215
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,822
If you keep watching my back,

216
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:35,733
I keep wanting to depend on you.

217
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:40,133
Look at me now. I'm still blaming you.

218
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:48,842
- Are you saying you'll move out? - Yes.

219
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,643
I'll enter the real world now.

220
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,782
When will I pack all this up?

221
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:32,022
Still...

222
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:37,223
it's time to go.

223
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:54,571
So...

224
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,041
- Doctor. - I heard.

225
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,472
- You're getting married? - What?

226
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:01,347
How did you...

227
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,612
Gosh. There are eyes and ears all over the hospital.

228
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:06,281
Congrats.

229
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,751
Well...

230
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,392
That's why I'm saying this,

231
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:16,192
- but... - You don't want to do...

232
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,892
the biopsy, right?

233
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:27,172
You said it was in a dangerous location.

234
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:34,341
Then let's do this.

235
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:40,482
Until the wedding. Let's wait until after the wedding.

236
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:43,281
Okay.

237
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:46,491
To be honest, you're right.

238
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,491
It's very dangerous.

239
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:50,567
Once we go in,

240
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,132
we may have to close it right up.

241
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,637
That was why...

242
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:57,331
I wanted to do a biopsy and treatment rather than surgery.

243
00:18:58,367 --> 00:18:59,531
But...

244
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:03,071
Let's live a little longer.

245
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:09,942
Let's live a little longer and become a little happier...

246
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:12,281
since you've decided on the treatment.

247
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:16,182
Yes.

248
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:20,991
But have the wedding as soon as possible.

249
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:22,827
Come to the hospital right away if you don't feel well.

250
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,061
Can you promise me that?

251
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:26,692
Thank you.

252
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,761
Don't be too afraid though.

253
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,972
You're doing well already.

254
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:36,402
I'll be there at your wedding.

255
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,301
Did you set a date yet?

256
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:42,212
Not yet...

257
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:44,241
Well...

258
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:51,722
Dong Kyung is going home.

259
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,591
What did your aunt say?

260
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,432
She's worried.

261
00:20:03,206 --> 00:20:04,761
Tell her not to worry.

262
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,172
I'll take full responsibility.

263
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:10,771
I will drive her to and from every time.

264
00:20:12,017 --> 00:20:13,642
So tell her not to worry...

265
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:16,511
and that we should do everything for Dong Kyung that she wants.

266
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,311
What has gotten into you?

267
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:22,281
I thought you'd be adamantly against it.

268
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:28,291
She clung onto me and cried.

269
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,962
She doesn't show it, but it must be hard.

270
00:20:36,137 --> 00:20:37,402
And nervous.

271
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,976
I don't want to even think about it,

272
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,202
but just in case...

273
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:48,412
Let's give her what she wants...

274
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:51,081
so there are no regrets.

275
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:56,452
Okay.

276
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:02,821
(Lee Hyun Kyu)

277
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:10,561
(Lee Hyun Kyu)

278
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:15,172
- Hey. - Let's meet up.

279
00:21:17,146 --> 00:21:19,472
Okay. Where?

280
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,212
Okay.

281
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,751
I have to go.

282
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:30,551
- Wait. Ji Na. - Yes?

283
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:35,222
Make sure you don't regret it either.

284
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,222
Worry about yourself.

285
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,291
Later.

286
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:14,632
Is it marriage blues?

287
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,061
Are you that depressed about marrying me?

288
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:33,051
I'm hurt.

289
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:37,321
You used to say I was handsome and all that.

290
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:41,152
You should be grateful that I'm marrying you.

291
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:43,267
Not everyone gets to marry a guy...

292
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:45,061
they thought was good-looking when they first saw him.

293
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:52,132
You don't even respond anymore.

294
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:58,672
You'll have to respond when you see this.

295
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:00,876
(Savings account)

296
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:02,312
Sun Kyung gave it to me.

297
00:23:02,586 --> 00:23:03,911
He said to use it for the wedding.

298
00:23:05,656 --> 00:23:06,951
You've raised him well.

299
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:16,421
Why are you staring at me like that?

300
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:20,491
Are you marveling at my good looks?

301
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,792
It's been so long since I came here.

302
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:54,032
Back then, the field looked so big.

303
00:23:55,197 --> 00:23:57,302
That just means that we grew up.

304
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:06,141
I told you that my friend was sick the other day. Do you remember?

305
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:07,741
Yes.

306
00:24:08,546 --> 00:24:10,042
She has glioblastomas.

307
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:13,082
She could die from them.

308
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:18,522
I never thought...

309
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,421
she would get sick like that...

310
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:28,391
because never in my life have I thought...

311
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:32,971
that I would lose her like that.

312
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:38,342
That just shows how foolish I am.

313
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:45,656
And yesterday, she told me that she wanted to get married...

314
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,082
when she was sobbing.

315
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:51,352
That made me think a lot.

316
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:53,122
Like what?

317
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:57,862
"If today was my last day, what would I do?"

318
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:01,632
"Would I..."

319
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:04,701
"be in love like her?"

320
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:21,882
When I first saw you,

321
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:24,282
you were really cute.

322
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:27,651
When our eyes met in the hallway,

323
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:30,292
I could hear...

324
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:33,532
what you wanted to tell me from your gaze.

325
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,961
I could see what you were thinking. I like that about you.

326
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,032
There was honesty in your eyes.

327
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,572
But did you know?

328
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:45,542
That hasn't changed.

329
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:50,512
There's still honesty in your eyes unlike mine.

330
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,711
I got indigestion after eating rice cake and bombed the CSAT.

331
00:25:54,816 --> 00:25:57,082
So I was being transported to the hospital in the morning.

332
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,221
This crossed my mind.

333
00:26:00,497 --> 00:26:01,751
"What a relief."

334
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:05,931
I talked a big game of going to the same college as you...

335
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:08,832
and attending the same school in Seoul.

336
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:12,161
But you knew that my grades were never good enough.

337
00:26:13,777 --> 00:26:16,001
But I didn't admit that in front of you.

338
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:18,572
I was so humiliated...

339
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:21,272
because I really liked you.

340
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,812
So I wanted to always look cool in your eyes.

341
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:27,882
But when I went abroad to study, I dodged your calls and texts.

342
00:26:29,257 --> 00:26:32,022
But on my social media, I kept...

343
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:34,221
posting pretentious photos.

344
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:38,461
To tell you the truth, I cried every night before going to sleep.

345
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:42,701
I didn't speak the language.

346
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:45,001
I didn't know anyone.

347
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,772
I was falling behind with the training.

348
00:26:47,037 --> 00:26:48,971
My life was a total mess.

349
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:51,572
I wanted to go back home every day.

350
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:54,312
I missed you every day.

351
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,082
But...

352
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:01,981
I thought I would cry if I heard your voice...

353
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,751
and that you would sense it.

354
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:10,822
So I never called you back.

355
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:15,592
But after that, I came back to Korea.

356
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:20,201
I was so embarrassed that I had to come back home...

357
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:22,772
after leaving you like that.

358
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:25,342
So I couldn't call you.

359
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:27,772
Why?

360
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,542
I'd rather be a bad guy,

361
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,812
not a pathetic guy.

362
00:27:34,257 --> 00:27:36,322
But that's what made me pathetic.

363
00:27:38,927 --> 00:27:40,552
I was so childish.

364
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:44,022
I didn't know any better.

365
00:27:49,707 --> 00:27:50,832
I'm sorry.

366
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:54,701
You should have told me.

367
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:57,471
You should have.

368
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:06,981
This school field...

369
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:10,052
still looks big to me.

370
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:13,122
I guess I didn't grow up at all.

371
00:28:14,296 --> 00:28:15,491
Hyun Kyu.

372
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:20,366
You didn't ask me to see me. I asked you out today.

373
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,762
So we still have one more date.

374
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,336
And you can ask me out for the last date...

375
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,671
when you really want to see me.

376
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:28,836
When you really want to see me.

377
00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:30,471
Don't force yourself.

378
00:28:30,906 --> 00:28:32,171
I won't beg.

379
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:36,911
Before I go,

380
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:43,481
let's shake hands to celebrate our graduation.

381
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:11,572
Goodbye.

382
00:31:13,876 --> 00:31:15,772
I didn't give up yet.

383
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:19,001
I'm not running away.

384
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:21,042
I know.

385
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:23,582
You'd better not mess up.

386
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,451
I'll run to her and take your spot.

387
00:31:30,727 --> 00:31:31,981
Don't lower your guard.

388
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:35,191
Never lower your guard.

389
00:31:40,697 --> 00:31:41,862
I won't.

390
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:24,542
Ji Na told me only then, she felt...

391
00:32:24,906 --> 00:32:27,641
as she was no longer 18, 19, or 20...

392
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:31,681
and that she finally felt like she was where she belonged.

393
00:32:33,356 --> 00:32:36,751
And no matter when she faced it, in the end,

394
00:32:37,227 --> 00:32:39,552
the result wouldn't have changed.

395
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,862
"The result wouldn't have changed."

396
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,661
That's another way of expressing fate.

397
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:52,832
I was also...

398
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:56,201
heading toward my fate that wouldn't change.

399
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:57,542
Hello.

400
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,711
You must be getting discharged.

401
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:08,682
Did I startle you?

402
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:12,021
That wasn't my intention.

403
00:33:21,297 --> 00:33:23,032
You look so gaunt.

404
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:26,672
I wanted to help.

405
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:28,572
I'm sorry.

406
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:33,141
Help me. Help me just one more time.

407
00:33:33,417 --> 00:33:35,311
It's out of my hands now.

408
00:33:38,747 --> 00:33:40,411
Then what am I supposed to do now?

409
00:33:41,316 --> 00:33:43,052
What are we supposed to do?

410
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:44,681
Just accept it.

411
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:53,232
- No. - Then what?

412
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:56,106
Will you destroy the world?

413
00:33:56,106 --> 00:33:57,262
Yes.

414
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:59,632
You can't do that.

415
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:04,402
You also know you're incapable of doing something like that.

416
00:34:06,216 --> 00:34:07,371
No.

417
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:11,012
I'll do anything for him.

418
00:34:16,057 --> 00:34:18,621
My life perished countless times.

419
00:34:19,526 --> 00:34:22,052
So I know better than anyone about perishment.

420
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:28,431
You cry and try to fight it.

421
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:31,661
But in the end, you just accept it.

422
00:34:32,977 --> 00:34:36,641
Because that's his choice.

423
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:39,041
And that choice...

424
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,342
is his fate.

425
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,411
So just modestly accept it.

426
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,521
Accept doom.

427
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:55,592
There's nothing we can do about it.

428
00:34:57,767 --> 00:34:58,922
I'm sorry.

429
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,362
But that's the ending he wants.

430
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:07,971
That's his happy ending.

431
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,406
Neither of us is happy.

432
00:35:12,406 --> 00:35:13,917
So how is that a happy ending?

433
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:15,811
As you live life, you'll realize one day...

434
00:35:17,017 --> 00:35:19,581
that there was a reason behind everything you went through.

435
00:35:20,156 --> 00:35:22,482
You'll find out that it was a happy ending.

436
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:25,422
You can only find out if you stay alive.

437
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,891
If everyone dies, no one will know.

438
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:38,601
So live.

439
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:42,701
He wants you to live.

440
00:35:45,807 --> 00:35:48,112
He wants you to live a very happy life.

442
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:21,342
You sold a lot today.

443
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:35,121
You can go home now.

444
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,291
I'm your last customer.

445
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:47,271
You're going to leave it all here?

446
00:36:49,537 --> 00:36:51,302
I don't need them anymore.

447
00:36:51,446 --> 00:36:53,041
So I should leave them behind.

448
00:36:53,876 --> 00:36:55,141
They're a burden.

449
00:36:55,876 --> 00:37:01,112
I've always felt burdened throughout my entire life.

450
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,621
Now it's time to leave it all behind and go.

451
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:09,192
Goodbye.

452
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:11,391
You lived a great life.

453
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:48,791
My gosh.

454
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:56,601
Gosh.

455
00:38:00,847 --> 00:38:01,942
Hello.

456
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:06,617
You could've just come inside.

457
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,081
What's with the joke?

458
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,652
Will you marry me?

459
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:20,862
Hey, you smiled. I'm going to take that as a "yes".

460
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:31,501
The flowers are pretty.

461
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,486
We only said that so I could get discharged from the hospital.

462
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,052
You didn't have to get me flowers.

463
00:38:43,787 --> 00:38:45,621
Who says I didn't mean it?

464
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:49,922
So you actually bought these to propose to me?

465
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:52,592
No, someone gave them to me.

466
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:55,192
Who gave them to you?

467
00:38:57,307 --> 00:39:00,001
A person whose life was going to end today.

468
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:06,001
She gave them to me before she left.

469
00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:09,882
A person who was about to disappear...

470
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:12,342
gave them to another person who's going to disappear soon.

471
00:39:17,126 --> 00:39:18,822
I should put them in a vase...

472
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,521
so I can enjoy them for a long time.

473
00:39:29,137 --> 00:39:30,661
Let's always stay together.

474
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:34,072
- Okay. - Let's never be apart.

475
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:36,431
Okay.

476
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:39,501
Forever.

477
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,242
Okay.

478
00:40:09,676 --> 00:40:10,802
What is it?

479
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:15,541
I guess it wasn't the last time.

480
00:40:16,486 --> 00:40:18,882
Flowers might blossom again.

481
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:20,712
On that tree?

482
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:22,882
Yes.

483
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:29,052
Let's come see it together.

484
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:33,121
You and I...

485
00:40:34,696 --> 00:40:36,962
should come see it together.

486
00:41:05,626 --> 00:41:07,061
Just a little bit.

487
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:31,422
Days like this will continue.

488
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:34,422
After you're gone, spring will arrive.

489
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:37,192
After you disappear, the morning will come.

490
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:41,732
And after your life ends, my life will begin.

491
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:51,271
Okay.

492
00:42:57,247 --> 00:43:00,311
So every year when spring comes,

493
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:02,242
and every time morning is here,

494
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:07,411
I will think of you throughout my entire life.

495
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,181
Will I be able to endure that?

496
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:14,791
How would that kind of life...

497
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,021
be any different from doom?

498
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:43,938
A fountain pen?

499
00:43:44,673 --> 00:43:45,969
What's wrong with her?

500
00:43:51,883 --> 00:43:54,584
To the most sane author I've ever worked with...

501
00:43:54,584 --> 00:43:56,719
and the most insane friend.

502
00:43:56,823 --> 00:43:57,978
Insane?

503
00:44:06,294 --> 00:44:07,894
Let me make myself clear.

504
00:44:07,894 --> 00:44:09,989
I'm not trying to make you cry, so don't.

505
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:12,259
This is water-based ink.

506
00:44:13,573 --> 00:44:16,599
So don't cry. Become strong.

507
00:44:17,504 --> 00:44:19,799
That is your goal, Ji Na.

508
00:44:23,843 --> 00:44:26,308
(Savings account)

509
00:44:38,463 --> 00:44:40,788
I can't take your money, Sun Kyung.

510
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:44,199
It isn't even half of what I've spent on you.

511
00:44:44,504 --> 00:44:46,299
Don't try to call it even with this.

512
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:49,029
You seriously have no shame.

513
00:44:49,974 --> 00:44:51,639
But thanks always.

514
00:44:52,044 --> 00:44:55,268
I'm always proud of you, my little brother. You grew up well.

515
00:45:03,383 --> 00:45:04,549
Auntie.

516
00:45:05,084 --> 00:45:08,719
My life was filled with a lot of love.

517
00:45:09,724 --> 00:45:13,024
Thinking back, it was love...

518
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:14,458
that saved me.

519
00:45:14,894 --> 00:45:19,828
Your love, Sun Kyung, Ji Na...

520
00:45:20,573 --> 00:45:23,268
and him too.

521
00:45:25,504 --> 00:45:27,038
That's why I'm scared.

522
00:45:28,274 --> 00:45:30,538
Because I don't want to lose anything.

523
00:45:37,724 --> 00:45:38,849
I had asked...

524
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:43,089
if it'll hurt a lot...

525
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:45,589
when I die.

526
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:48,358
Mom.

527
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:51,599
Dad.

528
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:56,799
I'm so scared.

529
00:45:58,744 --> 00:46:02,874
I have no idea what I'll choose.

530
00:46:02,874 --> 00:46:04,044
(Tak Jong Won, Kang Soo Ah)

531
00:46:04,044 --> 00:46:05,239
But...

532
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:10,978
whatever I choose,

533
00:46:11,983 --> 00:46:13,949
it'll probably hurt a lot.

534
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:18,219
That terrifies me.

535
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,128
I'm so scared.

536
00:46:41,084 --> 00:46:44,518
(House of Love)

537
00:46:51,124 --> 00:46:52,589
What are you doing here?

538
00:46:53,224 --> 00:46:54,489
I followed you.

539
00:46:56,033 --> 00:46:57,834
How long were you following me?

540
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:59,458
From the moment you were born.

541
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:01,934
Why are you following me?

542
00:47:01,934 --> 00:47:03,069
Because I like you.

543
00:47:03,774 --> 00:47:04,998
Because it's a waste.

544
00:47:07,144 --> 00:47:09,038
Because I don't want to miss a single moment.

545
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:14,608
- Go with me. - Where?

546
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,949
To work.

547
00:47:33,673 --> 00:47:37,168
Why are we here? Will this library disappear?

548
00:47:39,343 --> 00:47:42,239
No. Words disappear.

549
00:47:46,084 --> 00:47:47,279
I hear them.

550
00:47:48,184 --> 00:47:50,254
Even now, hundreds of words...

551
00:47:50,254 --> 00:47:52,779
are disappearing every second in that corner.

552
00:47:54,053 --> 00:47:56,619
Collogue. Disport.

553
00:47:56,923 --> 00:48:00,558
Indite. Malapert. Peregrinate.

554
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:02,593
Even words are forgotten.

555
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:03,929
If they aren't used,

556
00:48:04,963 --> 00:48:06,429
they die.

557
00:48:26,024 --> 00:48:27,489
This is a secret.

558
00:48:28,294 --> 00:48:30,759
There are words that never disappear.

559
00:48:32,164 --> 00:48:33,518
Like a dozen of them.

560
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:36,288
The meaning of your name is among them.

561
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:37,898
Dong Kyung. Admiration.

562
00:48:41,104 --> 00:48:42,299
What about "human"?

563
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:44,799
That's on the list as well.

564
00:49:00,394 --> 00:49:01,788
I'm annoyed.

565
00:49:02,894 --> 00:49:04,018
Why?

566
00:49:04,693 --> 00:49:07,058
I want to stay awake, but I'm sleepy.

567
00:49:08,963 --> 00:49:12,228
Go to sleep. You're human, so you need to sleep.

568
00:49:17,004 --> 00:49:20,708
I'll sleep for a few minutes. Just for a few minutes.

569
00:49:21,644 --> 00:49:22,808
Okay.

570
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,248
Don't go anywhere.

571
00:49:31,024 --> 00:49:32,219
Okay.

572
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:35,349
Stay right next to me.

573
00:49:35,954 --> 00:49:37,188
Okay.

574
00:49:39,294 --> 00:49:40,889
Don't disappear.

575
00:50:25,573 --> 00:50:27,239
Is this the end?

576
00:50:28,874 --> 00:50:30,268
I came to say bye.

577
00:50:31,544 --> 00:50:33,949
I'm the one who came to say bye.

578
00:50:35,314 --> 00:50:36,978
You knew, didn't you?

579
00:50:41,823 --> 00:50:43,958
That I'd make this decision.

580
00:50:48,794 --> 00:50:51,898
Since a deity knows everything.

581
00:50:51,963 --> 00:50:53,969
Everything is uncertain.

582
00:50:54,233 --> 00:50:55,998
Even if she wishes for doom,

583
00:50:56,403 --> 00:50:58,668
it's impossible to know whether or not it's possible.

584
00:51:01,274 --> 00:51:04,883
So why don't you bet on that?

585
00:51:04,883 --> 00:51:06,938
No. I'll bet on the sure thing.

586
00:51:07,954 --> 00:51:11,378
On the sure way to save her.

587
00:51:12,323 --> 00:51:14,454
Why did you make such a stupid promise?

588
00:51:14,454 --> 00:51:16,719
I guess it was something I had to do.

589
00:51:17,263 --> 00:51:20,858
- What? - Keep my promise, protect her,

590
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:22,728
and protect this world.

591
00:51:28,803 --> 00:51:31,069
You have more to protect than I do.

592
00:51:42,254 --> 00:51:44,219
I plan to live a little longer.

593
00:51:45,184 --> 00:51:47,449
I plan to rely on the human heart...

594
00:51:48,323 --> 00:51:50,518
and extend this life a little.

595
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:55,688
That's the first time, isn't it?

596
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,728
You never thought of doing that before.

597
00:51:58,504 --> 00:51:59,659
Yes.

598
00:52:01,533 --> 00:52:04,498
That heart will stop again eventually,

599
00:52:07,613 --> 00:52:09,969
but there's still a lot that I want to see in this body.

600
00:52:11,314 --> 00:52:14,578
I really like this life in many ways.

601
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:16,978
What do you want to see?

602
00:52:17,854 --> 00:52:19,049
Flowers.

603
00:52:19,724 --> 00:52:21,119
A flower in full bloom.

604
00:52:39,173 --> 00:52:40,538
Where did you go?

605
00:52:41,113 --> 00:52:42,414
I was...

606
00:52:42,414 --> 00:52:44,478
Where were you?

607
00:52:49,454 --> 00:52:50,578
I'm sorry.

608
00:52:51,553 --> 00:52:53,619
I thought you had left.

609
00:52:53,854 --> 00:52:55,719
I thought you were gone.

610
00:52:55,954 --> 00:52:57,664
When I woke up, I didn't see you.

611
00:52:57,664 --> 00:52:58,958
So I was...

612
00:52:59,963 --> 00:53:02,589
I'm sorry. Sorry.

613
00:53:02,994 --> 00:53:05,828
I just closed my eyes for a bit and opened them.

614
00:53:06,463 --> 00:53:07,969
I thought if a day had gone by.

615
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:09,699
Or two days.

616
00:53:09,934 --> 00:53:12,599
I thought if it was over.

617
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:15,768
I don't have much time left.

618
00:53:16,414 --> 00:53:19,378
I really don't have much time left.

619
00:53:20,184 --> 00:53:22,549
It's okay. We still have time.

620
00:53:23,314 --> 00:53:26,449
We still have one more day.

621
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:33,089
I don't think I can do it.

622
00:53:34,693 --> 00:53:36,429
I really didn't want to do this.

623
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:38,828
I really don't want to do this.

624
00:53:40,164 --> 00:53:41,328
Do what?

625
00:53:43,874 --> 00:53:45,839
Make me not love anyone.

626
00:53:46,943 --> 00:53:48,168
No one.

627
00:53:49,713 --> 00:53:50,978
That's my wish.

628
00:53:55,854 --> 00:53:57,108
I can't do that.

629
00:53:57,454 --> 00:53:59,153
I said that was my wish.

630
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,724
That was the term of our contract.

631
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:02,688
Why can't you do it?

632
00:54:02,754 --> 00:54:04,263
Because I must save you.

633
00:54:04,263 --> 00:54:06,693
If you're not in my life,

634
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:10,288
my life would be worthless to me.

635
00:54:10,463 --> 00:54:12,828
No, it will be worth it to me.

636
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:16,668
I might have to...

637
00:54:17,544 --> 00:54:19,538
live in an empty world...

638
00:54:20,004 --> 00:54:23,268
to the end of time after losing you and everyone you love.

639
00:54:28,584 --> 00:54:29,779
Dong Kyung.

640
00:54:38,164 --> 00:54:39,389
Humans...

641
00:54:42,664 --> 00:54:44,599
can fall in love again.

642
00:54:45,763 --> 00:54:48,128
No.

643
00:54:48,474 --> 00:54:49,828
You're human.

644
00:54:51,244 --> 00:54:53,799
You can overcome it, but I can't.

645
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:56,969
You know that, right?

646
00:54:57,713 --> 00:55:00,478
I don't eat, sleep, or cry.

647
00:55:01,254 --> 00:55:02,708
I don't have compassion or fall in love.

648
00:55:05,283 --> 00:55:06,819
But you're human.

649
00:55:07,894 --> 00:55:09,119
So you can do it.

650
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:12,788
No. I can't.

651
00:55:12,963 --> 00:55:16,958
I can't... I cannot live without you.

652
00:55:24,073 --> 00:55:27,343
Don't do this. Don't say things like that.

653
00:55:27,343 --> 00:55:31,409
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

654
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,119
It's my fault.

655
00:56:03,213 --> 00:56:05,409
I want to make a wish for real now.

656
00:56:11,783 --> 00:56:13,518
Take me...

657
00:56:14,524 --> 00:56:15,819
to the world of doom.

658
00:56:19,564 --> 00:56:20,759
It's not possible.

659
00:56:21,863 --> 00:56:23,994
I'm not asking you to take me there for real.

660
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:25,128
I don't care...

661
00:56:26,704 --> 00:56:28,569
even if it's fake.

662
00:56:29,374 --> 00:56:31,898
It can be in a dream or a figment of my imagination.

663
00:56:33,004 --> 00:56:34,469
Let me...

664
00:56:36,173 --> 00:56:39,009
stay there with you on my last day.

665
00:56:42,513 --> 00:56:43,708
Grant me this wish.

666
00:56:45,423 --> 00:56:47,378
I'm serious.

667
00:57:20,684 --> 00:57:23,049
- Is this... - The world of doom.

668
00:58:19,513 --> 00:58:20,909
Seriously. There's no one...

669
00:58:23,653 --> 00:58:25,449
My voice is too loud.

670
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:27,918
Because no one is here to make any sounds.

671
00:58:32,224 --> 00:58:33,688
This is weird.

672
00:58:35,994 --> 00:58:37,228
I'll be lonely.

673
00:58:38,704 --> 00:58:42,628
In the world of doom, I will have lost my purpose.

674
00:58:46,504 --> 00:58:47,768
I will be nothing.

675
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:02,688
Being responsible for everything that disappears...

676
00:59:03,754 --> 00:59:05,719
means that I exist...

677
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:08,458
for the things that disappear.

678
00:59:10,363 --> 00:59:12,659
As there's nothing that needs to disappear here,

679
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:16,029
I will be...

680
00:59:18,604 --> 00:59:20,398
a particle of dust, floating around.

681
00:59:28,454 --> 00:59:30,208
So it will be pointless...

682
00:59:31,553 --> 00:59:33,148
if I exist without you.

683
00:59:39,294 --> 00:59:40,489
You're lonely.

684
00:59:43,033 --> 00:59:45,358
When you look at the things that disappear,

685
00:59:47,263 --> 00:59:48,429
you still...

686
00:59:50,173 --> 00:59:51,398
look lonesome.

687
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,299
You too.

688
00:59:56,244 --> 00:59:57,469
You always look lonesome...

689
00:59:59,113 --> 01:00:00,478
when you look at me.

690
01:00:11,693 --> 01:00:13,188
There's a place I want to visit.

691
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:36,578
Why did you want to come here?

692
01:00:37,254 --> 01:00:38,878
I wanted to pray.

693
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:41,119
There's no deity in the world of doom.

694
01:00:43,354 --> 01:00:45,018
Because there are no humans?

695
01:00:45,724 --> 01:00:46,918
Right.

696
01:00:47,423 --> 01:00:48,788
I'm here.

697
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:55,069
I'm a human being. And I'm right here in this world.

698
01:01:46,254 --> 01:01:49,049
The sun also sets in the world of doom.

699
01:01:51,494 --> 01:01:54,889
What did you pray for in the church earlier?

700
01:01:57,133 --> 01:01:58,828
It's a secret between the deity and me.

701
01:01:58,863 --> 01:02:00,858
You said there was no deity.

702
01:02:01,133 --> 01:02:03,529
The deity would have been born at the moment you wanted.

703
01:02:08,744 --> 01:02:10,208
What did you pray for?

704
01:02:11,044 --> 01:02:12,279
I...

705
01:02:14,954 --> 01:02:16,478
I just...

706
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:21,049
For the last time, I prayed that I won't ever love anyone again.

707
01:02:23,553 --> 01:02:24,719
I know.

708
01:02:24,923 --> 01:02:27,518
I know it won't come true.

709
01:02:28,394 --> 01:02:30,029
But I still prayed for it anyway.

710
01:02:43,274 --> 01:02:44,374
Dong Kyung.

711
01:02:44,374 --> 01:02:45,639
I love you.

712
01:02:51,124 --> 01:02:53,679
You're what I love the most.

713
01:02:55,524 --> 01:02:58,589
I'm sorry I fell in love with you.

714
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:03,089
I'm sorry I love you the most.

715
01:03:05,863 --> 01:03:07,029
Thank you...

716
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:10,529
for loving me.

717
01:04:14,363 --> 01:04:15,898
It's going to be midnight soon.

718
01:04:25,213 --> 01:04:26,339
It's okay.

719
01:04:27,544 --> 01:04:28,878
Everything will be all right.

720
01:04:52,474 --> 01:04:55,509
I wanted to be with you until the very last moment.

721
01:04:56,874 --> 01:04:58,009
I know.

722
01:05:01,584 --> 01:05:02,808
I love you.

723
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:06,549
I know.

724
01:05:09,224 --> 01:05:11,018
I'm so scared.

725
01:05:13,423 --> 01:05:15,688
- Dong Kyung... - Don't say anything.

726
01:05:17,863 --> 01:05:19,199
Don't say a word.

727
01:05:19,863 --> 01:05:21,728
This contract is invalid.

728
01:05:22,233 --> 01:05:23,398
No.

729
01:05:25,104 --> 01:05:27,799
- No. - I will take with me...

730
01:05:28,343 --> 01:05:30,538
your sadness and pain.

731
01:05:31,483 --> 01:05:34,509
Don't worry. I'll take everything with me.

732
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:36,679
No.

733
01:05:38,923 --> 01:05:40,619
I don't want that.

734
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:46,688
I was created for you.

735
01:05:47,934 --> 01:05:49,389
So don't worry.

736
01:05:50,533 --> 01:05:51,898
Live a happy life.

737
01:05:54,303 --> 01:05:56,333
That's why I was born.

738
01:05:56,334 --> 01:05:58,398
I was born to make you happy.

739
01:05:59,403 --> 01:06:01,369
Can't you stay?

740
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:05,938
Please?

741
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:10,409
Earlier at that church,

742
01:06:13,684 --> 01:06:15,589
I prayed for your happiness.

743
01:06:15,653 --> 01:06:18,219
I need you to be happy.

744
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:22,689
I need you by my side.

745
01:06:25,863 --> 01:06:27,929
Do you remember what I told you last time?

746
01:06:29,233 --> 01:06:30,568
Even if it rains,

747
01:06:30,674 --> 01:06:33,198
and you're the only one without an umbrella, it's okay.

748
01:06:34,374 --> 01:06:36,309
If you run just a little bit, you'll soon be home.

749
01:06:41,044 --> 01:06:42,979
I want you to run once I'm gone.

750
01:06:45,223 --> 01:06:46,918
Don't look back and just run.

751
01:06:47,683 --> 01:06:48,948
Then you'll soon be...

752
01:08:15,613 --> 01:08:19,609
(Doom At Your Service)

753
01:08:20,744 --> 01:08:22,849
I wonder if it all actually happened.

754
01:08:23,214 --> 01:08:26,849
I wonder if you were really once...

755
01:08:27,183 --> 01:08:29,118
a part of my life.

756
01:08:30,323 --> 01:08:31,563
No, it's not that.

757
01:08:31,563 --> 01:08:32,658
Joo Ik.

758
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,128
Ji Na, don't you keep in touch with Cha Joo Ik?

759
01:08:37,094 --> 01:08:39,304
We all gathered together for a meal today.

760
01:08:39,304 --> 01:08:41,259
And everyone told me they miss you.

761
01:08:42,334 --> 01:08:46,204
If I ever walk past you, will you grab my hand...

762
01:08:46,204 --> 01:08:47,998
just like you always did?

763
01:08:49,643 --> 01:08:50,809
You're happy, right?
