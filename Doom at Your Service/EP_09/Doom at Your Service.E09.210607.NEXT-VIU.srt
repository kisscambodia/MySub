4
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,071
Thanks for the food!

5
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,760
At one point, I wanted to be one of them.

6
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,760
- Here. - Hey, you know what?

7
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:53,590
You should try the drink.

8
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,500
You might like it.

9
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:56,830
All right.

10
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,571
You're pretty good for a first-timer.

11
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:01,741
You know?

12
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:04,740
I wanted to eat just like them.

13
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:14,580
And I wanted to fall asleep like them.

14
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:30,929
- Hello. - Hello.

15
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,829
- Mom! - Mommy!

16
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,371
- Mom! - Dad!

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,371
Daddy!

18
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:40,611
I wanted to have compassion...

19
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,740
and love like them.

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,891
But being one of them was impossible.

21
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,861
They always leave.

22
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,731
They always have a place to be...

23
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,171
unlike me.

26
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,230
That's when I realized it.

27
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:37,871
I had no place to be.

28
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,301
There was no end to this life.

29
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:43,271
So I could never become one of them.

30
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,251
My job...

31
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,651
is to merely watch them.

32
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,031
So choose.

33
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,901
Choose yourself and the world.

34
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,380
All I can do is watch.

35
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,759
You darn brat! Stop right there!

36
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,460
How do you expect me to stop when you're running after me?

37
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,160
I won't stop.

38
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,730
You little brat.

39
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:06,591
Hey.

40
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,931
I'm sorry for showing up like this all of a sudden.

41
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,901
Who's here?

42
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:25,110
Wait for me on the first floor. I'll be right there.

43
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:29,680
Let me know if you heard that.

44
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,881
I'll be right back.

45
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,550
Here.

46
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:15,460
If you're leaving because of me, I'll leave.

47
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:16,989
I'm sorry. That's not it.

48
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,091
Is there something wrong?

49
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:23,631
He's here. Lee Hyun Kyu.

50
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:29,369
I'm sorry, but can you wait a bit...

51
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,571
before you come outside?

52
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:34,610
- I just don't want... - I understand.

53
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:41,750
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:55,860
She didn't have to apologize, but it does feel...

55
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,800
a little weird.

56
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,151
Who told you my address?

57
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:18,020
I asked around.

58
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:19,749
Did you think it'd be okay to just come by...

59
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,391
just because someone told you my address?

60
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:22,821
No.

61
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,960
It seemed like the wrong thing to do.

62
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:27,930
- Then why did you come? - I couldn't help it.

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,201
I missed you.

64
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,040
I came to Korea because I missed you.

65
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,610
And I went to the reunion for the same reason.

66
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,240
I came here to tell you that.

67
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:49,021
You always do things however you like.

68
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,891
- Hello. - Hey.

69
00:06:57,391 --> 00:06:58,831
You just do everything however you like, don't you?

70
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,130
How could you not tell me that you're leaving to study abroad?

71
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,271
I can't believe you made me come all the way here.

72
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,940
- I'm sorry. - Why didn't you text me back?

73
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:10,201
Are you really going to break up?

74
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:14,540
I just felt really sorry.

75
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:17,380
Then you should've texted me back.

76
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:19,310
If you felt sorry, you should've met up with me.

77
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:22,750
I'm really sorry.

78
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,490
You're always like this.

79
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,489
I liked you first, and I like you more than you like me.

80
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,221
You know that. You're totally aware of it.

81
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:35,831
Forget it.

82
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,870
That's not it. Let me explain.

83
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,410
I may be going abroad to study, but I never said I wanted to end it.

84
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:50,441
Look at yourself.

85
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:52,410
You're being selfish again.

86
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,620
I bet you thought I didn't have the guts to break up.

87
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,720
You kept dragging things on,

88
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:02,460
and we eventually broke up without even talking about it.

89
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,761
I always regretted it.

90
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,130
I was too young back then.

91
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:09,359
I know how it feels to blindly wait in front of someone's house...

92
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,631
because I've also done it before.

93
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,099
You wonder what you're going to say when you meet them,

94
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
but you can't come up with anything.

95
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:15,941
But even so,

96
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:19,471
I couldn't help but just wait.

97
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,281
I just waited.

98
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:24,850
- Ji Na. - But you're not like me.

99
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,750
But then again,

100
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:30,521
I never got to meet you.

101
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,890
But you did.

102
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,931
You should've shown up like this back then.

103
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,300
You're too late. It's been nine years.

104
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:43,461
I know. I'm not trying to do anything. I just...

105
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,230
I just wanted to answer your question.

106
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,671
But if you think I'm only complicating things,

107
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,240
just forget about it.

108
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,940
I'm sorry. Don't let it bother you.

109
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:54,041
I can't.

110
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:56,711
You'll be on my mind for a while now that I've met you today.

111
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,880
Look at me now.

112
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,821
Even now, I'm sitting right in front of you.

113
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:06,091
Whenever I'm with you,

114
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,191
it takes me back to the past.

115
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,791
I was always wet.

116
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:15,860
The day I saw you at the pool and the day I waited in the rain.

117
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:18,471
Liking you...

118
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:21,701
felt so wet and damp for me.

119
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:24,770
Although it might've been soft and fuzzy for you.

120
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:28,441
I'm not so sure if I want to go back...

121
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,181
to those days.

122
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,780
I still liked everything about you.

123
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,721
Regardless of all that happened,

124
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:45,230
I still liked you.

125
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,911
Auntie, calm down!

126
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:09,749
- How do you expect me to calm down? - Sun Kyung, that punk.

127
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,291
Who am I going to blame?

128
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,091
Auntie.

129
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,721
Auntie, stop.

130
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:18,860
Auntie, wait. Wait.

131
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,529
- Get over here. Come here. - No, wait. Calm down.

132
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,760
I didn't do it on purpose.

133
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:25,800
Get over here while I'm being nice.

134
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:28,740
You're not being nice right now.

135
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:34,140
Auntie.

136
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,451
Auntie. Auntie, are you okay? Auntie.

137
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:41,479
- I got you. - Auntie.

138
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,790
This isn't fair. That's cheating.

139
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,850
You're the one who cheated first.

140
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:49,889
No, wait. Let me go.

141
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,489
- My gosh. I'm so exhausted. - Please let go.

142
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,730
Auntie, please!

143
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,311
Sit down.

144
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,380
I don't want to sit on the floor.

145
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,479
He can be very American at times.

146
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,091
He doesn't do it often, but he did it just now.

147
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,561
Let me finally introduce myself, Dong Kyung's boyfriend.

148
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,270
My name is Kang Soo Ja. I'm Dong Kyung's aunt.

149
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,571
Yes, she's my aunt, Kang Soo Ja.

150
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:36,941
"Boyfriend"?

151
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,470
I heard a lot about you.

152
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:41,411
You heard a lot about him? From whom?

153
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,450
Sun Kyung, that punk.

154
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:55,790
I'm sorry for what happened earlier.

155
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,161
I bet you were shocked.

156
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,831
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

157
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,100
By the way, where do you live?

158
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,730
It's very late.

159
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,040
I live...

160
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,201
Yes, she's right. It's really late.

161
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:13,009
- You should go home. - But you told me to sit down.

162
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,110
It's time for you to get up. Hurry.

163
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,210
What? I know, right? It's such a relief.

164
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:21,010
You can still take the bus.

165
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,280
You should get going now.

166
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,820
I'd ask you to stay and drink with me.

167
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:29,461
But as you can see, our family is going through something important.

168
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,359
What? You're okay?

169
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,859
Yes, of course. He says it's fine, Auntie. Wait.

170
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,530
Here. Take this.

171
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:39,130
Stop that. Get out.

172
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,600
Go.

173
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,841
Call me later.

174
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,110
Bye! Okay!

175
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:53,551
She's always so unpredictable.

176
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,671
Auntie.

177
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,091
I know how you feel.

178
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,461
So I won't get mad.

179
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,860
"I'll be a burden."

180
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,461
"I'll be a nuisance."

181
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,229
I know that's what you were thinking...

182
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,500
and that's why you didn't call me.

183
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,471
The color is perfect.

184
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,681
I bought it on sale last year. It's perfect.

185
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,951
I'm glad I got it.

186
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,951
You were like that since you were 10.

187
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,480
You walked on eggshells around me...

188
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,191
and acted like a guest.

189
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,220
Why did you bother?

190
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:10,560
You always did what you wanted.

191
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:12,390
So why did you bother walking on eggshells?

192
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:14,530
You create stress for no reason.

193
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,661
How could you not get sick?

194
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,931
Auntie.

195
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,041
How long will you be polite?

196
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,311
Are you a guest who dropped into my life?

197
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,650
Anyway... Why is this hat so big?

198
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,411
Is your head tiny?

199
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:38,191
I thought it would fit.

200
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:42,890
I'll give it to Sun Kyung.

201
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,390
Hey. I bought a few summer dresses too.

202
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,061
Do you want to try them on?

203
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,340
I bought one here and there whenever I thought of you...

204
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:56,971
when I was in Canada.

205
00:14:57,841 --> 00:14:59,711
You have to wear them all.

206
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,041
I need to get my money's worth.

207
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:09,051
That was my intent when I boarded that plane.

208
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,020
So you have to get your act together.

209
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:19,990
Don't give this to Sun Kyung. It's mine.

210
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:25,571
Gosh. You're greedy about clothes just like your mom.

211
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,770
Do you know how much of my stuff she took from me?

212
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,870
That's why I didn't want to take your life from you.

213
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,750
You never took it.

214
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:43,581
I gave it to you willingly.

215
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,421
Because I wanted to.

216
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,249
(Na Ji Na - Did you get home safely?)

217
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,520
Did you get home safely?

218
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:17,880
I was too out of it earlier.

219
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,191
(Na Ji Na - Did you get home safely?)

220
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,561
- You're back. - Yes.

221
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:32,201
- Were you in the shower? - Yes.

222
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,971
You should wash up too.

223
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,171
Okay. Rest up.

224
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:38,370
Rest up.

225
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:35,131
(Ms. Soo Ja)

226
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:43,701
Hello?

227
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:45,411
Hey.

228
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,510
You know how to answer the phone?

229
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,711
- I know how to hang up too. - Hey.

230
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:54,509
I'm calling in secret,

231
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,151
so don't make me yell.

232
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,121
What are you doing? Are you home?

233
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:05,361
Why?

234
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,560
I'm just curious. You always slept with me.

235
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,730
You're hesitant only with certain words.

236
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,570
Otherwise, you're so free with your words.

237
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:17,671
Do I? Anyway...

238
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
Yes.

239
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:22,111
Is that all you can say?

240
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,881
Yes.

241
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:25,810
Darn it.

242
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,121
Your aunt looks a lot like your mom.

243
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,861
They don't just look alike. They look the same.

244
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,461
They're twins.

245
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,601
I feel like I'm looking at my mom when I see my aunt.

246
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,070
I'd always look at her...

247
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,799
and think that was what my mom probably looked like.

248
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,111
I always thought that, but it was all I could do.

249
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,980
But seeing her in person, I realized they were different.

250
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,840
Thanks.

251
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,790
I didn't get to say that.

252
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:10,191
Thank you for letting me see my mom and dad.

253
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:14,631
Sure.

254
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,430
And I'll think hard about my wish...

255
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:19,701
for myself.

256
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:25,240
Okay.

257
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,970
Is that all you can say?

258
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:29,310
I can say, "Good night," too.

259
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:35,451
Good night.

260
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:40,589
This so new and awkward,

261
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,990
doing this over the phone.

262
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,691
- Bye. - Wait.

263
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,260
What?

264
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:50,000
You said you'd do pretty much anything for me, right?

265
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:53,070
So I was thinking...

266
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:57,040
May I ask you for a favor?

267
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:08,081
A new drug was confirmed to be safe...

268
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,581
and is currently in clinical trials,

269
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:11,223
and they're looking for more volunteers.

270
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:14,121
Her name is on the list,

271
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:15,763
so we're waiting to hear back.

272
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:20,291
When can we begin treatment?

273
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:22,331
We need to wait for the blood work,

274
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:23,832
so it'll take about two weeks.

275
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:26,502
If she qualifies,

276
00:20:26,503 --> 00:20:28,102
she'll have to come in periodically.

277
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:29,842
See?

278
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:33,272
Let's relax and wait patiently.

279
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:35,513
Are you sure...

280
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:39,552
she doesn't need to be hospitalized right away?

281
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:41,552
Yes, I am.

282
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,522
You're saying there's hope, right?

283
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:47,923
Can she live?

284
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:51,423
Yes, I'm in the process of saving her.

285
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:04,542
Didn't you say yesterday that your boyfriend is a doctor too?

286
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:07,112
- Where does he work? - Him?

287
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,782
He works...

288
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:12,282
in the US. He's an American doctor.

289
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:14,782
I see. He's in the US.

290
00:21:15,322 --> 00:21:17,322
That's why you said at times that he was American.

291
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:18,953
Yes, that's right.

292
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:22,962
Although your boyfriend is...

293
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:25,263
very slightly less attractive...

294
00:21:25,862 --> 00:21:27,792
than your doctor...

295
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:29,163
He's less attractive?

296
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:32,801
Who cares about his looks?

297
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:34,302
As long as he's a good person.

298
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:37,643
Sun Kyung told me that he's a very nice guy.

299
00:21:38,443 --> 00:21:40,611
But you know, I wouldn't say...

300
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:44,041
he's ugly or anything like that.

301
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:47,453
My gosh. You're totally into him.

302
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,752
Then, let me go, pick my Canadian husband,

303
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:53,592
and drop him off at a hotel.

304
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:55,693
Meanwhile, you can hang out with your American boyfriend.

305
00:21:56,163 --> 00:22:00,263
Gosh. You guys didn't have to come back to Korea.

306
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:03,302
Don't you know how much Kevin adores you guys?

307
00:22:03,832 --> 00:22:05,973
Don't say stuff like that. Kevin will be disappointed.

308
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:08,232
I could barely stop him from buying a house in Seoul,

309
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,072
so we could all live together.

310
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:20,653
I'll be back. I won't be gone for long.

311
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:22,653
Okay.

312
00:22:46,513 --> 00:22:49,243
- I want my cell phone. - I see.

313
00:22:51,243 --> 00:22:52,253
Gosh.

314
00:22:52,812 --> 00:22:54,052
- All good? - Yes.

315
00:22:54,552 --> 00:22:56,322
- Bye. - Where are you going?

316
00:22:57,753 --> 00:22:58,753
You said you're all good.

317
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:02,362
I'm all good with the phone. And I'm not done with you yet.

318
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:06,433
Here.

319
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:10,732
- What's this? - It's a cell phone.

320
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:11,832
You've never seen one before?

321
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:13,802
- No. I saw it yesterday. - Gosh.

322
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:15,443
Come on. Take it already.

323
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,643
No. I'm asking you why I need this.

324
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:23,182
There might be another incident similar to yesterday's again. Okay?

325
00:23:23,183 --> 00:23:25,412
I have a plan. Okay?

326
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:27,983
Or were you excited that we talked on the phone before going to sleep?

327
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:32,923
Well, that's partially true.

328
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:34,452
Who's paying for this?

329
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:36,722
That brings me to my next question. What's your bank account number?

330
00:23:36,723 --> 00:23:38,163
Or tell me your card number.

331
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:40,862
Is this phone even working?

332
00:23:41,193 --> 00:23:42,362
Goodness.

333
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:44,902
Here.

334
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:46,032
(Human)

335
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:55,913
(Dong Kyung)

336
00:23:56,282 --> 00:23:59,282
I didn't include our last names because full names sound distant.

337
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:03,922
All right. We have each other's numbers.

338
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:05,052
What should we do next?

339
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:10,893
(Human)

340
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,233
What are you doing?

341
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:14,562
Answer it.

342
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:18,903
Are you free?

343
00:24:20,703 --> 00:24:22,643
Isn't this the next step after getting a girl's number?

344
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:25,673
What if I'm free?

345
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:27,312
Let's hang out.

346
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:45,993
What's this? Why are we here?

347
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:50,362
What is it? Is this a present for me?

348
00:24:51,102 --> 00:24:53,433
- No, that's your work. - Work?

349
00:24:53,632 --> 00:24:56,203
You've gotten materialistic lately. Do you want a present from me?

350
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,102
Gosh.

351
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:15,663
Grandma. Then, my teacher isn't coming?

352
00:25:16,923 --> 00:25:20,532
I heard that there's no boat coming to the island.

353
00:25:21,032 --> 00:25:24,263
I don't think your teacher will make it today.

354
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:25,902
Then, I can't have my graduation ceremony?

355
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:29,403
You and I will have your graduation ceremony together.

356
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:32,612
You already have your diploma right here.

357
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,683
I want to get the diploma from my teacher.

358
00:25:41,782 --> 00:25:44,422
- Sir. - Sir.

359
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:46,792
My gosh. I thought you wouldn't be able to make it.

360
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:51,763
I ought to come today. It's the school's last graduation.

361
00:25:57,032 --> 00:25:58,403
Who are you?

362
00:25:58,532 --> 00:25:59,532
What?

363
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:02,342
Well...

364
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:05,541
She came from Seoul to take photos today.

365
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:08,013
From Seoul? She flew here?

366
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:10,342
Yes.

367
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:12,713
I'm here to take photos.

368
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:18,622
All right. Here it goes.

369
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:21,122
In 1, 2.

370
00:26:21,253 --> 00:26:24,993
(Diploma)

371
00:26:30,102 --> 00:26:33,632
Then, this school will disappear?

372
00:26:35,032 --> 00:26:36,973
There won't be any students coming to the school anymore.

373
00:26:37,403 --> 00:26:38,943
And there aren't any teachers who would teach here.

374
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:41,542
Where's the real teacher?

375
00:26:43,082 --> 00:26:44,943
He's probably headed somewhere.

376
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:48,882
- Where? Is he having a dream? - No.

377
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:51,153
He's headed to the opposite direction of life.

378
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:53,493
By now,

379
00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:56,393
he could have arrived at the garden.

380
00:27:09,272 --> 00:27:10,372
You know, that girl?

381
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:13,872
The girl at the garden.

382
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:17,943
I've seen her at the hospital too.

383
00:27:18,782 --> 00:27:20,882
She was wearing a patient gown that time.

384
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:23,953
She's sick.

385
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:26,893
She is?

386
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:29,263
She's always sick.

387
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:32,592
She's always born sick, suffers in pain, and dies.

388
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:36,801
And she's reborn again just to go through the same pain.

389
00:27:36,802 --> 00:27:38,132
Then, she dies again.

390
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:42,872
That's how she maintains the world.

391
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:46,772
She suffers in pain for all the sins in the world and dies.

392
00:27:50,213 --> 00:27:51,413
That's the duty of a deity.

393
00:27:56,122 --> 00:27:58,322
I saw her repeat that many times for a long time.

394
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:04,223
I thought I had the most miserable life.

395
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,032
My pain was nothing compared to hers.

396
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:12,203
If there was nothing in the world from the beginning,

397
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:15,132
would the world be a peaceful place?

398
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:20,312
If nothing ever happened in the world.

399
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:27,653
Don't move.

400
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:30,453
What? Why?

401
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:48,702
You didn't move for a second. And during that one second,

402
00:28:48,703 --> 00:28:50,842
nothing in the world was destroyed.

403
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:54,973
It was the world you wanted.

404
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:00,453
It's odd, isn't it?

405
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:02,983
During that one second,

406
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:06,193
my time stood still.

407
00:29:10,993 --> 00:29:14,733
(Kang Soo Ah)

408
00:29:15,802 --> 00:29:17,503
You're still beautiful.

409
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:22,473
I'm the only one aging.

410
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:28,913
You're the one who should address me as the elder sister now.

411
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:37,522
Soo Ah.

412
00:29:41,223 --> 00:29:42,622
I know you miss her,

413
00:29:44,423 --> 00:29:46,433
but please be patient a bit longer.

414
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:51,263
Just a bit longer.

415
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:55,032
Let her stay here a bit longer.

416
00:29:57,272 --> 00:29:59,003
I'm talking about Dong Kyung.

417
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:10,923
One thing I learned in life is...

418
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:14,791
that we can't use the word, "forever", for something...

419
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,362
that is still happening.

420
00:30:17,322 --> 00:30:21,092
Loving someone forever is nearly impossible.

421
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:25,503
But losing someone forever is possible.

422
00:30:29,173 --> 00:30:33,143
But we always live for things that don't last forever.

423
00:30:33,513 --> 00:30:35,912
For example, dreams are one of them.

424
00:30:35,913 --> 00:30:37,713
Two cups of latte are ready.

425
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:40,852
- Thank you. - Thank you.

426
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,352
- This is good. - Really?

427
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:53,392
Or things like memories or regrets.

428
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,433
("Second First Love", Lee Hyun Kyu)

429
00:30:58,632 --> 00:31:00,433
(Lee Hyun)

430
00:31:03,272 --> 00:31:07,571
Or some live for love or other people.

431
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:09,041
(Human)

432
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,812
The Korean words, "human", and "love", look similar.

433
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:14,812
I shouldn't have given you such a name.

434
00:31:18,522 --> 00:31:21,223
Come out. I want to do something with you.

435
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:26,663
Why am I here?

436
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:29,831
- I've made up my mind today. - For what?

437
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:31,502
I'm determined to spend money today.

438
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:33,402
I've never done this in my life.

439
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:34,871
So I need you.

440
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:35,872
Why do you need me?

441
00:31:36,072 --> 00:31:38,101
I want you to watch me splurge.

442
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:39,312
Make it fun for me.

443
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:46,112
Give me everything...

444
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:51,022
from here to here.

445
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:53,322
You want all this?

446
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,822
Yes. In 270mm.

447
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:18,082
Then just up to here.

448
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:27,193
People only have two feet. Is it necessary to buy this many?

449
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:29,621
It's one for every season.

450
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:32,522
Sun Kyung's shoes wear out very easily.

451
00:32:32,963 --> 00:32:34,632
There's our next stop.

452
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:46,871
Do you know what gift writers don't like to receive...

453
00:32:46,872 --> 00:32:48,542
but end up receiving the most?

454
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:50,542
- What is it? - Fountain pens.

455
00:32:51,183 --> 00:32:53,152
People think writers will need them,

456
00:32:53,153 --> 00:32:56,223
but they rarely use them nowadays.

457
00:32:56,552 --> 00:32:59,621
But they're too pretty and expensive to throw away.

458
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:01,322
So they just end up keeping them somewhere.

459
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:02,963
Then why are you buying one?

460
00:33:03,592 --> 00:33:05,892
Because she's the type who lingers on the stuff she hates...

461
00:33:05,893 --> 00:33:08,232
rather than what she likes.

462
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,732
She'll never be able to forget it.

463
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:11,862
I'd like to take a look at this one.

464
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:26,212
I'm sorry.

465
00:33:26,552 --> 00:33:29,112
But we only have one left.

466
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:32,992
Can I please take it?

467
00:33:32,993 --> 00:33:34,893
I waited three months for this.

468
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:36,723
I...

469
00:33:38,123 --> 00:33:40,092
only have three months left.

470
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,333
I'm...

471
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:47,402
terminally ill.

472
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:48,773
So...

473
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:51,072
before I die,

474
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:55,942
I want to buy something for my aunt.

475
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:09,523
Stay strong.

476
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:11,993
Thank you.

477
00:34:15,663 --> 00:34:16,802
Nice.

478
00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:44,063
I've never shopped like this in my entire life.

479
00:34:44,592 --> 00:34:46,493
I guess this is why people work so hard.

480
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:49,362
- Who's next? - "Next"?

481
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,663
The next person is me.

482
00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:05,782
I'm going to press on this to take a photo.

483
00:35:06,913 --> 00:35:08,881
I know you don't want to do this, but try to smile.

484
00:35:08,882 --> 00:35:10,482
It's not that I don't want to do it.

485
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:12,453
But what's the purpose?

486
00:35:13,953 --> 00:35:15,993
- What? - To look at it from time to time?

487
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:19,263
Then shouldn't I be the only one in the photo?

488
00:35:19,592 --> 00:35:21,361
Humans are really weird.

489
00:35:21,362 --> 00:35:23,102
Why make things like that?

490
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:24,462
You never get to see them yourself.

491
00:35:25,132 --> 00:35:26,933
It's for others, not me.

492
00:35:28,402 --> 00:35:29,973
I'm like that sometimes.

493
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:35,043
Who knows? I might not be the person looking at it later on.

494
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:42,752
Just do it. I'm going to take the photo now.

495
00:35:43,123 --> 00:35:44,123
Smile.

496
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:56,333
Here we go.

497
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:12,913
When are you going to give everyone these gifts?

498
00:36:13,152 --> 00:36:15,212
What? I don't know.

499
00:36:15,913 --> 00:36:18,282
Maybe later. When I want to give it to them.

500
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:20,853
Hey, give me your cell phone.

501
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:23,023
Can't you see my hands are full?

502
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:30,433
- What are you doing? - Just wait.

503
00:36:34,203 --> 00:36:35,302
Ta-da.

504
00:36:36,743 --> 00:36:38,772
- Hey. - Your hands are full.

505
00:36:38,773 --> 00:36:39,942
So just stay still.

506
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:45,282
See you.

507
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:46,953
Dong Kyung.

508
00:36:48,482 --> 00:36:49,852
Just let it slide already.

509
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:51,182
Do we really have to fight over something like this?

510
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:52,952
As you already know, I can be pretty feisty.

511
00:36:52,953 --> 00:36:54,252
I'll see you later.

512
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:56,663
Oh, later...

513
00:36:57,462 --> 00:36:59,793
What? Later? When?

514
00:37:19,882 --> 00:37:20,913
Hey.

515
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:30,993
What is this? Am I dreaming?

516
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:32,493
Yes.

517
00:37:34,993 --> 00:37:36,032
I guess it is a dream.

518
00:37:36,402 --> 00:37:39,002
You'd never take me to a place like this in real life.

519
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:42,102
What's that supposed to mean?

520
00:37:42,103 --> 00:37:43,942
You said you never eat or sleep.

521
00:37:44,672 --> 00:37:47,712
I'm eating and sleeping right now just for you.

522
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,902
Will I be able to taste everything even if it's a dream?

523
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:15,802
I won't gain weight since it's a dream, right?

524
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:18,703
- Are you happy? - No.

525
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:21,243
It'd be better if we could do this in real life.

526
00:38:23,212 --> 00:38:24,982
There are some things that are only possible here.

527
00:38:25,212 --> 00:38:26,252
What?

528
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:38,563
I'm sorry.

529
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:40,332
Sorry we're late.

530
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,531
Ji Na is such a rough driver.

531
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:43,732
Hey, shut it.

532
00:38:44,402 --> 00:38:46,333
I guess I should've left you behind.

533
00:39:00,112 --> 00:39:02,353
It's my treat today. Eat as much as you want.

534
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:06,352
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

535
00:39:06,353 --> 00:39:07,551
What's gotten into you?

536
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:09,123
Hey, stop eating and ask for water.

537
00:39:11,822 --> 00:39:13,432
- Sun Kyung, eat up. - Okay.

538
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:14,732
Eat up, kiddo.

539
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,132
This is delicious.

540
00:40:17,962 --> 00:40:18,962
Good morning.

541
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:21,833
Hey, you're awake. Come and eat.

542
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:26,372
I called them over so they could eat with us.

543
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:28,032
Why didn't you tell me your aunt came?

544
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:29,703
So I told her instead.

545
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:31,072
Right.

546
00:40:31,402 --> 00:40:32,773
Come and sit down.

547
00:40:33,643 --> 00:40:34,643
Okay.

548
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:36,543
- Ta-da. - My gosh.

549
00:40:37,342 --> 00:40:38,513
I haven't had a homemade meal in so long.

550
00:40:40,683 --> 00:40:42,812
When did you cook all this?

551
00:40:42,813 --> 00:40:43,922
This is your favorite.

552
00:40:44,453 --> 00:40:45,852
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

553
00:40:45,853 --> 00:40:47,853
- Thank you, Auntie. - Enjoy.

554
00:40:58,402 --> 00:40:59,902
I'm getting changed.

555
00:41:00,703 --> 00:41:01,933
You can talk from there.

556
00:41:06,973 --> 00:41:08,543
I'm sorry I never listened to you.

557
00:41:09,313 --> 00:41:10,442
I'll listen from now on.

558
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:14,682
This isn't a truce.

559
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:15,712
I'm surrendering to you.

560
00:41:17,123 --> 00:41:18,123
Why?

561
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:21,092
Are you going to try and become a nice kid?

562
00:41:22,552 --> 00:41:23,663
I'll give it a try.

563
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:26,962
I'll try to prevent what you're worried about from happening.

564
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,532
What is it that I'm worried about?

565
00:41:32,002 --> 00:41:33,873
She won't abandon the world.

566
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:35,203
I'll make sure she doesn't.

567
00:41:35,302 --> 00:41:36,643
That's what I want.

568
00:41:41,773 --> 00:41:42,773
Also,

569
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:46,282
I've always wanted to say this.

570
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:50,623
I always felt sorry for you.

571
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:54,822
I pitied you more than I resented you.

572
00:41:57,362 --> 00:41:58,962
Thanks for letting me be born.

573
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:02,592
I've been...

574
00:42:04,263 --> 00:42:05,862
feeling that recently.

575
00:42:34,864 --> 00:42:37,335
What do you mean, she won't renew her contract?

576
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:42,634
Tell me what you mean.

577
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:44,574
It's as I said.

578
00:42:45,074 --> 00:42:46,504
She won't work with this company...

579
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:48,303
unless Dong Kyung is her editor.

580
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,114
Give me a break.

581
00:42:50,145 --> 00:42:52,044
Tell her to kiss off.

582
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:55,684
Why is she so arrogant when she's not even popular?

583
00:42:55,685 --> 00:42:57,314
Fire Lee Hyun. Hey!

584
00:42:57,315 --> 00:42:59,283
Go and make it clear.

585
00:42:59,284 --> 00:43:02,554
"You're not rejecting us, I'm rejecting you. Me."

586
00:43:02,755 --> 00:43:03,993
That rude brat.

587
00:43:03,994 --> 00:43:06,823
- Dalgona won't work with us either. - What? Why not?

588
00:43:06,824 --> 00:43:09,164
Siberia and Jung Dang Myun too.

589
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:10,263
What? Why?

590
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:13,065
Same for Young Prince, whom she barely signed recently.

591
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:17,633
What? No... We can't lose him.

592
00:43:17,634 --> 00:43:19,134
He's our top 10!

593
00:43:21,244 --> 00:43:22,604
Did you hear them?

594
00:43:22,605 --> 00:43:25,214
Mr. Cha. Do something.

595
00:43:25,215 --> 00:43:27,045
You'll do something, right?

596
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:29,784
Like what?

597
00:43:30,114 --> 00:43:33,724
Either bring the writers or bring Dong Kyung.

598
00:43:33,784 --> 00:43:35,124
- Why should I? - What?

599
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:37,594
You should take responsibility for something this important.

600
00:43:37,755 --> 00:43:39,395
What?

601
00:43:40,065 --> 00:43:43,194
Are you saying I created this mess, so I should clean it up?

602
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:45,334
No. I'm saying the CEO should take responsibility...

603
00:43:45,335 --> 00:43:47,204
for something this important.

604
00:43:48,034 --> 00:43:50,335
At least you know you created this mess.

605
00:43:50,605 --> 00:43:52,074
I thought you didn't know.

606
00:43:54,505 --> 00:43:56,945
Call Dong Kyung right now.

607
00:44:00,614 --> 00:44:01,684
Answer me.

608
00:44:01,685 --> 00:44:02,714
You call her.

609
00:44:02,715 --> 00:44:05,554
She's screening my calls...

610
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,355
Hey, kid. What did you just say?

611
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:18,864
Do you see a kid in here?

612
00:44:20,505 --> 00:44:22,605
I assume the meeting is over, so we'll go now.

613
00:44:22,665 --> 00:44:26,545
We kids have too much work piled up.

614
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:41,384
How dare he talk to the CEO like that?

615
00:44:49,324 --> 00:44:50,533
(Na Ji Na - Isn't it too sudden?)

616
00:44:50,534 --> 00:44:51,694
(Absolute obedience. Wait.)

617
00:44:51,695 --> 00:44:53,164
(Can you come right now? I'm stuck.)

618
00:44:53,165 --> 00:44:55,634
(Did you get home safely? I was too out of it earlier.)

619
00:44:57,735 --> 00:45:00,403
To be honest, I didn't expect the writers to do that.

620
00:45:00,404 --> 00:45:03,574
I know. I expected that from one writer, but...

621
00:45:03,915 --> 00:45:05,114
Lee Hyun?

622
00:45:07,815 --> 00:45:09,415
Did you get home safely?

623
00:45:09,784 --> 00:45:11,784
I was too out of it earlier.

624
00:45:23,735 --> 00:45:26,235
Mr. Cha, how do you know Lee Hyun?

625
00:45:27,235 --> 00:45:28,235
What?

626
00:45:28,465 --> 00:45:30,533
What is wrong with you today?

627
00:45:30,534 --> 00:45:32,174
During the meeting too.

628
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:35,544
- What? - You've been checked out.

629
00:45:35,545 --> 00:45:37,875
Where are you? Are you somewhere nice?

630
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:40,915
It's not that nice.

631
00:45:41,384 --> 00:45:44,154
How do you know Lee Hyun?

632
00:45:44,884 --> 00:45:46,585
Well...

633
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:48,924
I filled in for Dong Kyung once at a meeting.

634
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:06,375
- Where are you going? - I'm cutting.

635
00:46:09,174 --> 00:46:11,074
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

636
00:46:13,344 --> 00:46:14,545
Did you sober up?

637
00:46:15,344 --> 00:46:17,553
I've never been drunk in my entire life.

638
00:46:17,554 --> 00:46:18,684
I've been fine all morning.

639
00:46:18,685 --> 00:46:20,723
Is that why you called me "bro" and were informal with me?

640
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:22,454
I'm sorry, sir. I think I was drunk.

641
00:46:23,085 --> 00:46:25,525
My tolerance is three shots of soju.

642
00:46:27,795 --> 00:46:28,795
Thanks.

643
00:46:29,324 --> 00:46:30,364
For what?

644
00:46:30,965 --> 00:46:32,534
For having a low tolerance?

645
00:46:32,764 --> 00:46:34,204
Just something.

646
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:40,974
Oh. Hi.

647
00:46:41,605 --> 00:46:43,574
- Let's talk. - What would you like?

648
00:46:45,545 --> 00:46:46,584
I said let's talk.

649
00:46:46,585 --> 00:46:48,585
Your CEO is at a table behind you.

650
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:50,114
Hyun Kyu.

651
00:46:51,114 --> 00:46:52,884
(Push)

652
00:46:55,784 --> 00:46:57,525
Look at this punk.

653
00:46:58,195 --> 00:47:01,364
Do you think I put you here so you can play all day?

654
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:03,863
I have to go. The building owner just came in.

655
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:05,264
I'll call you back later.

656
00:47:06,195 --> 00:47:07,965
Didn't you hear your dad?

657
00:47:08,235 --> 00:47:09,634
Why are you here?

658
00:47:11,435 --> 00:47:12,634
Mr. Cha.

659
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,474
Dad?

660
00:47:20,185 --> 00:47:21,284
Father.

661
00:47:21,614 --> 00:47:23,315
Come on, Father.

662
00:47:23,654 --> 00:47:25,714
You should've told me you were coming.

663
00:47:25,715 --> 00:47:27,924
Whom did you come with? Did you come alone?

664
00:47:28,355 --> 00:47:29,554
Come on.

665
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,935
Hey.

666
00:47:37,994 --> 00:47:39,394
Where are you rushing off to?

667
00:47:39,395 --> 00:47:41,835
Come on, Father. Don't be like that...

668
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:03,755
What is wrong with you?

669
00:48:09,395 --> 00:48:11,735
He suddenly showed up at my door.

670
00:48:12,534 --> 00:48:14,304
Oh my gosh. Hyun Kyu?

671
00:48:14,534 --> 00:48:16,464
Was he always that aggressive?

672
00:48:16,465 --> 00:48:17,973
Time changes people.

673
00:48:17,974 --> 00:48:20,604
That's not the point. Who told him where I live?

674
00:48:20,605 --> 00:48:21,903
It wasn't me.

675
00:48:21,904 --> 00:48:23,974
Who else came over besides you?

676
00:49:04,614 --> 00:49:05,755
You said you wanted to talk.

677
00:49:07,424 --> 00:49:08,424
Yes.

678
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:10,395
Go on.

679
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:13,824
Let's talk upstairs.

680
00:49:17,895 --> 00:49:19,395
Do you know Na Ji Na?

681
00:49:25,275 --> 00:49:26,335
Yes.

682
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:30,915
Is that all?

683
00:49:33,074 --> 00:49:34,545
Let's talk upstairs.

684
00:49:48,824 --> 00:49:50,065
I have to go somewhere.

685
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:04,174
(Fill line. Quality may decrease if you cross this line.)

686
00:50:10,355 --> 00:50:11,414
(Mr. Cha Joo Ik)

687
00:50:11,415 --> 00:50:12,453
(Did you leave your umbrella?)

688
00:50:12,454 --> 00:50:15,085
(Incoming Call)

689
00:50:17,324 --> 00:50:19,224
- Hello? - Where are you?

690
00:50:20,094 --> 00:50:22,395
- Who... - It's me, Hyun Kyu.

691
00:50:23,965 --> 00:50:25,763
How did you get my number?

692
00:50:25,764 --> 00:50:27,704
I'll explain when I see you. Let's meet right now.

693
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:29,034
Right now?

694
00:50:29,605 --> 00:50:31,904
- I'm not home. - Where are you?

695
00:50:32,775 --> 00:50:34,375
I'm at the laundromat by my apartment.

696
00:50:42,344 --> 00:50:44,255
- What are you doing? - Are you seeing anyone?

697
00:50:45,185 --> 00:50:47,125
- What? - Are you seeing anyone?

698
00:50:48,054 --> 00:50:49,554
- No. - Or are there any guys you like?

699
00:50:51,295 --> 00:50:52,625
Even if there are, date me.

700
00:50:55,395 --> 00:50:57,965
I don't care who that guy is. We met first.

701
00:50:58,695 --> 00:50:59,993
I liked you first.

702
00:50:59,994 --> 00:51:01,034
And...

703
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:04,635
I still like you.

704
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:46,546
We must put up with a lot of hassles now that we don't live together.

705
00:51:47,345 --> 00:51:48,385
Right.

706
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:53,856
That should do it. Bye.

707
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:07,235
What? You don't want to let go of my hand?

708
00:52:12,436 --> 00:52:13,945
If...

709
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,485
What if...

710
00:52:23,146 --> 00:52:24,685
I wanted to live?

711
00:52:24,686 --> 00:52:26,555
Can you grant me that wish?

712
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:33,055
No.

713
00:52:33,496 --> 00:52:36,425
I can't do that. My job is to destroy.

714
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:40,566
I see.

715
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:44,505
I knew it.

716
00:52:46,275 --> 00:52:47,945
I just wanted to ask.

717
00:52:53,686 --> 00:52:54,985
You heard it, didn't you?

718
00:52:56,845 --> 00:52:59,016
What everyone was thinking in their heads, right?

719
00:53:01,186 --> 00:53:02,825
It might look like...

720
00:53:04,325 --> 00:53:06,425
they are all smiling at me.

721
00:53:09,365 --> 00:53:10,465
But...

722
00:53:11,496 --> 00:53:12,896
they are hurting inside, right?

723
00:53:15,336 --> 00:53:16,436
As much as me.

724
00:53:18,405 --> 00:53:19,575
Or more.

725
00:53:24,775 --> 00:53:25,845
Yes.

726
00:53:31,456 --> 00:53:32,456
What about you?

727
00:53:38,356 --> 00:53:40,595
What goes in your head when you look at me?

728
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:43,796
You think I can't see that?

729
00:53:45,066 --> 00:53:46,336
You keep...

730
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:52,075
You keep hinting at me that I should live...

731
00:53:55,345 --> 00:53:57,516
when I only see death in your eyes.

732
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:05,516
How do you think I feel when I see that?

733
00:54:07,825 --> 00:54:11,296
You can do what you had in mind from the beginning.

734
00:54:12,025 --> 00:54:13,155
It's simple as that.

735
00:54:17,936 --> 00:54:18,996
Bye.

736
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:51,735
Its flowers were beautiful back in the day.

737
00:54:52,796 --> 00:54:54,566
I don't see any flowers these days.

738
00:54:55,635 --> 00:54:57,206
It's dying.

739
00:55:00,845 --> 00:55:02,106
Just like us.

740
00:55:04,646 --> 00:55:07,916
Both you and I are dying too.

741
00:55:10,715 --> 00:55:12,816
That's what it means to live.

742
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:16,625
Goodness.

743
00:55:16,626 --> 00:55:18,595
I thought the flowers would always be around.

744
00:55:19,796 --> 00:55:21,796
What a shame now that I can't see them anymore.

745
00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:24,996
Its flowers were so beautiful.

746
00:55:34,546 --> 00:55:36,746
What goes in your head when you look at me?

747
00:55:39,146 --> 00:55:42,344
I thought I would be able to watch people disappear...

748
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:44,155
to the end of time.

749
00:55:53,595 --> 00:55:54,896
Eating,

750
00:55:56,626 --> 00:55:57,936
sleeping,

751
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,235
feeling compassionate, falling in love,

752
00:56:07,945 --> 00:56:10,074
and having a place to go...

753
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,345
Is this how it feels to be human?

754
00:56:33,396 --> 00:56:35,606
Dissipating from the world didn't scare me.

755
00:56:52,586 --> 00:56:55,286
But not being able to see you anymore scared me.

756
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:19,075
Like a fool, I just realized...

757
00:57:20,546 --> 00:57:24,055
that I don't have much time left.

758
00:57:27,825 --> 00:57:30,155
What's wrong? What happened?

759
00:57:39,796 --> 00:57:40,836
I love you.

760
00:57:45,805 --> 00:57:46,805
I am...

761
00:57:48,505 --> 00:57:49,876
in love with you.

762
00:58:29,445 --> 00:58:33,385
(Doom at Your Service)

763
00:58:33,755 --> 00:58:36,286
I decided to date him.

764
00:58:36,985 --> 00:58:39,755
Do you still feel lonely and alone?

765
00:58:40,595 --> 00:58:43,126
No. You're back.

766
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:45,896
Hey, don't look at me like that.

767
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:49,106
He's been scowling at us.

768
00:58:49,436 --> 00:58:51,105
You were like a puppy protecting his owner.

769
00:58:51,106 --> 00:58:52,436
You glared like this.

770
00:58:52,635 --> 00:58:54,476
I told Ji Na.

771
00:58:55,246 --> 00:58:56,275
Don't answer it.

772
00:58:57,146 --> 00:58:58,445
I need to talk to you.

773
00:58:59,175 --> 00:59:02,215
Be madly in love and live.

774
00:59:03,786 --> 00:59:05,985
I want to make a birthday wish.

775
00:59:06,715 --> 00:59:07,885
Will you marry me?
