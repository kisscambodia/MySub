Jiang Yu Cheng, are you free now?

8
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,390
The printing factory
got out of it unscathed?

9
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,510
Sort of.

10
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,030
Where is Chu Li?

11
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,940
She went to her room after lunch

12
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,310
and hasn't been out since.

13
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,790
And you are just going to stay here?

14
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,790
What a good boyfriend you are.

15
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,540
Maybe I should go upstairs
and check on her?

16
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,830
What's there to check?

17
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,230
Given her current state,

18
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,870
just a few words of advice
won't make her feel better.

19
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,630
Is there anything I can do to help then?

20
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,270
How are you and Gu Bai Zhi

21
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,150
doing lately?

22
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,430
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

23
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,670
I need verifications on several
news articles about the factory.

24
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,710
Since she has a lot of connections,

25
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,430
I need her to put me in
touch with a few people.

26
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,660
Why are you avoiding my eyes?

27
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,070
I am not.

28
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,830
I think

29
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,190
you can ask her yourself.

30
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,510
I ask her?

31
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,430
Then I will be
owing her a favour, won't I?

32
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,870
You can ask for me.

33
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,150
I will just get a free ride from you.

34

Don't you think you are getting

35
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,190
more and more shameless these days?

36
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,710
That depends on who
you're comparing me to,

37
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,830
if it's to you,

38
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,430
I admit defeat.

39
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,950
I've got other things to do, bye.

40
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,110
What other things?

41
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,670
I can't tell you.

Director Gu,

44
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,980
can you explain this to me?

45
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,830
What's wrong with these authors?

46
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,270
Why are they removed from
the Highly Recommended list?

47
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,910
The quality of

48
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,390

49
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,910

been assigned to me,

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,580
Fine.

56
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,550

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,030

as soon as possible.

60
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,860

62
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,230
And some things are easier to get done

63
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,630
behind closed doors.

64
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,070
What do you mean by that?

results from you then.

Director Gu up from work?

79
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,430
Yes.

80
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,350
Just doing her job, huh?

81
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,230
Looks like you can't trust

82
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,670
anything that woman says.

83
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,830
What is that supposed to mean?

84
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,230
I suppose you know

85
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,030
Gu Bai Zhi better than I do, am I right?

86
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,870
Aren't you worried that
she has some other agenda?

87

93
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,910
Nothing.

94
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,230
Nothing important.

95
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,380

Go to sleep.

Why don't

110
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,390
you teach me how to play games?

111
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,310

Put you in a costume then, maybe?

How could you do this?

134
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,989
Even though I was sad and
frustrated last night,

135
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:58,910
but that didn't mean you could
take advantage of my vulnerability.

136

asked me to stay last night.

I've been miserable lately.

145
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,950
I told her that Little Deity
has been widely praised.

146
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,630
Its sales volume is still rising,

147
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,430
it has almost exceeded 150,000 copies now.

148
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,940
She was only happy for ten minutes,

149
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,190
and then she went back
upstairs ten minutes later.

150
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,710
When the night came,

151
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,660
she just started to walk
around in the living room,

152
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,190
asking to catch a movie or play games,

153
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,830
and she had to drag me along.

154
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,790
On the next morning,

155
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,230
she kicked me out.

156
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,870
We kept doing this
round and round for days.

157
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,550
She has been behaving erratically,

158
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,310
like she has been drinking fake liquor.

159
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,230
I kind of get it now what does it mean by

160
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,910
attitude can change
faster than the weather.

161
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,390
Kicked you out? Kicked you out of where?

162
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,630
Is that the only thing you
heard after everything I said?

163
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,350
Our relationship is purely platonic.

164
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,500
I have affection for her,
but I respect her.

165
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,700
I never overstep the line.

166
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,830
I think

167
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,390
you are decent on the outside

168
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,540
and dirty on the inside.

169
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,270
What about you?

170
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,270
What you said is just sour grapes.

171
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,350
There is something wrong with your mood.

172
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,060
You looked like a
lovesick fool two days ago,

173
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,820
what's with the long face today?

174
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,150
Why are you being such a gossip?

175
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,860
You've listened to a lot of
my stories, haven't you?

176
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,390
You think I want to hear it?

177
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,150
It's all because of your strong
desire to express yourself.

178
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,350
You came telling me every time
something trivial happened.

179
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,110
I haven't even charged you
for relationship consultation fee.

180
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,430
Those relationship advice from you?

181
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,420
I had to wash my ears
after hearing your advice.

182
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,510
I haven't even asked you for compensation.

183
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,710
Let me record it down for you,

184
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,830
say it again.

185
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,870
Say you will never seek my advice

186
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,670
on relationship problems again.

187
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,550
Let me remind you kindly

188
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,310
and compassionately that

189
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,230
don't forget the tragic moment you had

190
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,750
when you broke up with her.

191
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,830
Don't come hugging and
crying to me in my house

192
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,710
for three days and three nights again.

193
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,310
Have you been fantasizing about me?

194
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,550
Who are you in a relationship with,

195
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,870
me or Chu Li?

196
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,390
Fine, you'd better not let
me catch you crying again.

197
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,790
Otherwise, I am going to
record it and upload it online

198
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,510
to show all the readers

199
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,950
what a crybaby you are.

200
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,550
All the videos on your phone are about me?

201
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,590
Do you really care about me that much?

202
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,390
Get lost!

203
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,430
This is a public place.

204
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,350
Why should I leave?

205
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,990
Fine, I will go.

206
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,790
Hold on.

207
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,070
The idea that you thought of
before, have you executed it?

208
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,790
Of course.

209
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,830
I have uploaded an 10,000 words
long article before I came here.

210
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,910
You want to denounce the printing factory?

211
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,710
You think I'm some kind
of single-celled creature?

212
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,470
Always use your head

213
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,790
to handle anything.

214
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,270
What?

215
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,710
The printing factory even
issued an apology statement.

216
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,660
The statement also said

217
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,830
they would carry out a
friendly negotiation with us

218
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,390
to cover the loss of
this mistake together.

219
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,030
Of course they should apologize.

220
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,230
This entire thing was their fault.

221
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,510
But I thought they were facing
difficulties in their business?

222
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,070
Why would they be
willing to cover the loss?

223
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,350
You'll have to ask
Mr Zhou Chuan about that.

224
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,550
And what's wrong with Zhou Chuan?

225
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,030
He actually posted a 10,000 words
long article on Weibo,

226
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,710
about the rise and fall
of Zhaoming Printing

227
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,710
over the past fifty years.

228
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,540
He even got a bunch
of writers in the circle

229
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,510
to share it for him.

230
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,790
This old factory that has

231
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,190
an epic and long history,

232
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,150
is poorly managed

233
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,150
and is facing talent loss

234
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,390
due to the external environment.

235
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,740
Such a

236
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,190
devastating story.

237
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,670
But this result is well enough,

238
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,990
isn't it?

239
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,270
It's a happy ending for everyone.

240
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,070
Not only our readers'
anger are dissipated,

241
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,670
but they also believed that Yuan Yue
Publishing House was being generous

242
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,870
for taking the fall for the old factory.

243
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,790
Honestly,

244
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,950
Zhou Chuan has made a really smart move.

245
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,990
But

246
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,870
the question is that after he did this,

247
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,310
who will still hold the managing editor,

248
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,470
Chu Li, for her

249
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,510
responsibility in this?

250
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,950
You see, now everyone believes that

251
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,590
the old factory's slip-up

252
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,950
was because of the external environment.

253
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,990
And the printing factory

254
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,220
is now speaking up for Chu Li,

255
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,300
as a thank you to Zhou Chuan
for creating a good publicity for them.

256
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,830
As a result, Yu Yao and Mr Xia

257
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,060
have gone to see Director Yang

258
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,390
to help Chu Li apply for reinstatement.

259
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,430
We can't have this, Mr Liang.

260
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,870
You have to step up and say something.

261
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,270
Miao, I think you are

262
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,790
getting carried away.

263
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,790
Don't make it personal.

264
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,790
No matter what you do,

265
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,190
you have to put yourself in
Yuan Yue Publishing House's place,

266
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,150
stop focusing on just one person,

267
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,830
am I right?

268
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,670
Now your top priority is to

269
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,820
manage the Animation Column well.

270
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,230
That's your priority, got it?

271
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,910
The result is good.

272
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,470
You've received so much support.

273
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,350
Now Chu Li should be
able to be reinstated soon.

274
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,390
It doesn't matter to me
whether she's reinstated or not.

275
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,990
I just couldn't stand

276
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,670
to see her being sad.

277
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,800
[Luo Wen]

278
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,430
Hello.

279
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,510
All right, I will be right over.

280
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,950
Go home now and coax your girlfriend.

281
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,070
Now is a good chance
for you to claim credit.

282
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,420
Is this Luo Wen

283
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,180
the same Luo Wen from Xin Dun?

284
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,060
Yes.

285
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,630
Gu Bai Zhi's boss?

286
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,150
He said he wanted to
talk to me about something.

287
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,390
Does Gu Bai Zhi know about this?

288
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,950
She

289
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,910
doesn't need to know.

290
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,700
Jiang Yu Cheng.

291
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,230
I don't care if you've
gotten back together again,

292
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,070
or if you have personal ties
with Luo Wen...

293
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,590
Just make sure you know what you're doing.

294
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,670
Chief Editor Yu is helping me
to get reinstated.

295
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,550
If all goes well,

296
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,350
I am going back to work next week.

297
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,580
Mr Zhou, you're so sweet.

298
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,270
Why are you so sweet?

299
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,310
Now you know how sweet I am.

300
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,470
But how have you been treating me
in the last two days?

301
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,430
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

302
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,630
See, I've prepared quite a feast for you.

303
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,670
I'm getting just a feast?

304
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,390
Are you happy now?

305
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,820
It's not enough.

306
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,230
You are home.

307
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,230
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

308
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,470
What's wrong?

309
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,750
Since when?

310
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,550
What do you mean?

311
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,620
Since when did you start using me

312
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,350
as a tool to get your promotion
as vice president?

313
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,910
Who told you that?

314
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,070
Answer me.

315
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,300
You've never been a tool to me,

316
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,790
not even once.

317
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,190
You are still lying even at this moment?

318
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,830
Have you been honest for even once?

319
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:32,789
Have you ever trusted me then?

320
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:38,069
You suspected that I gave your
manuscript to Yun Fei before,

321
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,980
now you are suspecting me

322
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,309
for using you as a tool for my promotion.

323
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,950
Right, I, Gu Bai Zhi, have been

324
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,029
using myself as bargaining
chip to play with you.

325
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,550
Happy now? Satisfy?

326
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,820
If you want my book,
I'll sign it with you.

327
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,990
If you want to be promoted
as vice president, I'll help you.

328
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,270
Just don't lie to me again.

329
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,310
I don't want to learn about
you from other people again.

330
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,700
If you have any real thoughts,

331
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,190
please tell me.

332
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,630
If you promise me this,

333
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,710
I will pretend nothing has happened.

334
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,230
Go ahead and pretend nothing has happened.

335
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,910
Jiang Yu Cheng,

336
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,230
are you feeling sorry for yourself now?

337
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,870
All these year, I, Gu Bai Zhi

338
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,550
have been approaching
you with an ulterior motive.

339
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,870
I was wrong, you were right.

340
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,910
We shouldn't have started over.

341
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,140
[The Disappearing Amusement Park]

342
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,310
[The Disappearing Amusement Park]

343
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,780
Where is the knife? Where is the knife?

344
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,990
What's the matter with you?

345
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,110
I'm going to kill Liang Chong Lang
that rascal.

346
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,670
Rascal!

347
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,110
-What's the matter with you?
-Let go of me!

348
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,790
-Let go of me!
-What did he do to you? Tell me!

349
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,910
I'm so mad right now.

350
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,990
Give me the knife.

351
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,270
I say,

352
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,470
Mr Liang, only you are capable of this.

353
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,990
You managed to

354
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,310
talk Director Yang out of

355
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,310
reinstating Chu Li.

356
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,540
And Mr Xia can't
even get mad at you.

357
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,230
Cut it out.

358
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,470
I didn't do that for you.

359
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,140
How did it go with the
popular comic book writer

360
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,070
you contacted?

361
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,270
Time is running short.

362
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,230
Don't worry,

363
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,390
Xiao Niao and I

364
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,620
have accumulated

365
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,590
a lot of resources.

366
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,020
You see,

367
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,030
I just learnt two new massage techniques

368
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,310
during my massage the other day.

369
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,790
Come, sit down, sit down.

370
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,550
Feel it.

371
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,030
Harder.

372
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,230
Harder.

373
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,910
I don't care.

374
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,270
She's like a different person now.

375
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,870
I kicked the trash can

376
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,150
by accident just now,

377
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,990
and she looked at me like
she was going to kill me.

378
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,150
How can she just turn hostile so quickly?

379
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,070
I don't care.

380
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,940
If you don't come sooner,
I'm dead for sure.

381
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,190
What are you doing?

382
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,150
Nothing.

383
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,030
I'm not doing anything.

384
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,670
Are you feeling bored right now?

385
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,390
No.

386
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,830
Go and work on your novel then.

387
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,630
Do the laundry too.

388
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,230
Okay.

389
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,310
Remember to mop the floor.

390
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,350
Sure.

391
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,390
What should

392
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,870
I do first?

393
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,380
Forget it.

394
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,140
You'd better come and help me cook.

395
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,910
[What is this?]

396
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,790
[A gift that should be given
to you three years ago.]

397
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,390
[If you want my book,
I'll sign it with you.]

398
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,950
[If you want to be promoted
as vice president, I'll help you.]

399
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,190
[Just don't lie to me again.]

400
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,470
[I don't want to learn about
you from other people again.]

401
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,950
Okay.

402
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,100
Hello, Director Gu.

403
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,420
No problem.

404
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,990
I'll see you next week then.

405
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,460
Okay.

406
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,830
Okay, bye.

407
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,110
Well played, Mr Luo.

408
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,430
What do you mean by that?

409
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,390
You told Jiang Yu Cheng, didn't you?

410
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,190
Well, you said you
were just doing your job.

411
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,670
So I suppose telling him wouldn't affect

412
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,750
your arrangement, right, Director Gu?

413
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,830
Of course.

414
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,230
These are the works you wanted
to put on Highly Recommended.

415
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,230
I've looked through them,
none of them pass.

416
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,950
You should stop interfering with

417
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,270
Content Planning Department's work,

418
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,190
so that you won't increase our workload.

419
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,950
The incident with the printing factory

420
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,470
has finally come to an end.

421
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,900
Thank you, Chief Editor Yu.

422
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,270
Since Chu Li has been suspended,

423
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,470
so naturally that I should
take care of these matters.

424
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,790
You don't have to thank me.

425
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,910
And about Chu Li's suspension,

426
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,670
is there anything I can do to help?

427
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,510
She has been suspended for a week now.

428
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,470
I've sent Ah Xiang to see her.

429
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,740
Chu Li can take care of it.

430
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,620
When the time comes,

431
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,190
we just have to give her a little help

432
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,270
at the critical moment.

433
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,150
Okay.

434
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,140
Qiu Qiu's birthday

435
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,990
is coming soon.

436
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,470
You'll come to his birthday party, right?

437
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,670
He'll be really happy when he sees you.

438
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,990
When I wasn't pregnant,

439
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,070
I said

440
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,020
you'd be Qiu Qiu's godmother.

441
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,510
Do you remember that?

442
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,310
Qiu Qiu has grown so much now.

443
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,150
Isn't it a bit strange to tell him

444
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,180
that he has a godmother all of a sudden?

445
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,500
No.

446
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,470
In fact, I often brought
you up in front of him.

447
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,990
He knows who you are.

448
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,350
It's okay.

449
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,230
We will see.

450
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,190
This should be the place.

451
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,870
Is this Mr Zhou Chuan and Chu Li's place?

452
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,110
I'm Ah Xiang.

453
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,470
Chief Editor Yu sent me here.

454
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,540
Is there a hope for her
reinstatement again?

455
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,670
Yes, Mr Zhou Chuan.

456
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,590
Have some water.

457
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,550
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

458
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,270
Have a seat.

459
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,140
So, actually,

460
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,230
Chief Editor Yu and Ms Suo Heng

461
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,990
were supposed to come with me.

462
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,420
But something came up

463
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,990
at the printing factory.

464
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,790
So I came alone.

465
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,670
How's it going?

466
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,900
The gifts have been sent out.

467
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,190
Everything is going well.

468
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,390
Good to hear that.

469
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,150
If it hadn't been Mr Liang's sabotaging,

470
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,380
you would've been reinstated by now.

471
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,110
But Mr Xia still got you

472
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,430
an opportunity from Director Yang.

473
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,630
You know that Yuan Yue Publishing House

474
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,620
is going to reinvent right?

475
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,550
Are you talking about
the new Animation Column?

476
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,870
Mr Liang and Miao have been wanting
to take charge of it for a long time.

477
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,540
It has probably been
assigned to them, hasn't it?

478
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,620
Other than the Animation Column,

479
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,910
Yuan Yue Publishing House

480
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,990
is also adding a New Writer Column
with greatest potential.

481
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,550
You will be in charge of this section.

482
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,030
New Writer Column.

483
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,950
Are you saying that

484
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,150
I am going to scout new writer?

485
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,910
Sort of.

486
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,940
Chief Editor Yu asked you to contact

487
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,630
the outstanding authors
whose follow-ups were picked

488
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,660
in the Interactive
Cultural Festival last year.

489
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,150
As long as you can recruit
a talented new writer,

490
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,430
you'll have no problem getting reinstated.

491
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,910
You got it.

492
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,950
As long as I can keep my job,

493
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,350
I'll do anything.

494
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,870
I will look through the follow-up articles

495
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,950
from the Interactive Cultural
Festival last year now.

496
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,150
I do remember one writer

497
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,470
whose article was good.

498
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,190
I know who you're talking about.

499
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,430
The Ghost Behind You!

500
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,620
Found it.

501
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,390
But I only found his QQ account.

502
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,550
That will do.

503
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,910
Hello.

504
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:40,580
I am the editor of Moonlight Magazine.

505
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,780
My name is Chu Li.

506
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,870
Looking forward to hearing from you.

507
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,620
I am feeling a little excited suddenly.

508
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,030
What are you excited about?

509
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,140
This is my first time
signing a new writer.

510
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,780
Whether it was you,

511
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,190
or Mr Jiang, or Ms Suo Heng,

512
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,430
you all have some experience
in book publishing.

513
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,630
This is the first time I'm
working with new writer.

514
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,230
He hasn't added you yet.

515
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,900
And you already knew you
are going to work with him?

516
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,710
He'll definitely say yes.

517
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,070
First, he chose your manuscript,

518
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,470
so he is most likely your fan.

519
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,190
Second, even if he isn't your fan,

520
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,430
among all manuscripts,

521
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,190
he and you were like-minded.

522
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,390
So if I can't persuade him,

523
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,990
I can send you to persuade him for me.

524
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,670
That's very cheeky of you.

525
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,500
You were still trying to stab your
husband to death a while ago.

526
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,550
Now you're thinking about
how to take advantage of me.

527
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,190
What a slap in the face.

528
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,070
You'd better not lose
your job again in future,

529
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,590
otherwise, I might as well
just sleep with Er Gou,

530
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,910
it's safer for me.

531
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,430
What nonsense are you talking about?

532
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,590
Who is my husband?

533
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,990
What do you think?
Who else do you think it is?

534
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,510
You haven't answered my question.

535
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,110
You, you, of course it's you.

536
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,830
Now that's more like it.

537
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,490
[Ghost]

538
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,590
Goodness,

539
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,220
This kid is generous

540
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,300
in using exclamation mark.

541
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,350
Let me send him a few topics and ask
him to submit his drafts as try-out.

542
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:05,740
Director,

543
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,150
I've sent you the information via email.

544
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,230
I'm going take off now.

545
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,020
Okay, get home safe.

546
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,220
We need to talk.

547
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,110

But what he wrote here

572
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,590
is considered a joke,

let me ask you,

707
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,390
if a book is incomprehensible to you,

708
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,350
will you introduce it to the readers?

709
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,350

710
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,870
we'll find other ways.

it's normal that they can't
accept it for the moment.

the broad sense of incomprehensibility,

719
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,380
the issue here lies with
the reader's age group.

720
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,900
I can't just give up
Ghost's novel like this.

that's okay,

724
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,620

that can be achieved overnight.

726
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,580

transforming themselves.

on the market soon.

732
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,710
But you have to give Mr Xia time

733
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,230
to understand ACG genre.

734
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,750
It's easy for us to understand ACG,

735
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,510
but it's hard for Mr Xia.

736
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,750
No.

737
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,460
Why must we get Mr Xia understand it?

738
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,270
Besides, what more can we do?

739
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,670
Yes, yes, let me tell you...

740
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,020
Mr Xia!

741
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,340
Mr Xia.

742
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,420
Chu Li, what are you doing here?

743
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,470
Don't you know

744
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,590
you are under suspension?

745
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,470
Miao.

746
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,030
Fine, I'll get on with my work.

747
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,190
Side ponytail is a common hairstyle

748
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,780
for women in anime.

749
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,670
Most characters who
show up with this hairstyle,

750
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,870
they are either dead or going to be dead.

751
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,150
That's why she wrote

752
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,190
"Madam, your hairstyle is dangerous."

753
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,670
The season for white album is winter.

754
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,630
Whenever there is a love triangle
between two women fighting for a man,

755
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,670
people will say,

756
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,990
"This is the season of the white album."

757
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,140
After you explained it,

758
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,430
I get it now.

759
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,150
But you can't explain it

760
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,150
to the reader one by one.

761
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,710
Not everyone

762
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,670
can understand Ghost's novel,

763
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,820
but there must be
a certain group of readers

764
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,150
that will really like and appreciate her.

765
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,430
As long as our New Writer Column

766
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,190
can seize these readers' attention,

767
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,980
we are already half success.

768
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,150
What I'm about to say
may sound a bit overconfident,

769
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,140
but please trust my judgment.

770
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,340
Ghost will definitely become
the most popular author

771
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,070
in the New Writer Column.

772
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,030
Fine.

773
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,990
You want me to trust your judgment.

774
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,030
Tell me then,

775
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,910
what kind of book do you want to publish?

776
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,900
What kind of energy do you
want to convey to reader?

777
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,950
I believe that the energies that a book

778
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,230
can convey to the reader are diverse.

779
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,030
It doesn't have to have
profound ideologies

780
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,470
or educational significance.

781
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,150
As long as it can move the reader
for even just one second,

782
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,870
it's a book that I'm willing to push
through all obstacles to work on.

783
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,910
Did it really make you that happy?

784
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,630
Of course.

785
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,350
Not only did I convince Mr Xia,

786
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,870
but I might get reinstated too.

787
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,550
This would be another highlight

788
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,230
of my year.

789
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,750
What if Mr Xia wasn't convinced?

790
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,420
Not likely to happen.

791
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,500
Entrenchment is
the biggest taboo for a literati.

792
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,550
A literati should be

793
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,990
tolerant to diversity.

794
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,030
Just because Mr Xia was taken aback by

795
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,910
the sudden emergence of
a new generation of literature,

796
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,750
it doesn't mean he rejects it.

797
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,230
Are you that confident?

798
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,950
Yes.

799
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,430
Otherwise, Moonlight Magazine
wouldn't have carried out a reinvention.

800
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,630
I believe that Moonlight Magazine
can definitely

801
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,150
introduce these new generation literature

802
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,060
to those who miss out
on great literary works

803
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,110
because of their traditional stereotype.

804
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,030
Like Mr Xia.

805
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,470
Like your dad.

806
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,470
What are you doing?

807
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,910
We are still in the company.

808
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,550
What? I just want to hold your hand.

809
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,390
Do we really need so many books?

810
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,710
Of course.

811
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,270
When Ghost's novel

812
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,750
is published,

813
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,070
as her editor,

814
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,670
I have to understand

815
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,470
all the references of ACG first

816
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,950
before I can evaluate her content.

817
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,100
You really are...

818
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,830
Really are what...

819
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,310
You really are making me proud.

820
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,590
What are you doing?
This is a public space.

821
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,310
Don't worry, I checked, no one's looking.

822
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,390
Tell me,

823
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,430
if I didn't run

824
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:35,950
when we first met,

825
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,070
what would have happened?

826
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,510
When we first met?

827
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,510
The first time I found out
you were Monkey was here.

828
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,750
[Mr Zhou Chuan?]

829
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,110
No wonder you ran
away so fast that time.

830
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,870
Weren't you afraid you were
going to fall down hard?

831
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,750
Will you still want me
if I disfigure my face?

832
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,230
Of course not.

833
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,110
What are you doing?

834
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,060
-Grabbing a book.
-Come down.

835
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,630
Come down.

836
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,270
I'll get it for you.

837
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,630
Get me The Garden of Sinners.

838
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:27,790
Okay.

839
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,370
[Natsume Soseki Collection]

840
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,670
[Sir.]

841
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,510
Have you forgotten that you snatched

842
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,750
Natsume Soseki's Crime from me?

843
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,910
I gave it back to you
after that, didn't I?

844
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,590
But aren't you going to apologize me

845
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,470
after you made a mistake?

846
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,030
Come here.

847
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,660
Why?

848
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,030
I'm going to make it up to you.
