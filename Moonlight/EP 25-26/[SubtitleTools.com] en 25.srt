[Episode 25]

4
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,590
I know you're single, but you can't
just act like this.

5
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,030
You're having sinister thoughts

6
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,910
when you see a happy couple like us.

7
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,110
But, your relationship with her is

8
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,670
practically the same as you being single.

9
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,470
Get out.

10
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,989
I've been waiting for you to say that
for a long time.

11
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,429
Let me call Gu Bai Zhi then.

12
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:22,310
Why are you calling her?

13
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,710
I'm curious about how you two

14
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,150
maintained your relationship
when you're a person like this.

15
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,470
There are three solutions to this.

16
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,500
They're suitable for
all kinds of situations.

17
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,630
Heat up the pan and put your steak in.

18
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,390
First,

19
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,470
you need to cook for her personally.

20
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,630
Because when both of you
are busy with work,

21
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,590
you two won't have opportunities
to eat with each other.

22
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,350
Time will always separate you two.

23
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,150
At this time,

24
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,550
someone needs to stand out

25
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,790
and break the balance.

26
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,660
The meal you prepared for her
will be your opportunity.

27
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,070
You're really lucky.

28
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,350
You have steaks for dinner these few days.

29
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,590
Next,

30
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,710
the way you speak is very important.

31
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,790
But,

32
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,230
flattery doesn't work.

33
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,630
You should ask her directly

34
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,870
and see what you can help her with.

35
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:05,029
Let her know that

36
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:06,590
you're there for her

37
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,110
no matter how tired she is.

38
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,100
I know you're worried about Suo Heng.

39
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,790
I know you have no time for me lately.

40
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,910
But, don't worry.

41
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,710
I will take care of myself.

42
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,950
You can tell me everything.

43
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,070
Not only am I your boyfriend, Zhou Chuan,

44
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,390
I'm your best friend, Mr Fox, as well.

45
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,430
Get her a present.

46
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,310
All girls like it when
boys give them presents.

47
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,950
Don't think that buying her accessories
is old-fashioned.

48
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,950
No matter how different she is,

49
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,940
girls will always be girls.

50
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,430
Why hasn't she returned yet?

51
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,870
Why have you only returned by now?

52
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,100
I was too busy.

53
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,350
Have you eaten?

54
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,110
No. I was waiting for you.

55
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,110
I told you that...

56
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,470
I've eaten already.

57
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,140
I need to work overtime later.

58
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,910
You need to work overtime
even though you're back?

59
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,190
Since when does Yuan Yue Publishing House

60
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,710
know how to extort their employees?

61
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,950
It's not that.

62
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,910
I'm going to the
printing factory tomorrow.

63
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,150
I have to prepare
all of the materials by tonight.

64
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,670
You...

65
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,540
I've prepared dinner.

66
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,150
Let's eat.

67
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,820
I thought you ate already?

68
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,830
Can you still finish the dinner I've made?

69
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,950
I feel hungry suddenly.

70
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,470
It's cold.

71
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,260
Let me heat it up for you.

72
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,910
Men who cook are the coolest.

73
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,550
But of course.

74
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,190
By the way, I've prepared a movie as well.

75
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,710
We can watch it later.

76
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,790
If you don't feel like watching the movie,

77
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,310
we can play some games.

78
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,310
We'll do whatever you want to do.

79
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:10,790
By the way...

with Suo Heng's front cover.]

83
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,430
Were you caught in the traffic
when you took the bus?

84
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,510
Do you need me to send you to work?

85
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:18,990
I'll send you there and
pick you up as well.

86
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,060
Not only will you be able to

87
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,230
save money,

88
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,110
you'll be able to rest on my car
on your way there.

89
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,470
What do you think?

90
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,230
Enjoy it while it's hot.

92
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,460
I know you've been busy lately.

93
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,710
What I want to say is...

94
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,830
Mister,

95
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,950
I had my fill already.

96
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,910
Thank you for your dinner.

97
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,710
Although tonight was very romantic,

98
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,470
I still have work that I need to finish.

99
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,910
I'm not done with
Suo Heng's front cover yet.

100
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,950
I'll leave now.

101
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,510
Delicious!

102
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,030
So delicious!

103

It's so delicious!

106
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,030
I'm going to take a walk with my dog.
Do you want to join me?

107
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,390
No thanks.

108
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,870
You had a large piece of steak.

109
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,510
Don't you want some desserts later?

110
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,150
No thanks.

111
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,270
It hurts! I think I have a bone fracture!

112
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,270

jot everything down clearly.

A concubine who has been
banished to the Cold Palace.

If I must say,

182
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,750

these few days.

She didn't catch what
you were trying to do at all.

184
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,470
You should stop imagining things.

185
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,990
You don't understand at all.

186
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,660
A relationship is doomed to fail

187
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,750
once someone neglects the other party
due to their work.

188
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,430
You should know that the best.

189
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,830
Didn't you and Gu Bai Zhi break up

190
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,510
because of the same reason?

191
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,550
Can you just focus on your own problem?

192
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,190
Don't try to drag me into this.

193
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,590
I know what kind of problem
I'm facing right now.

194
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,990
I shouldn't have asked for your opinion
in the first place.

195
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,950
If your solutions did work,

196
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,860
you would've been married with
Gu Bai Zhi long ago.

197
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,710
I shouldn't have asked for your opinion
in the first place.

198
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,070
In the end,
I still need to depend on myself.

199
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,390
Chu Li,

200
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,070
you're acting like

201
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,100
a capable editor now.

202
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,470
Many readers are
curious about you, you know?

203
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,940
I would rather become an editor
who's invisible.

204
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,910
Editors work behind the scenes.

205
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,750
It's great as long as we can help
the writers to publish their books.

206
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,910
There's no need for people
to know of our existence.

207
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,950
It's fine when there's no trouble,

208
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,230
but I'll be reprimanded
if I'm in trouble because of it.

209
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:03,950
What's wrong?

210
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,750
Your phone was ringing non-stop just now.

211
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,510
Is there anything wrong?

212
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,310
It's Mr Zhou Chuan.

213
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,100
I don't know what's wrong with him lately.

214
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,030
He has been forwarding

215
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,740
some weird articles to me lately.

216
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,270
What articles?

217
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,590
Can I have a look?

218
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,790
I want to read the things

219
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,990
my idol reads usually.

220
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,900
Come.

221
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,350
Why we go cold on our partners?

222
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,860
Why don't women leave men even after

223
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,510
falling out of the relationship?

224
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,550
Women who truly love you

225
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,070
will fulfil two of
the circumstances below.

226
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,030
What? Do you want to tell me something?

227
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,190
Chu Li,

228
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,110
have you been ignoring
Mr Zhou Chuan lately?

229
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,270
Why do you say so?

230
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,030
All these articles are
so blatantly obvious.

231
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,390
He's seeking for attention.

232
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,870
I don't need to work overtime tonight.

233
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,310
I'll make a feast for you tonight.

234
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,990
[I don't need to work overtime tonight.]

235
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,980
[I'll make a feast for you tonight.]

236
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,550
Listen.

237
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,190
Listen to it.

238
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,150
The candlelit dinner was useless.

239
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,710
Do you see

240
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,110
how good and efficient I am?

241
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,190
Please don't give me

242
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,510
any relationship advice in the future.

243
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,870
You're not good enough.

244
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,310
You should consult me

245
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,270
before you court a girl in the future.

246
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,500
I didn't expect myself to be a genius
at something else

247
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,150
besides writing.

248
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,900
Genius? My foot.

249
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,310
I've checked the advance copy
and the gifts.

250
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,270
They're fine.

251
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,790
But you must remember to key in
the online pre-sale edition

252
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,470
as a different entry from
the normal edition.

253
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,660
You hear me?

254
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,190
[Yes, madam.]

255
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,550
[Coming.]

256
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,150
[Sister Chu Li, I'll hang up now.]

257
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,870
[Don't worry.]

258
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,870
[I'll handle this for you.]

259
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,910
Mr Jiang,

260
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,870
I'm really sorry.

261
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,310
I can't attend your function.

262
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,630
Because I'm not done with

263
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,540
Ms Suo Heng's books yet.

264
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,070
You don't need to apologize to him.

265
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,870
You're my girlfriend.

266
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,830
Why are you trying to join him?

267
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,030
I need to correct something.

268
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,150
I didn't invite your girlfriend.

269
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,100
I invited my editor.

270
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,300
Mr Jiang, how about this?

271
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,590
Let Zhou Chuan join you for the function

272
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,590
since it didn't state that you need
a female partner to enter.

273
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,550
-Are you out of your mind?
-No thanks.

274
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,270
Mr Zhou Chuan, stop pretending.

275
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,150
When Mr Jiang gave me

276
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,510
the signed copy of
The Disappearing Amusement Park,

277
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,020
not only did you take it for yourself,

278
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,150
you didn't even let me

279
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,710
take a look at
the heart sticker on the book.

280
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,030
What's with that?

281
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,030
You're my girlfriend, you know?
Why are you curious about

282
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,550
the heart sticker left by him?

283
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,070
Are you done? Leave when you're done.

284
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,190
I can't stand you anymore.

285
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,100
You're not allowed to let him stay.

286
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,110
-I didn't plan...
-Don't worry.

287
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,910
I don't plan to stay for dinner as well.

288
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,670
Chu Li, see you next time.

289
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,110
See her? You're not allowed to see her!

290
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,380
You're finally skipping work

291
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,950
for me today?

292
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,150
So, do you want me to come home?

293
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,950
Will you believe me if I say no?

294
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,350
No.

295
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,190
Give me your hands.

296
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,549
I've been invisible to you

297
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:39,430
for the past few days.

298
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,470
Why did you buy a present for me then?

299
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,990
If I don't do anything,

300
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,590
we'll go through a breakup soon.

301
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,980
No way. We're in the middle of
our love bubble.

302
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,550
How are we in a love bubble

303
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,270
when we're barely talking to each other?

304
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,910
You don't let me kiss you at all.

305
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,030
It's not that I'm objecting to that.

306
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,630
It's just that
there isn't any opportunity.

307
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,590
Come on then.

308
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,230
I'm ready.

309
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,500
This is more like it.

310
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,150
Seems like the chapters

311
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,070
I've sent to you weren't in vain.

312
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,150
What? Chapters of your new novel?

313
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,150
I just sent them to your email.

314
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,430
I'm going to take a look at them!

315
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,150
I shouldn't have said that.

316
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,390
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

317
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,350
Mr Nian Nian,

318
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,310
I've already started to
inspect your scripts.

319
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,230
By the way,

320
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,230
didn't you say that

321
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,150
my shampoo smelled nice?

322
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,190
I bought extra this time.

323
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,510
I'll send them to you later.

324
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,630
You're welcome.

325
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,990
Alright, see you.

326
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,990
Mr He Ma?

327
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,550
How is it? Have you returned to
the country?

328
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,070
I was planning to prepare
a welcoming dinner for you.

329
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,190
The weekend? I'm fine with that.

330
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,190
By the way,

331
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,390
regarding the writer of Luo Yi Monk,

332
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,670
Mr Yu Bo,

333
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,270
have you contacted him for me?

334
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,350
What?

335
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,550
You want me to bring Chu Li with me?

336
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,950
Mr He Ma,

337
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,110
Chu Li is very famous now.

338
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,780
You may not be able to meet her.

339
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,350
Even I couldn't meet her often.

340
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,110
How about this? I'll contact you
if I'm able to

341
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,030
arrange for an appointment with her.

342
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,750
Okay?

343
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,380
That's all for now.

344
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,750
Alright.

345
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,710
Ms Suo Heng, this is great.

346
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,470
The number of copies for
your first print run are increasing.

347
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,470
Thank you, Chu Li.

348
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,550
It's all thanks to you.

349
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,830
Thank you so much.

350
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,140
Not at all.
You should credit yourself as well.

351
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,390
I didn't expect us

352
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,430
to receive 65,000 orders

353
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,350
from the pre-sale online and
the hard copies.

354
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,620
That means you'll be able to sell
70,000 books for your first print run.

355
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,150
I've contacted the printing factory
for the printing of your books.

356
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,470
Chu Li, it's all thanks to you.

357
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,110
Let me treat you to dinner tonight.

358
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,470
I appreciate your effort.

359
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,980
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

360
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,510
I still need to work overtime

361
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,030
to complete your book.

362
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,550
We can go and celebrate our success

363
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,550
after your book is listed on the market.

364
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,550
We must tell Chief Editor Yu
to join us as well.

365
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,470
You may not know,

366
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,390
but she went to check out the sequence

367
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,710
for your books this morning.

368
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,870
She hasn't even returned yet.

369
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,950
Is that so?

370
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,460
Thank her for me.

371
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,830
You want me to thank her for you?

372
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,980
You should thank her yourself.

373
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,350
I'm sure she'll be delighted.

374
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,750
I'm back.

375
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,230
Overtime shifts again?

376
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,350
Why is the living room always messy?

377
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,300
Can't you guys just clean it up?

378
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,670
Mum!

379
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,070
My baby.

380
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,150
Our house wouldn't be in this mess

381
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,190
if you didn't work overtime every day.

382
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:25,980
Baby,

383
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,390
after I'm finished with my work,

384
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,230
let's go and celebrate

385
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,500
your birthday in Disneyland,

386
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
okay?

387
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,430
That's great.

388
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,510
Mum, there's one more week
before my birthday.

389
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,430
Can I have the chocolate

390
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,660
Grandma left for me?

391
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,750
Baby, I told you before.

392
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,470
What will happen to you
if you consume too much sweets?

393
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,310
I will have a toothache, and worms
will attack my tooth.

394
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,430
Yes, my baby. You're right.

395
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,710
Just let him have one.

396
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,470
My mother bought it especially
for him, you know?

397
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,510
As adults, we mustn't spoil our children.

398
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,430
Just tell Mum

399
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,430
to stop buying sweet things for him.

400
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,270
My mother was the one who's been
taking care of him lately.

401
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,950
What's wrong with having a few sweets?

402
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,110
Qiu Qiu, let's go.

403
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,750
Let's take a bath.

404
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,830
After that, we'll go to sleep.

405
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:28,780
[Suo Heng]

406
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,990
[Thank you.]

407
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,910
Congratulations.

408
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,990
Why are you here alone?

409
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,190
Chu Li couldn't come as she has
an emergency to attend to.

410
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,670
Bai Zhi,

411
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,710
this is?

412
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,470
You must be Mr Jiang.

413
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,110
I've heard many things about you.
I'm Luo Wen.

414
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,630
I'm from Xin Dun Books.

415
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,630
Hello, Mr Luo.

416
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,670
People often told me that
Mr Jiang is young and talented.

417
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,030
Your reputation is well-deserved.

418
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,950
Mr Jiang, I'm an avid reader of yours.

419
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,660
I've been reading all of your books.

420
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,100
I hope that

421
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,990
we can work together in the future.

422
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,670
You flatter me.

423
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,750
Where's Yun Fei?

424
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,540
-Yun Fei...
-Yun Fei

425
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,870
is busy for the past few days.

426
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,590
That's why I'm here on his behalf.

427
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,910
I won't interrupt you guys then.

428
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,310
Please accompany Mr Jiang.

429
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,270
No problem.

430
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,700
Next time, you can find me.

431
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,750
What?

432
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,660
You can find me

433
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,110
if you lack a male partner.

434
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,190
Let's have a drink.

435
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,470
Mr Lu,

436
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,910
do you remember me?

437
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,590
I'm Luo Wen from Xin Dun Books.

438
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,430
I do remember you.

439
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,190
Please.

440
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,830
Alright.

441
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,780
Mr Lu.

442
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,470
Look at your Mr Luo.

443
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,830
He's following Mr Lu like a puppy.

444
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,470
Flattery doesn't work on

445
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,390
Mr Lu at all.

446
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,710
And I still remember that

447
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,430
last time...

448
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,300
Isn't this Mr Jiang Yu Cheng?

449
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,910
We meet again.

450
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,830
Your novel,

451
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,310
The Disappearing Amusement Park,

452
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,470
it sold like hotcakes.

453
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,390
I read the book.

454
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,790
I was so regretful.

455
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,310
How could I part ways with
an impeccable novel

456
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,470
like that?

457
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,820
Is that so?

458
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,550
What do you think about
Li Su's ending then?

459
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,540
Li Su?

460
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,750
He left a deep impression on me.

461
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,350
I think his ending is great.

462
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,260
Since Mr Jiang is one of

463
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,790
the best writers out there.

464
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,780
Li Su doesn't exist in the novel.

465
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,390
Yeah.

466
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,750
I think I'm getting too old.

467
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,030
My memories aren't as good
as they used to be.

468
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,990
Excuse me, but you are?

469
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,310
She's Gu Bai Zhi from Xin Dun Books.

470
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,270
Ms Gu from Xin Dun Books?

471
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,790
It's a pleasure to meet you.

472
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,870
It's an honour to see you here.

473
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,030
This...

474
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,630
This is my name card.

475
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,300
Ms Gu.

476
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,270
Mr Jiang.

477
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,830
So,

478
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,590
I won't interrupt you guys then.

479
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,710
Please continue.

480
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,990
Ms Wen Xiang,

481
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,500
this is my name card.

482
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,230
Let's go.

483
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,190
What are you doing?

484
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,550
I have many ideas that
I want to propose to you.

485
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,790
Hey!

486
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,190
I'm sorry about that.

487
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,510
It's fine.

488
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,270
Ms Gu, I know you didn't do it on purpose.

489
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,790
It's just an accident.

490
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,750
Give me a tissue.

491
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,710
Look at him.

492
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,710
He was enraged,

493
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,030
but he still pretended to smile.

494
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,430
If you work with a person like him,

495
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,220
he might stab you in the back one day.

496
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,630
That Wang Yang

497
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,870
has been trying to ruin your reputation

498
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,300
just because he couldn't publish
your book, The Disappearing Zoo.

499
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,870
I wanted to teach him a lesson long ago.

500
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,870
Why do you guys remember my affairs

501
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,750
more clearly than me?

502
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,070
You guys?

503
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,620
Who else is there? Zhou Chuan?

504
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,990
Yeah.

505
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,830
Back then,

506
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,030
Zhou Chuan and I were nobody.

507
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,910
We couldn't do anything about it.

508
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,300
We could only keep it to ourselves.

509
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,500
Besides,

510
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,190
I was your editor back then.

511
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,710
I've finally avenged myself

512
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,510
today.

513
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,100
I've reached home.

514
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,990
I'll go in now.

515
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:36,920
♫ They say strange things

516
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:44,470
♫ Guileless adults are reduced to a joke ♫

517
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,750
Wait.

518
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:51,580
♫ Unceasingly, here to stay ♫

519
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,750
Does it still count?

520
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,950
What do you mean?

521
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:58,750
♫ No dancing on the roof, but rain ♫

522
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,470

♫ The loneliness has found
a place and moved out ♫

524
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,150
you said we could start again.

525
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,260
Does it still count?

526
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,390
What do you think?

527
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:14,830
♫ Guests sillier than me

What is this?

537
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,950
This is a gift that I was supposed to
give to you three years ago.

538
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,270
You're going to be late for work.

539
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,430
Although I haven't finished it,
Mr Zhou Chuan,

540
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,990
your new novel

541
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,430
might be your new masterpiece.

542
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,990
Every book of mine is a masterpiece.

543
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,710
I'll go up then.

544
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,670
I still need to work overtime tonight.

545
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,670
You don't need to wait for me tonight.

546
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,550
You owe me some kisses.

547
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,550
Chu Li!

548
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,630
This is bad! Something happened to
Suo Heng's books!

549
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,150
I read the online reviews

550
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,550
of Little Deity today.

551
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,470
They said they didn't receive any gifts
from the online pre-sale edition.

552
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,990
Only those who bought the hard copy
received the gifts.

553
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,510
Have you asked the
customer service about this?

554
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,310
I did.

555
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,830
But they said they did everything
according to our preference.

556
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,950
I don't know what's going on either.

557
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,350
I'll go to the printing factory.

558
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,670
You should contact Chief Editor Yu.

559
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,990
Alright, I understand.

560
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,030
I'll be there immediately.

561
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,350
Alright.

562
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,710
Something urgent popped up.

563
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,230
Please send him to the kindergarten today.

564
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,790
I have an important meeting
to attend as well.

565
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,070
I mustn't be late.

566
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,070
I need to rush to the company immediately.

567
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,660
Just send him to
the kindergarten this time, okay?

568
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,510
Yu Yao,

569
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,790
you always give the same excuses.

570
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,430
Qiu Qiu,

571
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,230
pat his back.

572
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,830
Qiu Qiu?

573
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,190
Qiu Qiu.

574
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,870
Qiu Qiu, are you okay?

575
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,830
How do you feel?

576
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,140
Do you feel better?

577
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,870
How many times have I told you this?

578
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,630
You should stop Mum from buying
all those sweets for him.

579
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,590
My mother bought him some sweets
because she cared for him.

580
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,590
How could you blame this on my mother?

581
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,350
I'm not blaming Mum.

582
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,870
It's just that sweets aren't good for him.

583
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,310
Why do you always talk to me

584
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,190
with this kind of attitude?

585
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,470
Qiu Qiu, look at me.

586
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,620
It's fine now.

587
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,070
You can go to the kindergarten, right?

588
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,030
Okay.

589
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,270
Alright.

590
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,630
Send him to the kindergarten then.

591
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,270
Ask the teachers to observe him in school.

592
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,190
I'll leave first.

593
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,830
You're leaving just like that?

594
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,510
Suo Heng's books are in huge trouble.

595
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,910
I have to rush over there immediately.

596
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,910
Qiu Qiu is fine now.

597
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,590
I'm really sorry about this.

598
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,910
Yu Yao,

599
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,700
I tried my best to transfer my job
to this state

600
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,350
so that

601
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,310
our family can live together in peace.

602
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,540
But you?

603
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,390
Which is more important in your heart?

604
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,950
Is Yuan Yue Publishing House

605
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,670
more important than our family?

606
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,470
Qiu Qiu, let's go.

607
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,710
Hello, Chief Editor Yu.

608
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,070
Chu Li, what's going on?

609
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,830
Why aren't the buyers of
the online pre-sale edition

610
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,030
receiving their gifts?

611
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,790
[Now, the official website of
Yuan Yue Publishing House]

612
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,780
[is filled with their complaints.]

613
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,780
Chief Editor Yu,

614
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,470
I went to the printing factory just now.

615
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,150
The person in charge,
Xiao Wang, made a blunder.

616
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,470
He mixed up the two orders.

617
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,310
[Chief Editor Yu, I'm sorry.]

618
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,790
Enough. Just return here for now.

619
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,180
Stop wasting your time over there.

620
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,310
We need to resolve this

621
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,670
within one hour.

622
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,190
Alright.

623
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,790
Mr Zhou Chuan?

624
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,830
Why are you here?

625
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,950
Look at you, you look so down.

626
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,460
How could I return home in peace?

627
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,750
I've heard everything from Xiang.

628
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,990
Let's return for now.

629
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,030
Tell the circulation department

630
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,390
to stop distributing the current goods.

631
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,990
After that, you can prepare
for the compensation.

632
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,750
Before this happened, I told Xiang that

633
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,550
the readers mustn't know
the existence of the editors.

634
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,670
Because if something happens to the book,

635
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,190
we'll be reprimanded.

636
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,150
And now, I'm in trouble.

637
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,190
I think I'm a jinx.

638
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,350
Yeah, you're a jinx.

639
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,390
Alright, it's fine now.

640
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,830
I'm here for you.

641
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,030
Mr Zhou Chuan,

642
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,230
this concerns my work.

643
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,750
Please don't interfere.

644
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,150
I'm sure Miao and the rest will...

645
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,710
Their opinion doesn't matter.

646
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,110
It's fine as long as
I can help the readers

647
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,670
get their compensation.

648
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,510
I'll wait for you in the car then.

649
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,790
Chu Li,

650
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,510
what's the current situation
in the printing factory?

651
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,510
The person in charge made a blunder.

652
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,540
He mixed up the orders
for the two editions.

653
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,350
That's the reason behind this incident.

654
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,190
I suggest we print new copies
and send it to the readers

655
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,110
in order to calm them down.

656
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,150
Yi Wen is on a sick leave.

657
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,780
You can report it to us.

658
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,910
According to preliminary statistics,

659
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,859
Most of the pre-sale goods have been
sent to the readers.

660
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:34,710
We've recalled all of the books

661
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,430
that haven't been sent out.

662
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:37,669
Even so,

663
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:39,550
there are 8,000 copies

664
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,070
on their way to the readers.

665
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,390
You guys hear that?

666
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,830
Of course you can print another copy,
but who'll fork out the money?

667
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:47,149
One copy is around 8 to 10 yuan.

668
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:49,990
For 8,000 copies, it costs around
60,000 yuan.

669
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,430
Who'll pay for it?

670
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:53,540
Of course the printing factory
will pay for it.

671
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,109
We've told them time and time again.

672
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,350
We told them the gifts are meant
for the online pre-sale edition.

673
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,629
They were the ones who made the blunder.

674
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:00,830
Of course they need to
be responsible for it.

675
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,149
This is a breach of contract.

676
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,750
We've been working together with the
printing factory for so many years.

677
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,470
Next,

678
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,390
we need to work together with them
for the photo albums

679
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,669
and coloured comic for Role Playing Game.

680
00:35:10,669 --> 00:35:11,550
If we fall out with them

681
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,070
at this crucial moment,

682
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,629
that means we need to find

683
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:17,589
another printing factory which can
match our standards.

684
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:19,430
If we have to let go of
the projects in our hand

685
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,190
because of this incident,

686
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,910
we will incur a big loss.

687
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,950
Wait.

688
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,430
Why do I think

689
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,390
you're trying to speak up for the
printing factory?

690
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,860
You don't want to compensate them?
What about their feelings?

691
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,590
For this kind of matter,

692
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,260
we need to make it sound less serious.

693
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,270
I think our current readers

694
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,100
aren't that hard to deal with,

695
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,470
am I right?

696
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,670
I think they're

697
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,710
giving us such a huge reaction

698
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,230
because they want us

699
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,030
to give them an explanation.

700
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,230
That means

701
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,950
you want someone to be the scapegoat then?

702
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,190
Who will be the scapegoat?

703
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,150
For this,

704
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,190
I think Chu Li will
need to be the scapegoat.

705
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,070
Managing editor,

706
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,590
as the name implies,
she's the one managing it.

707
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,420
If you visit the printing factory

708
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,510
as frequent as you could,

709
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,790
I'm sure they won't have time

710
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,820
to commit such stupid mistakes.

711
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,660
But Chu Li has been frequenting the
printing factory as often as she could.

712
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,550
She would've stayed there
if she could do so.

713
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,950
Now, all the readers

714
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,870
are scolding Ms Suo Heng
on her Weibo account.

715
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,910
They said that they want to boycott them
because she's a liar.

716
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,470
They said she didn't give them

717
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,710
the free gifts she promised to give.

718
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,270
The person who made the blunder
is hiding behind the scene

719
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,740
while my editor needs to take the blame?

720
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,710
I don't agree with that.

721
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,790
I told you already. Chu Li is
the managing editor for the book.

722
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,550
It's logical for her to
admit her mistakes.

723
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,390
How could you say
I'm making her our scapegoat?

724
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,350
I believe Director Yang

725
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,470
would do the same as well,

726
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,030
am I right, Mr Liang?

727
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,230
Fine.

728
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,830
I'll shoulder the responsibility.

729
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,550
Because I don't want my author
to be disheartened.

730
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,870
I don't want her readers
to be disappointed.

731
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,470
This isn't their fault.

732
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,110
But I hope

733
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,590
the circulation department can
make the order by today.

734
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,150
Chu Li

735
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,870
will be suspended for now.

736
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,710
Suspended?

737
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,750
That punishment is too much.

738
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,380
Do you have a better idea?

739
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,710
I'm the chief editor here.
Did I agree to that?

740
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,510
Did Mr Xia agree to that?

741
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,990
She's lucky that she's just suspended.

742
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,310
Now,

743
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,380
we can't afford to fall out
with the printing factory.

744
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,990
Yuan Yue Publishing House

745
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,950
has to pay for all of our loss.

746
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,270
She's just suspended.

747
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,790
We would've sacked her
if she was someone else.

748
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,790
If Chu Li was the reason behind our loss,

749
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,590
I will be the first

750
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,270
to kick her out.

751
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,190
The problem is she's not responsible
for this mistake.

752
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,030
Why must she shoulder the blame?

753
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,830
It's an order from Director Yang.

754
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,350
Take a look yourself.

755
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,020
As for the period for her suspension,

756
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,230
we'll talk about it next time.

757
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,990
Are you guys done finding your scapegoat?

758
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,870
Mr Zhou Chuan, why are you here?

759
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,390
Deputy Editor Miao,

760
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,950
what's that under your feet?

761
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,470
There's nothing under my feet.

762
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,270
Oh, I understand now.

763
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,990
It's your repulsive character.

764
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,070
Since she's suspended,

765
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,350
I can take her away then.

766
00:38:54,330 --> 00:39:00,090
[Yuan Yue Publishing House]

767
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,590
You're not allowed to cry.

768
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,510
You're just suspended!

769
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,470
Let's just treat it as a break then.

770
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,470
The key is I don't know
when my suspension will end.

771
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,900
I think I'm going to be sacked soon.

772
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,350
So what if you're sacked?

773
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,350
It's fine, I can support you.

774
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,500
I don't want you to support me.

775
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,390
I want to do my work.

776
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,950
I just want to be a good editor.

777
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,070
Alright, you can be an editor
all you like.

778
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,180
You're the best editor

779
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,550
in the world.

780
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,550
Why is this happening?

781
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,150
This is so unfair!

782
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,630
I'm leaving
Yuan Yue Publishing House already.

783
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,030
Why should Yuan Yue Publishing House
cover their own loss?

784
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,750
Is it because they want to
maintain a good relationship

785
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,030
with the printing factory?

786
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,870
It's fine.

787
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,780
Let's think of a solution together.

788
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,070
Stop crying, okay?

789
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,790
Stop crying.

790
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,790
I'll be there after two hours.

791
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,110
Mr Liang.

792
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,990
Are you satisfied with the result?

793
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,910
What do you mean?

794
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,310
You've been here for more than 10 years.

795
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,710
I don't believe that

796
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,220
you're satisfied

797
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,390
for letting Yuan Yue Publishing House
cover for our own loss.

798
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,990
All of us know this deep down.

799
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,030
For this matter,

800
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,750
at most, Chu Li can be blamed
for her negligence.

801
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,870
If she's able to shoulder the blame,

802
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,630
no problem, just let her bear the blame.

803
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,510
The problem is, she may appear
to be responsible for it,

804
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,150
but Yuan Yue Publishing House is the one
who's taking all of the blame.

805
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,470
No matter if it's money
or people's opinions,

806
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,070
in the end, Yuan Yue Publishing House

807
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,340
will be the one at a disadvantage.

808
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,070
Yes.

809
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,910
But the solution is already out.

810
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,910
It's useless for you to say that.

811
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,820
Have you ever thought of

812
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,990
whether Miao

813
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,430
is truly trying to help
Yuan Yue Publishing House?

814
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,550
Or is he just trying to chase Chu Li away?

815
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,910
Are you sure that

816
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,950
you want to help the
current Miao Jian Ping?

817
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,270
Chief Editor Yu.

818
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,510
Suo Heng? Why are you here?

819
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,200
I saw the official website's announcement.

820
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,190
Why was Chu Li
suspended from her position?

821
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,110
You haven't been eating well lately.

822
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,190
You should eat up.

823
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,030
Later, we'll think of a solution together.

824
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,030
I deserved it.

825
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,070
This wouldn't have happened

826
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,270
if I went to the printing factory

827
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,030
instead of calling them.

828
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,670
I've let down Ms Suo Heng.

829
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,270
The printing factory is in the wrong here.

830
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,510
You did nothing wrong.

831
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,470
You're the best editor I've ever seen.

832
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,070
How could you know that

833
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,830
when you've barely even seen any editors?

834
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,150
You didn't speak in that tone

835
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,950
when you first became my editor.

836
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,350
[Chu Li,]

837
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,240
[Flying Elephant]

838
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,340
[Ms Suo Heng posted a post for you.]

839
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,550
[Take a look.]

840
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,510
Finish your meal first.

841
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,910
No, return it to me.

842
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,880
[The author, Suo Heng]

843
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,100
[I have]

844
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,540
[always been a weak person]

845
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,790
[who doesn't know how to
stand up for myself.]

846
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,150
[This is my first time doing this.]

847
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,670
[I feel that I need to speak up for her.]

848
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,950
[My editor, Chu Li,]

849
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,100
[she was the only one who didn't
give up on me]

850
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,030
[when I was in despair.]

851
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,590
[She was the one who rushed to protect me]

852
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,430
[from anything.]

853
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,030
[She's a person who will
sacrifice herself]

854
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,790
[in order to protect the writers.]

855
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,150
[Not only is she my editor,]

856
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,190
[she's an important friend
of mine as well.]

857
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,110
[So,]

858
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,620
[please, everyone, stop attacking her.]

859
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,940
[Because you guys don't know]

860
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,230
[how big of a chivalrous fool she is.]

861
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,870
It's fine.

862
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,870
Everything will be over eventually.
