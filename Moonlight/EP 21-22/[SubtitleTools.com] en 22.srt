[Episode 22]

4
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,750
You're done

5
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,789
showing Mr Zhou Chuan around?

6
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,070
Why is your face red?

7
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,509
I...

8
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,780
It... It's hot in here.

9
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,509
Hot?

10
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,870
Mr Zhou Chuan.

11
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,870
We don't have a vacant desk right now.

12
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,230
How about that corner?

13
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,780
Will it do?

14
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,150
Chu Li is my editor.

15
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,750
I want to learn from her.

16
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,310
-I'm thinking of sitting closer to her.
-In that case,

17
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,310
Mr Zhou Chuan, you can sit here.

18
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,990
Mr Zhou Chuan won't let his reader

19
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,310
move to another desk.

20
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,590
She's right.

21
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,790
Ah Xiang, you don't have to
move to another desk.

22
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,350
By the way,
what were you doing over there just now?

23
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,470
Mr Zhou Chuan.

24
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,470
I was transferring a fish.

25
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,470
Our company has a custom.

26
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,550
Whenever a newcomer comes in,

27
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,430
we'll add a fish into the aquarium.

28
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,470
This welcoming ritual is

29
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,870
pretty novel.

30
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,750
Why don't I sit over there?

31
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,430
Can I, Chief Editor Yu?

32
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,070
No problem.

33
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,430
As you wish.

34
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,150
In that case, make sure Mr Zhou Chuan
is well taken care of.

35
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,390
I need to attend a meeting.

36
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,030
At your editorial department just now,

37
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,230
I took a glance at the shelves

38
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,430
with editor names on them.

39
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,590
If it weren't for the Book of Luo He God,

40
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,870
your shelf must have been

41
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,270
the shabbiest one among all.

42
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,670
Why didn't you adhere to
what we have discussed?

43
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,350
Didn't we agree that we have to
maintain a little distance?

44
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,950
We are in fact maintaining

45
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,110
this little distance now.

46
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,340
I gave it another thought.

47
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,100
We've been working closely for so long,

48
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,270
but now we're suddenly like strangers
after coming into the office.

49
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,060
Don't you think it's weird?

50
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,830
That does make some sense.

51
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,140
What is this?

52
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,630
Mr Zhou Chuan.

53
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,630
This is your assignment today.

54
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,750
You have to go to the reception area

55
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,110
to receive contributors
who came to submit their manuscripts.

56
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,500
You just need to write down
the contributor's information

57
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,510
into this record book.

58
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,950
I'm not doing this.

59
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,590
You said you want to learn from me.

60
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,870
But you refused the first assignment

61
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,860
that I planned for you today?

62
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,790
Mr Zhou Chuan.

63
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,940
Do you know why you are here?

64
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,110
Mr Zhou Chuan, you can do it.

65
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,430
You can do it.

66
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,190
Chu Li.

67
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,470
Come to my office.

68
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,790
Have a seat.

69
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,870
Have you read the new book

70
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,270
written by Yun Fei from Xin Dun Books?

71
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,620
I just finished reading it last night.

72
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,510
The ending was a bit hasty.

73
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,790
We just had a long meeting.

74
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,190
Liang Chong Lang

75
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,150
made a big fuss out of

76
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,430
Yun Fei's new work, The Dogtail Mink.

77
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,110
He said the sales of novels
by a few suspense authors

78
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,150
are underperforming lately.

79
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,190
He also said that

80
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,110
when our official platform

81
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,470
released news about our collaboration

82
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,470
with Mr Jiang Yu Cheng,

83
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,510
the response was ordinary.

84
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,670
Hence,

85
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,500
he suggested that

86
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,820
we defer our collaboration plan
with Mr Jiang Yu Cheng

87
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,340
and let Miao's Role Playing Game
publish his autobiography first.

88
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,630
How can we do that?

89
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,110
Isn't the publication date fixed?

90
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,430
What will Mr Jiang think of this?

91
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,190
Besides, we don't know how long
this will be deferred.

92
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,110
Mr Jiang can't afford to wait.

93
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,990
Liang Chong Lang also
mentioned another thing.

94
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,750
Publication date of Mr Jiang Yu Cheng's
book, The Disappearing Amusement Park

95
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,910
might clash with Huang Quan Inn,

96
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,550
Mr Zhou Chuan's book.

97
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,470
He's afraid it won't stand a chance.

98
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,870
Has big boss agreed?

99
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,540
Mr Xia knew

100
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,350
Jiang Yu Cheng's last two books
did not do well.

101
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,470
This new one is especially critical.

102
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,030
So he insisted that
it must be published first.

103
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,710
The top management

104
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,070
has not expressed their stand on this.

105
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,310
After all, this is a competition
with Xin Dun Books.

106
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,990
From the sales of
Book of Luo He God previously,

107
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,380
the difference is clear.

108
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,110
And we can see that

109
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,070
the top management is worried
about the previous sales performance

110
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,900
of Jiang Yu Cheng's books.

111
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,870
If an author fails
three times consequently,

112
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,510
it'd be hard for him to make a comeback.

113
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,110
Though this is just
a jest of the industry,

114
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,190
But

115
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,950
all eyes are on the book now.

116
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,590
We have to find a way

117
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,270
so that all major dealers
and the top management

118
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,470
can feel confident about it.

119
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,130
[The Disappearing Amusement Park, Chapter 3]

120
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,510
[Mr Zhou Chuan.]

121
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,110
[What time is it?
Why are you not sleeping yet?]

122
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,830
[Can you think of your health?]

123
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,910
[Quick. Go to bed now.]

124
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,310
[You just gave me a scare.]

125
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,350
[You call that thinking of my health?]

126
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,000
[Moonlight]

127
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,990
[You're reading Moonlight?]

128
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,230
[Didn't your instalment just ended?]

129
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,470
[Are you reading Mr Jiang's]

130
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,230
[The Disappearing Amusement Park?]

131
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,830
[How is it?]

132
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,630
[Isn't it surprisingly good?]

133
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,390
[I was thinking.]

134
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,270
[After the publication of this book,]

135
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,780
[you can hold a book signing session.]

136
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,070
[He has never gone public.]

137
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,110
[So this can be a huge gimmick]

138
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,630
[to boost his popularity.]

139
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,270
Mr Zhou Chuan suggested previously

140
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,950
that Mr Jiang can hold
a book signing session.

141
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,950
Since he has never gone public,

142
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,070
by making an appearance,

143
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,500
it'll definitely attract many readers

144
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,150
to come see him in person.

145
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,140
If this is part of the publication plan

146
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,510
for pre-launch publicity,

147
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,150
I would suggest he hold

148
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,830
a suspense film seminar.

149
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,230
Mr Jiang has been reviewing

150
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,230
suspense films online.

151
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,790
Moreover, his viewpoint is very unique.

152
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,230
Many readers urged him to

153
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,710
publish a movie review collection.

154
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,350
This is a good idea.

155
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,790
Immediately work on it.

156
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,030
Ask Mr Jiang for his opinion.

157
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,380
We're running out of time.

158
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,190
Alright.

159
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,430
I'll talk to him.

160
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,270
Good.

161
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,390
Let me begin then.

162
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,070
The pattering rain

163
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,310
are my tears.

164
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,190
I stand by the window

165
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,350
looking at the afterglow of sunset.

166
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,510
The tiny dust

167
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,870
spilling in from the window

168
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,429
is shattered by time.

169
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:49,070
I wanted to say...

170
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,950
Madam Lin.

171
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,670
You can stop.

172
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,510
Call me Linda.

173
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,470
I think you should find another job.

174
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,910
I'll be honest with you.

175
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,550
Many publishing houses are eyeing

176
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,350
my autobiography now.

177
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,150
But I only like Moonlight.

178
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,550
I like a steady guy like you

179
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,350
to be my

180
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,870
editor.

181
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,310
I hope

182
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,390
you give it a thought.

183
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,580
What I'm trying to say is, you'd better

184
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,190
stop writing

185
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,630
and stop giving us a hard time.

186
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,870
What do you mean?

187
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,710
I...

188
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,230
Listen here.

189
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,270
Everyone who has read my writings
says they are good.

190
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,590
They say I'm an unprecedented talent.

191
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,270
Do you even know what you're doing?

192
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,590
What's your name?

193
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,510
I want to file a complaint.

194
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

195
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,390
You are?

196
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,830
Call me Ms Lin.

197
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,980
That's how authors are addressed
these days.

198
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,740
Hi, Ms Lin.

199
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,430
I'm an editor here.

200
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,990
You can pass your manuscript to me

201
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,270
and I'll pass it to the chief editor.

202
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,430
If there's any news about it,

203
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,350
I'll contact you.

204
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,510
This should be the attitude.

205
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,180
I have two phone numbers

206
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,550
and three email addresses.

207
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,550
But I only have this business card.

208
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,870
Take out your pen to write in down.

209
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,470
Yes, yes.

210
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,510
Your new intern

211
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,430
has looks

212
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,390
but are terrible with words.

213
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,470
Have you written it down?

214
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,310
Yes, yes. It's all written down.

215
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,310
I've written it down, Ms Lin.

216
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,140
I'll contact you if there's news.

217
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,270
Alright then.

218
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,460
A nothing.

219
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,070
You asked me to do this.

220
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,670
It's my mistake.

221
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,430
I forgot.

222
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,510
You're only gentle and kind

223
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,540
for your readers.

224
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,150
You don't have to do this anymore.

225
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,470
This whole morning,

226
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,350
I've experienced a lot of feelings.

227
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,150
You now feel how hard

228
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,550
an editor's job is, don't you?

229
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,950
No.

230
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,300
I rediscover that my level of writing

231
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,310
is absolutely that of a genius.

232
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,700
It's lunch break.

233
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,670
You can go have your lunch.

234
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,990
-I...
-Mr Zhou Chuan.

235
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,630
You've not eaten?

236
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,350
Why don't we all

237
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,310
go for a lunch?

238
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,510
It'll be your welcoming ritual.

239
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,670
No, thanks.

240
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,550
I'm having lunch with my girlfriend.

241
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,540
Your girlfriend is working in this area?

242
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,550
She's not far.

243
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,950
The reason I come to work
at Yuan Yue Publishing House

244
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,350
is to be closer to her.

245
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,990
Lunch break is only one and a half hour.

246
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,150
Mr Zhou Chuan.

247
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,070
Time is very short.

248
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,540
You won't be able to eat anything
if you don't go now.

249
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,350
Go quick.

250
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,350
Just one and a half hour?

251
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,110
I don't know this area.

252
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,430
Can you take me there?

253
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,820
Go then.

254
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,830
Alright.

255
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,630
Let's go.

256
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,660
Let's go.

257
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,030
I just want to hold your hand.

258
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,150
You think I'm a pervert?

259
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,910
It's all red now.

260
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,630
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,780
I'll buy a cold drink so you can use it
to reduce the swell.

262
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,540
Blow it for me.

263
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,750
Why don't you just go to Mount Everest

264
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,750
and blow it from there?

265
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,780
Mr Zhou Chuan.

266
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,910
I'm actually happy you came
to Yuan Yue Publishing House.

267
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,470
But,

268
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,190
Yuan Yue Publishing House

269
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,820
is only 500 metres away.

270
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,070
There're many acquaintances around.

271
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,990
It's best

272
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,510
not to have any physical contact.

273
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,100
Fine.

274
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,950
We'll set Yuan Yue Publishing House
as the centre.

275
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,190
The length of this road is the radius.

276
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,950
How about that?

277
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,950
Let's cross the road.

278
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,390
No.

279
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,390
The radius must be five kilometres.

280
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,980
Why do I feel like I'm at a wet market

281
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,630
negotiating with you?

282
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,230
There're many restaurants over there.

283
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,190
At lunch time,

284
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,310
just pick anyone you like.

285
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,390
I have work outside office.

286
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,470
I'll leave you to it.

287
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,030
What are you doing?

288
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,030
You said

289
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,710
no physical contact.

290
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,270
I want to join you.

291
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,430
You better don't.

292
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,270
I have a work assignment.

293
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,790
Me too.

294
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,710
Since I want to learn from you,

295
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,870
then I'll follow you
whether it's inside or outside office.

296
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,950
Alright then.

297
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,910
This is your idea anyway.

298
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,030
Let's go now.

299
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,260
Keep walking.

300
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,870
Why are you here?

301
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,950
For work of course.

302
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,070
I should be asking you.

303
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:53,830
So?

304
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,350
You're already becoming a clingy pet

305
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,390
that can't let go?

306
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,190
-You...
-Alright now.

307
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,510
Mr Jiang.

308
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,910
Zhou Chuan is interning
at Yuan Yue Publishing House

309
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,550
to collect new ideas for his book.

310
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,430
Coming here with me

311
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,030
is for work too.

312
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,820
The reason I contacted you today

313
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,710
is to see if you're interested to

314
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,870
hold a suspense film seminar.

315
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,030
Seminar?

316
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,830
As pre-launch publicity for
The Disappearing Amusement Park?

317
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,700
I saw that

318
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,870
your official platform has released news

319
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,630
about this book.

320
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,430
But

321
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,470
compared to the response
for this fellow's,

322
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,700
mine is too lukewarm.

323
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,110
You must be worried.

324
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,630
No, no.

325
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,750
Mr Jiang.

326
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,630
You must never use Mr Zhou Chuan

327
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,030
for comparison.

328
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,350
The number of shares for his book is high

329
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,870
only because people were giving him face

330
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,390
and joining in the fun.

331
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,270
I know you meant

332
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,110
to comfort him,

333
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,030
but I just don't feel comfortable

334
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,630
listening to it.

335
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,110
Good advice is always
unpleasant to the ears.

336
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,790
Mr Jiang.

337
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,390
You've been lying low for so long.

338
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,910
This is a great opportunity

339
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,190
to return to the spotlight.

340
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,270
Tell everyone that

341
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,510
the King has returned.
Your new book is coming.

342
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,430
As your reader,

343
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,710
when I imagine about it,

344
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,150
I'm so fired up.

345
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,470
Do you want to

346
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,750
consider it?

347
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,670
I personally

348
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,420
don't object to it.

349
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,670
I simply feel

350
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,830
it's a lot of trouble.

351
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,630
I know.

352
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,420
I always fast-talk you,

353
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,830
like the boy who cries wolf.

354
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,060
But,

355
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,510
I still want to say that

356
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,310
this time, the wolf
is really at the valley.

357
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,230
I know you have high hopes

358
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,230
on this book.

359
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,190
In fact all of us

360
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,230
hope you can turn this around

361
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,380
and make a comeback.

362
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,430
Hence, Mr Jiang,

363
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,110
I really hope you can consider this.

364
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,190
For the sales and the comeback,

365
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,670
some kind of sacrifice is needed.

366
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,070
Mr Jiang.

367
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,180
I will think about it seriously.

368
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,350
Is circulation department

369
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,550
trying to hamper
The Disappearing Amusement Park?

370
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,780
What did you hear?

371
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,300
What I suggested was
a book signing session.

372
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,990
Why is it a seminar now?

373
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,660
Honestly,

374
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,510
to resume Mr Jiang's publication plan,

375
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,990
book signing event is too late.

376
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,310
We plan to generate pre-launch publicity.

377
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,230
But after the talk just now,

378
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,510
I think he might not want it.

379
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,630
Even at his prime,

380
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,510
Jiang Yu Cheng never had
a book signing event.

381
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,620
In that case,

382
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,590
his attitude towards this is same as mine.

383
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,110
We instinctively reject it.

384
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,510
Then why did you suggest it
in the first place?

385
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,220
I just casually mentioned it.

386
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,750
I never thought you'd keep it in mind.

387
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,950
Don't worry.

388
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,790
We have some difference too.

389
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,550
Just that this time,

390
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,430
he really can't fail.

391
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,300
You're doubled-face.

392
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,390
You're deep down worried too.

393
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,630
It also crossed my mind

394
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,220
that I might lose my fame someday too.

395
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,270
Because of one book,
readers feel disappointed

396
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,980
with the author

397
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,150
and forgetting all of it
really is the scariest thing.

398
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,470
An author who has never gone public
appearing at an event

399
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,339
is probably the last gimmick.

400
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,790
Whether he can bounce back to life

401
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,300
will all depend on whether the work

402
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,940
is worthy of being
the final cast of the die.

403
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,030
You also think
The Disappearing Amusement Park

404
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,550
is a worthy final cast of the die?

405
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,270
I didn't say that.

406
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,950
It came out of your mind.

407
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,550
Let me go.

408
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,750
Five kilometres.

409
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,310
What are you doing?

410
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,350
Come here.

411
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,790
Look.

412
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,430
This spot is 5.1 kilometres
from Yuan Yue Publishing House.

413
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,060
Physical contact is allowed.

414
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,030
You're so childish.

415
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,390
I enjoy it.

416
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,270
Just so childish.

417
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,230
Alright, that's the end of
the 0.1 kilometre.

418
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,510
I'll run away.

419
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,810
[The Disappearing Zoo]

420
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,910
[Mr Jiang, about the seminar,]

421
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,480
[Chu Li]

422
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,470
[have you considered it?]

423
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,440
[Jiang Yu Cheng]

424
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,550
[I agree.]

425
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,350
Mr Jiang agreed!

426
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,830
-Really? Let me see.
-Look.

427
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,550
He really did.

428
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,590
That's great.

429
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,070
Thanks, Mr Jiang.

430
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,630
But if you're doing the seminar,

431
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,150
you have to do some preparation.

432
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,870
Remember to buy a suit.

433
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,430
And get your hair styled.

434
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,550
If you're free tomorrow,
why don't I...

435
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,870
I, Zhou Chuan will accompany you.

436
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,030
He's a 30 year-old man.

437
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,420
How can he not know
how to buy a suit and style his hair?

438
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,030
Why do you need to worry about it?

439
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,740
I'll just accompany him tomorrow.

440
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,870
I know.

441
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,470
Among everyone, you're actually
hoping the hardest

442
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,190
for Mr Jiang to make a comeback.

443
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,220
Aren't you?

444
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,470
I'm warning you.

445
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,710
Don't put your heart
all into his seminar.

446
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,270
Where should I put it then?

447
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,190
On me.

448
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,230
I haven't submitted
the outline of my instalment.

449
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,270
You should pay more attention about it.

450
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,590
Then you have to teach me.

451
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,350
How should I do that?

452
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,670
Should I squat in front of your room

453
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,390
and scream at you everyday?

454
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,030
You're going to use the 30 Tenant Rules

455
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,070
to bind me.

456
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,990
It's been a week since you started
at Yuan Yue Publishing House,

457
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,310
but I don't even see a punctuation mark.

458
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,750
Teach me. What should I do?

459
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,390
Why are you giving me a salacious smile?

460
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,390
That's good.

461
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,510
It doesn't matter
if you're happy or angry,

462
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,990
as long as you are looking at me.

463
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,790
Are you serious?

464
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,950
You must have been
severely poisoned by Gu Bai Zhi.

465
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,110
What do you mean suits must be black
for important occasions?

466
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,310
This has nothing to do with Gu Bai Zhi.

467
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,230
This one.

468
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,910
Save it.

469
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,340
Lately there have been a lot of talks
about Yun Fei's book.

470
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,630
Didn't you show her some concern?

471
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,790
Firstly, I don't have a position.

472
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,470
Secondly, I don't know anything about it.

473
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,990
I don't have a reason to show her concern.

474
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,670
I've a question.

475
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,950
Inside your heart,

476
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,990
what does Gu Bai Zhi mean to you?

477
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,550
I'm not at all curious

478
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,030
about your love life.

479
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,150
I just felt that

480
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,430
your relationship with her
seems to have improved.

481
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,670
You can be friends.

482
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,190
But if you're thinking of
getting back together,

483
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,990
I think you should save yourself the pain.

484
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,790
If not, history is just going to
repeat itself.

485
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,190
The why did you let me
send her back that day?

486
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,430
That's because you had your eyes
on the wrong person.

487
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,420
So you're taking revenge on me?

488
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,990
If I want to take revenge on you,

489
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,110
I'll make you wear this.

[Dark Moments, A Suspense Film Seminar
Speaker: Jiang Yu Cheng]

491
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,670
Many readers will be here.

492
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,510
These seats will all be full.

493
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,580
I've never expected that our boss

494
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,100
will hold a seminar in his own bookstore.

495
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,540
Ah Xiang.

496
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,070
Let me help you.

497
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,510
Excuse me, intern.

498
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,030
Can you not

499
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,060
sit here leisurely?

500
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,910
Go do something.

501
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,590
For example, check on Mr Jiang
to see when he'll be here.

502
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,350
I don't need you to tell me.

Get out.

506
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,670
Quick. Get out.

507
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,790
Hurry up.

508
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,830
May I know what the matter is?

509
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,670
Are you Gu Bai Zhi?

[I'm Yun Fei.]

00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,990

00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,070
I'm driving.

525
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,430
I have to cut you off.

526
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,390
I've called the cops.

527
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,150
I'll not take this further
if you leave within three minutes.

528
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,350
Xin Dun Books threatened authors

529
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,630
and forced the publication
of uncompleted stories.

530
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,670
How dare you!

531
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,030
Do you know how much effort

532
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,060
Yun Fei put into this book?

533
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,590
Why are you so irresponsible?

534
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,630
A great book

535
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,790
is ruined just like that.

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,830

-Manuscript withdrawn.

If you have a problem,
please submit your feedback online.

539
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,990
Authors are not movie stars.

540
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,510
Don't act like a fan club.

541
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,110
You oppressed authors with ill intention

542
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,350
and cheated the money of book fans.

543
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,150
We have the right to voice out.

544
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,190
That's right.

545
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,430
I'll look into the matter.

546
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,830
You can't leave.

547
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,750
What are you doing?

548
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,350
-Give us an answer.
-Let go.

549
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,940
You there. What are you doing?

550
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,910
Are you out of your mind?

551
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,710
Why did you get out of your car?

552
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,310
I didn't expect them to get so worked up.

553
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,910
Are you alright?

554
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,870
Let's get out of here.

-You can't leave.

00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,110
Jiang Yu Cheng, wake up.

559
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,750
Jiang Yu Cheng.

560
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,900
I'm sorry.

561
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,620
Didn't you say he's near?

562
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,870
It's been an hour.

563
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,950
Where is he?

564
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,630
Something happened.

565
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,390
What?

566
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,510
He didn't pick up.
Something must have happened.

567
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,390
I'll call again.

568
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,430
Chu Li.

569
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,670
Go with the backup plan.

570
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,830
Keep calling him, Mr Zhou Chuan.

571
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,750
And...

572
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,350
Who's the person-in-charge of
Mr Jiang Yu Cheng's book fans?

573
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,030
I'll talk to her.

574
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,790
I'll take you to her.

575
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,670
Alright.

576
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,420
Let's go.

577
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,910
Hello?
Jiang Yu Cheng, where are you?

578
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,750
Gu Bai Zhi?

579
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,870
Alright.

580
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,020
Alright, I got it.

581
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,830
What did she say?

582
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,980
Gu Bai Zhi

583
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,550
was mobbed by Yun Fei's fans.

584
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,790
Jiang Yu Cheng went to
save the damsel in distress.

585
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,230
As he was helping her,

586
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,190
he ended up in the hospital.

587
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,710
Then this...

588
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,900
He...

589
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,660
Everything will be fine.

590
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,310
I'll go to the hospital to check on him.

591
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,550
You take care of this here.

592
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,740
Alright.

593
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,430
Jiang Yu Cheng.

594
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,220
Are you dead?

595
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,670
You came right on time.

596
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,950
Let's go. I'll get changed.

597
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,620
Take me to the seminar.

598
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,270
You can't do that.

599
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,750
Although externally

600
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,190
your injury doesn't look serious,

601
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,470
you have to be hospitalized
for further observation.

602
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,230
We must make sure there's no concussion.

603
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,470
Concussion?

604
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,310
I won't have a concussion.

605
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,670
I'm very sober.

606
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,030
Your situation

607
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,340
doesn't allow you to move around.

608
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,510
If you're in a hurry,

609
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,630
quickly complete all the required tests.

610
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,710
Once we confirm that you're fine,

611
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,910
you can leave.

612
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,590
Alright.

613
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,910
Thank you, Doctor.

614
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,030
Thank you.

615
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,350
Did you hear that?

616
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,190
The doctor said you should stay put.

617
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,310
Lie down now.

618
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,510
I told you.

619
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,510
I'm fine. I'll be good after a while.

620
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,990
Is the book important?
Or your life?

621
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,990
Besides, didn't Yuan Yue Publishing House

622
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,030
already decide to
defer your publication plan?

623
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,510
So they can let Role-Playing Game
publish first.

624
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,710
This is just a seminar.

625
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,060
It won't make them come back to life.

626
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,030
Gu Bai Zhi.

627
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,910
You have no business here anymore.

628
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,790
Please go now.

629
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,390
We don't want to
obstruct your path to success.

630
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,950
What she just said

631
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,500
about the deferral
of the publication plan,

632
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,030
is it true?

633
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,100
You knew about it?

634
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,870
I...

635
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,550
You hid this from him?

636
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,310
I don't know anything.

637
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,070
All I know is

638
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,420
Chu Li is now tirelessly

639
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,950
trying to handle your matter.

640
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,060
I also didn't expect that

641
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,110
Yun Fei's readers will be this aggressive.

642
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,470
This is just great.

643
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,150
Jiang Yu Cheng saved
the damsel in distress

644
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,030
and screw up his own business.

645
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,510
Miss Bei, it's me.

646
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,470
Is Director Lu free for a meet-up?

647
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,870
I have a really good story here

648
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,310
to recommend to him.

649
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,590
It's called
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

650
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,940
Have you read it?

651
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,150
If he has no time for a meeting,

652
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,430
I can pay him a visit.

653
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,190
Alright. I'll wait for your call.

654
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,990
Thanks, Miss Bei.

[Heal The Wounded, Save The Dying]

656
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,470
Listen.

657
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,070
This is an honours pennant

658
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,190
specially commissioned
by a reader of Mr Jiang.

659
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,110
Is that so?

660
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,670
It must be you.

661
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,510
Am I not the top reader of Mr Jiang?

662
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,500
Mr Jiang, don't worry.

663
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,580
After the fans heard our explanation

664
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,900
and read the official statement
from Yuan Yue Publishing House,

665
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,510
they expressed their understanding.

666
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,300
Our Moonlight editorial team
also promised them

667
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,310
that attendees of today's seminar

668
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,110
will be given a free copy each

669
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,140
of your new book after it is published.

670
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,150
That is very generous.

671
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,590
I really want to see

672
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,590
how impressive the content is.

673
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,390
Mr Jiang

674
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,950
on his way to the book signing session,

675
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,790
did a good deed

676
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,950
by helping a stranger

677
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,630
who was trapped in the car.

678
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,630
In the end, he sacrificed himself
to save the stranger.

679
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,510
He got injured and had to be taken
to the hospital.

680
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,030
Well, that is all facts.

681
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,830
Your official Weibo

682
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,590
also posted a photo
of the honours pennant.

683
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,470
The caption says

684
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,750
readers present this honours pennant

685
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,620
and vow to stay loyal forever.

00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,710
I see the comments below

688
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,510
are all in support of this.

689
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,550
The crisis management is a success.

690
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,710
Thank you. It's our duty.

691
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,630
You had to handle my mess.

692
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,990
I've really troubled you.

693
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,230
Mr Jiang.

694
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,310
We have come out with a plan.

695
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,350
Please have a look...

696
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,350
Chu Li.

697
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,350
Can you honestly tell me something?

698
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,750
About the seminar,

699
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,310
is it organized

700
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,030
so that The Disappearing Amusement Park
can be published as planned?

701
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,390
I'm sorry, Mr Jiang.

702
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,830
I didn't tell you about it.

703
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,550
Tomorrow,

704
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,430
I'll terminate the contract with
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

705
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,020
As for your promise of free copy
to fans today,

706
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,220
I'll pay for them personally
when the book is published.

707
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,100
Mr Jiang.

708
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,830
People say that

709
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,990
I have a good temper.

710
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,380
They say

711
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,790
I'm a yes man.

712
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,270
I always cooperate with
online merchants and bookstores,

713
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,870
sharing posts of book sales.

714
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,550
Publishing companies asked me to join

715
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,270
the bundle sales with books that sells

716
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,670
but have poor content.

717
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,870
I agreed with a smile.

718
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,270
Even if I was reluctant,

719
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,190
I still did it.

720
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,510
It's all because I'm an

721
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,430
outdated author who has fallen
from the tip of the pyramid.

722
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,870
Hence,

723
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,630
The Disappearing Amusement Park

724
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,470
is my last chance.

725
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,100
I understand.

726
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,510
Hence I'll work really hard to make sure

727
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,190
the book is launched this year.

728
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,510
Work hard...

729
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,390
I didn't expect

730
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,270
to fall this low.

731
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,390
Chu Li, since your publishing company

732
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,270
has no confidence in my work,

733
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,300
let's not waste the time of both parties.

734
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,750
No, we're confident.

735
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,140
It's just that
the circulation department is worried...

736
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,340
That's just part of the reason.

737
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,350
You're more worried that

738
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,310
my book will clash dates with
Zhou Chuan's Huang Quan Inn.

739
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,790
Mr Jiang is too smart to a painful extent.

740
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,910
Was he like this when he was younger?

741
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,990
He was more arrogant than me.

742
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,710
Just that the passing years has turned him

743
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,750
into a quiet man.

744
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,390
I can't give up.

745
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,500
I must publish this book for him.

746
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,190
I must witness his glorious return

747
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,710
to the peak of the pyramid.

748
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,220
All those who look down on him

749
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,590
will be speechless.

750
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,590
You're shouting slogans again?

751
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,510
Dealing with someone like him,

752
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,230
you have to let your actions
do the talking.

753
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,910
Do you have a plan in mind?

754
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,390
Gu Bai Zhi tried to recommend him

755
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,390
to top-grossing movie director, Li Yu.

756
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,830
That's a good plan.

757
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,910
Recommend Mr Jiang's story to

758
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,550
top directors like Li Yu.

759
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,990
Then the publishing house
will have to publish

760
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,310
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

761
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,830
But Jiang Yu Cheng harshly rejected Li Yu.

762
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,350
I don't think they have a chance now.

763
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,430
Then...

764
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,870
Can we find other directors?

765
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,070
Directors like Li Yu

766
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,550
is very rare.

767
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,150
Besides, they won't see you.

768
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,270
But we can try this person though.

769
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,310
Are you sure she'll come?

770
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,260
If she doesn't, Jiang Yu Cheng will have
sacrificed for nothing.

771
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,150
This is about Jiang Yu Cheng?

772
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,670
Yes. I...

773
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,270
I'll talk to you.
But you...

774
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,700
Xiao Niao.

775
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,110
The photocopy of
Yi Shui Han's autobiography

776
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,550
will come in today.

777
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,980
So you work on it.
They want it really urgently.

778
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,670
But it's fine.

779
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,390
There are more pictures

780
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,350
than words.

781
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,270
You still have to follow it closely.

782
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,830
Try to pass it to me this week.

783
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,910
He can get it published with priority?

784
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,590
Yes. As long as

785
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,950
all top management sign the deal today,

786
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,110
it can be published.

787
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,430
You have to pass it to me quick.

788
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,630
Alright, Deputy Chief Editor.

789
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,540
Chu Li.

790
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,740
I'm really sorry.

791
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,820
The publication plan of
Jiang Yu Cheng's book

792
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,470
will have to give way to Yi Shui Han.

793
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,790
The crisis at the seminar yesterday

794
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,510
is managed in time,

795
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,350
but we can't do much about it.

796
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,389
The upper management

797
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,830
has their own opinions.

798
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,230
Like I always say,

799
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,830
what is yours will be yours.

800
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,070
If it's not yours, it's no use fighting.

801
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,070
-Good morning, Mr Xia.
-Good morning, Mr Xia.

806
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,469
Come to my office.

807
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,310
Alright, Mr Xia.

808
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,870
That's what happened.

809
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,750
Mr Jiang would never miss the seminar

810
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,909
without reasons.

811
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:49,110
Moreover, those who came were his readers.

812
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,389
Alright, alright.

813
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,150
I got it.

814
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,989
Mr Xia, is it confirmed that

815
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,670
Yi Shui Han's book will be
given priority for publication?

816
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,870
There's no chance to turn this around?

817
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,950
The upper management

818
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,350
has all agreed.

819
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,830
The documents

820
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,990
will come in today.

821
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,270
This evening?

822
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,350
Mr Xia.

823
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,150
Can you give me one more day?

824
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,670
Just one day will do.

825
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,190
This evening

826
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,510
I don't think I'll be in the office.

827
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,230
I'll only get to come back

828
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,860
tomorrow evening

829
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,060
to sign that document.

830
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,950
Thank you, Mr Xia.

831
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,630
Jiang Yu Cheng.

832
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,630
You're in.

833
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,110
Listen carefully.
I only say it once.

834
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,230
Chu Li wants me to tell you this.

835
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,270
Give her one more day.

836
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,710
She'll make sure your book
is published as planned.

837
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,590
If she failed,

838
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,630
the problem is her ability.

839
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,310
When you terminate the contract

840
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,310
and sign with another company,

841
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,550
she will have no complaints or regrets.

842
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,220
Alright. I'm done.

843
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,870
Goodbye.

844
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,030
Wait.

845
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,110
But I saw Yi Shui Han
posted the news online

846
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,310
that his autobiography will be published.

847
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,710
Is it all confirmed?

848
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,860
Why did you follow that account?

849
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,470
Can you follow account with quality news?

850
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,700
I don't know anyway.

851
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,950
I only know that
if Chu Li wants me to trust her,

852
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,070
I'll trust her.

853
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,670
But seriously,

854
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,470
terminating the contract
with Yuan Yue Publishing House now

855
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,470
is really not a smart move.

856
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,310
It'll only rage another storm.

857
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,670
My old man has always thought that

858
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,150
I'm not as good as you.

859
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,380
But on some matters,
I'm really not convinced.

860
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,630
I know.

861
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,900
You're now doing better than me,

862
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,390
but I'm still that legendary

864
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,300
Then let's call it a match.

865
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,940
Trust Chu Li. She'll make sure your book

866
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,260
is published according to plan.

867
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,750
When that time comes,
the match will be real.

868
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,830
Alright. Tell Chu Li

869
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,030
I'll wait for her.

870
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,270
Why am I always the messenger?

871
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,590
I'll send voice mail.

872
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,030
I'm leaving. Goodbye.

Including the extra volumes that were
specially written for publication.

881
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,910
I've printed them into a booklet.

I'll show him the digital copy.

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,990
Digital copies may be convenient.

885

But physical book

886
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,190
feels good to hold.

887

Hope we can succeed today

00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,190

to buy the movie rights for

on par with Director Li Yu.

No wonder his works
continuously received big awards.

he'll definitely want it.

929
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,750
Chief Director Gu, if you're tired,

930
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,750
I can drive.

931
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,910
I have a driving license.

932
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,070
Thanks for offering.

933
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,750
A driver who has a license
but never been on the road.

934
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,150
I don't want to

935
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,110
risk our lives.

936
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,230
With our current speed,

937
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,990
how long will it take?

938
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,630
Half an hour if it is smooth.

939
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,990
Great. We'll be in time.

940
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,310
Looks like the heavens
is watching over Mr Jiang.

941
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,750
What happened?

942
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,430
We have a flat tyre.

943
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,990
What?

944
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,980
What should we do?

945
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,430
Let's call the helpline.

946
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,710
We don't have time for that.

947
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,630
Use the spare tyre.

948
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,110
Let me do it. Let me do it.

949
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,110
You use your driving skill.
I'll use my strength.

950
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,790
Don't act tough.

951
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,630
You'll turn into
the guy you're looking for.

952
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,910
Let me do it.

953
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,470
I think we should do it together.

954
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,430
Alright.

955
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,990
Amazing.

956
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,190
We can still make it.

957
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,150
We'll reach in five minutes.

958
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,510
Miss Bei, we'll reach
Linzhou Airport very soon.

959
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,270
Where are you?

960
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,150
[We've passed the security checks.]

961
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,990
[Why don't we reschedule
the meeting to next month?]

962
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,350
Alright. Have a safe flight.

963
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,950
They've entered the boarding area?

964
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,230
What should we do?

965
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,910
We won't make it
if we don't do this today.

966
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,870
I've waited for Chu Li.

967
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,150
One day.

968
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,420
24 hours.

969
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,150
If she asked you to wait for a day,

970
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,270
why can't you wait for a second day?

971
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,670
That idiot is still rushing about for you.

972
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,990
You get her to come back then.

973
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,750
Don't tire herself out.

974
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,590
My heart aches for her too.

975
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,990
Don't you dare.

976
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,110
Mr Jiang Yu Cheng.

977
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,310
Thank you for coming in today.

978
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,990
I know you're here

979
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,830
to talk about the contract termination.

980
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,510
We're really sorry

981
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,470
that our plan affected you.

982
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,190
I can understand

983
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,510
your concerns.

984
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,670
Hence I won't make it hard on you

985
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,470
about the contract termination.

986
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,830
Before we terminate our contract,

987
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,270
I want you to meet someone.

988
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,030
Let's not do this.

989
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,990
I've made up my mind.

990
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,700
Chief Editor Yu, Director Lu is here.

991
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,150
Please come in, Director Lu.

992
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,070
I trust you know that

993
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,980
this is the famous Director Lu Fang.

994
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,150
Hi, Director Lu Fang.

995
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,110
It's an honour to meet you.

996
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,070
Same here.

997
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,310
We'll leave you two to discuss further.

998
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,110
Please take a seat, Director Lu.

999
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,190
You too.

1000
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,660
Mr Jiang.

1001
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,670
I finally get to meet you in person.

1002
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,510
Why do you suddenly have a cold?

1003
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,990
You didn't come home the whole night.

1004
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,590
Well...

1005
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,190
I was too exhausted last night.

1006
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:20,030
Thank you for your concern, Mr Zhou Chuan.

1007
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,710
What are you typing?

1008
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,190
An official publication statement

1009
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,830
of The Disappearing Amusement Park

1010
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,270
on our official platform.

1011
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,470
Didn't we confirm that we'll publish

1012
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,390
Yi Shui Han's book first?

1013
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,430
Why are we changing again?

1014
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,870
I'm sorry, Deputy Editor Miao.

1015
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,950
Director Lu Fang has decided
to make a film

1016
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,270
for The Disappearing Amusement Park.

1017
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,150
He just signed the film rights
licensing agreement with Mr Jiang.

1018
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,510
Shooting is estimated
to be within this year.

1019
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,060
Mr Xia has told the upper management

1020
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,430
about this great news.

1021
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,830
The upper management wants

1022
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:53,310
this book to be published with priority.

1023
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:55,510
Hence, if it is not yours,

1024
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,950
it's no use fighting.

1025
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,550
Chu Li, do you really think

1026
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,030
I can't do anything about you?

1027
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,950
What do you want to do?

1028
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:06,540
What happened?

1029
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,830
Why are you standing here?

1030
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,350
I feel so sleepy.

1031
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,460
I'm going to get some coffee.
