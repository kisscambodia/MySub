[Episode 15]

4
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,870
When you told me to
quit the publishing house

5
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,590
and focus on surviving,

6
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,789
I didn't listen to you as well.

7
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,070
Yeah, since when have you
ever listened to me?

8
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,550
[Oh no.]

9
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,430
[That's what Mr Fox had said before.]

10
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,509
Since when have I told you that?

11
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:01,750
We were strangers

12
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,259
before you came into the industry, right?

13
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,110
If we knew each other before,

14
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,910
I would've told you to give up
being an editor.

15
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,710
Look at you right now.

16
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,550
You can't even afford to pay a fine.

17
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,870
Who would've thought that

18
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,990
the wealthy Mr Zhou Chuan

19
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,670
would hold it against me
for a meagre fine?

20
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,350
There's hot water in the pot.

21
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,390
Why are you drinking cold water?

22
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,470
Hello, Sister?

23
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,630
You've returned home?

24
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,190
We can talk about Huang Quan Inn later.

25
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,980
You can go and annoy your Jiang Yu Cheng.

26
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,990
I'll hang up now. Goodbye.

27
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,990
You should return now.

28
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,150
It's been tough on you.

29
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,190
I've wasted two hours

30
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,150
of your writing time.

31
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,030
How could it be a waste of my time

32
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,390
when I'm together with you?

33
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,670
I read the ending you wrote
while I was on the plane.

34
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,150
You need to change it according to
what we've discussed.

35
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,870
Let me carry it.

36
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,630
Sister, I know now.

37
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,590
After I'm done helping you out,

38
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,710
I'll return and write immediately.

39
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,910
Don't worry, I won't lose.

Sister,

45
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,660
I've put your things into your room.

We used them as our bookmarks
when we were young, right?

53
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,150

You don't like it?

56
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,670
Forget about it then. I thought
it could serve as a memento.

love comes upon once in your life?

76
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,030
I've thought about it many times.

77
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,390
One day, when I'm old,

78
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,910
there's someone who would
still hold my hand.

79
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,470
We would take a walk in the park together.

80
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,630
As the breeze passes by us,

81
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,830
the sun

82
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,990
will shine on us.

83
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,310
Birds will chirp on the trees.

84
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,590
No matter how many times I think about it,

85
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,030
Jiang Yu Cheng was always
the one on my mind.

86
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,030
He will still make you sad.

87
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,590
I know that.

88
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,030
But I don't know how to give up

89
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,350
on that idealistic image of mine.

90
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:54,990
Sister.

91
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,830
Go back now.

92
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,390
I want to be alone.

93
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,790
I have something to discuss with you.

94
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,030
We need to determine who will cook
and who will do the work.

95
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,630
Why don't you determine who will cook
and who will eat the food?

96
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,750
You're the one eating.

97
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,830
That's a given.

98
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,380
Do you think this is enough?

99
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,470
That's too much.

100
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,390
You can wash

101
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,460
all of our cooking utensils
with that amount.

102
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,030
Do you even know how to wash dishes?

103
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,980
Use this.

104
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,950
The metal sponge is used to clean pots.

105
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,430
Isn't all of it the same?

106
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,540
Mr Zhou Chuan,

107
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,270
do you have a smurf account?

108
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,790
[Here she comes again.]

109
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,030
What smurf account?

110
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,780
I don't even have enough time
to handle my main account.

111
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,510
I haven't told you what kind of
smurf account I'm talking about.

112
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,030
I don't have any smurf account.

113
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,549
Weibo, WeChat, QQ, none of them.

114
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,830
Why are you asking me this?

115
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,950
Nothing. It's just a random question.

116
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,900
Mr Zhou Chuan,

117
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,540
I discovered something interesting.

118
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,230
What is it?

119
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,750
For every ending of your story,

120
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,670
you'll put five ellipses at the back.

121
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,070
Is that a habit of yours?

122
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,870
Can't I do so?

123
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,190
Of course you can. It's just that

124
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,190
one of my online friend
has the same habit as you.

125
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,430
Plenty of people
have the same habit, you know?

126
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,550
So, are all of them your online friends?

127
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,510
But even the tone you're using
is the same as him.

128
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,420
Especially when
you're criticizing Mr Jiang.

129
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,620
He's bothering Jiang Yu Cheng as well?

130
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,820
You can introduce him to me then.

131
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,270
What exactly are you trying to say?

132
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,350
Mr Zhou Chuan,

133
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,870
you're Mr Fox, right?

134
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,790
Mr Fox?

135
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,310
Who is it?

136
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,300
It's the Little Zhou Chuan
I've told you about.

137
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,230
You mean the one who's just like me?

138
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,630
You must be delusional.

139
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,270
You're saying that I'm Mr Fox
just because of the way I write?

140
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,710
Not just that,

141
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,630
the way you criticize people

142
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,910
is exactly the same as him.

143
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,350
You two are curious about
the same thing as well.

144
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,700
Just like

145
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,020
the entries for the
Interactive Cultural Festival.

146
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,430
Now, you're using the tone
of my writing as evidence?

147
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,990
You should listen to yourself.
It's absurd.

148
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,510
I'm one of the authors for
the Interactive Cultural Festival.

149
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,430
Isn't it normal for me

150
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,990
to care about the amount of entries?

151
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,550
As for that Mr Fox,

152
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,540
I think he's curious because

153
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,070
he's one of my readers.

154
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,870
You can call Mr Fox right now.

155
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,070
Ask him if he is me.

156
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,430
[Please don't make the call.]

157
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,590
[Please.]

158
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,270
[Please.]

159
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,870
Mr Zhou Chuan,

160
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,670
are you not Mr Fox?

161
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,350
Didn't I give you a chance
to prove it to me?

162
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,950
Forget about it.
I'll take it as a no then.

163
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,380
I won't dwell on this anymore.

164
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,830
[What a relief.]

165
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,420
I have to endure this every day?

166
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,270
My heart won't be able to take it
any longer.

167
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,950
Why are you staring at me?

168
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,100
Of course I can't admit that I'm Mr Fox.

169
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,070
I wasn't honest with her from the start.

170
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,620
What should I do if she knew that

171
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,390
I was trying to get information from her?

172
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,230
Mr Fox is me at my geekiest moment.

173
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,780
If she knew that I was Mr Fox,

174
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,830
what if she threatens me

175
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,630
and wants me

176
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,190
to hand over my copyright to her?

177
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,910
Enough already.

178
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,630
I know she won't resort to this.

179
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,750
But I'm sure she'll tease me for it.

180
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,980
I can imagine her face

181
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,350
when she teases me.

182
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,350
"Mr Zhou Chuan."

183
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,430
"I didn't expect you

184
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,070
to be such an emotional teen in the past."

185
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,110
What if she threatens me with that

186
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,500
and doesn't want to cook for us?

187
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,950
I'm fine with that.

188
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,670
But can you change from

189
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,220
eating freshly made dishes
to dried dog food?

190
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,470
That's why.

191
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,790
I can't admit it for your sake.

192
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,430
Let's not dwell on it anymore.

193
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,190
I will never admit that I'm Mr Fox.

194
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,190
Let's go.

195
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,470
Let's go.

196
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,370
[Moonlight]

197
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,350
Good morning, Mr Jiang.

198
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,620
Morning.

199
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,790
Are you here for the latest issue
of Moonlight Magazine?

200
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,390
Yes.

201
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,110
Count this as my present for you.

202
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,100
Thank you.

203
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,230
Compared with the fan fictions
on Xin Dun Creative Exchange,

204
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,820
seems like this issue's
Interactive Cultural Festival

205
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,070
focuses more on

206
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,710
promoting new authors.

207
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,470
I guess all of the articles
are specially chosen.

208
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,070
That's what Mr Xia thought of.

209
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,390
He wants to guide the newcomers
as a veteran.

210
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,190
He wants more people to know about
the new authors.

211
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,550
By the way,

212
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,990
all of your articles

213
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,660
were specially picked by me.

214
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,870
What do you think?
I did a good job, right?

215
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,550
I have nothing to fear when you're here.

216
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,870
By the way,

217
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,350
I've rewritten the ending for

218
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,070
The Disappearing Amusement Park.

219
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,070
Are you free tomorrow night?

220
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,190
I wish to discuss it with you.

221
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,910
Of course. You wrote another ending to it?

222
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,030
Mr Jiang, you're really amazing.

223
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,390
So, am I the first reader

224
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,630
of this new ending?

225
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,350
Please remember to send the location
and time to me.

226
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,550
I need to leave now.

227
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,670
I have a meeting to attend to.

228
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,470
Alright.

229
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,550
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

230
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,590
Hello?

231
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,260
Please reserve two spots
with the best view for me.

232
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,510
For two.

233
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,270
For the Interactive Cultural Festival,

234
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,630
no matter it's from the entries

235
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,430
or the response of the readers,

236
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,910
they're the best we've achieved
for the past two years.

237
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,430
We need to thank our leader for this.

238
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,350
He has been fully supporting us for this.

239
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,550
But, there are some problems
regarding the festival as well.

240
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,670
For the authors,

241
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,190
their popularity vary greatly.

242
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,310
Everyone knows that

243
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,150
the current publishing field

244
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,390
isn't doing too well.

245
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,550
I think we can use this chance

246
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,470
to cut down on our number of authors.

247
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,750
All of the authors included

248
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,070
have a sturdy fanbase.

249
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,670
Their popularity

250
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,270
is largely determined by the situation.

251
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,830
For example, for Mr Zhou Chuan
and Mr Jiang Yu Cheng

252
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,030
Their fans are more active

253
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,590
on social media.

254
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,430
That's why they may seem more popular.

255
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,590
But for some authors,

256
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,460
their readers are more mature.

257
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,870
They keep a low profile as well.

258
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,950
Although they may not express themselves
on social media,

259
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,390
it doesn't mean that the authors
are not popular.

260
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,830
You're saying that they're popular?

261
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,910
If that's so, why are people

262
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,510
faking data for them

263
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,590
behind the scenes?

264
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,070
Chief Editor Yu,

265
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,270
I'm sure you know who I'm talking about.

266
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,630
It's Suo Heng.

267
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,070
Everyone knows the amount of letter

268
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,150
Suo Heng had received this time,
am I right?

269
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,470
Five letters in total.

270
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,580
According to our data,

271
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,830
why is the second section

272
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,470
keeping an unpopular author like her?

273
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,150
Do you think she's our mascot?

274
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,230
Mr Liang,

275
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,230
Ms Suo Heng has been writing
for Moonlight Magazine for a decade.

276
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,430
You can't just judge her capability

277
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,790
based on an activity like this.

278
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,150
Actually, the managing editor

279
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,270
has been reminding
Ms Suo Heng of her situation.

280
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,390
It's just that the results
aren't that positive.

281
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,110
You guys are seeing it for yourselves.

282
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,780
I was the one who brought Suo Heng
to our publishing house.

283
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,310
It's heartbreaking

284
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,740
for me to say this,

285
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,190
but I have to say it

286
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,190
for the sake of the publishing house.

287
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,990
In my opinion,

288
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,390
we should fire

289
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,910
unpopular authors like her.

290
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,110
We should leave spaces

291
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,670
for authors who are more worthy.

292
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,030
This is a publishing house.

293
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,070
We aren't doing charity over here.

294
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,470
There's no need for us to support

295
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,550
the losers in life,

296
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,630
am I right?

297
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,900
Losers?

298
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,990
Miao,

299
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,070
you think this has
nothing to do with you at all?

300
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,790
Chief Editor Yu,

301
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,310
we are in a meeting, you know?

302
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,750
There's no need for you to
confront me directly.

303
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,190
Unpopular authors like Suo Heng
should've been

304
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,780
eliminated long ago.

305
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,630
It's been so many years, you know?
Do you think other publishing houses

306
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,790
are still publishing her works?

307
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,990
If it weren't for your support,

308
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,750
she wouldn't have been able to stay with

309
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,310
Yuan Yue Publishing House
for so many years.

310
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,830
Miao.

311
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,910
Chief Editor Yu,

312
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,350
I know you've been asking other people
to write Suo Heng's stories for her.

313
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,710
Director Yang was unhappy

314
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,390
when he found out about it.

315
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,830
I tried my best to defend you, you know?

316
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,510
Yet, you're still unwilling to give up?

317
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,510
That's it. It's decided then.

318
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,390
If anyone has objections,

319
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,820
you can complain to Director Yang.

320
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,420
Sir,

321
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,190
I've prepared steam rice rolls with
BBQ pork for your lunch.

322
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,390
Steam rice rolls with BBQ pork?

323
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:32,190
Where is it?

324
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,910
Er Gou!

325
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,230
You're complaining to me about Er Gou?

326
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,990
Come back home immediately

327
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,670
and prepare another set
of steamed rice rolls for me.

328
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,100
Brother, can't you
please call for deliveries

329
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,420
using your phone?

330
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,350
Why do you sound so down?

331
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,470
I'll hang up now. Bye.

332
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,950
Chu Li, Ms Suo Heng

333
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,630
looks pale.

334
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,430
I feel like she's going
to faint at any time.

335
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,110
Fine.

336
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,900
Both of you are trying to
make me angry, huh?

337
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,710
You won't get to eat your favourite
chicken meatballs,

338
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,590
you hear me?

339
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,270
Don't tell me she realized that

340
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,190
I was Mr Fox after last night?

341
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,150
Mr Fox didn't reply her the entire night.

342
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,110
That won't do.

343
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,390
How should I reply her?

344
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,370
[The Navy Hired by the Monkey]

345
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,350
What are you doing?

346
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,350
No.

347
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,190
This sounds just like me.

348
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:05,470
[The Navy Hired by the Monkey]

349
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,150
Good morning.

350
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,430
Today will be a great day.

351
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,550
Let's see if you still suspect me
as Mr Fox after this.

352
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,350
Deputy Editor Miao.

353
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,230
You must be kidding me, right?

354
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,070
Yuan Yue Publishing House and I

355
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,710
have been working together
for so many years.

356
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,790
How could you terminate
my contract just like that?

357
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,500
We had no choice.

358
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,110
We tried to fight for you,

359
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,430
but

360
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,790
this is a decision made by the higher-ups.

361
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,300
We didn't want this to happen either.

362
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,110
Deputy Editor Miao, look.

363
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,300
I still have more than

you asked of me.

366

I was always trying to be creative.

367
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,190
I'm not lying.

368
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,470
I tried my best to be creative.

369
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,950

As long as you guys don't give up on me.

373
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,030
Suo Heng,

374
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,150
didn't I tell you already?

375
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,150
Regarding these scripts,

376
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,860
since we've worked together

377
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,030
for so many years,

378
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,910
let me

379
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,900
be honest with you.

380
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,100
You're not suitable

381
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,420
for writing.

382
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,870
It's better for you to find another job.

383
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,190
He said he's being honest with her?

384
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,310
He's stabbing Ms Suo Heng's gentle heart

385
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,350
with a spear.

386
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,270
I've spent the most precious decade
of my life

387
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,030
on writing.

388
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,950
I try my best

389
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,190
to write every day.

390
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,270
I was thinking that even if
I wasn't talented as a writer,

391
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,550
my hard work will be able to
compensate for my lack of talent.

392
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,390
I don't want my career to end like this.

393
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,670
I can't accept this.

394
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,230
You can't accept this?

395
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,460
Even so, you can't just let

397

I understand now.

398
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:17,780
I understand everything.

399
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,030
Great, I'm glad that you understood me.

400
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,990
Let's part with a smile then.

401

And that'll be all.

00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,470
I can't accept this!

405
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,510
Miao, you better don't be too much!

406
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,190
Aren't you being too anxious?

407
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,030
Why are you here?

408
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,470
You have no say in this matter!

409
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,870
Ms Suo Heng's novels

410
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,870
were great.

411
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,910
Every writer has their own style

412
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,870
and themes they're good at.

413
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,550
Things wouldn't have ended like this

414
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,230
if you didn't force her
to change her style.

415
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,830
I forced her to change her style?

416
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,790
Tell me, should all writers

417
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,470
stay in their comfort zone then?

418
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,270
I just wanted her to make a breakthrough.

419
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,390
But she couldn't make it.

420
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,910
How could you blame this on me?

421
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,950
Is asking her to write something
she isn't good at

422
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,510
an attempt for her to make a breakthrough?

423
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,870
If you love to help her out so much,

424
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,110
why don't you write it for her then?

425
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,150
Enough!

that's been going on.

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,390

I know all of that.
I knew what was going on.

I don't need you guys to take pity on me!

I can only say that

456
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,990
I really had no choice back then.

457

What's wrong?

502
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,310
It's all because of Ms Suo Heng.

503
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,870
She received too less replies from
the Interactive Cultural Festival.

504
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,750
That's why Director Yang
is terminating her contract.

Even if Suo Heng couldn't make it,

506

Yu Yao is still there for her.

507
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,470
Why are you worried about her?

508
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,790
Even you know her relationship
with Chief Editor Yu?

509
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,870
I know a little bit.

510
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,070
Isn't Ms Suo Heng pitiful

511
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,910
if Chief Editor Yu

512
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,830
were to ignore her as well?

513
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,310
So, what has this got to do with you?

514
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,190
Why has it got nothing to do with me?

515
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,670
Miao said so before.
Even you are saying the same thing.

516
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,390
But I'm an editor.

517
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,990
As an editor,

518
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,430
how could I watch and do nothing

519
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,400
as a talented writer

520
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,430
fades away?

521
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,750
This concerns my professionalism.

522
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,070
If I failed after I've done my best,

523
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,990
I won't say anything.

524
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,070
But if I keep quiet about it

525
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,460
and pretend to be ignorant
because it doesn't concern me,

526
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,430
I will never be able to forgive myself.

527
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,390
As long as I'm working as an editor,

528
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,470
I will never give up on any author.

529
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,270
That's why I became an editor
in the first place.

530
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,390
What if, one day,

531
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,910
I run out of ideas?

532
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,470
I will never give up on you as well.

533
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,100
Incorrect. You should've said,

534
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,590
"Mr Zhou Chuan, it's impossible for you

535
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,310
to run out of ideas?"

536
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,340
So,

537
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,710
the talented, handsome,

538
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,550
and resourceful Mr Zhou Chuan,

539
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,430
do you know where
Ms Suo Heng is staying at?

540
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,150
You think I'm the paparazzi?

541
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,220
Let's go.

542
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,430
What are you doing?

543
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,030
Are you removing the BBQ pork
because you want to give them to me?

544
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,790
You said you love BBQ pork, right?

545
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,110
I'm giving them to you just in case
you want more.

546
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,150
You're doing all of this

547
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,870
just because you want to
find out her address?

548
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,110
Waiter,

549
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,340
give me another set of BBQ pork.

550
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,910
Alright.

551
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,230
How could you say that about me?

552
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,190
Do you think I'm being nice to you
just because of that?

553
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,630
Ever since I came to know you,

554
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,580
I've been serving you every day, you know?

555
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,270
Where can you find another

556
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,190
cute and bubbly editor like me?

557
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,460
I've sent Suo Heng's address to you.

558
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,990
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

559
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,630
I'll go and find her tonight.

560
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,110
I hope you still remember that
you're my editor.

561
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,550
Eat up.

562
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,870
-Sorry for being late.
-You became prettier.

563
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,230
Come.

564
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,310
I saw that your daughter has
given birth to a girl.

565
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:41,940
Congratulations.

566
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,310
Yeah, congratulations.

567
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,110
Not bad at all.

568
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,030
You were a tomboy in the past.

569
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,070
Yet you got married the fastest
among all of us.

570
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,740
Now,

571
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,230
I'm a housewife who had just given birth
to my second daughter.

572
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,790
I was so busy that

573
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,950
I can't even finish a book.

574
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,310
I wanted to be a writer
in the past, you know?

575
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,270
But, I realized that

576
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,150
I can't make a living

577
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,150
with just writing novels.

578
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,230
That's why

579
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,580
I joined the sales industry.

580
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,510
This is a rich wife's life.

581
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,910
Yeah, no one can compare to her.

582
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,420
Suo Heng,

583
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,590
I heard that you've written
several novels.

584
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,150
Share them with us.

585
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,140
Yeah, the hottest novel right now
is The Fierce West Wind.

586
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,910
Did you write it?

587
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,830
-The Fierce West Wind?
-Yeah.

588
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,780
It's quite good.

589
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,910
You'll earn a lot if
you turn novels into movies.

590
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,060
Suo Heng, tell us about it.

591
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,750
How much do you earn from
selling your novels?

592
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,630
I don't earn that much.

593
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,030
-Just tell us about it.
-That can't be.

594
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,220
Why are you asking about her income

595
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,230
when we're here to have a meal?

596
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,940
Why do I feel like you have some
ulterior motives?

597
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,590
Not at all. I'm just trying to
show concern for her.

598
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,580
Come, it's been a long time
since we've met.

599
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,390
Let's have a toast.

600
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,910
-Come on.
-Come on.

601
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,980
That person who's been
enjoying himself abroad,

602
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,150
you have to drink three cups.

603
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,390
Bottoms up.

604
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,470
He's living his life right now.

605
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,950
Ms Suo Heng!

606
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,070
Are you okay?

607
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,390
Why are you here?

608
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,660
Did you drink?

609
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,150
I've terminated my contract
with Yuan Yue Publishing House.

610
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,700
I have no ties with your company anymore.

611
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,750
Don't come and look for me anymore.

612
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,510
What about your pills?

613
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,110
Ms Suo Heng,

614
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,510
you mustn't give up on
writing just like that.

615
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,910
Don't you think

616
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,710
you're being sarcastic

617
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,590
when you're working for
Yuan Yue Publishing House?

618
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,030
Chu Li, I've seen everything
you've done for me.

619
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,460
Thank you for everything.

620
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,390
Director Yang.

621
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,550
Director Yang, I need to speak with you.

622
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,390
Director Yang, I need to speak with you.

623
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,230
Chief Editor Yu?

624
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,550
What a coincidence.

625
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,900
Do you need anything?

626
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,390
I have something to
report to Director Yang.

627
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,910
Director Yang and I had
a happy time tonight.

628
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,430
He drank a lot.

629
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,070
He has fallen asleep.

630
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,580
Why don't you try to wake him up?

631
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,590
Come.

632
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,270
Director Yang,

633
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,030
Suo Heng...

634
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,870
As long as she regains confidence,

635
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,110
as long as she returns to her expertise,

636
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,990
I'm sure she can write
another great novel like

637
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,220
Golden Spears and Armoured Horses

638
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,710
She isn't worthless.

639
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,510
Yeah.

640
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,590
You do have a point.

641
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,550
Chief Editor Yu,

642
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,750

643
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,950
Have a piece of chocolate.

644

645
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,710
Director Yang, please give
Suo Heng another chance.

646

647
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,950
Director Yang,

648
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,910
please give Suo Heng another chance!

649
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,350
Hello?

650
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,790
Dear?

651
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,830
I'm sorry.

652
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,590
I might not be able to

653
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,750
attend Mum's birthday dinner later.

654
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,430
Please apologize to her for me.

655
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,310
Wish her happy birthday for me.

656
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,910
I'll surely apologize to her personally
in the future.

657
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,270
Mum, let's proceed.

658
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,550
She's busy tonight.

659
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,550
She won't be coming.

660
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,070
She was already busy with her work.

661
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,270
She had never brought Qiu Qiu

662
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,710
to visit us.

663
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,860
Now, she was finally
transferred back here.

664
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,940
I thought our family

665
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,670
can have a happy meal together.

666
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,110
Coincidentally,

667
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,150
today is my 60th birthday.

668
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,950
We waited until now,

669
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,990
yet she's telling us that
she won't be coming?

670
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,870
I'm sure Yao Yao has an emergency
to attend to.

671
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,630
I'll apologize to you on behalf of her.

672
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,100

for Grandma later.

675
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,950

678
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,590
Let's go and buy some fruits.

679
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,950
What are we having for breakfast tomorrow?

680
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,590

That's a restricted medication.

685

You need to get them from the hospitals.

686
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,670
What kind of medication is this?

687
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,230
It's a strong sleeping pill.

I'm afraid something might happen to her.

00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,070
What are you guys saying?

728
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,570
[Estazolam Pills]

729
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,110
I'm not trying to kill myself.

730
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,590
It's just that I couldn't sleep lately.

731
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,110
That's why I'm taking the sleeping pills.

732
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,390
I didn't expect myself to
fall into a deep sleep.

733
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,710
Did you drink just now?

734
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,310
Alcohol might strengthen the effects
of sleeping pills.

735
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,550
I'm glad that you're fine.

736
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,430
How did you guys come in?

737
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,830
Chief Editor Yu...

738
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,140
I've always kept your keys with me.

739
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,190
I was the one who opened the door.

740
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,550
So,

741
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,350
since she's fine,

742
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,430
I'll wait for you outside.

743
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,510
Do you still find it hard

744
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,470
to sleep lately?

745
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,390
Your body will be damaged
if you keep taking sleeping pills.

746
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,710
You need to see a doctor.

747
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,470
I know a great doctor.

748
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,030
I don't need you to care for me.

749
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,660
Even doctors won't be able to save me.

750
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,710
I know my own condition the best.

751
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,630
I'm fine right now.

752
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,390
Please leave.

753
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,790
Ms Suo Heng,

754
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,150
Chief Editor Yu has always
been concerned for you.

755
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,590
So,

756
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,470
I think we'll leave now.

757
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,670
If you need anything,

758
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,750
you can call Chu Li.

759
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,310
Take good care of yourself.

760
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,900
Ms Suo Heng,

761
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,510
we didn't give up on you.

762
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,750
If you're willing,

763
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,510
I can be your editor...

764
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,910
Even Yuan Yue Publishing House
won't be able to save me.

765
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,940
Stop worrying about me.

766
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,470
You guys should leave.

767
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,270
-Let's go.
-Wait.

768
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,860
Leave the keys here.

769
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,190
Is there anything else?

770
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,430
Tearing your own scripts into pieces,

771
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,270
I've done that before.

772
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,390
But, it's useless.

773
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,390
Because every word that you've written

774
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,270
will be imprinted in your mind.

775
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,110
If you can't even accept your past self,

776
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,310
you have no right
to talk about the future.

777
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,990
Do you think I still can
expect something from my future?

778
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,670
No matter for what reason,

779
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,470
you didn't take the entire bottle tonight.

780
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,100
That means you're still
expecting something.

781
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,070
What's the use of expectations?

782
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,550
This is just my last struggle.

783
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,830
Why don't you have a try?

784
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,990
Today, my editor told me that

785
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,830
as long as she's working as an editor,

786
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,510
she won't give up on any author.

787
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,750
That's why she became an editor
in the first place.

788
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,190
She can accept it when she fails

789
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,430
after trying her best,

790
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,310
but she can't accept it when

791
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,750
she submits to fate without even trying.

792
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,060
That's because you're lucky.

793
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,510
You got yourself a great editor.

794
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,510
That's precisely why

795
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,830
you should give her

796
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,270
and yourself another chance.

797
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,990
It's all because of me.

798
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,910
I was the one

799
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:28,630
who pushed her into this plight.

800
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,350
I was the reason

801
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,030
she couldn't sleep without taking
sleeping pills.

802
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,820
Do you know

803
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,190
why she ended up like this?

804
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,710
It's because I gave up on her before.

805
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,190
It'll be inconvenient for me
to visit you from now on.

806
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,590
You can take the keys first.

807
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,100
You're not visiting me anymore?

808
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,670
Even you are giving up on me?

809
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,350
It's not that. I...

810
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,950
I need to take a long break.

811
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,990
In the future, I'll ask

812
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,310
the other editors

813
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,590
to take care of you.

814
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,550
What do you mean by that?

815
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,950
Are you saying that you're abandoning me?

816
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,070
Is it because no one is buying my book?

817
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,510
Is that why you're abandoning me as well?

818
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,190
I don't know how to
explain it to you right now,

819
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,470
but,

820
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,870
Suo Heng, I'm sorry.

821
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,750
I didn't expect you

822
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,990
to deviate from your original style

823
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,550
after you did your research

824
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,870
on how to write better.

825
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,470
Maybe it's my fault.

826
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,470
Sis Yao Yao,

827
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,750
can you please trust me one last time?

828
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,390
Please trust me one last time, okay?

829
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,430
Fine.

830
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,070
I understand now.

831
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,270
Thank you for caring for me
all these years.

832
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,590
From now on,
we'll be on our separate ways.

833
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,750
We are even now.

834
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,790
I was so naive that I thought

835
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,660
the dreams you told me before
were your true dreams.

836
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,870
Just throw away the keys.

837
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,390
Chief Editor Yu,

838
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,940
why didn't you tell her that...

839
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,110
Because

840
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,790
I was pregnant back then.

841
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,150
The doctor said

842
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,790
it'll be hard for the child to survive

843
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,620
if I didn't rest well.

844
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,110
Why didn't you tell her then?

845
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,030
Even if I had told her,
that wouldn't have changed anything.

846
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,150
Even if I had told tell her that

847
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,790
I didn't want to give up on her,

848
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,070
what would have that changed?

849
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,230
It won't change anything.

850
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,470
I'm sorry, Chief Editor Yu.

851
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,270
Stop it.

852
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,070
You're not the one
who should apologize here.

853
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,350
Sorry for that.

854
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,270
I have things to attend to.
I'll leave now.

855
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,390
Chu Li,

856
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,070
let's go.

857
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,430
It's fine as long as she's alive.

858
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,350
If you want her to pull herself together,

859
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,910
you'll have plenty of time to do so
in the future.

860
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,390
I watched Ms Suo Heng

861
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,790
as she couldn't say anything

862
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,830
or do anything about her circumstances.

863
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,180
She worked so hard,

864
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,380
even the ink of her keyboard has faded.

865
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,590
In this world,

866
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,310
there are many helpless situations.

867
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,070
Your effort might not be repaid.

868
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,910
But, if you can move on bravely

869
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,550
even after realizing the truth,

870
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:01,830
these difficulties you've faced

871
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,350
won't become ordeals to you.

872
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,270
They'll become a meaningful experience

873
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,950
to you.

874
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,670
Sir, I'm sorry.

875
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,750
Did I mention your sad past by accident?

876
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,830
I'm different from you.

877
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,260
I'm a genius.

878
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,870
Geniuses don't need to put in effort.

879
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:29,230
Your confidence is what I like about you.

880
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,470
Let's go.
