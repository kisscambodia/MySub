00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,820
Ah Xiang, what happened?

5
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,030
Chu Li,

6
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,310
Miao invited the famous

7
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,870
Yi Shui Han over to do the warm-up.

8
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,910
He doesn't have to do anything.

9
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,150
He came here to sign
autograph and take photo.

10
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,670
There are many cosplayers in there.

11
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,190
Isn't this ridiculous?

12
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,510
Do the superiors know about this?

13
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,070
We've sold

14
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,590
a thousand books in less than an hour.

15
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,830
Mr Liang is very happy.

16
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,940
The worse is that

17
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,190
they want to change
Mr Zhou Chuan's display board

18
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,990
to Yi Shui Han's display board.

19
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,030
Who dares to do that?

20
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,310
-Excuse me! Excuse me!
-Excuse me! Excuse me!

21
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,710
Excuse me!

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,829
Carry Mr Yi Shui Han's

24
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,110
display board out.

25
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,710
You...

26
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,420
Why are you putting
Mr Zhou Chuan's display board here?

27
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,620
Put it back!

28
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,829
Deputy Editor Miao has said it.

29
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:39,070
There're too many people. He's afraid
the display board will be broken.

30
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,190
So he asked us to put Mr Zhou Chuan's

31
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,190
display board away.

32
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,950
And take it out on the premiere date.

33
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,590
He did it to protect our company's

34
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,950
important goods from damaging.

35
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,430
Is that so?

36
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,030
Then why don't you leave

37
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,510
Mr Yi Shui Han's display board here?

38
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,950
They are the important goods
of our company anyway.

39
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,230
We should treat them the same way.

40
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:53,910
You...

41
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,070
Put it back

42
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,390
or I'll cut Mr Yi Shui Han's

43
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,590
display board.

44
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,470
Chu Li, calm down.

45
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,110
It'll be hard for you to
explain to the leader.

46
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,630
I'll count to three.

47
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,660
I'll do it

48
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,870
if you don't put it back.

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,500
All right.

50
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,190

51
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,830
move this out.

52
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,750
Mr Liang,

Ask Miao

56
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,070
to make the deal with
the other character

57
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,430
for Yuan Yue platform.

58
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,550
Okay.

59
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,230
What are you doing?

60
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,190
Are you demolishing?

61
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,430
Mr Liang,

62
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,550
I want to discuss something with you.

63
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,870
Are you free?

64
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,470
No, get out.

65
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,710
About the marketing publicity
of this book fair,

66
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,990
I would like to share some idea.

67
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,670
What?

68
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,670
Publicity?

69
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,510
Idea?

70
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,910
It's not a problem
if you want to invite a cosplayer.

71
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,910
Two-dimensional world
is about positivity.

72
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,470
But it's not a right timing.

73
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,140
Tomorrow is the premiere
of Book of Luo He God.

74
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,390
What if Mr Zhou Chuan's readers
couldn't get in

75
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,470
if they want to buy his book?

76
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,910
Didn't you say you want to
sign his new book over?

77
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,500
Isn't that insincere if you do this?

78
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,829
You're right.

79
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,790
Keep going.

80
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:25,990
So, can you cancel

81
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,510
tomorrow's role play activity?

82
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,590
Okay.

83
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,990
Here, have a seat.

84
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,910
I'll listen to you if you sit here.

85
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,830
Sit.

86
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,070
What are you doing?

87
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,830
Chief Editor Yu.

88
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,830
Your editorial department

89
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,790
dropped in unannounced.

90
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,670
Do you think my office is a market?

91
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,220
Mr Liang, don't joke on me.

92
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,790
In comparison to here,

93
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,830
Yuan Yue Publishing House's booth

94
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,670
is like a market.

95
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,350
Mr Xia went to receive

96
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,110
his friends.

97
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,030
He asked me to communicate with you.

98
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,070
When can the booth of

99
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,710
Yuan Yue Publishing House
turn from Comic-Con to a book fair?

100
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,430
Hello.

101
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,070
Mr Yang.

102
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,630
Yes.

103
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,310
Rest assured.

104
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,630
I've been discussing
about the cosplaying.

105
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,300
Right, no problem.

106
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,150
They will keep an eye on it.

107
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,030
Right!

108
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,070
Okay, leave it to me.

109
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,990
Goodbye.

110
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,710
Have you listened it?

111
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,270
Hiring the cosplayer is an exemption
which is granted by Director Yang.

112
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,510
Please pass the message to Mr Xia.

113
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,870
The role-playing platform will be

114
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,270
lasted until the end.

115
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,470
As for Book of Luo He God,

116
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,190
we'll open two more passageways by then.

117
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,710
And hire someone to maintain the order.

118
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,390
What's big deal?

119
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,540
Everything is under my control.

120
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,030
But this...

121
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,670
Okay, just stop.

122
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,870
It's useless to speak much.

123
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,550
Let's go.

124
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,830
Gu Bai Zhi, why is it you?

125
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,230
You can't just drop by

126
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,940
even if we live nearby.

127
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,630
Open the door,
I have something to tell you.

128
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,030
What is it?

129
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,550
Are you busy writing Huang Quan Inn?

130
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,150
It's a mess on your Weibo.

131
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,140
Don't you know that?

132
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,550
Weibo?

133
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,150
What's going on?

134
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,630
Yuan Yue Publishing House is outrageous.

135
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,310
It's not enough for just one cosplayer.

136
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,710
Tomorrow is the launch day
of Book of Luo He God.

137
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,030
Yet they still wanted to hire
two more cosplayers.

138
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,110
But your little editor

139
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,710
really worked hard for you.

140
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,750
She went up

141
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,110
against them

142
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,909
just for your display board.

143
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,870
What's going on?

144
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,470
Why are you coming to me?

145
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,190
Tomorrow night,

146
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,750
Xin Dun Books prepares

147
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,630
a banquet to welcome Maurer.

148
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,500
I'm here to invite you to the banquet.

149
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,230
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,780
I'm not planning to sign

151
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,790
the serial rights of Huang Quan Inn
over to Xin Dun Books.

152
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,990
Don't tell me you're going to sign it
over to Yuan Yue Publishing House.

153
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,390
Er Gou, I'm back.

154
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,830
I'm back.

155
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,380
You're back?

156
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,350
I...

157
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,110
I... I mean,

158
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,190
Mr Zhou Chuan, I'm back to bother you.

159
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,030
These are the stuffs
that you asked me to buy.

160
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,340
You guys continue. I'm going.

161
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,980
Your relationship
with this little editor...

162
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,470
Is not that simple.

163
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,110
There's someone in the house.

164
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,790
I'd better walk around

165
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,990
for a while before I go back.

166
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,790
Are you planning to

167
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,310
stay out for

168
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,510
two hours if she was
to stay that long?

169
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,990
Two hours?

170
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,710
Why does she want to stay that long?

171
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,670
Is she

172
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,630
going to stay for supper?

173
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,070
That was just a metaphor.

174
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,110
Do you know metaphor?

175
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,140
I think I should
find a place where I can sit

176
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,460
then I'll go back after a while.

177
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,429
Just send me a message

178
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,630
after Director Gu has left.

179
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:50,270
She lives nearby.

180
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,710
You guys will meet someday.

181
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,590
How many times do you plan to hide?

182
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,830
I'll hide every time I see her.

183
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,750
It's unnecessary.

184
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,350
It's like we're cheating.

185
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,390
Mr Zhou Chuan, slow down.

186
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,620
I don't want to go in.

187
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,390
Hello, Director Gu.

188
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,390
What a coincidence. We meet again.

189
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,190
Both of you...

190
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,900
She is now my tenant

191
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,070
and I'm her landlord.

192
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,540
Right.

193
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,670
I rented Mr Zhou Chuan's second floor.

194
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,070
Mr Zhou Chuan is a nice person.
He knew I'm homeless

195
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,910
so...

196
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,030
I'm not going to hide it

197
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,430
since you've seen us.

198
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,190
But I hope that
you could keep it as secret.

199
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,630
A man and a woman
lives in the same house.

200
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,910
It's hard for people not
to have impure thoughts.

201
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,380
And you'll get affected

202
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,550
if your readers know it.

203
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,350
I don't mind.

204
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,750
I think

205
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,950
it will affect Chu Li's reputation

206
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,390
if this gets out

207
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,590
since she is a lady.

208
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,220
Then I'll let you two be.

209
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,220
Just send me

210
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,070
a message if you want to go.

211
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,790
I'll leave first.

212
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,550
If you want to go?

213
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,700
Where do you want to go?

214
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,590
She invited me to meet Maurer.

215
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,230
I think she's trying to get
Huang Quan Inn's serial rights.

216
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,150
I finally finished writing Huang Quan Inn.

217
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,190
Why is my shoulder this sore?

218
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,790
Dear Mr Zhou Chuan,

219
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,900
when can we sign the contract?

220
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,710
Tomorrow after the book fair,

221
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,390
bring the contract with you.

222
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,830
Rest assured.

223
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,910
I'll try my best to complete the mission.

224
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,230
Be gentle.

225
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,870
Are you trying to break a rock?

226
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,510
Hello, Chief Editor Yu.

227
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,070
I'm fine.

228
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,670
Okay, I'll be right there.

229
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,550
Qiu Qiu is sick, you don't have to go.

230
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,340
I'll report it to you at night.

231
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,750
You just came back.
Are you going to

232
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,950
the editorial department
at this late hour?

233
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,820
It's nothing.

234
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,460
Something urgent has come up
in the editorial department.

235
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,150
Just order the delivery
if you're hungry.

236
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,950
I'll leave first.

237
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,830
I...

238
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,710
How about this?

239
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,590
Let's meet

240
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,790
each other halfway.

241
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,350
The editorial department
already compromised.

242
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,870
We just ask to suspend tomorrow's

243
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,390
comic exhibition for one day.

244
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,660
Tomorrow is the national

245
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,350
launch day of
Book of Luo He God with limited copies.

246
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,390
Based on the minimum of
respect for the author,

247
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,630
shouldn't the unrelated activities

248
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,030
be suspended?

249
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,990
Is there a conflict
between these two activities?

250
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,390
Why are you

251
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,100
putting all eggs in one basket?

252
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,510
Mr Xia,

253
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,550
I think this is a win-win situation.

254
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,510
Mr Liang,

255
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,310
do you know that tomorrow,

256
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,470
Xin Dun Books has invited
world-renowned author

257
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,350
and director, Maurer over?

258
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,470
At this point, Yuan Yue

259
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,790
is still not focusing

260
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,230
on Mr Zhou Chuan

261
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,750
but to hire some cosplayers
and hold Comic-Con.

262
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,430
Aren't the priorities being misplaced?

263
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,910
Right, I've misplaced the priorities.

264
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,950
Okay.

265
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,830
Hitting two millions copies

266
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,350
in three days,

267
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,620
you do it.

268
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,430
I'm from the editorial department,

269
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,990
not the circulation department.

270
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,150
I don't know much about these things.

271
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,830
But I know the practical realization
of the win-win situation

272
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,550
is to maximize the sales
in the book fair under the premise

273
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,350
of protecting the author.

274
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,630
You can search for
Mr Zhou Chuan's Weibo.

275
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,070
The readers of Mr Zhou Chuan

276
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,230
are dissatisfied with
Yuan Yue Publishing House now.

277
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,150
Mr Zhou Chuan always
cherishes his readers.

278
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,430
This situation is no good for us.

279
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,550
I'm impressed.

280
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,230
Mr Xia,

281
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,590
Miao,

282
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,670
I think

283
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,350
Chu Li has transformed.

284
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,870
She has made a great progress.

285
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,100
She has lots of

286
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,430
well-reasoned theories
and they are in simple terms.

287
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,300
I think

288
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,830
you are Mr Zhou Chuan's top fan

289
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,270
and you are the one
who are dissatisfied with us.

290
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,910
Just that you haven't
hold Zhou Chuan's hands

291
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,670
to the book fair and told him that

292
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,740
this is the kingdom

293
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,790
you establish for him.

294
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,070
Can you bear this in mind?

295
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,270
That you are the editor of
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

296
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,150
not Zhou Chuan's mother.

297
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,550
Chu Li,

298
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,750
it's not that I want to blame you.

299
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,830
Mr Liang is right.

300
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,470
I found that too.

301
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,630
Do you think

302
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,310
you're great

303
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,190
after being Zhou Chuan's editor?

304
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,630
Do you think everyone in the company

305
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,070
should make way for you?

306
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,070
Are others not allowed to

307
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,180
organize book fair except Zhou Chuan?

308
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,230
It's not about making way for me.

309
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,950
I only wish that Mr Zhou Chuan's book

310
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,270
could achieve a better sales.

311
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,750
Book fair is not some sort of

312
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,470
annual clearance sale.

313
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,990
And it's not Comic-Con where
the cosplayers can walk around.

314
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,590
Of course, I have
personal considerations.

315
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,630
I, too, wish that

316
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,070
tomorrow is my Mr Zhou Chuan's

317
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,460
special session.

318
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,150
Listen to her,

319
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,030
Mr Xia!

320
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,670
Why is Zhou Chuan yours?

321
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,990
I have to remind you.

322
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,830
As an editor,

323
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,780
the privatization of the author

324
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,070
is prohibited.

325
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,270
I think

326
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,430
what Cocoon told me

327
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,110
was not coined for nothing.

328
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,110
Deputy Editor Miao, watch your words!

329
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,470
All right.

330
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,790
Miao,

331
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,910
deal only with the current matter,
no name-calling.

332
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,350
So, everyone is here.

333
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,510
Mr Xia, it's been a long time.

334
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,270
Look at you,

335
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,900
you're full of energy.

336
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,990
You were in middle school

337
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,390
since I last saw you.

338
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,270
Yes.

339
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,030
In a blink of an eye,

340
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,380
I publish your book now.

341
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,470
No, no, no.

342
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,590
The Tang poetry that
you gave me that time

343
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,950
is kept on the bookshelf of my house.

344
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,980
Really?

345
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,790
Why did you drop by unexpectedly?

346
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,830
You're asking me?

347
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,830
Didn't I call you just now?

348
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,150
You said you're on meeting.

349
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,590
And you'll reply me later.

350
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,430
I rushed here

351
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,030
as I was impatient.

352
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,510
Mr Xia.

353
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,430
I've read the readers' comments
on Weibo today, saying that

354
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,030
the exhibition of Yuan Yue
Publishing House today is very popular.

355
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,990
It's said it was having a cosplayer.

356
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,390
Two more cosplayers
are coming tomorrow.

357
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,990
I'm here to verify it.

358
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,430
Tomorrow is the day of

359
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,350
Book of Luo He God's launch day, right?

360
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,910
Yes.

361
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,630
Of course it is.

362
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,870
Mr Zhou Chuan,

363
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,910
the launch of Book of Luo He God

364
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,110
is definitely the main point
of this book fair.

365
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,590
Rest assured.

366
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,830
I'll open a passageway
for VVIP.

367
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,870
It won't affect your new book's release.

368
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,510
Actually, I

369
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,590
am reluctant to share

370
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,910
an event venue with other people.

371
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,220
Xin Dun Books has invited
Maurer over tomorrow.

372
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,630
I have enough problems.

373
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,150
If something comes up again,

374
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,190
I think our future collaboration
will be over.

375
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,750
I was reckless.

376
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,660
Miao,

377
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,910
what's your opinion?

378
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,270
I...

379
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,470
The is the thing.

380
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,790
Mr Zhou Chuan.

381
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,310
We've already made
an official announcement that

382
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,990
this book selling and photograph events

383
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,030
will be held three days.

384
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,590
If we suddenly cancel it,

385
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,310
I think it'll cause dissatisfaction

386
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,580
among those readers

387
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,630
who have bought the admission tickets.

388
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,510
They've spent money.

389
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,180
If they make a scene

390
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,589
in the book fair,

391
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,550
I'm afraid it'll affect the launch
of Book of Luo He God.

392
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,950
This is all for peace.

393
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,470
How about this?

394
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,750
We just compress

395
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,230
the book selling and photograph events

396
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,510
to tomorrow morning from ten to twelve.

397
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,950
From twelve onward

398
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,030
until six in the evening,

399
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,510
this period of time

400
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,990
will be given to

401
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,340
the launch of the Book of Luo He God.

402
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,910
Isn't that good?

403
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,790
That is good!

404
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,950
That's the deal! Okay!

405
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,030
Little Zhou, just tell us if you

406
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,940
don't like it.

407
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,870
We respect your decision.

408
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,070
And

409
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,830
Mr Zhou Chuan,

410
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,070
I've asked two cosplayers

411
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,060
to play the male leading roles
of the Book of Luo He God.

412
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,030
What do you think?

413
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,670
Great!

414
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,510
Fantastic!

415
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,630
This will build momentum
for the Book of Luo He God.

416
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,150
Then can you guarantee

417
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,950
that it won't affect

418
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,590
the readers to purchase
the book tomorrow afternoon?

419
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,820
I can guarantee.

420
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,670
I'll send the personnel
to maintain the order.

421
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,550
And

422
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,510
everything will be under my control.

423
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,710
Okay.

424
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:31,980
Tomorrow,

425
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,470
I'll personally go on-site
and have a look too.

426
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,030
Mr Xia,

427
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,830
that's all.

428
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,790
Okay.

429
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,950
So, you must

430
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,070
strictly control the time
of the events tomorrow.

431
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,060
You must keep them well-organized.

432
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,260
Chu Li,

433
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,990
prepare a staff identity card
for Mr Zhou Chuan.

434
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,190
Rest assured, Mr Xia.

435
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,150
Mr Zhou Chuan is such a reasonable man.

436
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,070
A gentleman, Mr Chuan.
He has lived up to his reputation.

437
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,990
Miao,

438
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,470
what do you think?

439
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,310
He's as good as they say!

440
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,070
Just tell me what's on your mind.

441
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,190
Aren't you tired of looking sideways?

442
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,430
Mr Zhou Chuan,

443
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,110
why are you starting to monitor
the editorial department?

444
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,670
I can tell that
you were going to start a fight

445
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,630
in the editorial department
by your look when you went out.

446
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,300
I'm a defensive person.

447
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,230
I can't watch my people get bullied.

448
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,430
Then why did you easily agree

449
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,630
with Miao's suggestion?

450
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,030
You compromised too soon.

451
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,070
It's not really your style.

452
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,830
I don't wish that the readers

453
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,990
get affected by the
role-playing activity.

454
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,750
I wish they could buy the book

455
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,430
and read it with a good mood.

456
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,990
Just like that.

457
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,990
You genuinely thought about your fans

458
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,630
unlike the seniors, they don't want
to offend either side.

459
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,150
They can't choose which one to abandon.

460
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,190
They don't want to lose you,

461
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,390
they don't want to lose
the stack clearance too.

462
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,190
They can only ask the circulation
department and the editorial department

463
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,590
to discuss the issue among ourselves.

464
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,510
Are you finished?

465
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,550
Then it's my turn to ask you.

466
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,950
When did Zhou Chuan become yours?

467
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,750
How long had you been eavesdropping?

468
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,020
When Miao started to

469
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,750
interrogate you.

470
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,750
Your...

471

Your readers

472
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,310
always say "my Mr Zhou Chuan" too.

473
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,270
As your editor and reader,

474
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,670
what's wrong about
me saying "my Mr Zhou Chuan" ?

475
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,070
Nothing's wrong.

476
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,030
I feel good to hear that.

477
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,630
Then why did you change your mind?

478
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,910
Rest assured.

479
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,590
Just do your job and sell the books.

480
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,670
Nothing will happen with me around.

481

the book fair when you awake.

I'm not awake,

489
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,390

You weren't like this

494
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,990
last night when you ensured

495
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,500
justice for the readers.

It's not that long,
more than three hours?

00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,220
Come quickly.

562
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,390
Okay, I know.

563
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,940
You haven't seen it, right?
You need to study harder.

564
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,070
Mr Zhou Chuan is stuck in traffic.

565
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,870
He might be fifty minutes late.

566
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,310
Fifty minutes more?

567
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,590
But

568
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,590
there's no connection between

569
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,390
the end time of the book selling
and photograph events

570
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,550
and Mr Zhou Chuan's arrival time.

571
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,790
Right, I didn't say so.

572
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,750
Are you hungry?

573
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,860
I am.

574
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,870
Let's go eat.

575
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,990
Let's go. Let's go and eat.

576
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,820
Do you want to join us?

577
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,150
Chief Editor Yu,

578
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,390
why do I have a bad feeling?

579
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,760
[Reading makes the life better.]

580
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,870
Really?

581
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,660
The animation photograph is ongoing?

582
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,750
Shouldn't they hold the limited
launch for Zhou Chuan?

583
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,430
Right, the book selling
and photograph event

584
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,190
should be ended at noon.

585
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,910
But there's a steady stream

586
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,630
of anime fans now.

587
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,590
What's wrong with Yuan Yue
Publishing House? Look at the time.

588
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,780
Liang Chong Lang,

589
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,670
he went mad to boost their sales.

590
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,670
We haven't purchased it!

591
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,390
Right!

592
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,270
There're many people in the Comic-Con!
Look at the time!

593
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,060
Start it quickly!

594
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,310
Hurry up! We have things to do too!

595
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,310
When is he coming? When?

596
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,390
We have limited time!

597
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,630
We've waited for so long, hurry up!

598
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,670
Geez!

599
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,150
Chief Editor Yu,

600
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,420
what's going on?

601
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,790
It's already twenty past twelve.

602
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,110
Why are they still allowing

603
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,380
the people to enter?

604
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,950
When can they clear the place?

605
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,470
Chief Editor Yu,

606
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,430
the lunch is ready.
Why don't we just eat first?

607
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,750
Who has the mood to eat now?

608
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,390
The members of circulation department
are enjoying their lunch.

609
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,550
Where are they?

610
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,270
Over there.

611
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,300
Ah Xiang, you stay here as lookout.

612
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,510
Let's go there.

613
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,390
Look, look, look.

614
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,550
We're old.

615
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,350
I see you two enjoying your meal.

616
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,110
You want some?

617
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,990
Mr Liang,

618
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,700
I've told you once.

619
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,110
I'm not saying it again.

620
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,150
You had agreed to

621
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,590
end the events before twelve.

622
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,510
Look at the time now.

623
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,300
Why haven't you controlled the stream?

624
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,030
Zhou Chuan hasn't reached too.

625
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,380
Isn't he stuck in the traffic?

626
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,950
Just one more hour,
Director Yang already agreed.

627
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,510
Chief Editor Yu,

628
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,270
we didn't expect

629
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,870
the role-playing enthusiasts

630
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,390
would be this much.

631
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,070
Right.

632
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,310
And there are many people

633
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,870
coming from distant places.

634
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,470
They are here to support us.

635
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,830
We can't disappoint them

636
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,910
and ask them leave just like this.

637
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,790
Right.

638
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,030
Then have you thought about this?

639
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,700
What if Zhou Chuan's
fans couldn't enter

640
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,790
and purchase the book?

641
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,100
But I didn't see

642
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,510
any of them making a fuss

643
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,670
but you.

644
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,060
What's the big deal?

645
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,820
Why are you making this difficult?

646
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,390
So, you act like nothing happened

647
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,270
because they didn't
make a fuss in front of you?

648
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,710
Why did you break your promise
and extend the time?

649
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,710
Or do you think Zhou Chuan's readers

650
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,110
will come to buy
the books no matter what

651
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,030
since they've bought
the admission tickets?

652
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,390
So, it doesn't matter to
keep them waiting,

653
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,630
right?

654
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,220
Do you show respect to the author

655
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,150
and the readers?

656
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,950
Then do you show respect to the leader

657
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,390
and the superior?

658
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,990
Who is he?

659
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,150
He is your superior

660
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,140
not your grandson.

661
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,310
What makes you think

662
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,470
you can teach him?

663
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,630
Who do you think you are?

664
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,670
Respect the author?

665
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,350
Respect the readers?

666
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,590
That's so kind of you.

667
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,950
Don't be an editor,

668
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,310
go start a charity!

669
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,590
You just implement
the leader's decision,

670
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,510
you have no right to
tell us what to do!

671
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,470
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

672
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,310
You've reached?

673
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,270
Okay, I'll come pick you up.

674
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,270
Didn't you say he
needs fifty minutes more?

675
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,580
But he got here early.

676
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,190
There's nothing I can do.

677
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,340
Chief Editor, I'm going to pick him up.

678
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,220
Okay.

679
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,150
Then I'll stop eating.

680
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,340
I'll go and manage the situation first.

681
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,990
[What's wrong with
Yuan Yue Publishing House?]

682
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,600
[Isn't Book of Luo He God
start at twelve o'clock?]

683
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,120
[Why are they still letting
the COSER enthusiasts in?]

684
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,990
My Weibo is going to explode.

685
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,230
What's the situation up there?

686
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,710
The circulation department
finally started

687
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,230
to manage the situation
as they heard you've reached.

688
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,270
Let's go quickly.

689
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,070
Let's go.

690
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:29,990
Hello.

691
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,030
[It's me, Mr Liang.]

692
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,630
Chu Li, listen to me.

693
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,350
You do whatever it takes to

694
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,310
hold Zhou Chuan off.

695
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,230
[At least ten minutes.]

696
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,150
[Do you understand?]

697
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,430
Mr Liang,

698
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,350
Mr Zhou Chuan has entered the venue.

699
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,310
[He has entered?]

700
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,630
This is not right.

701
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,510
Young lady,

702
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,390
why is it so quiet

703
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,110
if you've entered the venue?

704
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,870
[Is this some kind of a trick?]

705
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,350
[I warn you.]

706
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,790
Are you trying to get back at me?

707
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,870
I tell you.

708
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,350
If you don't hold Zhou Chuan off,

709
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,350
[you don't have to come back to
Yuan Yue Publishing House.]

710
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,380
You...

711
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,670
I am Zhou Chuan.

712
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,470
What's wrong with
Yuan Yue Publishing House?

713
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,710
[You're still letting the
role-playing enthusiasts in now.]

714
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,310
Isn't the event
supposed to end at twelve?

715
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,150
Who are they trying to take photo with?

716
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,140
Is it me?

717
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,830
Mr Zhou Chuan, calm down.

718
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,630
Listen to me.

719
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,990
[How can I not be agitated?]

720
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,110
There are many comments on my Weibo.

721
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,670
They are all my fans' complaints.

722
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,710
Others' fans are more

723
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,310
important than mine, right?

724
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,870
What's the matter
with the circulation department?

725
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,590
[Just quit if you don't
want to sell the books.]

726
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,660
Just hold a clearance sale

727
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,540
in the farmers' market,

728
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,950
such as ten dollars for three catties.

729
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,620
I'm sure it's more lively than now.

730
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,750
Mr Zhou Chuan, okay, I admit

731
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,190
that the current situation

732
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,070
makes you mad.

733
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,590
[But you can rest assured.]

734
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,070
[Everything]

735
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,110
can...

736
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,870
Hello.

737
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,750
I came out at ten thirty.

738
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,470
How would I know
there'll be a traffic jam?

739
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,860
I haven't had my breakfast too.

740
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,470
What are you trying to say?

741
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,790
I didn't mean to be late.

742
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,870
I didn't know
there'll be a traffic accident.

743
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,750
I've tried to reach here as fast as I can.

744
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,670
Why are you telling me this?

745
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,590
I...

746
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,790
I'm afraid you'll start a fight
with the circulation department.

747
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,700
You might be

748
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,020
a dead meat when I reach

749
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,070
and come back to haunt me, asking me

750
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,350
why I didn't protect you.

751
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,670
The book fair is crowded.

752
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,820
I know you hate to go
to the crowded place.

753
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,830
So, I'm touched that you came.

754
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,230
My fans say

755
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,340
they wouldn't buy a book

756
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,630
from Yuan Yue Publishing House
if it wasn't for me.

757
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,830
Do you regret?

758
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,270
About what?

759
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,790
About choosing
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

760
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:40,630
There are tiresome
circulation departments,

761
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,870
illustrators who are hard to communicate,

762
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,110
and infuriating authors everywhere.

763
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,590
So, I regret nothing.

764
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,990
Let's go.

765
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,190
Let's go.

766
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,270
Excuse me! Excuse me!

767
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,630
That should be Maurer.

768
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,670
His book signing is going to
start at three o'clock.

769
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,550
Mr Zhou Chuan,

770
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,470
don't tell me you are starstruck.

771
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,390
Of course not.

772
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,030
I can have dinner with him tonight.

773
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,110
Luckily, you didn't lose your mind.

774
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,470
They sweep it all real quick.

775
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,790
It's only been five minutes

776
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,060
and they are done?

777
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,390
I guess the circulation department
went all out.

778
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,670
Mr Zhou Chuan!

779
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,670
Mr Zhou Chuan!

780
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,790
You're here.

781
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,580
Mr Liang

782
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,220
is waiting for you at the rest room.

783
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,070
Miao,

784
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,950
I'll mistake you as the member of

785
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,830
the circulation department
if I didn't know you're an editor.

786
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,950
We are all

787
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,790
from Yuan Yue Publishing House

788
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,670
and also the leaders
of Yuan Yue Publishing House.

789
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,420
There's no discrimination.

790
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,950
Old workers like us

791
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,830
are no match to the youngsters.

792
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,030
They have short temper.

793
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,230
We are just doing our jobs.

794
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:19,990
We'll just do

795
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,390
as the leaders told us to

796
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,510
no matter what position we hold.

797
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,980
Okay. Then,

798
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,470
I'll stop bothering you.

799
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,550
Chu Li, take me there.

800
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,630
This way, please.

801
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,510
Director Gu, are you all right?

802
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,310
You haven't rested these few days

803
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,070
to arrange

804
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,870
this event for Maurer.

805
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,510
And you've been standing for so long.

806
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,630
Why don't you go and
rest in the small room?

807
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,110
I'm fine. It's going to end soon.

808
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,510
I have to keep an eye on the event.

809
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,590
Thank you.

810
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,470
You're welcome.

811
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,870
Mr Zhou Chuan,

812
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,900
you've finally reached.

813
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,470
You must be tired. Have a seat.

814
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,230
You haven't eaten yet, right?
Let's eat first.

815
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,180
I'm not tired.

816
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,390
It's no match to
the circulation department.

817
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,310
That's our job.

818
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,310
Here. Eat it.

819
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,390
Drink some water.

820
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,710
Chu Li,

821
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,230
it's quite busy out there.

822
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,910
Go and help them.

823
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,270
Have you not eaten yet?

824
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,790
Here, eat it first.

825
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,310
Never mind, you eat it.

826
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,300
I'll go and help them.

827
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,740
Chu Li,

828
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,580
Mr Zhou Chuan has said it.

829
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,670
He shows you consideration.

830
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,340
Just eat it.

831
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,150
Here.

832
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,270
Sit here.

833
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,630
Thank you, Mr Zhou Chuan.

834
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,220
Mr Zhou Chuan, come sit here.

835
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,710
Here, sit.

836
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,630
You must be tired.

837
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,910
Everyone understands
you were stuck in the traffic.

838
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,550
Look.

839
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,190
I'm sorry.

840
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,190
You saw the strong reaction

841
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,470
of the role-playing enthusiasts
out there too.

842
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,230
I had no choice

843
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,430
but to extend an hour

844
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,870
for them

845
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,670
to calm them down.

846
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,510
You don't mind that, right?

847
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,510
I can understand that.

848
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:17,989
The role-playing has high popularity.

849
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,989
Masked men like us are

850
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,110
no match to them.

851
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,790
You can't sell yourself short.

852
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,190
You are young

853
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,949
but I think you have

854
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,350
the highest popularity

855
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,510
in this venue.

856
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,070
Right, Chu Li?

857
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:38,350
Xin Dun Books has invited Maurer over.

858
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,070
He seems famous

859
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,070
but I think that's about it.

860
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,179
You will pass him

861
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,429
in less than two years.

862
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,670
Right, we...

863
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,190
Have we added WeChat yet?

864
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:56,790
Let's add WeChat.

865
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,510
It'll be more convenient
for our future collaboration.

866
00:34:59,230 --> 00:34:59,870
Here.

867
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:00,870
All right.

868
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,220
Scan me.

869
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,710
Mr Zhou Chuan, I've read your book.

870
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,550
I believe it will achieve

871
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,950
the highest sales.

872
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,630
Our circulation department already
has a comprehensive plan.

873
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,710
Mr Liang,

874
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,830
didn't you just say

875
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,430
it's understaffed out there?

876
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,140
Right, I wonder

877
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,030
how they're doing

878
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,150
without me around.

879
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,830
I have to go check on them.

880
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,310
Look.

881
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,470
Enjoy your meal.

882
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,550
I've

883
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,750
sent it.

884
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,820
Please accept my request.

885
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,550
Mr Zhou Chuan,

886
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,710
may I ask you

887
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,820
about your mental journey
of being added on WeChat?

888
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,670
He'll get my WeChat contact

889
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,790
from Miao even if I didn't add him.

890
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,470
So,

891
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,910
what's the difference?

892
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,230
Can't I add him?

893
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,030
You can't.

894
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,950
Didn't I tell you?

895
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,220
Author is the weapon of an editor.

896
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,590
Didn't you agree with me?

897
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,310
Yes.

898
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,270
But now my weapon

899
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,030
goes in the enemy's sheath.

900
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,670
Rest assured, I won't betray you.

901
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,550
Look.

902
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,710
I didn't add him.

903
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,670
It's true.

904
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,350
But

905
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,580
aren't you afraid of offending him?

906
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,310
I tell you what.

907
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,150
People from the circulation department
are smooth talkers.

908
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,550
I'm afraid you'll be deceived.

909
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,910
Aren't you too hypocritical

910
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,910
to ask this question now?

911
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,670
Why would I be afraid
of offending them?

912
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,870
Isn't he the one

913
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,230
who made this...

914
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,310
Green Onion Flavour Snack Immortal?

915
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,030
It's too soft-hearted to create

916
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,510
such screen name for

917
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,430
a middle-aged man like him.

918
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,180
Is this Mr Liang's WeChat name?

919
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,510
It's so disgusting!

920
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,750
Eat it.

921
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,150
I don't want to eat. I'll go to work.

922
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,110
This looks awful.

923
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,910
You...

924
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,790
Suit yourself.

925
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,190
You're late.

926
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,700
Mr Maurer went back to the hotel.

927
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,310
I'm not Zhou Chuan.

928
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,470
I'm not that obsessed with Maurer.

929
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,310
So, you're here to

930
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,830
check out your brother's situation.

931
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,790
There are still

932
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,430
many of his fans at this hour.

933
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,750
Should I talk with them too?

934
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,510
In case I get a chance
to publish his books.

935
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,270
He won't sign it over to Xin Dun Books.

936
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,910
Life is full of uncertainties.

937
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,950
The venue is going to close soon.

938
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,310
Please make a rapid departure.

939
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,110
Stop queuing up!

940
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:48,910
Stop queuing up!

941
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,390
I've been queuing
for more than two hours.

942
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,790
The readers came all the way here.

943
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,710
They can't buy the book
after queuing up for a whole day.

944
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,310
Now that they ask them
to leave just like this.

945
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,470
Mister,

946
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,110
can you make an exception?

947
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,630
Just a few people left,

948
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,470
they'll leave after buying the book.

949
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,580
They've been queuing for so long.

950
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,510
I'm sorry.

951
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,990
Please cooperate with us too.

952
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,910
Fans and the staffs, clear out quick.

953
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,430
It would be a trouble if someone

954
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,270
got locked in the venue.

955
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,470
Dismiss! Dismiss!

956
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,110
Let's go! Let's go!

957
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:12,990
Yuan Yue Publishing House

958
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,990
is so unprofessional.

959
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,870
Jiang Yu Cheng,

960
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,310
here's a cautionary tale.

961
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,590
Do you want to consider Xin Dun Books?

962
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,830
I'm really sorry.

963
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,110
Today's event has ended.

964
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,750
Why don't you come back tomorrow?

965
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,950
We didn't get the autograph

966
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,830
and didn't buy the book.

967
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,510
Zhou Chuan is not
going to come tomorrow.

968
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,270
Sister, can you buy it for me first?

969
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,430
I'm going to study abroad and
my flight is on tomorrow morning.

970
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,750
I can't come even I want to.

971
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,270
Dismiss!

972
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,670
Stop checking out, please cooperate.

973
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,340
Leave.

974
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,470
I'm sorry.

975
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,310
I'm really sorry. Sorry.

976
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:09,990
Are you hurt?

977
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,950
Stop rubbing it.

978
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,900
Thank you.

979
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,620
You still wear high heels
to the book fair

980
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,270
where you need to stand all day?

981
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,750
Didn't I say I have

982
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,270
something to tell you after I return?

983
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,110
Can we start over?

984
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,990
I've already written

985
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,550
what I want to tell you on the card.

986
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,860
Then can we start a new journey?

987
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,310
Why bother to try again if the ending

988
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,190
is still the same?

989
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,790
Go buy her a pair of shoes.

990
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,030
Flat shoes.

991
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,270
Do you still care about her?

992
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,310
You still care about her, right?

993
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,590
Don't wear this.

994
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,580
I'll buy you a pair of flat shoes.

995
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,710
Yun Fei,

996
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,910
I'm sorry.

997
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,550
I'm being too selfish.

998
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,270
I didn't care

999
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,990
about your feelings.

1000
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,550
It's all right, sister.

1001
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,670
I won't do

1002
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,030
anything childish from now on.

1003
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,870
I've figured it out in these days.

1004
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,780
I'll court you when I

1005
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,510
become a grown man

1006
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,110
and have the capability.

1007
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:00,910
Where's your ending script?

1008
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,110
When are you going to send it to me?

1009
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,340
Stop making me rush you.

1010
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,630
This is the first step to grow.

1011
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,180
Why do you rush me
as soon as you see me?

1012
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,350
Sister, I've been
avoiding you for days.

1013
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,670
You keep circling back
to the same topic.

1014
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,150
Okay, I'll stop talking.

1015
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,110
Go and buy the shoes.

1016
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,510
I need to attend the banquet later.

1017
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,230
Okay, I'll go now.

1018
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,070
Wait for me.

1019
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,750
Wait for me.

1020
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,510
Miao,

1021
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,550
have you seen this sales before?

1022
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,430
It takes only half a day.

1023
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,510
Didn't he break the record?

1024
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,030
Yes.

1025
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,420
Zhou Chuan is amazing.

1026
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,310
Mr Zhou Chuan,

1027
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,380
you're here.

1028
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,230
Youth are to be regarded with respect.

1029
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,310
What did I tell you?

1030
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,190
Why wait 2 years?

1031
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,830
You'll pass Maurer tomorrow.

1032
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,350
Right,

1033
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,110
just from...

1034
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,070
Judging from this situation alone,

1035
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,550
you're much better than
Maurer's personal book tour.

1036
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,630
Yes.

1037
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,150
Mr Zhou Chuan,

1038
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,430
I'm really sorry about today.

1039
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,590
It's our problem.

1040
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,470
I think Yuan Yue Publishing House

1041
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,630
should apologize to

1042
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,630
the readers for today's matter

1043
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,990
and we have to give them
the corresponding compensations.

1044
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:16,860
Of course.

1045
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,870
Miao, let's call a meeting
right away when we're back.

1046
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,790
Notify everyone of the meeting.

1047
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,630
To summarize the gains
and losses of today's work.

1048
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,670
Noted.

1049
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,750
As for the readers,

1050
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,150
we have to give them an explanation.

1051
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,470
Yes, we need to explain to them.

1052
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,670
Mr Zhou Chuan,
the books sold well today.

1053
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:32,590
I'll treat you, let's go.

1054
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,550
Let's have supper.

1055
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,870
Zhou Chuan, you finally came out.

1056
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,590
We'll take your car.

1057
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,550
Mr Zhou Chuan,

1058
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,550
can I please talk to you for a second?

1059
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,310
Mr Zhou Chuan,

1060
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,510
just tell me if you have any decision.

1061
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,190
It's all right. I can take it.

1062
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,950
It would be hard to
explain to the readers

1063
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,350
if I sign Huang Quan Inn over
to Yuan Yue Publishing House

1064
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,270
after what had happened.

1065
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:05,350
You mean Huang Quan Inn is now

1066
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,870
owned by Xin Dun Books,

1067
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,190
right?
