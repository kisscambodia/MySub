[Episode 20]

4
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,670
Jiang Yu Cheng.

5
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,229
Happy new year.

6
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,180
Happy new year.

7
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,420
What do you want this time, man?

8
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,590
Why do you keep bugging me today?

9
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,790
[Come out and eat with me.]

10
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,290
[Hi, Magic City]

11
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,950
Is this a place to eat?

12
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,260
Don't you think it's
too early to be in a bar?

13
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,710
I'm feeling down, so I'm having
wine for dinner, any problem with that?

14
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,030
What's the matter?

15
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,230
Chu Li didn't make you dinner tonight?

16
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,829
She went home early for Chinese New Year.

17
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,110
No wonder.

18
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,710
I was just wondering why you have
been clinging to me like Er Gou today.

19
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,829
Speaking of which,

20
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,740
tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

21
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,750
Remember

22
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,710
to leave in the morning.

23
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,470
I got it.

24
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,070
You are as nagging as my mum.

25
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,430
Why do you want to go home this year?

26
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,060
There is no one in the house.

27
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,990
Might as well just go home

28
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,590
and listen to my old man nagging.

29
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,590
You've never been so lonely on your own

30
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,190
on Chinese New Year in the past, have you?

31
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,190
You asked too many questions.

32
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,710
It's so cold out here,
why are we coming out?

33
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,110
I am wearing light clothing only.

34
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,630
Let the air cool your head.

35
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,510
So you can stop asking questions
that you shouldn't ask.

36
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,630
I actually have question for you.

37
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,510
If...

38
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,590
If the female lead in my book

39
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,990
was already in love with someone,

40
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,110
yet she kissed the male lead,
what was on her mind?

41
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,500
Already in love with someone?

42
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,310
Don't tell me you still think

43
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,909
Chu Li likes Mr Fox.

44
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,470
I am talking about the
leading characters in my book.

45
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,830
It's been long enough.

46
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,270
If I still haven't figured out that

47
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,870
Mr Fox was just her excuse to reject me,

48
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,990
then I'd have wasted 30 years of
my life learning nothing.

49
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,070
What do you mean?

50
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,750
Did she often take the initiative
to send Mr Fox message?

51
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,110
Did she share everything
in her life with him?

52
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,710
Not really.

53
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,270
Because we don't usually talk much.

54
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,470
But she replied to Mr Fox's messages,

55
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,620
and not mine.

56
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,750
Do you really not know the reason?

57
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,990
Put together the touching love story

58
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,590
you told me at breakfast

59
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,230
with my understanding of
your emotional intelligence,

60
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,260
there is a reason for you

61
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,430
being single until now.

62
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,870
Hey,

63
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,150
we are having a friendly
conversation here,

64
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,510
what's with your personal attack?

65
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,630
You've only had a girlfriend,
Gu Bai Zhi in 30 years of your life.

66
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,150
How are you better than me?

67
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,990
What's the matter?

68
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,590
What happened between you and Monstress?

69
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,790
Nothing.

70
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,350
Jiang Yu Cheng,

71
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,860
I have a question for you.

72
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,590
Go on.

73
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,870
When you said you liked Chu Li,

74
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,110
did you really like her,

75
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,630
or did you like that

76
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,350
she reminded you of
the way Gu Bai Zhi once was?

77
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,630
Their personalities,

78
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,670
their looks, their ways of doing things

79
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,220
are completely different, okay?

80
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,100
That's true.

81
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,150
Chu Li is so much better than her.

82
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,270
It's just that sometimes,

83
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,140
they show the same spirit that

84
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,470
keeps them moving forward

85
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,070
until they get what they want.

86
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,470
My daughter is home!

87
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,110
Stop shouting.

88
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,430
Are you afraid that
our neighbours don't know

89
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,270
your unfilial daughter is back?

90
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,190
You gave me a fright.

91
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,870
I thought you and
your mum started arguing again.

92
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,070
I came back as soon as
I was done with my work.

93
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,950
You were crying wolf, you know?

94
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,310
No.

95
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,990
I thought about it that

96
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,180
I am now a year older than I was

97
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,150
when I ran away from home,

98
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,950
I have to be more sensible than her,

99
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,510
so I resist my impulse.

100
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,790
By the way, I brought you guys

101
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,590
a wellness gift package.

102
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,550
A gift package.

103
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,830
Check out this shampoo,

104
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,230
it can improve the blood circulation
to the scalp

105
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,110
and prevent hair loss.

106
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,500
It smells nice too.

107
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,070
It can prevent hair loss too?

108
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,670
And this one.

109
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,390
It's good for your health
to eat more goji berries.

110
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,870
And use these health
foot patches at night.

111
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,990
Right, goji berry tea is good.

112
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,950
Dinner is ready.

113
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,070
Let's eat, let's eat.

114
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,150
Do I have to invite you?

115
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,270
Come on, come on.

116
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,190
I say,

117
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,550
Mum,

118
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,750
did you know that I made a book?

119
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,790
No.

120
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,790
I don't have time to read book.

121
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,350
I am very busy.

122
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,310
How do you explain
this receipt for the purchase of

123
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,550
50 Book of Luo He God?

124
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,470
You are the only one in our family
who has the patience to keep receipts.

125
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,710
A friend asked me to buy it for her.

126
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,750
What?

127
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,590
You actually made this book?

128
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,870
My soup is ready.

129
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,190
Your mother won't let me tell you.

130
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,470
She already knew you made the book.

131
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,510
She read that book until
two o'clock in the morning,

132
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,750
and she finished it.

133
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,790
We are really happy for you.

134
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,950
Keep it up.

135
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,910
Hot soup coming through.

136
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,470
Here.

137
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,270
Even the food can't shut you up.

138
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,830
I will shut up.

139
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,510
And you.

140
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,190
I say

141
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,430
if Grandpa knows how well you are doing,

142
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,590
he will be really happy.

143
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,510
Come, it's been a long time

144
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,750
since our family ate together.

145
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,630
Here.

146
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,750
Have some of this silkie chicken.

147
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,070
Nourish your body.

148
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,190
Come on.

149
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,670
I made it for myself.

150
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,590
I didn't say it's for her.

151
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,550
It's for both of you.

152
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,100
-Come on, have some of it.
-Serve her some.

153
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,310
How can I be so sober
despite I have been drinking?

154
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,630
Sometimes, being a good drinker

155
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,870
isn't a good thing indeed.

156
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,140
Unlike someone.

157
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,510
Er Gou,

158
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,150
what do you think Chu Li is doing now?

159
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,070
How could she be so cruel?

160
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,030
She doesn't reply to my message.

161
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,460
I've set you up for a date
on the first day of New Year.

162
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,830
You are going on a blind date

163
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,150
with the boy introduced by Mrs Lee.

164
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,110
Blind date?

165
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,070
I am still young.

166
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,470
You call yourself young?

167
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,070
Your mum said

168
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,900
you're all alone in Shanghai
with no one to look after you.

169
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,630
You don't even have a boyfriend.

170
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,390
Your mum is worried about you.

171
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,910
I can look after myself.

172
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,700
You need money to look after yourself

173
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,830
Given the little amount of your salary,

174
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,550
how can you look after yourself?

175
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,310
I have looked into him.

176
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,150
This boy

177
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,860
works for a finance company in Shanghai.

178
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,750
He's an eligible bachelor.

179
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,990
Meet him.

180
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,430
No, I am not going.

181
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,460
Are you going against me

182
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,220
on everything now?

183
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,270
If you don't want to go on the blind date,

184
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,190
that's fine,

185
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,950
tell me then,

186
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,110
do you have a boyfriend?

187
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,990
No.

188
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,990
Listen to her.

189
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,030
Fine.

190
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,950
I will take another step back.

191
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,110
Did you meet any boy you like?

192
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,550
Who is this?

193
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,560
[Saviour]

194
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,350
Why is he calling on New Year's Eve?
Hang up.

195
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,300
No one. It's just a blind date,

196
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,790
I'll go.

197
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,550
Did she hang up on...

198
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,750
How to apologize to your girlfriend?

199
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,510
First, throw a glass on the floor

200
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,270
and see how she reacts.

201
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,390
If she doesn't react at all,

202
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,990
then you're in big trouble, my friend.

203
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,350
She is really mad at you.

204
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,150
Now, get down on your knees

205
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,630
on the broken glass.

206
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,430
What the heck is this?

207
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,350
How is it that nine out of ten tips here

208
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,870
are teaching the ways to
get down on your knees?

209
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,950
This is more like the 99 tips

210
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,340
to get down on your knees.

211
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,150
Don't say anything,

212
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,230
hold her in your arms

213
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,020
and kiss her.

214
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,710
This one feels like a solid idea.

215
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,980
Unfortunately, we are
not in the same space now.

216
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,470
Don't use any trick,

217
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,100
just give her a heartfelt
and sincere apology.

218
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,110
I am sorry.

219
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,910
Mum, I am home!

220
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,790
You are home, son.

221
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,630
Your favourite bun is almost ready.

222
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,070
Eat some apples first.

223
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,030
Never mind, I am going
upstairs to take a nap.

224
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,950
What kind of son doesn't come home

225
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,350
for Chinese New Year for a few years?

226
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,670
And you are going to sleep
after you finally came home?

227
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,710
If you don't want to come home,

228
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,660
don't.

229
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,470
Ignore your dad.

230
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,790
Look at your dark eye circles,

231
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,110
did you not rest well?

232
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,110
Go upstairs and take a nap.

233
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,430
Call me when dinner's ready then, Mum.

234
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,460
Okay.

235
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,790
Don't you know why he didn't come home

236
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,750
for Chinese New Year?

237
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,070
I am warning you.

238
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,270
It's New Year's Eve.

239
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,820
I don't want to see you two fighting.

240
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,310
If you fight on New Year's Eve,

241
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,830
you are going to fight
every day after this.

242
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,750
Who cares to fight with him?

243
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,710
Here, here.

244
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,270
Look at this, our daughter

245
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,470
knows how to take care of us.

246
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,790
She has been helping us out all day.

247
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,910
If she really is sensible,

248
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,550
she should come back early
and work in her hometown.

249
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,830
That's sensible.

250
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,430
It's New Year's Eve.

251
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,310
Here.

252
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,270
Let's raise our glasses, come on.

253
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,750
In the new year,

254
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,590
I wish you all the best.

255
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,750
May all your wishes come true.

256
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,460
Come back early and work in your hometown.

257
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,100
Okay, drink up, drink up.

258
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,300
It's so spicy.

259
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,830
Try some of this.

260
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,230
Tell me if it's crispy.

261
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,700
How is it?

262
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
Very nice.

263
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,110
It's not overfried.

264
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,190
Not bad for a first time.

265
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,150
That's right.

266
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,990
Son,

267
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,150
have some more of this.

268
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,710
Thanks, Mum.

269
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,190
Shanghai doesn't have this, does it?

270
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,980
When you are eating,

271
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,270
don't play with your phone.

272
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,190
Your mother has worked hard
all afternoon to make these.

273
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,190

274
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,550
you've slept until now.

275
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,390

with your phone during dinner.

276
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,150
Mum,

277
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,030
it's really good, you are a good cook.

278
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,940
Have more of it if it's good.

279
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,020
Your father knew you
were coming back this year,

280
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,390
so he didn't call any of your relatives.

281
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,950
He just wanted us

282
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,710
to have a nice family dinner.

283
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,990
Why are you telling
him these useless stuff?

284
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,510
Don't mind his attitude,

285
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,310
he has been looking forward to
having you home for New Year's Eve.

286
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,990
He asked me to cook
all these dishes for you.

287
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,940
Our son gave it to you, take it.

288

It's not like you won't go

370
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,870
if I don't want you to go.

371
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,870
If you don't want me to go,

372
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,910
I won't go.

373
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,910
Don't go then.

374
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,260
Bye bye.

375
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,310
[Chief Yu, happy new year.]

376
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,270
Why are you still playing with your phone

377
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,390
on New Year's Eve?

378
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,560
[Yu Yao: Happy New Year.]

379
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,950
My colleague sent me New Year greetings.

380
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,310
Mum,

381
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,990
why don't I take him back to the room?

382
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,670
Isn't he doing fine sleeping here?

383
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,790
He will catch a cold if he sleeps here.

384
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,830
It's cold out there.

385
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,870
I will take him inside then.

386
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,110
Why did you have to upset my mum?

387
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,990
She has been cooking all day.

388
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,390
She made us so many dishes by herself.

389
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,590
How come she didn't even get
a simple thank you at the end?

390
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,470
I didn't mean to upset her.

391
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,510
I'd booked a restaurant
for New Year's Eve dinner,

392
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,110
but she insisted on eating at home.

393
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,670
Can you call it a New Year's Eve dinner
if you eat out?

394
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,030
It's fine that most of the time

395
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,510
you don't cook because you are too busy,

396
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,030
but it's New Year's Eve,

397
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,310
and you still want to eat out?

398
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,500
I don't want to argue with you now.

399
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,950
By the way,

400
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,630
I promised my mum that I
will bring Qiu Qiu to visit her

401
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,630
on the second day of Chinese New Year.

402
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,190
My mother came all the way
to spend the festival with us,

403
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,860
and you are leaving with
our son the second day?

404
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,940
Does it sound right to not visit
my family for New Year?

405
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,140
I've booked us a flight to Sanya
on the third day of the festival.

406
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,510
The three of us, together with my mum,

407
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,750
are going to spend a few days there.

408
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,870
We will come back on the
seventh day of the festival.

409
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,420
What do you mean by you booked a flight?

410
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,430
Why didn't you discuss with me first?

411
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,150
Can we still go if I had
discussed with you?

412
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,150
Think about it,

413
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,110
Since Qiu Qiu was born,

414
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,950
tell me one time we didn't cancel our trip

415
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,710
because you were busy at work.

416
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,470
Seventh day is not good for me.

417
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,630
I have a lot to do in my office.

418
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,660
It's your choice,

419
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,590
if you can't go,

420
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,590
I will just bring our son and mum with me.

It's snowing.

432
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,750
I wished you already before,

433
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,790
but I want to wish you again,

434
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,870

No, I am fine.

439

But listen to your voice.

440

You didn't go to Ms Liu's
place either, did you?

441

443
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,030
Yes.

447
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,430
Okay.

I've got you two bowls.

460
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,540
Try it.

461
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,110
Thank you for the new cloth, Mum.

462

It's so pretty.

About the blind date this afternoon,

464
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,070
can I skip it?

465
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,150
No.

466

I don't care if you're real or fake,

steamed, boiled or braised,

470

you are going.

471
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,750
Or else, what am I going to tell

472
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,150
the matchmaker?

473
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,420
It's 5pm, don't be late.

475
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:54,990
Let me tell you,

476
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,670
I put up with you the other day.

477
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,470
Today is the first day of the festival.

478
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,470
At 6am.

479
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,060
You started calling me at 6am.

480
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,070
What the heck do you want?

481
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,990
I just couldn't wait

482
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,830
to give you my Chinese New Year greetings.

483
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,710
I...

484
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,150
Thanks a lot.

485
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,910
Don't call me again.

486
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,270
Since you are here,

487
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,510
do you know how hard it is

488
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,500
to find a shop that is open on
the first day of Chinese New Year?

489
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,350
You've ordered my food for me?

490
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,460
Lay it out, what nasty thing
is on your mind?

491
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,510
My male lead and female lead

492
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,870
have worked it out.

493
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,350
You are together now?

494
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,430
Close enough.

495
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,830
Still need a perfect timing.

496
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,180
Why does a love confession need a timing?

497
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,710
Isn't that just take you like a sentence?

498
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,140
You are so vulgar.

499
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,900
Such things can't just be said.

500
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,910
It needs to be done sophisticatedly.

501
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,670
Sophisticatedly like how?

502
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,550
It's like a love letter,

503
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,670
if you simply write I like you,

504
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,790
it's too crude.

505
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,270
You need to let her receive the
love letter through a sophisticated way.

506
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,670
This is called tacit understanding.

507
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,150
Do you get it?

508
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,150
Whether I get it or not doesn't matter,

509
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,830
but in my experience,

510
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,460
most girls

511
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,990
don't get it.

512
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,110
My male lead and female lead
are nothing like

513
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,790
a vulgar person like you.

514
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,830
So, how are you going
to deliver your love letter?

515
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,100
I...

516
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,790
I am still

517
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,470
contemplating.

518
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,870
You are dilly-dallying.

519
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,140
Be careful that someone may
snatch the female lead away.

520
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,990
How is that possible?

521
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,670
The female lead has turned down

522
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,790
a blind date for the male lead.

523
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,700
Are you that confident?

524
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,900
Careful that things may go sideways.

525
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,710
That's impossible.

526
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,750
I've got it all figured out.

527
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,750
After Chinese New Year, the male lead

528
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,710
is going to deliver his
thoughtfully written love letter,

529
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,270
and the female lead

530
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,510
will be in tears by then.

531
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,420
Chu Li looks quite good in this outfit.

532
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,030
What is it?

533
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,630
New clothes?

534
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,310
Why is she wearing new clothes?

535
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,670
Is she lack of clothes?

536
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,550
Who is she going to
meet in her new clothes?

537
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,060
She can't be going on
a blind date, can she?

538
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,470
You jinxed it again.

539
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,390
Some guy is now trying
to snatch her from me.

540
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,750
How would I know?

541
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,990
Besides, it's normal to wear
new clothes on Chinese New Year.

542
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,870
Everyone do the same.

543
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,390
Not me.

544
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,630
We are grown up now.

545
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,180
Wearing new clothes on Chinese New Year?

546
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,740
What? Like you can't buy
new clothes at other times?

547
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,150
Why must you wear it on the festival only?

548
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,270
Do you think I should go see her?

549
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,030
Do you think everyone is like you?

550
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,310
What are you going to
say after you see her?

551
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:53,790
I...

552
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,790
Ask her why she is wearing new clothes?

553
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,670
Can't I give her my
Chinese New Year greetings?

554
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,110
I have to go now.

555
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,830
Are you serious right now?

556
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,270
It's the first day of
Chinese New Year, man.

557
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,110
Careful that your dad is
going to break your leg.

558
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,110
[Mr Zhou, it's true that Chu Li
has gone on a blind date.]

559
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,910
[I've found out the address
of their meeting place.]

560
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,390
[And I've sent it to you.]

561
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,260
Thanks.

562
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,750
I'm in finance,

563
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,790
I don't make a lot of money a year,

564
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,430
but I can certainly

565
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,950
afford to support a family.

566
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,270
Good to know.

567
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,590
I am not getting any younger.

568
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,390
So, my mum has been urging me

569
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,710
to get married next year.

570
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,790
Next year?

571
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,350
It's okay.

572
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,750
If you think next year is too fast,

573
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,190
we can postpone it a bit.

574
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,510
We will see.

575
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,550
I heard that you work
for a publishing house.

576
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,510
Do people still buy books these days?

577
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,710
Yes, they do.

578
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,710
Waiter, more water here, please.

579
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,310
It's okay, no need.

580
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,990
Don't bother.

581
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,590
It's fine, don't be shy.

582
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,350
And what are you responsible for?

583
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,590
Literary works?

584
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,870
I will check it out sometime.

585
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,830
I am responsible for novels.

586
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,510
If you don't have a preference,

587
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,790
you can check out Moonlight Magazine.

588
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,190
You can find many
interesting serials there.

589
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,510
Here's your water.

590
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,350
Novel,

591
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,950
I really haven't read one
for quite some years.

592
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,100
I think reading novel is a waste of time.

593
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,750
It's not worth my time.

594
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,790
Hey! What are you doing?

595
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,990
Sorry, sorry.

596
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,870
Watch what you are doing, seriously.

597
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,390
Sorry.

598
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,230
I think he didn't mean to do it.

599
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,190
Why don't you go clean up in the gents?

600
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,910
Excuse me.

601
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,470
What are you doing here?

602
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,340
I came to see you going on a blind date.

603
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,470
That man seems nice.

604
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,350
No, no.

605
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,550
I was planning to leave
after I finished this meal.

606
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,460
My mum forced me to come.

607
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,670
Excuse me,

608
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,870
sorry for the wait.

609
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,670
Where were we just now?

610
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,990
Novel right?

611
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,550
Is the e-book version quite costly?

612
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,870
Do you have any internal edition

613
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:17,950
that I can look at?

614
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,820
E-book version? It's not expensive.

615
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,230
It's about 10 yuan per copy.

616
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,430
This is not about its price,

617
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,950
or the money,

618
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,230
buying books is an investment.

619
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,420
I haven't even seen the product yet,

620
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:29,950
so how do I know

621
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,430
if it's worth the price?

622
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,310
Am I right...

623
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,310
Hey!

624
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,310
What are you doing?
This is the second time!

625
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,990
I've had enough with you, you know?

626
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,070
I think the worth of it

627
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,630
is not determined by the price,

628
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,910
but by the person who read the book.

629
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,060
What do you think?

630
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,950
What was that supposed to mean?

631
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,870
What by the person who read the book?

632
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,670
I mean, Mr Chen,

633
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,660
I have something to do, I have to go.

634
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,670
And, Mr Chen,

635
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,710
I will get the check.

636
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,990
Wait.

637
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:53,910
What was that supposed to mean? Come back!

638
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,750
Come back here.

639
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,110
Is there anyone who can assist me?

640
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,550
What kind of waiter is he?

641
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,150
Slow down, Mr Zhou.

642
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,710
I can't keep up with you.

643
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,510
It's because my mother has
made a promise to someone else,

644
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,990
there's no other way
for me to wriggle out of it.

645
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,700
I didn't do it on purpose.

646
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,390
I think you did it on purpose.

647
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,590
This is new clothes, right?

648
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,100
I haven't seen you wear it before.

649
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,420
My mother bought it for me,

650
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,180
I can't not wear it, can I?

651
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,750
You always have a reason.

652
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,310
It's me who's being
heartless and unreasonable,

653
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,430
and neglected your feelings.

654
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,670
It's me who drove four hours here

655
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,630
to see you and your blind date
having a good time.

656
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,830
I am sorry.

657
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,150
I know I made a mistake.

658
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,270
No, you didn't.

659
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,270
I made a mistake.

660
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,830
I shouldn't have come over to stop you

661
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,390
from getting married to a man in finance.

662
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,950
Can you stop speaking in anger?

663
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,510
Look, I even curled

664
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,750
my hair on purpose.

665
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,990
Look how ugly I look.

666
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,030
It's not ugly.

667
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,750
These little curls are cute.

668
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,310
You are right.

669
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,220
Ah Xiang has curly hair like this,

670
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,190
it's cute.

671
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,510
I didn't say Ah Xiang is cute.

672
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,620
Not just this,

673
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,630
I had a big fight with my mum yesterday,

674
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,790
and I cried.

675
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,950
You cried?

676
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,990
I can't trust you anymore.

677
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,870
It's true.

678
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,230
You see, you see.

679
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,670
How about I remove my make-up?

680
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,750
My eyes are swollen, look at them.

681
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,550
You even put on make-up?

682
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,910
Well, it's for...

683
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,910
Forget it.

684
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,110
Look at the little freckles on my face,

685
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,310
my date wouldn't like me

686
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,990
if he saw me like this.

687
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,100
All right, I

688
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,030
forgive you.

689
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,990
Really?

690
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,510
But don't do it again.

691
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,750
And no more crying.

692
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,630
Absolutely, no next time.

693
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,750
By the way, Mr Zhou,

694
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,300
how did you know I was here?

695
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,820
Take a guess.

696
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,310
Mr Zhou, I am home.

697
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,630
Off you go.

698
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,870
Would you like to come in?

699
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,310
It's not a good idea
to go in empty-handed.

700
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,270
Next time.

701
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,910
So, you're just going to go back?

702
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,230
How long will it take to drive back?

703
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,950
Just four hours.

704
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,830
I'm a little tired today.

705
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,710
So, it's not a good idea to drive back.

706
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,070
Since I am already here,

707
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,389
might as well just stay for one more day.

708
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,420
Really?

709
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,739
Really!

710
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,620
Let me tell you,

711
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,429
there is so much to eat and

712
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,790
so much to do in my hometown.

713
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,270
Wait here, let me book
a hotel room for you right now.

714
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,780
Given your little salary, forget it.

715
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,150
Just go in.

716
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,190
Let me book it for you.

717
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,550
Just go in!

718
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:32,389
Okay.

719
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,870
I will come find you tomorrow.

720
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,750
Okay.

721
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,870
Hello, Mum.

722
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,710
Son, where are you now?

723
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,350
Why aren't you back yet?

724
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,510
I am

725
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:01,030
going away to Zhejiang for two days.

726
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,190
I won't be home for now.

727
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,750
You are in Zhejiang?

728
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,430
What are you doing in Zhejiang
on the first day of the festival?

729
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,910
[Why didn't you tell us first?]

730
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,150
I've got something going on.

731
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,390
What could you have going on?

732
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,950
Do you still care about us?

733
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,790
[No sons do this like you do.]

734
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,190
[I have to go now, bye.]

735
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,060
[Mr Zhou,]

736
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,670
[I'm taking you to do
something big tomorrow.]

737
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,870
Hello, your food is here.

738
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,950
Miss?

739
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,830
Miss, what's the matter with you?

740
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,070
Are you okay?

741
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,630
Miss!

742
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,540
Wake up!

743
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,150
Hello, hi.

744
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,190
[Hello, hi.]

745
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,910
[Is this Mr Jiang Yu Cheng?]

746
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,110
Hello, Mum.

747
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,430
Something urgent has come up,
I'm going back to Shanghai.

748
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,270
Tell Dad for me.

749
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,630
[Why are you going back all of a sudden?]

750
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,830
Mum, I'm driving now.

751
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,830
Talk later.

752
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,030
[DeltaHealth]

753
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,100
Nurse,

754
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,230
what ward is Gu Bai Zhi in?

755
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,110
Ward 302.

756
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,310
Thanks.

757
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,310
Relax, you're fine now.

758
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,790
We will observe your condition first.

759
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,390
If there is nothing wrong,

760
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,590
you can be discharged.

761
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,060
Okay.

762
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,230
Thank you, doctor.

763
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,110
Okay.

764
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,990
Are you her family?

765
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,830
No, I'm her friend.

766
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,270
Patient with acute gastroenteritis

767
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,660
can't eat these.

768
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,150
We will observe her condition first.

769
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,390
If she doesn't vomit,

770
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,470
let her have some porridge first.

771
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,990
She is weak now and

772
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,830
needs to be looked after.

773
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,790
Okay, thank you, doctor.

774
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,310
You didn't take medicine, did you?

775
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,990
How else could a small cold

776
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,710
develop into acute gastroenteritis?

777
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,790
How did you know I am in hospital?

778
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,270
Your emergency contact at this hospital

779
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,870
is still me.

780
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,590
Sorry,

781
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,230
I forgot to change it.

782
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,390
I will change it later.

783
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,070
Leave it.

784
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,550
Are we there?

785
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:37,950
You are awake.

786
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,190
Isn't this your place?

787
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,430
Come on.

788
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,780
I can manage.

789
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,950
What if you go home by yourself

790
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,950
and faint again?

791
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,910
You can let me down now.

792
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,380
Okay.

793
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,150
You can sleep in the room.

794
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,550
I can just sleep on the couch.

795
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,900
Just give me a blanket.

796
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,950
What if you catch a cold again?

797
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,390
I won't.

798
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:34,870
What's your problem?

799
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,870
It's not like you've
never slept here before?

800
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,150
I will be in the living room.

801
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,230
Go and get some sleep.

802
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,790
So, this is...

803
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,590
Keep your voice down.

804
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,230
This is the big thing
you were talking about?

805
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,270
This was my high school.

806
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,550
Every day at 12pm,

807
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,710
the security guards
will change shifts here.

808
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,780
We have one minute

809
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,990
to sneak in.

810
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,230
Sneak in?

811
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,510
Sneak in to revisit
the memory of your youth?

812
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,510
No.

813
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,190
Sneak in to get something out.

814
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,030
You will see later.

815
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:32,710
Liu,

816
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,550
what's wrong with this walkie-talkie?

817
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,190
The connection is probably weak.

818
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,900
There is some issue with it.

819
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,870
Your report yesterday,

820
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,430
I have submitted it.

821
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,070
Is it out of battery?

822
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,660
Yes, probably.

823
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,860
I have submitted it yesterday.

824
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,110
Yes, the frequency now is 285.

825
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,790
Go now.

826
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,790
28.5

827
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,870
Write this down in the handover book.

828
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,990
The thing I'm looking for

829
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,030
is down here.

830
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,070
Digging a hole?

831
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,590
Did you really think
of yourself as Er Gou?

832
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,350
Of course not.

833
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,030
We are using these.

834
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,020
This is...

835
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,950
This is a short story I wrote

836
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,070
when I was in high school.

837
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,430
You didn't expect that, did you?

838
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,030
My original dream was to be an author.

839
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,350
It was poorly written, right?

840
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,990
I wrote a lot of short stories

841
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,380
like this back then.

842
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,790
I was going to send them all
to Yuan Yue Publishing House.

843
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,190
Until I saw

844
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,980
Mr Jiang's The Disappearing Zoo.

845
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,830
And I thought to myself,

846
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,270
oh my,

847
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,470
I would never be able to write

848
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:06,140
a novel like this in my life.

849
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,310
How could anyone be so wildly creative

850
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:11,510
and logical at the same time?

851
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,990
So, I gave up

852
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,350
and I became Mr Jiang's fan.

853
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,070
But I couldn't throw them away,

854
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,710
so I buried them here.

855
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,660
You called me here today

856
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,710
so that I could listen to you

857
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,390
talking about your star-struck journey?

858
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,590
Of course not.

859
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,430
I just want to share

860
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,870
my past with you.
