00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,000
[Episode 19]

4
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,270
Mr Zhou Chuan,

5
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,470
let me know if you have made

6
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,590
any decision.

7
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,470
It's all right, I can take it.

8
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,789
You are trying to say that

9
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,590
Huang Quan Inn belongs to Xin Dun Books,

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,950
right?

11
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,350
Something like this
has happened.

12
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,150
If I still let Yuan Yue Publishing
House to publish Huang Quan Inn,

13
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,990
I can't explain to my readers

14
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,550
it also goes against my own principles.

15
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:14,870
But I don't think you're wrong.

16
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,710
If you were to be punished for this,

17
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,470
it would not be appropriate.

18
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,220
I...

19
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,950
There is no such thing as punishment.

20
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,150
We are all in the same boat

21
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,790
as Yuan Yue Publishing House.

22
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,550
When something bad has happened,
no one could

23
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,710
escape responsibility.

24
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,350
However, as the editor of
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

25
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,860
should I now

26
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,790
hug your thighs

27
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,380
and beg you not to give up on us?

28
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,910
Does this work?

29
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,990
No.

30
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,780
I knew it.

31
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,070
You used to be the one
who cared about me.

32
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,820
This time, I'll learn to care about you.

33
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,670
So, I won't put you
in a difficult situation.

34
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,540
Anyway,

35
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,150
since you have finished writing
Huang Quan Inn,

36
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,590
can you serialise a new long story

37
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,460
in Moonlight Magazine again?

38
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,620
What are you laughing at?

39
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,390
I laughed at you, who're
unwilling to take a loss.

40
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,830
Even if you lose a sesame seeds,
you have to pick up a watermelon.

41
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,830
It's been on your mind
for a long time, right?

42
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,310
No, it's a tentative idea.

43
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,190
Well, I thought of it for quite a while.

44
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,390
Go back quickly.

45
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,829
Don't speculate on my mind here.

46
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,630
-Go.
-I...

47
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,990
Xin Dun Books signed Huang Quan Inn.

48
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,310
It happened just now.

49
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,190
What?

50
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,990
Say that again.

51
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,020
Didn't he say that he will let us sign

52
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,550
Huang Quan Inn?

53
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,710
Well...

54
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,590
Chu Li.

55
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,150
Don't tell Director Yang about this yet.

56
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,390
You're close with Zhou Chuan,
aren't you?

57
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,310
Go and talk to him.

58
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,540
Go, don't just stand here. Go.

59
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,910
Mr Liang,

60
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,500
I have just sent the message
into the large group.

61
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,870
When did you start to have a brain?

62
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,470
Hello.

63
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,790
Director Yang. Yes.

64
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,990
[Mr Xia just called me]

65
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,030
[and told me everything
that happened this afternoon.]

66
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,750
[This afternoon, when you asked me to]

67
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,310
[to add a scene of cosplay,]

68
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,510
[why didn't you mention that]

69
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,590
[Book of Luo He God's author disagreed?]

70
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,909
[I let you manage a little more
of the publishing house's work,]

71
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:02,909
[but now,]

72
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:04,590
[we've lost a book.]

73
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,030
Director Yang, let me explain.

74
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,470
What happened this afternoon

75
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,790
was because those cosplayers

76
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,620
were too enthusiastic.

77
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,190
If I rashly stopped them,

78
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,430
I was afraid something would happen.

79
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,430
At first...

80
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,430
Miao, come here.

81
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,030
Wait a minute, Director Yang.

82
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,270
Miao will explain to you. Miao!

83
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,030
Chu Li.

84
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,710
We've harmed others
without benefiting ourselves.

85
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,270
What about Suo Heng?

86
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,150
Chief Editor Yu,

87
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,630
I didn't intend to take revenge on

88
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,390
Liang Chong Lang and Miao.

89
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,470
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

90
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,390
I'll persuade Mr Zhou Chuan.

91
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,659
You just don't know

92
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,710
how calm

93
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,030
and how determined he was

94
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,550
when he told me his decision.

95
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,380
I know him very well.

96
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,380
As long as he made the decision,

97
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,030
no one can change it.

98
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,670
But you're now
completely thinking for him

99
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,070
from the author's point of view.

100
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,470
There are authors before editors.

101
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,350
Chief Editor Yu, don't worry.

102
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,340
Only Mr Liang's harmed.

103
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,990
I'm not stupid until
forget about benefiting ourselves.

104
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,790
Just now, I begged Mr Zhou Chuan

105
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,790
to give a new serial to
Moonlight Magazine again.

106
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,940
Really?

107
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,310
Then why didn't you
say so in this group?

108
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,900
Later.

109
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,270
Let Director Yang concentrate on

110
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,750
scolding Director Liang
for a while first.

111
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,430
You were a little girl

112
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,190
when you were recruited.

113
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,550
How did you become like this

114
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,660
after a year?

115
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,150
What have you been through?

116
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,070
Who knows?

117
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,260
Okay, you've had a hard day.

118
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,390
Go back and rest early.

119
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,550
Chief Editor Yu, goodbye.

120
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,070
Goodbye.

121
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,540
Mr Zhou Chuan is so kind to me,

122
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,500
I couldn't even manage
his book launch day well.

123
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,790
Ah Xiang,

124
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,590
do you think I'm useless?

125
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,750
[Chu Li, you think too much.]

126
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,990
He's calling me.

127
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,670
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

128
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,910
Have you arrived home?

129
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,950
I...

130
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,220
I don't want to tell you.

131
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,950
Are you drinking?

132
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,230
No.

133
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,870
I'm drinking milk.

134
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,270
You're telling nonsense

135
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,540
and you said you're not drinking?

136
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,190
I... I'm drunk with milk.

137
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,430
Hello.

138
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,430
You're still here?

139
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:07,190
I thought you're left
after hearing the news.

140
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,710
How is Maurer?

141
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,980
It's okay. He was sent to the hospital.

142
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,910
The doctor said he's just not
acclimatized to the new environment.

143
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,470
He'll be fine after
resting for two days.

144
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,590
But he really can't
attend tonight's dinner.

145
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,950
What a pity.

146
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,910
Such a farce happened today,

147
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,990
you readers must be very unsatisfied
with Yuan Yue Publishing House.

148
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,990
They should suffer the consequences

149
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,830
of what they did wrong.

150
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,390
You are not a philanthropist.

151
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,630
You don't want to sign the contract of

152
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,309
Huang Quan Inn with
Yuan Yue Publishing House, do you?

153
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,030
Minimum number of
printed copies is 400,000.

154
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,789
No room for negotiation.

155
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,260
Tang, prepare a contract for me

156
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,670
and have it delivered
within half an hour.

157
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,550
Don't need to be so rush.

158
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,430
I'm in a hurry to get back.

159
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,030
Ah Xiang,

160
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,510
where is Chu Li?

161
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,020

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,840
♫ If this is not love ♫

187
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,430
♫ What can I tell myself ♫

188
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,430
We kissed.

189
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,900
This is not a dream, right?

190
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,630
No.

191
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,790
This is definitely not a dream.

192
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,060
Why did I forget those parts
that I shouldn't forget?

193
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,900
Anyway,

194
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,220
he kissed me back.

195
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,110
He should be...

196
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,870
Chu Li, you can do it.

197
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,150
Mr Zhou Chuan,
for breakfast, what do you...

198
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,180
Mr Zhou Chuan.

199
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,910
Mr Zhou Chuan.

200
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,310
Where is he?

201
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,510
Er Gou.

202
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,910
Where is your brother?

203
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,430
He didn't run away,

204
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,820
did he?

205
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,830
You...

206
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,150
Did you see him?

207
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,470
Is he avoiding me?

208
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,510
Why is he avoiding me?

209
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,470
He's not regretting it, is he?

210
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,470
Look me in the eye and tell me.

211
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,270
Is he regretting it, Er Gou?

212
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,830
Hey,

213
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,790
you asked me to come here
early in the morning

214
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,670
just to see you stirring soy milk?

215
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,550
You ordered sweet soy milk.

216
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,870
How unmanly.

217
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,070
My girl,

218
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,190
if you have something to say,
say it quickly!

219
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,910
I kindly invited you to breakfast

220
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,710
early in the morning,

221
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,030
not to listen to your sarcasm to me.

222
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,030
What's wrong with sweet soy milk?

223
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,470
Is you salty soy milk with
some fries and squash

224
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,830
more majestic than sweet soy milk?

225
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,590
Alright.

226
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,030
Countdown one minute.

227
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,910
If you don't say something
within one minute,

228
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,670
I'll get going then.

229
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,190
You want to talk about soy milk

230
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,750
or tell me something on your mind.

231
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,150
Start.

232
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,830
Well...

233
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,190
I have a problem

234
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,190
with my new serial.

235
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,700
I admit

236
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,030
you are indeed more
experienced than me in this.

237
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,470
It's one of the few parts
that you surpass me.

238
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,350
That's why I came to you for advice.

239
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,900
I have an emotional scene.

240
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,390
Emotional scene?

241
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,150
Didn't you say there's no
emotional scene in your book?

242
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,110
It's called a breakthrough.

243
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,550
Alright. What kind of
emotional scene is it?

244
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,870
Well...

245
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,590
The male lead kissed
the female lead while

246
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,940
she was drunk.

247
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,340
What to do the next day?

248
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,100
Kissed her while she was drunk?

249
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,150
Yes.

250
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,700
The male lead is not a good guy.

251
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,190
You're not a good guy.

252
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,230
Emotions can't be restrained.

253
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,310
You've been in a relationship.

254
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,350
You...

255
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,340
Let me go further.

256
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,910
Could it be that

257
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,510
don't see each other often...

258
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,270
The male lead has fallen in love.

259
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,630
That's not the point.

260
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,230
The point is that my male lead now

261
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,950
does not know what to do.

262
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,110
He doesn't dare to
talk to the female lead.

263
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,070
Anyway, he took advantage
of a situation.

264
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:09,910
If the female lead thinks that

265
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,670
the male lead is such a person,

266
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,830
the degree of favourability of the
female lead towards the male lead

267
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,990
will directly be reduced
to a negative number, right?

268
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,510
Just be together, then.

269
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,670
You must be responsible for it.

270
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,110
Yes, that's for sure. But...

271
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,790
It shouldn't be now, right?

272
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,790
The female lead was
being taken advantage.

273
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,270
She must be unhappy.

274
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,070
If the male lead said
he'd take the responsibility,

275
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,510
would he be sending
himself to the guillotine?

276
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,110
What if she thinks the male lead

277
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,750
is a villain who
took advantage of a situation?

278
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,220
Let's make it another time.

279
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,950
Hey,

280
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,070
how could you have so many
twists and turns of mind?

281
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,510
We've been talking for so long.

282
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,790
I'll get going now.

283
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,070
I didn't expect that

284
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,710
a kiddo who drinks sweet soy milk

285
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,990
knew to take advantage of a situation.

286
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,110
Let me tell you.

287
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,580
You should really thank Chu Li

288
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,870
for not giving you a slap.

289
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,590
Who said me and Monkey...

290
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,910
Normally, you didn't get up so early.

291
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,990
How could you just disappear
after kissing me last night?

292
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,070
I used to drink too much and you
said you would take care of me.

293
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,430
Those were all lies, right?

294
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,110
That's my first kiss.

295
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,390
Scoundrel.

296
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,870
What is this?

297
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,750
What are you doing?

298
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,820
Let me help you.

299
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,990
Don't touch.

300
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,870
What are these?

301
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,630
It has nothing to do with you.

302
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,990
Don't enter my study in the future.

303
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,270
Are you mad?

304
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,030
I just want to help you clean up.

305
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,340
No.

306
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,230
So why are you so fierce?

307
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,590
Stop asking. I want to take a nap.

308
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,430
I haven't even asked yet.

309
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,270
Where did you go early in the morning?

310
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,870
Let's talk about it tonight.

311
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,750
Wait.

312
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,270
Do you remember last night...

313
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,030
Hello, Ah Xiang.

314
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,990
[Chu Li, that's bad.]

315
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,830
[Because of the book fair,]

316
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,870
[Director Yang rushed back
from outstation overnight]

317
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,670
[to conduct a critique session.]

318
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,270
[Come back quickly.]

319
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,830
Okay, I'll be right there.

320
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,230
Go ahead with your nap!

321
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,070
How do you guys work?

322
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,030
We're still the hot search
in the Internet.

323
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,150
Under the apology statement,

324
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,990
it's full of the fans' condemnation.

325
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,990
We failed to sign
Zhou Chuan's new book as well.

326
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,460
I really do not know how the site staff

327
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,780
were managed.

328
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,270
Director Yang,

329
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,030
on site,

330
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,670
someone brought up
the author without informing us.

331
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,630
It gave us no time to react.

332
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,100
Mr Liang, this is not true.

333
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,910
The circulation department shortened
the activity time without permission

334
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,270
and caused fans on site
to be too late to buy the book.

335
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,070
Did I mention about editorial department?

336
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,580
Why did you assume
I was talking about you?

337
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,430
Alright.

338
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,630
There is no other reason

339
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,060
for such an embarrassing incident happened

340
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,380
at yesterday's book fair.

341
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,590
It's because everyone from
Yuan Yue Publishing House is not united.

342
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,950
There was a time

343
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,270
when we were united in our efforts

344
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,470
to publish a book. But what about now?

345
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,260
We're passing the buck to each other

346
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,070
for our own benefit.

347
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,150
It is the reader's sorrow

348
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,150
that disappoints the author.

349
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,710
It is also the sorrow of publisher.

350
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,150
Director Yang,

351
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,710
I should be responsible

352
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,510
for what happened yesterday.

353
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,790
Director Yang, can I say something?

354
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,150
Today,

355
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,150
if you want someone
to bear the responsibility,

356
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,870
anyone here is to blame.

357
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,350
But if you want to solve the problem,

358
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,020
I do have a solution.

359
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,310
Chu Li,

360
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,350
why are you everywhere?

361
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,910
You're Chu Li, right?

362
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,390
Tell me your solution.

363
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,150
Mr Zhou Chuan promised

364
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,630
to serialise his next novel

365
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,510
in Moonlight Magazine.

366
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,950
But there is a prerequisite.

367
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,310
The circulation department
must apologise seriously

368
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,390
to Mr Zhou Chuan and the readers.

369
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,660
That insincere statement online
is not accepted.

370
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,670
This time, Mr Liang
personally led the team

371
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,460
to fulfil two million sales quota.

372
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,910
Even if there is no credit,
but there is hard work.

373
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,790
Right?

374
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,750
Public apology from
the circulation department

375
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,830
is my promise to Mr Zhou Chuan.

376
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,070
It's also the least respect

377
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,510
Yuan Yue Publishing House can give him.

378
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,230
Otherwise,

379
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,100
it would be difficult for us

380
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,830
to sign his book from now on.

381
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,510
Director Yang, I'll make a statement.

382
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,990
For the benefit of
Yuan Yue Publishing House,

383
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,550
it's okay for me to suffer a little

384
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,990
personally.

385
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,270
Anyway, even if I apologise,

386
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,230
will we able to sign Zhou Chuan's book?

387
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,510
Will you be responsible

388
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,790
when he backs out?

389
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,710
First,

390
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,270
Mr Zhou Chuan is a man of his word.

391
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,790
He's different from you.

392
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,590
Next,

393
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,460
Mr Liang, you should apologise.

394
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,990
This is a prerequisite for signing,
not a condition.

395
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,550
If we can't even do this,

396
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,150
it's impossible for us

397
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,310
to sign his book.

398
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,510
Don't forget that you're just an editor
of Yuan Yue Publishing House.

399
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,430
Who are you siding with?

400
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,430
Enough!

401
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,110
Don't you say a word.

402
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,670
Chu Li, sit down.

403
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,150
Mr Xia's right just now.

404
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,990
United we stand, divided we fall.

405
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,060
Although the circulation department
exceeded its performance this time,

406
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,750
due to mistakes of work
and belittling authors,

407
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,390
they let the copyright slip through
their fingers and Xin Dun Books got it.

408
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,350
This is also indisputable, right?

409
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,630
So, the company has decided that

410
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,670
quarterly bonuses will be deducted
from the circulation department

411
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,830
and all personnel involved

412
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,870
in the Comic-Con.

413
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,910
Besides, Liang,

414
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,820
apology must be sincere.

415
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,270
Yes, I know.

416
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,480
[Zhou Chuan]

417
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,390
Wish us a happy second cooperation.

418
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,510
I'll send you the full manuscript of

419
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,830
Huang Quan Inn this evening.

420
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,950
Then, I'll be waiting to read it.

421
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
I won't see you out then.

422
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,150
Your fans have already paralysed

423
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,110
the official website of
Yuan Yue Publishing House.

424
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,990
Their Director Yang went to the office
early this morning for accountability.

425
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,710
I guess none of those present
yesterday could escape from it.

426
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,270
I have no control over the affairs
of their publishing house.

427
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,590
I just hope to give my fans

428
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,870
a satisfactory answer.

429
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,510
I know.

430
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,460
For you, your fans are
the most important ones.

431
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,350
Don't you worry about
that little editor?

432
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,990
I'll get going now.

433
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,210
[Zhou Chuan: You wouldn't
expect Maurer to be sick]

434
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,190
[Hey, why no response? Where
are you? Why don't you answer me?]

435
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,590
Er Gou.

436
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,030
Was I too mean to your sister today?

437
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,510
After the boy kissed your friend,

438
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,310
he even pulled a long face
in front of her?

439
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,870
How is it? Is it too much?

440
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,670
I... My friend didn't mean to do that.

441
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,150
It's an accident.

442
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,790
Chu Li,

443
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,830
your friend may really meet a bad guy.

444
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,510
They already did such an intimate thing.

445
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,910
What else can't they share
with each other?

446
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,510
It may also be
an unsatisfying experience.

447
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,470
Only when two people are willing to
share the good and bad with each other,

448
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,620
it's called love.

449
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,910
Chu Li,

450
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,460
you must be more sober.

451
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,470
You must give
wise advice to your friend.

452
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,980
Don't let her be taken advantage,

453
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,310
but still fantasizing
about owning eternal love.

454
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,070
I'm so tired and annoyed.

455
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,150
Don't be annoyed.

456
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,110
Good news for you.

457
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,430
You had worked hard for this book fair.

458
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,260
Chu Li,

459
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,110
this is the sales details
of the book fair.

460
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,100
Send it to Mr Liang.

461
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,950
You will be given
the afternoon off today.

462
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,700
Tomorrow is Chinese New Year's Eve.

463
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,580
Go home quickly to celebrate
Chinese New Year with your family.

464
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,630
Chief Editor Yu,

465
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,150
I am here to wish you happy
Chinese New Year in advance.

466
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,070
Thank you, Chief Editor Yu.

467
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,510
You've done a good job this year.

468
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,590
Keep up the good work next year.

469
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,590
What a bad luck.

470
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,390
I didn't expect
the last person I have to meet

471
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,300
before Chinese New Year
is Liang Chong Lang.

472
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,350
Chu Li,

473
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,790
change the time of
your train ticket quickly.

474
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,710
If I want to change it,

475
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,590
this evening is my only option.

476
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,230
Isn't it good,

477
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,990
so that you don't have to wake up
in the early morning tomorrow?

478
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,750
It's not bad actually.

479
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,510
[What are you thinking about?]

480
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,190
[He treated you that way]

481
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,740
[and you still want to stay with him
for another night?]

482
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,820
Anything is bad.

483
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,580
No problem, I'll change it now.

484
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,270
How are your plans to publish
a book after Chinese New Year?

485
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,430
Chu Li will take the manuscript home.

486
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,310
It is estimated that the final draft
will be ready in a few days.

487
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,630
You make her work on the
manuscript during Chinese New Year?

488
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,190
Shame on you.

489
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,030
Speaking of shame,

490
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,350
I still remember the story
between the male lead and female lead

491
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,590
that you told me this morning.

492
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,630
As I told you,
it has nothing to do with Monkey.

493
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,590
Alright. It has nothing to do with her.

494
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,150
Then why are you explaining to me?

495
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,830
I'm not your female lead.

496
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,030
If you were my female lead,

497
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,750
my male lead would resign on the spot.

498
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,380
I...

499
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,180
Hello, Chief Editor Yu.

500
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,870
Hello, Mr Zhou Chuan.

501
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,990
[Mr Xia and I would like to ask you out.]

502
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,670
[We want to apologise to you in person.]

503
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,660
We did it wrong this time.

504
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,550
[It's okay, I know you guys
were doing the best you can.]

505
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,830
No one

506
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,550
in your editorial department
has been punished

507
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,140
for this matter, right?

508
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,430
Only Miao and Xiao Niao who helped
the circulation department make trouble

509
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,910
were fined bonuses.

510
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,350
The others are fine.

511
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,150
[Thank you]

512
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,630
[for willing to give us another chance.]

513
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,020
Well...

514
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,590
Where is Chu Li?

515
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,190
I gave her the afternoon off.

516
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,350
She should have gone back her hometown.

517
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,550
She didn't tell you?

518
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,820
She's leaving today?

519
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,270
Alright, I got it.

520
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,310
Chu Li is leaving?

521
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,950
What do you care? I'll get going now.

522
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,670
You leave me alone again.

523
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,260
Don't call me next time.

524
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,110
Why are you waiting here?

525
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,150
What is there to wait for?

526
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,630
You're going home?

527
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,470
It's so sudden.

528
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,630
You really plan to leave
without leaving a word?

529
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,110
When do you plan to come back?

530
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,470
Not sure.

531
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,550
I'll go back to hometown
on Chinese New Year's Eve.

532
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,790
Should I take Er Gou home

533
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,630
or let my friend take care of him?

534
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,340
Up to you.

535
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,100
How can just up to me?

536
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,230
You're Er Gou sister.

537
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,870
Help me make a decision.

538
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,790
Thank you. I'll take a cab.

539
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,110
Why do you want to take a cab?

540
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,270
I'm free.

541
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,630
Let's go, I'll send you to the station.

542
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,230
I heard that you need to work on

543
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,870
Jiang Yu Cheng's manuscript
during Chinese New Year.

544
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,870
Jiang Yu Cheng

545
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,030
is so bad.

546
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,670
Are you mad...

547
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,030
Hello, Dad.

548
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,950
I'm on the way home.

549
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,910
I bought two more boxes

550

551
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,790
Are you happy?

552
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,500
That time, I ate four more at once

553
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,870
and got scolded by your mum.

554
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,870
So, did she eat it?

555
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,430
She... She won't eat.

556
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,750
She said she wanted to lose weight.

557
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,230
[The next day I looked at the box,]

558
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,030

559
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,670
[Think about what your father is doing.]

560
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,190

561
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,550
Who can she hide

562
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,190
this little trick from?

563
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,350
You are getting really arrogant now.

564
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,030
Let me ask you.

565
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,030
If I come back now to greet you,

566
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,230
is it okay?

567
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,190
[No.]

568
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,230
You should have called us in advance.

569
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,550
[You mum and I thought you will
off on Chinese New Year's Eve.]

570
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,870
Well... You mum and I are on a vacation.

571
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,150
It's fine. Have fun.

572
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,550
I can go home myself.

573
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,100
I just want Her Highness

574
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,750
be prepared.

575
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,030
If she wants to beat me up,

576
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,110
can she wash the feather duster first?

577
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,790
Your mum...

578
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,630
Your mum has worked very hard.

579
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,270
Don't you... Your mum is kind-hearted.

580
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,870
[I am also very gentle!]

581
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,110
Don't talk so much to her.

582
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,110
Whether you want to
come home or not, up to you!

583
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,110
[Hang it up.]

584
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,510
[Let's talk after you're home.]

585
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,610
What's the point of talking to her here?

586
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,670
-Let's go.
-No, she...

587
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,390
Done?

588
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,750
Thank you, I'll get going now.

589
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,150
For what happened this morning...

590
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,710
It was my fault.

591
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,270
I shouldn't enter your study.

592
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,670
I didn't mean it. I...

593
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,710
Do you have anything else to say to me?

594
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,060
What do you mean with anything else?

595
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,590
Mr Zhou Chuan,

596
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,190
before I leave,

597
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,990
I'll ask you one last time.

598
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,860
Do you really have nothing to say to me?

599
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,510
Don't drink in front of
other people in the future,

600
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,030
except me...

601
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,630
Tell me when you reach home.

602
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,990
[When is the right time?]

603
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,430
Dad!

604
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,830
Didn't you say you were on a vacation?

605
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,070
Once I received your call,

606
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,750
we rushed back immediately.

607
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,630
I haven't seen you for half a year.

608
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,910
Let me look at you.

609
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,350
You've become thinner.

610
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,110
Your chin is pointed, you...

611
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,270
Why do you work so hard?

612
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,030
Dad, do you have a bad eye?

613
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,350
I've become rounder.

614
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,150
Hello.

615
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,550
Now?

616
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,710
Okay, I'll be right there.

617
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,830
I got it, go now.

618
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,720
Remember, don't fall out with your mum.

619
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,550
If you can't take it,
hang in there until I get back.

620
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,350
-Remember, okay?
-Don't worry.

621
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,230
I'm ready for anything.

622
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,630
I can stand it this time.

623
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,670
If you can't, just use softness
to conquer strength.

624
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,270
I got it.

625
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,510
Come back early.

626
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,510
I'm back.

627
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,790
Your Highness.

628
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,750
I'm here to apologise to you.

629
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:08,270
Since I kneel on the foot
reflexology board on my own initiative,

630
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,510
please don't be mad at me anymore.

631

632
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,510

633
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,990
Mummy.

634
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,830
What's going on? Why is no one here?

635
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,070
I acted so emotional.

636
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,070
It hurts so much.

637
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,950
It's better to be at home.

638
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,070
You're back to pretend
to be miserable, right?

639
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,350
Oh my God! Why don't
you just act till the end?

640
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,870
-Why do you...
-Where did you show up from?

641
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,430
You were making fake tears, right?

642
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,670
-Mum!
-You...

643
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,070
-Listen to me.
-Keep running away!

644
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,030
How dare you run away!

645
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,950
Mum!

646
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,590
The price of feather duster has risen.

647
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,550

What a waste of money.

Do you think your sister has reached home?

651
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,630
She should have reached home, right?

652
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,270
Why didn't she send a message
to me once she reached?

653
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,270
Could it be that
she really gets mad at me?

654
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,460
What should I do?

655
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,030
Apologise?

656
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,909
What a joke!

657
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,870
How can I possibly apologise?

658
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,710
You know too little about me.

659
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,790
The word "apology"

660
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,989

if I don't have to aid you.

667
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,030
Yes, you're right.

668
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,510
Give me your superior's phone number.

669
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,190

670
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,950
What? Resign for you.

673
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,900
Tell me quickly.

674
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,310
No, I won't resign.

675
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,590
Mum, it's indeed my fault
as I went to Shanghai

676
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,060
without informing you.

677
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,030

732
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,870
Bai Zhi,

733
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,460
didn't you say

734
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,310
you're going home with Xiao Jiang
to celebrate Chinese New Year?

735
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,230
Come home with me this Chinese New Year.

736
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,350
Go home with you?

737
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,830
Yes.

738
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,030
You would say it's too fast

739
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,630
or to accompany Ms Liu back then.

740
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,350
It's my turn this year, right?

741
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,820
I have to ask Ms Liu first.

742
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,150
Ms Liu will definitely agree.

743
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,950
Not necessarily.

744
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,630
How can I go home with you so easily?

745
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,310
I have begged you four or five times.

746
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,310
I'll think about it.

747
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,590
Be honest with me.

748
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,230
If you don't want to go with me,

749
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,030
who do you want to go with?

750
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,310
Are you crazy?

751
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,270
Ms Liu, you remember wrongly.

752
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,380
This year, I'll be with you.

753
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,590
I remember wrongly.

754
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,540
I have poor memory.

755
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,830
I bought some new clothes for you.

756
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,310
Let's try it out later.

757
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,750
New... New clothes.

758
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,470
We wear new clothes
during Chinese New Year.

759
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,870
It's great to have new clothes.

760
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,270
Bai Zhi,

761
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,990
go and get the watch

762
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,660
of me and my husband.

763
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,830
I want to give them for you and
Xiao Jiang as a Chinese New Year's gift.

764
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,310
Ms Liu,

765
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,070
you gave me that watch last time.

766
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,790
I already gave it to you?

767
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,070
Why are you not wearing it then?

768
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,430
That watch is too expensive.

769
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,070
We can't wear it.

770
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,980
That's not expensive.

771
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,550
It's just a remembrance.

772
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,950
Where did I put my watch?

773
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,630
Ms Liu,

774
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,620
have more porridge.

775
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,430
Next time, we will wear that watch.

776
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,510
Alright, it's good that you'd wear it.

777
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,310
Did doctor say

778
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,990
what else can be done
with Ms Liu's disease?

779
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,590
There is no specific drug for Alzheimer.

780
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,150
There is nothing special
that doctors can do.

781
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,710
Let's hope she

782
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,390
doesn't deteriorate too much.

783
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,310
I don't know

784
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,470
what I will do if she doesn't even

785
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,910
recognize me one day.

786
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,830
I shouldn't talk about this since
Chinese New Year is soon coming.

787
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,740
Are you going back
to hometown this year?

788
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,310
When will you go back?

789
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,070
Tomorrow maybe.
You know Zhou Chuan well too.

790
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,710
He would just delay as long as he can.

791
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,950
What about you?

792
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,070
You'll stay here this year?

793
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,100
Your new book will be launched
after Chinese New Year, right?

794
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,470
All the best.

795
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,110
Thank you.

796
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,470
Thank you

797
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,190
for visiting Ms Liu with me.

798
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,100
Ms Liu is also my elder.

799
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,550
I should come and visit her.

800
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,790
I'll get going now then.

801
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,820
Take care.

802
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,310
Jiang Yu Cheng.

803
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,700
Happy Chinese New Year!

804
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,830
Happy Chinese New Year.
