Is Suo Heng publishing her
"Little Deity" soon?

570

The "Little Deity" series

571
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,530
is very popular.

572
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,850
Mr Xia got her

573
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,130

The minimum number is 10,000,

577
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,850
but it's a new beginning

578
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,520
for Suo Heng.

579
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,370
Get her to sign the contract.

580
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,730
It's not a lengthy book.

I think it can be printed
immediately after proofreading.

Maybe I'll bring Yun Fei.

He just signed a contract
with Director Lu.

604

She is so into her work.

744
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,650
Aren't people in love

745
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,570
always want to be with each other?

746
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,210
You won't cherish it when you get it.

747
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,010
Don't always speak like an old lady.

748
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,010
I think you are too free.

749
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,600
I am doing my laundry, I am not free.

750
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,410
You didn't add any laundry detergent.

751
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,160
And this is not washing your clothes.

752
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,330
This is throwing clothes.

753
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,010
The one

754
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,120
doing the laundry is me.

755
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,610
It's only a washing machine.

756
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,130
People may think

757
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,650
you lifted Thor's hammer.

758
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,490
If I can lift it up,

759
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,810
I'll kill you first.

760
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,850
Single men are always like this.

761
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,370
When you see a lovely couple

762
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,840
you are full of dark thoughts.

763
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,450
Is your relationship different

764
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,970
from that of a single man?
