You're still here?

It's okay, Chu Li.

when it comes to publication.

Didn't you listen to the weather forecast?

66
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,850
It's supposed to rain at this hour.

67
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,210
It will stop later.

68
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,370
Besides,

asked you out for dinner.

75
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,290

What did you say?

00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,690
He asked you out too, didn't he?

78
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,770
What is it?

79
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,970
Are you in a bad mood?

80
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,570
And why did you bring up

81
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,970
the girlfriend topic
all of a sudden just now?

82
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,040
Forget it. Never mind.

83
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,730
By the way, I talked to Yu Yao today.

84
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,210
I'm almost done with my research.

85
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,890

89
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,090
Tell me what you want. I'll buy it.

90

I heard that you fell sick
and hurt your back

97
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,440
because of me.

98
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,130
My apologies.

99
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,010
Please don't mind
about the contract termination.

100
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,920
It's okay. It's my honour to help you

101
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,000
get your book published.
All my efforts are worth it.

102
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,610
Hi. Today is Valentine's Day.

103
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,160
We are holding an event.

If a man confesses to the lady he likes,

105

they will be given a bouquet of flower.

106
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,810
Do you need it?

107
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,610
Ask him.

108
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,010
Me?

109
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,970
Never mind.
I don't celebrate Valentine's Day.

110
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,290
Sorry for disturbing.

111
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,200
Enjoy your meal.

112
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:06,650
I'll answer the call outside.

113
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,530
Don't tell me

114
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,320
you prepared nothing for Valentine's Day.

115
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,770
Do I need to tell you?

116
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,370
No.

117
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,010
But you need to let Chu Li know.

118
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,210
This is your

119
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,770
first Valentine's Day, after all.

120
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,650
You're acting like you don't care at all.

121
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,370
I want to let her feel disappointed

122
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,090
before showing my surprising gift.

123
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,690
You know nothing
for someone who had a girlfriend.

124
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,850
Fine.

125
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,810
You're getting tricky.

126
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,720
Hello, Chief Editor Yu.

127
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,210
The Disappearing Amusement Park

128
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,930
is of high importance to the higher-ups.

129
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,290
They increased the marketing fee

130
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,330
and have promised to publish it

131
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,850
in one month.

132
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,650
Is that true? Awesome.

133
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,690
I'm having dinner with Mr Jiang.

134
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,410
I'll tell him now.

135
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,370
You're having dinner with him?

136
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,970
Isn't it Valentine's Day?

137
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,010
You two...

138
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,450
Nothing like that.

139
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,890
Mr Jiang wanted to buy me a meal

140
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,130
to thank me. That's all.

141
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,890
Mr Zhou Chuan is here too.

142
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,080
Calm down.

143
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,490
Many writers and editors

144
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,330
fell in love too in the past.

145
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,090
[If you're together,]

146
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,800
I will give you my sincere blessing.

147
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,650
But doesn't Mr Zhou Chuan

148
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,410
have a girlfriend? If I'm not mistaken.

149
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,130
I think so.

150
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,810
He's eating with you guys

151
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,450
[instead of being with his girlfriend?]

152
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,370
[What a funny guy.]

153
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,970
So, enjoy your dinner.

154
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,250
I'm just calling to let you know.

155
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,010
Okay. Bye.

156
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,490
Mr Jiang.

157
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,050
I have a good news for you.

158
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,130
Chief Editor Yu said
the higher-ups think really highly

159
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,730
of The Disappearing Amusement Park

160
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,999
that they added
a huge sum of marketing fee,

161
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,129
and promised to

162
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,170
publish the book in a month.

163
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,090
That means it won't clash

164
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,690
with Huang Quan Inn's publication.

165
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:04,290
Too bad.

166
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,410
I thought of competing with you.

167
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,610
Chief Editor Yu also asked

168
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,930
if you want

169
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,130
a signing event on the launching day.

170
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,570
Signing event?

171
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,010
Okay.

172
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,050
When the speech on the film was cancelled,

173
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,160
it was a pity for many
fans who were at the event.

174
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,170
Thank you, Mr Jiang.

175
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,370
I will see to it that
your book is published.

176
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,090
Can we not talk about work

177
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,010
and just enjoy our meal?

178
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,810
By the way, Chu Li,

179
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,200
I heard you went to see Director Lu Fang

180
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,290
on the aeroplane.

181
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,610
You even talked through the entire flight.

182
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,040
It was so close.

183
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,570
When I got to Linzhou,

184
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,090
he already passed the custom.

185
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,930
Fortunately, I booked a ticket

186
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,810
of the same flight in advance.

187
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,160
That's how we stopped him on the plane.

188
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,170
"We"?

189
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,330
Me. Alone.

190
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,010
Luckily, it was a domestic flight.

191
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,410
I couldn't have done anything

192
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,210
if he was going abroad.

193
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,930
Chu Li.

194
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,690
Does Gu Bai Zhi have anything to do

195
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,250
with my cooperation with Director Lu?

196
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,930
Why did you ask that?

197
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,010
Just tell me.

198
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,650
Yes or no.

199
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,290
Yes.

200
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,970
Like what you thought.

201
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,570
The only person who can solve this

202
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,250
or would think of this idea,

203
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,800
and realise it

204
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,650
is Director Gu.

205
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,490
I heard from Mr Zhou Chuan

206
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,890
that tried to have Mr Jiang

207
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,530
collaborate with Director Li Yu,

208
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,040
but it failed.

209
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,530
The only director
who is as famous as him

210
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,440
in the country is Director Lu Fang.

211
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,970
So, is it possible

212
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,770
to help me contact him?

213
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,290
If The Disappearing Amusement Park
can be made into film,

214
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,810
the book can definitely be published.

215
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,530
Why should I help you?

216
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,770
We can persuade Director Lu Fang

217
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,090
to make a series of the film.

218
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,850
By then, you can also sell

219
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,450
the copyright of Yun Fei's work.

220
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,610
These two writers have similar style.

221
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,290
Yun Fei's can somehow
get some popularity back.

222
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,370
I thought you'd play the emotion card

223
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,370
and say Jiang Yu Cheng missed the speech

224
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,130
because of me.

225
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,680
That's the truth, isn't it?

226
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,690
But I'm sure

227
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,330
that even if I don't bring it up,

228
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,490
you'd still try to help him.

229
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,930
You could've just left it to me.

230
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,170
No way.

231
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,450
I'm in charge of him.

232
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,770
I will spare no effort to help him.

233
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,690
And I don't know about you.

234
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,960
So I must

235
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,570
get things under my control.

236
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,650
Let's work together.

237
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,730
Really?

238
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,090
But on one condition.

239
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,290
What's that?

240
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,650
Don't tell Jiang Yu Cheng.

241
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,290
Not only did Director Gu help me,

242
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,130
she even found out
about Director Lu Fang's schedule,

243
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,170
and quickly drove me to Linzhou.

244
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,600
When the tire blew out,

245
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,050
she fixed it on the road.

246
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,610
Her only condition

247
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,690
is not to let you know about it.

248
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,210
It suddenly occurred to me
that I have something on.

249
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,570
You guys enjoy.

250
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,090
Look at you. You must've caught a cold.

251
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,890
Drink warm water
the first thing you get home.

252
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,690
[Drink warm water?
An insensitive man, indeed.]

253
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,330
Put my interest first next time.

254
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,120
Stop working so hard for Jiang Yu Cheng.

255
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,290
I'm in charge of him.

256
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,930
Who else would fight for him if not me?

257
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,010
By the way,

258
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,730
did Gu Bai Zhi say something
I can't listen to the other day?

259
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,970
As she refused to let me enter.

260
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,800
She only gave me a reminder.

261
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,240
I'll get going.

262
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,970
The relationship
between an editor and a writer

263
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,640
isn't really romantic.

264
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,370
It will be harder for you

265
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,650
when the guy is Zhou Chuan.

266
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,090
"It will be harder when the guy

267
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,970
is Zhou Chuan?"

268
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,170
What did she mean?

269
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,530
Is it because she and Jiang Yu Cheng

270
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,810
didn't end well

271
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,210
that she tried to poison your mind?

272
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,040
She's just jealous.

273
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,240
Don't discuss her
experience in the future.

274
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,890
Mr Zhou, I think you should

275
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,850
reflect on yourself instead.

276
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,810
Look.

277
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,410

279
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,680
I think Director Gu is right.

280

It's a secret.

285

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,410
his sick girlfriend alone

375
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,080
in the dark house.

376
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,450
Hi, I need cold medicine.

377
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,850
The medicine we eat if we catch a cold.

378
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,010
Okay.

379
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,530
This one will do.

380
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,810
Drink with warm water.

381
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,090
You'll be fine with some warm water.

382
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,170
I'll have this one.

383
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,210
Okay.

384
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,800
The power panel is right behind the porch.

385
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,730
It can be fixed easily.

386
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,770
Er Gou, why aren't you sleeping yet?

387
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,770
Er Gou.

388
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,690
Isn't this pyjamas my present to...

389
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,390
[Stinky Monkey, after years of fighting,
you can have my favourite book. Mr Fox]

390
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,450
The power is back on already?

391
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,530
The circuit breaker tripped.

392
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,000
But I fixed it.

393
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,370
You're sick. Just stay in your room.

394
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,730
Why come downstairs?

395
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,930
Here.

396
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,410
Take the medicine.

397
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,760
Mr Zhou.

398
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,330
I found something interesting.

399
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,370
This pyjamas.

400
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,930
It was Mr Fox's birthday gift from me.

401
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,490
And the Natsume Soseki's book.

402
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,530
Why is Mr Fox's signature here?

403
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,810
Can you explain?

404
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,770
What's going on?

405
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,810
Why did you enter my study room again?

406
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,130
Is that the only thing
you have to say to me?

407

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,400
When did you find out that I'm Monkey?

412
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,770
A few days before
the Book of Luo He God's signing event.

413
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,970
It was half a year ago.

414
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,770
Why didn't you tell me?

415
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,570
I didn't see the need,

416
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,250
-so...
-You didn't see the need?

[Added to Blocked list]

418
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,370
You blocked me?

419
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,370
Aren't you childish?

420
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,800
You might as well block my real account.

421
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,890
I don't want to talk to you.

422
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,080
Where are you going?

423
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,570
I have no idea.

424
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,810
But I'm not talking to a liar now.

425
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,450
Does it matter if I'm Mr Fox?

426
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,210
Does it not?

427
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,730
Don't you know

428
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,050
I've always regarded Mr Fox

429
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,210
as my best friend?

430
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,920
You've been using this identity

431
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,730
to spy on my life,

432
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,250
thoughts and even feelings.

433
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,520
What did you say when I asked

434
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,770
if you're Mr Fox?

435
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,490
Yes, I denied it.

436
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,250
That's because I...

437
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,090
Because you never wanted to tell me.

438
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,730
It must be fun

439
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,090
fooling me with two accounts.

440
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,370
So you never planned to stop.

441
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,890
Or maybe in your mind,

442
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,720
an insignificant editor like me

443
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,330
doesn't deserve to have
a popular writer like you

444
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,610
to be my internet friend?

445
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,850
Why must you

446
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,530
make it so complicated? This...

447
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,690
That should be my line.

448
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,730
All this while,

449
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,410
you can't stop making fun of me.

450
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,570
Let me tell you.

451
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,690
I won't continue

452
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,810
such a childish game.

453
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,050
Let's stop it here. Let's break up.

454
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,810
Break up, you say?

455
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,050
Who would put himself

456
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,610
on the line for just a game?

457
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,970
Put on the line?

458
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,050
I'm the one who was kept in the dark.

459
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,890
Yet you said you suffered the losses?

460
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,930
Ridiculous.

461
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,010
I do

462
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,730
feel like I am a monkey

463
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,050
being fooled now.

464
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,450
He lied to me all this time.

465
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,050
Am I a fool to him?

466
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,570
Hello, Jiang Yu Cheng.

467
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,570
You got it right again, jinx.

468
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,090
This is bad.

469
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,730
Er Gou.

470
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,690
After I'm out of here,

471
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,570
don't forget to eat.

472
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,730
Don't be like someone.

473
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,610
She went to work already?

474
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,760
She's trying to avoid me again.

475
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,570
Chu Li.

476
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,050
Why are you spacing out?

477
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,770
Ah Xiang.

478
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,810
Can I

479
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,850
stay at your place for a day or two?

480
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,370
What happened?

481
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,330
Did your new landlord kick you out?

482
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,450
That's not the case.

483
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,690
The Disappearing Amusement Park

484
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,850
is going to launch earlier, isn't it?

485
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,130
My workload suddenly becomes heavier.

486
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,850
Your house is near the printing factory.

487
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,680
So, it's more convenient.

488
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,450
Sure.

489
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,490
Just move in.

490
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,570
Really?

491
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,650
I'm ready.

492
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,330
No problem.

493
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,320
Thank you.

494
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,810
You called me in the middle of the night

495
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,770
just because

496
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,730
she found out you're Mr Fox

497
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,530
and you don't know what to do about it?

498
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,970
Don't gloat over that.

499
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,810
You still

500
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,880
don't stand a chance.

501
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,770
I'm already over her.

502
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,890
I regard her as my sister now.

503
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,160
If I were her,

504
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,330
given how my boyfriend

505
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,330
neglected our first Valentine's Day,

506
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,370
and lied to me,

507
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,770
I would certainly

508
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,930
break up with you.

509
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,810
Shut up.

510
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,330
Now that makes me furious.

511
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,850
How could she say "break up" so easily?

512
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,970
Who am I to her?

513
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,410
Are you sure you want me to shut up?

514
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,890
Fine. I thought you asked me out

515
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,400
to give you advice.

516
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,450
Say it already.

517
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,770
Firstly, you must apologise.

518
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,770
Then,

519
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,050
be it she's angry about

520
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,290
you denying to be Mr Fox,

521
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,960
or not preparing for Valentine's Day,

522
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,490
when she said she wants a break up,

523
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,800
that means she feels insecure.

524
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,650
Simply put,

525
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,610
she is unconfident

526
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,650
about your relationship.

527
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,130
Unconfident?

528
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,130
I never said no to her.

529
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,170
I even did things I wouldn't do

530
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,360
in the past.

531
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,120
Men and women

532
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,440
are totally different.

533
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,410
Sometimes, we think

534
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,770
that we've done everything,

535
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,210
and that living harmoniously together

536
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,280
is the promise we gave.

537
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,890
But diamond rings, flowers,

538
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,250
and being romantically ceremonious

539
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,250
mean more to girls.

540
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,000
It

541
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,690
might be a white lie to you.

542
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,050
But to her,

543
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,730
if you would lie on a small matter,

544
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,810
then you might also
lie about important things.

545
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,330
She may think that you've never wanted
to spend the rest of your life with her.

546
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,440
That's not right.

547
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,290
She's my chosen one.

548
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,250
Had you told Chu Li earlier,

549
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,490
things would have been fine.

550
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,130
What should I do now?

551
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,730
It's easy

552
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,720
to ask for her forgiveness.

553
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,210
When you see her next time,

554
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,610
apologise first.

555
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,640
Then, hold her in your arms.

556
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,930
And kiss her.

557
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,410
Then say it out loud

558
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,570
that you like her,

559
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,490
you love her,

560
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,330
and that she's fated to be yours.

561
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,570
Is such pretension and
exaggeration necessary?

562
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,570
Prepare to get dumped then.

563
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,570
Not really.

564
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,050
Maybe to Chu Li,

565
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,810
she's not dumping you.

566
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,010
It could be

567
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,250
simply wonderful moments
that didn't end well.

568
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,890
Look at you.

569
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,250
Despising me for falling in love.

570
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,850
Annoying.

571
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,400
Same to you,

572
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,530
you highly

573
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,040
ignorant guy.

574
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,640
What have Chu Li done wrong?

575
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,210
Ah Xiang.

576
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,930
If... I mean, if.

577
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,170
If you found out that the person you like

578
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,490
is actually your
long time internet friend,

579
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,850
who has been keeping the truth from you

580
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,330
even after learning it

581
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,290
a long time ago,

582
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,690
and he created two accounts to fool you,

583
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,770
not planning

584
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,210
to tell you the truth.

585
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,720
What would you do then?

586
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,330
Is it about your friend?

587
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,570
Chu Li.

588
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,330
I think that guy has gone too far.

589
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,210
Right?

590
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,370
This is irritating,

591
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,730
isn't it?

592
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,050
That was my first ever Valentine's Day.

593
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,010
Not only did I receive any present,

594
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,570
I even found out that he is a liar.

595
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,810
This is too much for me to take.

596
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,450
You finally admit

597
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,530
that you are the friend.

598
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,890
Did you realise that long ago?

599
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,770
Well, not exposing someone is a virtue.

600
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,090
You won't be mad at me, will you?

601
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,210
Of course not.

602
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,090
You kept quiet
so that I won't feel awkward.

603
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,450
It's different from that heartless guy.

604
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,090
Don't be mad, Chu Li.

605
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,090
Ignore him.

606
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,410
Let's go home.

607
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,450
Exactly what I thought.

608
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,410
Where is she?

609
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,290
Why isn't she home yet?

610
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,050
How come her luggage isn't here?

611
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,330
[Where are you?]

612
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:08,470
[Zhou Chuan]

613
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:33,550
[Little Monkey]

614
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,840
[Ah Xiang's place.]

615
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,890
[I'm staying here for now.]

616
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,650
[You won't even feed Er Gou?]

617
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,930
[What does your
conscience say about that?]

618
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,410
[Running away from home just like that.]

619
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,290
[Aren't you incredible?]

620
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,050
[So you're rich now?]

621
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,130
Okay.

622
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,300
[Zhou Chuan]

623
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,720
[Not Drama King, it's Saviour: Okay]

624
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,650
What... What's wrong?

625
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,250
Did that guy say something?

626
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,320
Nothing. Don't bring him up.

627
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,200
I plan

628
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,970
to buy a cheap spring bed

629
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,130
and stay longer here.

630
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:08,810
Is that okay?

631
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,850
Sure.

632
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,850
Stay as long as you like.

633
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,610
This is really tasty.

634
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,000
I want to buy ten more.

635
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,490
Which flavour would you like?

636
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:28,490
I love the braised meat one.

637
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,089
Someone

638
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:57,850
irresponsibly broke

639
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,770
my 28-year-long

640
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,730
unrestrained lifestyle,

641
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,960
and made me getting used to

642
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,720
eating on proper time.

643
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,010
But now?

644
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,370
All of a sudden,
I no longer have meals ready on time.

645
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,609
Wouldn't you

646
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,169
feel upset?

647
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,770
You at least have your canned food.

648
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,530
But me?

649
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,250
I have nothing to eat.

650
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:33,360
[Zhou Chuan: Where are you? Little Monkey:
Ah Xiang's place for now. Zhou Chuan: Okay.]

651
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,330
It's been a week.

652
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,210
She doesn't even bother to
urge me to deliver my work.

653
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,730
Is she really not coming back?

654
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,770
Who's that?

655
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,360
Hi.

656
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,330
I'm here to clean the house.

657
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,450
Did you make a mistake?

658
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,570
Excuse me.

659
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,930
Hello, Jiang Yu Cheng.

660
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:00,810
Hello.

661
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,770
Chu Li isn't home.

662
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:05,120
Isn't it time to clean your house?

663
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,440
I ordered a cleaner for you.

664
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,010
She should have arrived.

665
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,490
Mind your own business.

666
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,610
Thanks.

667
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:20,970
Hi.

668
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,450
I'm a cleaner.

669
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,170
Did you order a three-hour
cleaning service?

670
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,010
Where should I work on?

671
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,490
Come on in.

672
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,530
Okay.

673
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,210
So,

674
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,730
do as you see fit.

675
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,090
Okay.

676
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,730
No, Jiang Yu Cheng.

677
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,650
How do you know Chu Li isn't at my house?

678
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,730
I even know
she's staying at Ah Xiang's place.

679
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,640
How could you only reply an "okay"?

680
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,490
I'm speechless.

681
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,970
I spent hours

682
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,040
explaining to you the mindset of a woman.

683
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,570
Did you keep it in mind?

684
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,930
Hold on.

685
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,530
You haven't told me

686
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,530
how did you know Chu Li isn't at my house?

687
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,160
Are you two together?

688
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,850
We're checking on the
book cover at the printing factory.

689
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,770
[I'll try to get you]

690
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,930
[Ah Xiang's address.]

691
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,410
[Don't let the chance slip.]

692
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,330
Remember, no matter what,

693
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,090
apologise first.

694
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,370
Oka...

695
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,410
Stop nagging. I'm hanging up. Bye.

696
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,320
I can drive you home.

697
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,530
Never mind.

698
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,770
Ah Xiang's place is just
two train stations away.

699
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,730
It's convenient.

700
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,090
No problem.

701
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,040
Since it's near,

702
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,800
I can get you home very quickly.

703
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,810
Then, thanks, Mr Jiang.

704
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,330
I should be thanking you.

705
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,650
It's been a while

706
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,130
since I saw my own new book cover

707
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,650
that I thought I won't

708
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,130
get to publish books anymore.

709
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,290
Don't say that.

710
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,930
Being able to

711
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,080
publish your book

712
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,450
still seems unrealistic to me even today.

713
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,850
When I saw the book cover,

714
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,250
I got so emotional that
I couldn't sleep for nights.

715
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,050
I guess when I see the real book,

716
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,810
I will cry out of excitement.

717
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:16,010
But I think there's another reason

718
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,850
why you couldn't sleep.

719
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,930
No, there isn't.

720
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,970
Let's go.

721
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,690
Give me Ah Xiang's address.

722
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,530
Come on, Er Gou.

723
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,010
Go, Er Gou.

724
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,250
Why are you here, Er Gou?

725
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,650
What a coincidence.

726
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,450
You talk. I'll get going.

727
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,050
Thank you, Mr Jiang.

728
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,090
Why are you here?

729
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,880
I'm walking my dog.

730
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,730
You sure have been walking far.

731
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,210
Carry on. I'm leaving.

732
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,010
Do you really hate to see me that much?

733
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,650
Why do you pull a long
face when you see me,

734
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,410
and keep smiling when
you see Jiang Yu Cheng?

735
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,170
He doesn't lie to me.

736
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,210
Nor did he fool me
with different accounts.

737
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,330
And he didn't live in a house with you,

738
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,290
or cook and walk the dog with you.

739
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,610
Fine. I don't want to talk to you.

740
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,610
What do you mean by "fine"?

741
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,320
Like, let's break up?

742
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,840
What am I to you?

743
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,090
A writer.

744
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,440
An internet friend.

745
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,970
A boyfriend.

746
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,250
Or neighbour?

747
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,330
I don't even know.

748
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,770
Let me ask you.

749
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,530
If I hadn't found it out,

750
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,690
when would you tell me the truth?

751
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,890
Must you

752
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:08,960
know everything

753
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,370
about your internet friend?

754
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,690
So you don't think you did anything wrong.

755
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,330
What's the point of coming to see me?

756
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,650
I'm just taking Er Gou here to ask

757
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,290
when will you come home?

758
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,330
You've stayed too long here.

759
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,770
It's time to come home.

760
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,850
Er Gou and I have lost weight.

761
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,970
It's not my business.

762
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,490
I'm not your maid.

763
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,770
Chu Li.

764
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,650
You're back from the printing factory?

765
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,090
Hi, Mr Zhou Chuan.

766
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,330
Er Gou is here too?

767
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,930
I...

768
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,690
Did I disturb you?

769
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,810
No, we're done.

770
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,770
Mr Zhou Chuan was going to leave.

771
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,730
Yes.

772
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,410
I can't deliver my new
outline on time anyway.

773
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,960
I'm just telling you. Bye.

774
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,210
-Let's go.
-Bye, Mr Zhou Chuan.

775
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,650
You saw that, didn't you?

776
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,290
She wanted to draw the line with me.

777
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,570
It's only been one week.

778
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,200
Where has her manners gone?

779
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,090
I should've recorded that

780
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,450
and show it to her.

781
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,360
That is too much.

782
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,330
Also...

783
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,050
Look at me.

784
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,530
What's the use of a leash?

785
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,650
Why didn't you hold me back?

786
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,330
I've actually decided to...

787
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,490
I've already decided to apologise first.

788
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,210
Is that your sister?

789
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,810
It's you?

790
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,090
Where's Chu Li?

791
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,570
You screwed up?

792
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,290
Didn't I say

793
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,850
to apologise first?

794
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,490
Swallow your pride.

795
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,490
Why won't you learn?

796
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,170
You're one to talk.

797
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,770
Why does she always smile
so happily when she sees you,

798
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,610
and pull a long face when she sees me?

799
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,930
When I think about it,

800
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,770
I can't help but get mad.

801
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:37,530
Hey.

802
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,130
What a jealous guy.

803
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,250
Seriously.

804
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,090
Can't you stop being jealous?

805
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,040
Listen.

806
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,610
I

807
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,250
am the writer Chu Li is working with.

808
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,320
Of course she will be polite to me.

809
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,050
Why would she treat you the same way?

810
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,210
If she does,

811
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,400
then you should really be mad.

812
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,720
Think about that.

813
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,330
What should I do now?

814
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,610
I actually planned to have a meal here

815
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,250
if Chu Li is in.

816
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,730
Seems like I'd better leave.

817
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,530
I'll place a delivery order.

818
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,210
Pick what you want.

819
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:18,640
Such kindness.

820
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,850
What do you want?

821
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,890
Update me on what Chu Li is doing anytime.

822
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:27,250
Since she's always nice to you.

823
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,850
I want the most pricey
Buddha's Temptation.

824
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,090
1,988 yuan per portion.

825
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,130
That expensive?

826
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,810
What is added to it?

827
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,970
Just order it.

828
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,330
Two portions?

829
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,370
One, for yourself.

830
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:50,970
I'm not hungry.
