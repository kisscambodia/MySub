00:40:49.238 --> 00:40:51.657 line:85.83%,end
I've come this far to forget everything.

00:40:55.077 --> 00:40:56.704 line:85.83%,end
But I can't seem to do it.

00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:01.167 line:85.83%,end
I can't let Yeong-ro die.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.002 line:85.83%,end
What about me

00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:06.922 line:85.83%,end
who came back to the dorm to save you?

00:41:13.512 --> 00:41:14.472 line:85.83%,end
Fine.

00:41:15.389 --> 00:41:17.057 line:85.83%,end
Forget about me.

00:41:17.766 --> 00:41:19.643 line:85.83%,end
But think about how you've been living.

00:41:20.227 --> 00:41:22.605 line:85.83%,end
If you leave on the ship,
you can live a new life.

00:41:22.688 --> 00:41:24.732 line:85.83%,end
You can live in luxury.

00:41:28.777 --> 00:41:30.362 line:85.83%,end
Do you still want to go?

00:41:44.293 --> 00:41:45.461 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry.

00:41:54.887 --> 00:41:55.846 line:85.83%,end
Get out.

00:42:05.814 --> 00:42:07.107 line:85.83%,end
Get out.

00:42:34.593 --> 00:42:36.679 line:85.83%,end
Make it quick and come to the car.

00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:45.062 line:85.83%,end
Move!

00:42:53.028 --> 00:42:54.780 line:85.83%,end
Was it you?

00:42:56.657 --> 00:42:57.950 line:85.83%,end
Not Ms. Oh?

00:42:58.033 --> 00:43:01.161 line:85.83%,end
Don't resent me.
I'm just following the party's orders.

00:43:02.037 --> 00:43:03.497 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol and Gyeok-chan…

00:43:04.873 --> 00:43:06.166 line:85.83%,end
What happened to them?

00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:09.795 line:85.83%,end
Did you think you could live
after betraying the country?

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:19.513 line:85.83%,end
They should've killed their traitor leader
and blown themselves up.

00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:21.557 line:85.83%,end
Like revolutionary warriors should!

00:43:27.313 --> 00:43:28.355 line:85.83%,end
So,

00:43:30.482 --> 00:43:33.193 line:85.83%,end
You who has been living
a revolutionary warrior's life…

00:43:35.654 --> 00:43:37.031 line:85.83%,end
Have you been happy?

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.702 line:85.83%,end
Since you had to hide
your identity from your son,

00:43:43.537 --> 00:43:46.081 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure you couldn't
have been a good dad.

00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:48.751 line:85.83%,end
I feel…

00:43:51.086 --> 00:43:52.755 line:85.83%,end
sorry for you.

00:43:54.923 --> 00:43:56.258 line:85.83%,end
I pity you.

00:43:58.594 --> 00:44:00.429 line:85.83%,end
If I survive this,

00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:03.682 line:85.83%,end
am I going to…

00:44:07.353 --> 00:44:09.063 line:85.83%,end
have to live like you?

00:44:22.284 --> 00:44:24.328 line:85.83%,end
I'm not afraid of death.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.539 line:85.83%,end
But…

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.212 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro is in danger.

00:44:36.131 --> 00:44:38.217 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il has taken control.

00:44:40.969 --> 00:44:42.513 line:85.83%,end
You know what is

00:44:44.556 --> 00:44:46.100 line:85.83%,end
going to happen, don't you?

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.760 line:85.83%,end
God damn it!

00:45:27.182 --> 00:45:29.643 line:85.83%,end
Do you know who I was calling?

00:45:32.855 --> 00:45:36.400 line:85.83%,end
You know Professor Choi Seong-muk
at Humboldt University in Germany, right?

00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:42.322 line:85.83%,end
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:45.534 line:85.83%,end
When I was studying in Germany,

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:50.122 line:85.83%,end
I'd visit the professor's house
with my friends,
