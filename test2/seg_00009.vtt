00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:53.250 line:85.83%,end
and one day,

00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:57.463 line:85.83%,end
I brushed by a man leaving after meeting
the professor in the reception room.

00:45:59.173 --> 00:46:01.800 line:85.83%,end
I think it was about six seconds.

00:46:02.384 --> 00:46:04.136 line:85.83%,end
Then the professor let us

00:46:04.386 --> 00:46:09.224 line:85.83%,end
taste the bear bile liquor
from Bukhan Mountain that guy gifted him.

00:46:10.893 --> 00:46:15.147 line:85.83%,end
The smell of the liquor was so strong
that I could never forget it.

00:46:25.199 --> 00:46:26.450 line:85.83%,end
And I found this

00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:29.995 line:85.83%,end
in your room yesterday.

00:46:30.078 --> 00:46:30.954 line:85.83%,end
My goodness.

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:34.374 line:85.83%,end
I'm so sorry, ma'am. I really am.

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:38.670 line:85.83%,end
I'm well aware that I can't drink
alcohol in the dorm, but--

00:46:38.754 --> 00:46:40.631 line:85.83%,end
When I smelled this,

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.050 line:85.83%,end
I remembered vividly.

00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:48.096 line:85.83%,end
That the man I brushed by
in Professor Choi's house…

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:52.935 line:85.83%,end
was you.

00:46:56.146 --> 00:46:58.065 line:85.83%,end
No, it couldn't be me.

00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.191 line:85.83%,end
I have

00:46:59.942 --> 00:47:03.529 line:85.83%,end
been working
as the hall director of this dorm

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:07.533 line:85.83%,end
for 10 years, 5 months, and 12 days now.

00:47:08.242 --> 00:47:12.746 line:85.83%,end
So don't you try to say I'm mistaken
or I must've seen wrong.

00:47:25.926 --> 00:47:27.386 line:85.83%,end
So will you report me?

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:36.687 line:85.83%,end
You're dying of terminal cancer.
Why are you being so nosy?

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:45.112 line:85.83%,end
I knew it. My hunch was right.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.198 line:85.83%,end
You're a Northern spy, aren't you?

00:47:56.665 --> 00:47:58.584 line:85.83%,end
As Jo Ja-lip in China,

00:47:59.918 --> 00:48:02.004 line:85.83%,end
as Korean-German Park Seung-cheol
in Germany,

00:48:02.796 --> 00:48:05.549 line:85.83%,end
as Kanemoto Tatsuya in Japan,

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.135 line:85.83%,end
and as Kim Man-dong.

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:13.056 line:85.83%,end
Do you know how I've managed

00:48:13.682 --> 00:48:15.976 line:85.83%,end
to keep my identity hidden for 30 years?

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:22.065 line:85.83%,end
By killing everyone who found out
who I was without mercy.

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:26.695 line:85.83%,end
All right.

00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:30.490 line:85.83%,end
I'll make an exception
and give you a final chance.

00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:35.037 line:85.83%,end
The chance to contribute
to the unification with me

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.998 line:85.83%,end
and go down in history
as a revolutionary martyr

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:43.295 line:85.83%,end
rather than die as a mere hall director
that no one would remember.

00:48:47.007 --> 00:48:48.258 line:85.83%,end
What do you say?

00:48:58.477 --> 00:48:59.603 line:85.83%,end
Is that a no?

00:49:03.023 --> 00:49:05.317 line:85.83%,end
If I have to live as a slave
to an ideology,

00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:07.569 line:85.83%,end
I choose to die as Song Hui-ju.

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.655 line:85.83%,end
A slave?

00:49:10.864 --> 00:49:12.991 line:85.83%,end
It's our Supreme Leader's noble love
for the people--

00:49:13.075 --> 00:49:14.034 line:85.83%,end
Love?

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.496 line:85.83%,end
They have no freedom, so how is it love?

00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:20.290 line:85.83%,end
He says he loves them,
but he deceives, exploits,

00:49:20.374 --> 00:49:23.377 line:85.83%,end
-and rules them by fear!
-You damn wench!

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.673 line:85.83%,end
Even if plucking a strand of someone's
hair would make the world a better place,

00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:30.008 line:85.83%,end
a wench like you still wouldn't do it.

00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:32.302 line:85.83%,end
You're wrong!

00:49:34.096 --> 00:49:35.389 line:85.83%,end
I also

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:38.183 line:85.83%,end
used to dream of an equal world.

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:42.562 line:85.83%,end
Because I used to
be an enthusiastic Marxist too!

00:49:45.232 --> 00:49:46.400 line:85.83%,end
But…

00:49:48.276 --> 00:49:51.738 line:85.83%,end
The world that exists only for one person?
Does that make sense to you?

00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:54.032 line:85.83%,end
How is that an equal world?

00:49:59.287 --> 00:50:01.081 line:85.83%,end
All for one!

00:50:02.374 --> 00:50:04.292 line:85.83%,end
And one for all!

00:50:05.752 --> 00:50:07.546 line:85.83%,end
That's our party's key slogan.

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.841 line:85.83%,end
We're all equal and living well
in the North.

00:50:13.593 --> 00:50:15.095 line:85.83%,end
Don't be absurd.

00:50:16.138 --> 00:50:20.434 line:85.83%,end
You must've seen and heard many things
while living as a spy,

00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:21.977 line:85.83%,end
so you must know

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:25.897 line:85.83%,end
that only one person's truly
leading his own life in your country.

00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:27.816 line:85.83%,end
You know nothing. How dare you!

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:34.740 line:85.83%,end
In this rotten capitalistic land,
all you care about

00:50:35.824 --> 00:50:39.453 line:85.83%,end
is eating well and living well.
Your bodily life.

00:50:40.454 --> 00:50:42.622 line:85.83%,end
But to us, our immortal, political lives

00:50:43.081 --> 00:50:44.833 line:85.83%,end
are more important.

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:49.463 line:85.83%,end
What? Political lives?

00:50:49.963 --> 00:50:51.423 line:85.83%,end
Immortal?
