<i>fabricating the North Korean spy case
in Munich</i>

00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:50.257 line:85.83%,end

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.758 line:85.83%,end

00:25:51.841 --> 00:25:55.220 line:85.83%,end
<i>a student of Professor Choi Seong-muk,
a pro-North scholar.</i>

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.766 line:85.83%,end
<i>I held out for a few weeks,
but in the end…</i>

00:26:02.978 --> 00:26:05.105 line:85.83%,end
<i>I made a false confession.</i>

00:26:11.778 --> 00:26:13.280 line:85.83%,end
A false confession?

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.284 line:85.83%,end
They insisted I was the one
who'd been to Pyongyang with my fiancé.

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:20.996 line:85.83%,end
And I told them it wasn't me…

00:26:23.957 --> 00:26:25.292 line:85.83%,end
but Yeon-ok.

00:26:27.627 --> 00:26:30.338 line:85.83%,end
The woman who fell in love with my fiancé.

00:26:35.635 --> 00:26:36.845 line:85.83%,end
So,

00:26:38.054 --> 00:26:41.516 line:85.83%,end
my sister died because of you?

00:26:44.978 --> 00:26:46.479 line:85.83%,end
Yes, I'm to blame.

00:26:47.647 --> 00:26:51.526 line:85.83%,end
Because of me, Yeon-ok killed herself
while being tortured, and my fiancé

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.113 line:85.83%,end
became a vegetable
because of all the torture.

00:26:56.364 --> 00:26:58.450 line:85.83%,end
TAXI

00:26:58.533 --> 00:27:00.285 line:85.83%,end
Safe travels, ma'am.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.500 line:85.83%,end
<i>I visited him once a month
and paid his hospital bills.</i>

00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:10.211 line:85.83%,end
And I kept you by my side
to look after you

00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:14.507 line:85.83%,end
and justify what I did over and over
telling myself that…

00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:19.137 line:85.83%,end
anyone in my shoes would've made
a false confession.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.806 line:85.83%,end
That's a lie! You know that's a lie.

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:26.519 line:85.83%,end
You did that to get back at her
for stealing your fiancé.

00:27:29.356 --> 00:27:31.483 line:85.83%,end
If you did it because of torture,

00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:33.818 line:85.83%,end
you wouldn't have been
spying for the ANSP.

00:27:35.487 --> 00:27:38.198 line:85.83%,end
Right. Maybe…

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:42.494 line:85.83%,end
a part of me wanted to get back at her.

00:27:44.621 --> 00:27:46.456 line:85.83%,end
Because I resented Yeon-ok.

00:27:47.582 --> 00:27:49.501 line:85.83%,end
I resented her so much.

00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:03.431 line:85.83%,end
So you were going to take it to the grave?

00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:07.894 line:85.83%,end
I knew it was only right that I should

00:28:09.646 --> 00:28:13.358 line:85.83%,end
tell you and your parents the truth
and beg for forgiveness someday.

00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:15.443 line:85.83%,end
I knew that very well.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.532 line:85.83%,end
But I was afraid.

00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:25.745 line:85.83%,end
I was so afraid, Bun-ok.

00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:32.377 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP offered me the hall director job
and told me to spy for them,

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.254 line:85.83%,end
and I couldn't say no.

00:28:36.464 --> 00:28:38.675 line:85.83%,end
I had no other choice. I…

00:28:40.927 --> 00:28:42.387 line:85.83%,end
I just…

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.812 line:85.83%,end
had to live.

00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:03.074 line:85.83%,end
Didn't you tell me
not to try to only save my skin?

00:29:08.621 --> 00:29:10.707 line:85.83%,end
I'll never forgive you.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:11.875 line:85.83%,end
I will

00:29:12.959 --> 00:29:15.295 line:85.83%,end
never forgive you.

00:29:46.826 --> 00:29:47.911 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo.

00:29:50.079 --> 00:29:51.748 line:85.83%,end
The ship arrives in ten minutes.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.421 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang and Comrade Lim
must be on their way, right?

00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:01.966 line:85.83%,end
They even managed
to march 90km overnight once.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:11.976 line:85.83%,end
By the way,

00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:15.730 line:85.83%,end
it seems Comrade Kang

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:18.441 line:85.83%,end
has feelings for Comrade Lim, doesn't it?

00:30:19.359 --> 00:30:22.570 line:85.83%,end
That must be why she came back
with the 300 million dollars.

00:30:23.613 --> 00:30:27.075 line:85.83%,end
I got to say,
the power of love is indeed great.

00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:28.785 line:85.83%,end
Damn.

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:33.957 line:85.83%,end
Anyway,

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.708 line:85.83%,end
the moon looks

00:30:36.292 --> 00:30:38.545 line:85.83%,end
just like a <i>songpyeon.</i>

00:30:39.796 --> 00:30:42.048 line:85.83%,end
The <i>songpyeon</i> my mom makes
