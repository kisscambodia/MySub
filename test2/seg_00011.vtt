MILITARY OPERATION
DO NOT CROSS

00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:16.206 line:85.83%,end
<i>Please.</i>

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.293 line:85.83%,end
Please…

00:56:21.753 --> 00:56:24.047 line:85.83%,end
save the students.

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.633 line:85.83%,end
<i>Once Nam Tae-il takes over,</i>

00:56:27.175 --> 00:56:28.927 line:85.83%,end
<i>he'll try to blow up the dorm right away.</i>

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:32.889 line:85.83%,end
<i>So I'll release the students
before he comes.</i>

00:56:33.473 --> 00:56:35.642 line:85.83%,end
Keeping people's mouths shut
is the ANSP's specialty.

00:56:36.684 --> 00:56:38.186 line:85.83%,end
So it won't be a problem.

00:56:39.604 --> 00:56:40.730 line:85.83%,end
What about you?

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.359 line:85.83%,end
I…

00:56:46.861 --> 00:56:48.696 line:85.83%,end
I'll live quietly for the rest of my life.

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:52.492 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'll make false statements
if you need me to.</i>

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:53.868 line:85.83%,end
<i>"The ANSP</i>

00:56:54.702 --> 00:56:57.997 line:85.83%,end
has persistently strived
to save the students

00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:02.544 line:85.83%,end
from the vicious armed Northern spies."

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:07.132 line:85.83%,end
How can I trust you?

00:57:18.017 --> 00:57:21.354 line:85.83%,end
They are just
innocent young college girls!

00:57:23.648 --> 00:57:24.899 line:85.83%,end
You know that!

00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:30.405 line:85.83%,end
<i>If the students can be spared,</i>

00:57:31.072 --> 00:57:32.407 line:85.83%,end
I'll betray

00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:35.994 line:85.83%,end
my conscience and convictions
without hesitation.

00:57:42.876 --> 00:57:44.043 line:85.83%,end
All right.

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:46.254 line:85.83%,end
Release them in five minutes.

00:57:48.715 --> 00:57:50.133 line:85.83%,end
Honey!

00:57:50.842 --> 00:57:53.720 line:85.83%,end
You're not even the ANSP director anymore!

00:57:54.387 --> 00:57:57.015 line:85.83%,end
-You must get out of this for the future!
-Chief An.

00:58:00.101 --> 00:58:01.561 line:85.83%,end
Call the reporters in.

00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:03.938 line:85.83%,end
Releasing the students
is advantageous to us.

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.861 line:85.83%,end
Gang-mu.

00:58:11.446 --> 00:58:12.447 line:85.83%,end
Gang-mu?

00:58:13.865 --> 00:58:14.991 line:85.83%,end
Mr. An.

00:58:16.367 --> 00:58:17.660 line:85.83%,end
Listen.

00:58:18.995 --> 00:58:22.123 line:85.83%,end
You saw the SWAT team was largely
reinforced and the dorm is surrounded.

00:58:22.707 --> 00:58:24.792 line:85.83%,end
And there are no reporters at the scene.

00:58:25.793 --> 00:58:26.836 line:85.83%,end
I'm warning you.

00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:31.299 line:85.83%,end
Anyone who gets out of the dorm
will be killed immediately.

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:48.691 line:85.83%,end
An.

00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:53.071 line:85.83%,end
I'm sorry,

00:58:53.404 --> 00:58:55.990 line:85.83%,end
but I need you to leave the scene now.

00:59:06.501 --> 00:59:07.919 line:85.83%,end
Let's get out.

00:59:08.002 --> 00:59:10.880 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il is coming. We must go!

00:59:17.428 --> 00:59:18.763 line:85.83%,end
ROASTED SWEET POTATO

00:59:33.361 --> 00:59:36.114 line:85.83%,end
Hey, wait. You need to pay.

00:59:36.197 --> 00:59:37.782 line:85.83%,end
No, look at that.

00:59:38.449 --> 00:59:39.492 line:85.83%,end
Look over there.

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.522 line:85.83%,end
CANDIDATE NO.1, PARK MU-YEOL
A COUNTRY WITHOUT CONFUSION

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:40.094 line:85.83%,end
Crush it.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.930 line:85.83%,end
Stop!

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:46.309 line:85.83%,end
Stop!
