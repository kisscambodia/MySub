<i>Lim Soo-ho and his gang near the washroom!</i>

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.254 line:85.83%,end
<i>We need backup!</i>

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.883 line:85.83%,end
Team A, what's going on?
Report now. Team A!

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.052 line:85.83%,end
Go after them. Now!

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.429 line:85.83%,end
All units, in the direction
of the washroom!

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:49.349 line:85.83%,end
All units, in the direction
of the washroom! Move!

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.100 line:85.83%,end
Now…

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.322 line:85.83%,end
To Pyeongtaek Port.

00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:49.117 line:85.83%,end
-Why are you going there?
-My goodness!

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.620 line:85.83%,end
Who the hell is this guy?

00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:55.164 line:85.83%,end
-You…
-We don't have time!

00:06:58.334 --> 00:06:59.377 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.174 line:85.83%,end
You… Goodness.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:13.516 line:85.83%,end
Soo-ho!

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.573 line:85.83%,end
They won't kill Soo-ho
as long as he has the 300 million dollars.

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:32.034 line:85.83%,end
But what about Man-dong?

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.746 line:85.83%,end
He's going after Soo-ho.
Will he really kill him?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.081 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry.

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:38.833 line:85.83%,end
He's a veteran agent.

00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:41.502 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure he'll be safe.

00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:49.635 line:85.83%,end
Your father lied to us again.
All of you 33 hostages are in danger.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.054 line:85.83%,end
Now you and I

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.599 line:85.83%,end
must fight against him.

00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:09.322 line:85.83%,end
<i>Put out an APB</i>

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:11.866 line:85.83%,end
and step up inspections at ports.

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:15.161 line:85.83%,end
Set up checkpoints
at the major intersections too.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:35.848 line:85.83%,end
Get out of the car.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.893 line:85.83%,end
Why do you keep telling me to get out?

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.521 line:85.83%,end
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.064 line:85.83%,end
You disabled the booby trap.

00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:46.400 line:85.83%,end
You even ran after all these years
you said you had bad joints!

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:50.196 line:85.83%,end
I mean, who on earth are you really, Dad?

00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:56.244 line:85.83%,end
Just get out of the car, you brat.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:58.663 line:85.83%,end
Get out, and we'll talk.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:00.665 line:85.83%,end
No.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.291 line:85.83%,end
I won't.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.709 line:85.83%,end
Not before you tell me.

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:07.421 line:85.83%,end
Why on earth are you going
to Pyeongtaek this late at night?

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:08.631 line:85.83%,end
We're going to be late.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.308 line:85.83%,end
Get out.

00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:23.521 line:85.83%,end
What does it matter who I am?

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:29.402 line:85.83%,end
Get out.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:32.738 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:44.166 line:85.83%,end
Just consider me dead from now on.

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:52.883 line:85.83%,end
Dad…

TAEGEUK HARDWARE STORE

<i>How did I not know he was a Northern spy?</i>

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:09.859 line:85.83%,end
It means he's the one who framed Ms. Oh.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.944 line:85.83%,end
But what do you think

00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:14.697 line:85.83%,end
he's been doing in the dorm?

00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:18.492 line:85.83%,end
I'm not sure.
But this is a women's dormitory,

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.703 line:85.83%,end
so it must've been
the perfect place to hide.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.415 line:85.83%,end
Do you think they're going to

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.834 line:85.83%,end
break in tonight?

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.838 line:85.83%,end
We should be prepared.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.924 line:85.83%,end
We should set more booby traps
