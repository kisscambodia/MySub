Chief Kim.

00:35:49.605 --> 00:35:52.233 line:85.83%,end
-Hey, beat him.
-It wasn't me.

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:54.861 line:85.83%,end
No! It wasn't me! I didn't know!

00:35:54.944 --> 00:35:56.737 line:85.83%,end
I had no idea, you bastard!

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.990 line:85.83%,end
How on earth could I know
she was a commie?

00:35:59.073 --> 00:36:00.199 line:85.83%,end
Beat him!

00:36:00.283 --> 00:36:01.534 line:85.83%,end
-Yes, sir!
-No!

00:36:01.617 --> 00:36:02.577 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Nam!

00:36:04.245 --> 00:36:06.581 line:85.83%,end
Why are you still calling him that?

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:11.544 line:85.83%,end
The Chief Presidential Secretary
wants to talk to you.

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:22.346 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Kim! This is Nam Tae-il.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.433 line:85.83%,end
<i>The President wants you
to clean up the mess.</i>

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.813 line:85.83%,end
This is your last chance.

00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:35.735 line:85.83%,end
Thank you!

00:36:39.155 --> 00:36:40.823 line:85.83%,end
I swear on my life!

00:36:41.365 --> 00:36:42.783 line:85.83%,end
At all costs!

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:44.702 line:85.83%,end
No matter what!

00:36:45.077 --> 00:36:48.164 line:85.83%,end
I'll clean it up neatly.
Please tell the President that!

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:50.082 line:85.83%,end
Thank you!

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.699 line:85.83%,end
You bastard!

00:37:23.783 --> 00:37:27.578 line:85.83%,end
You're nothing but the Chief of the
anti-communist investigation department!

00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:31.499 line:85.83%,end
How dare you beat me up,
this country's number two!

00:37:32.708 --> 00:37:34.627 line:85.83%,end
Damn it. I'm Nam Tae-il,

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:38.589 line:85.83%,end
the shepherd protecting the President!

00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:41.759 line:85.83%,end
How dare you treat me
like a freaking commie!

00:37:57.149 --> 00:37:58.484 line:85.83%,end
Where's Choi?

00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:01.362 line:85.83%,end
Hui-jun…

00:38:03.072 --> 00:38:04.740 line:85.83%,end
Release him right now.

00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:06.325 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:38:16.877 --> 00:38:18.296 line:85.83%,end
DIRECTOR EUN CHANG-SU

00:38:32.435 --> 00:38:33.602 line:85.83%,end
Hui-jun.

00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:37.732 line:85.83%,end
I'll take Eun down
and make you the director.

00:38:38.566 --> 00:38:39.567 line:85.83%,end
Tae-il…

00:38:42.278 --> 00:38:43.946 line:85.83%,end
I'll serve you with my life.

00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:48.534 line:85.83%,end
This is our last chance.
We must get it done with our lives.

00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:55.666 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang.

00:38:56.709 --> 00:38:59.503 line:85.83%,end
This is great.
We still have 30 minutes left.

00:39:02.757 --> 00:39:05.301 line:85.83%,end
<i>According to an official
from the Blue House,</i>

00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:08.262 line:85.83%,end
<i>a wiretapping agent at the scene exposed</i>

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:11.891 line:85.83%,end
<i>that Director Eun's daughter
had been actively helping the spies,</i>

00:39:11.974 --> 00:39:14.560 line:85.83%,end
<i>and it was the main reason
of Director Eun's dismissal.</i>

00:39:15.144 --> 00:39:19.398 line:85.83%,end
<i>Let's hear from Secretary-General Nam
Tae-il who will now lead the task force.</i>

00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:22.777 line:85.83%,end
<i>It's very regrettable
that the ANSP director's daughter</i>

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.403 line:85.83%,end
<i>has helped the Northern spies.</i>

00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:28.741 line:85.83%,end
<i>I promise to completely annihilate them
by the end of today,</i>

00:39:28.824 --> 00:39:32.203 line:85.83%,end
<i>so I urge our fellow citizens
not to deceived by false rumors,</i>

00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:34.413 line:85.83%,end
<i>and to keep calm and carry on.</i>

00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:41.420 line:85.83%,end
Don't let it bother you.
We have nothing to do with them anymore.

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:45.674 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure

00:39:47.301 --> 00:39:49.470 line:85.83%,end
Nam Tae-il will try to blow up the dorm

00:39:50.763 --> 00:39:52.598 line:85.83%,end
because the hostages know who you are.

00:39:52.681 --> 00:39:54.141 line:85.83%,end
I told you, it's not your concern.

00:40:01.524 --> 00:40:02.900 line:85.83%,end
I have to go back.

00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:07.321 line:85.83%,end
What?

00:40:12.451 --> 00:40:13.953 line:85.83%,end
Yeong-ro is in danger.

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:26.757 line:85.83%,end
You'll die if you go.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.761 line:85.83%,end
You will die.

00:40:32.888 --> 00:40:36.267 line:85.83%,end
Forget her.
Let's forget everything and leave.
