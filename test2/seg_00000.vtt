FINAL EPISODE

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.977 line:85.83%,end
When I came back here,
I hid the car I drove near the temple.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.354 line:85.83%,end
We'll get out through this window

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.857 line:85.83%,end
and leave in that car.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.275 line:85.83%,end
Okay.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.529 line:85.83%,end
Eun Chang-su will be flustered
when he finds out we're gone.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.366 line:85.83%,end
Don't slow us down out there, okay?

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:45.957 line:85.83%,end
Let's hurry.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.209 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Lee! Ms. Pi!

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.465 line:85.83%,end
He swore on his late son's honor,
but he fooled us again?

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.301 line:85.83%,end
What about Gal?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.680 line:85.83%,end
Don't worry.
I'll expose it tonight at all cost.

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:02.307 line:85.83%,end
Yes, you must

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.017 line:85.83%,end
<i>to stop Eun Chang-su from killing us.</i>

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.268 line:85.83%,end
But be careful.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.021 line:85.83%,end
Han-na, you too. Over and out.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.982 line:85.83%,end
What's the fuss about?

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.526 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Kim is suspicious.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:17.238 line:85.83%,end
I heard him radio someone
in the records room.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.990 line:85.83%,end
What do you mean?

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.450 line:85.83%,end
Radio?

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.412 line:85.83%,end
"Eliminate the agents including Lim Soo-ho

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.497 line:85.83%,end
and return with Moran Hill."

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:29.792 line:85.83%,end
Are you sure?

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.336 line:85.83%,end
Eliminate Lim Soo-ho?

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.420 line:85.83%,end
And the others too?

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.924 line:85.83%,end
Yes. I heard it clearly.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:40.511 line:85.83%,end
And I heard him order someone
to get a vehicle ready by the shrine.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:41.930 line:85.83%,end
Where is he?

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.723 line:85.83%,end
I think he's trying to leave the dorm.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.808 line:85.83%,end
I saw him going down to the records room.

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:55.568 line:85.83%,end
Where on earth did the old man go?

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:56.653 line:85.83%,end
Gosh.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.408 line:85.83%,end
Dad?

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.311 line:85.83%,end
Soo-ho!

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.082 line:85.83%,end
Soo-ho, what are you doing?

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:55.628 line:85.83%,end
Come out here now.
