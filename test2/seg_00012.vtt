Halt!

01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:17.298 line:85.83%,end
This is unprecedented.

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:20.259 line:85.83%,end
What's the reason you,
the Secretary-General, took a tank here?

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:22.470 line:85.83%,end
Is this an operation
that has been planned out?

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.350 line:85.83%,end
Fellow citizens,

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.143 line:85.83%,end
I'm General Nam Tae-il

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:33.773 line:85.83%,end
who led tanks across Han River
and saved the country from the crisis.

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:36.401 line:85.83%,end
And I've come myself

01:01:36.484 --> 01:01:40.154 line:85.83%,end
to punish the commie bastards
holding people hostage

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:43.074 line:85.83%,end
in the middle of the capital of Korea.

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:46.327 line:85.83%,end
I will make sure

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:50.206 line:85.83%,end
to put an end to this completely.

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:56.796 line:85.83%,end
Advance!

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:59.257 line:85.83%,end
-My goodness.
-Hey, move.

01:02:00.174 --> 01:02:01.509 line:85.83%,end
Move aside!

01:02:21.779 --> 01:02:24.907 line:85.83%,end
<i>Secretary-General Nam Tae-il
has taken the M48 Patton</i>

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:28.244 line:85.83%,end
<i>to Hosu University
from the Capital Defense Command.</i>

01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:30.747 line:85.83%,end
<i>If martial law has been declared,</i>

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:34.542 line:85.83%,end
<i>it's likely that troops will be sent
to Hosu University soon.</i>

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:38.546 line:85.83%,end
<i>The Ministry of National Defense
hasn't made any announcements yet,</i>

01:02:38.629 --> 01:02:41.424 line:85.83%,end
<i>but since the armed spies
can blow themselves up any moment,</i>

01:02:41.507 --> 01:02:43.426 line:85.83%,end
<i>-the military seems</i>
-Is that a tank?

01:02:43.509 --> 01:02:44.594 line:85.83%,end
<i>-to be taking</i>
-It is!

01:02:44.677 --> 01:02:47.597 line:85.83%,end
<i>-a hard line on its own.</i>
-Oh, no! What do we do?

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.766 line:85.83%,end
What I'm seeing right now

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.142 line:85.83%,end
is a tank, right?

01:02:51.225 --> 01:02:53.436 line:85.83%,end
Are they saying the tank is coming here?

01:02:53.519 --> 01:02:54.645 line:85.83%,end
Are we going to die?

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:56.731 line:85.83%,end
What do we do now?

01:02:56.814 --> 01:03:00.568 line:85.83%,end
What now? You're the only person
who can fight with a gun here!

01:03:00.651 --> 01:03:03.279 line:85.83%,end
I really don't want to die here!

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.449 line:85.83%,end
Where did the spies go
after making this mess?

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:09.118 line:85.83%,end
-Did they run off
-Calm down.

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:10.828 line:85.83%,end
after putting us in danger?

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:12.955 line:85.83%,end
-I don't want to die!
-Calm down!

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.292 line:85.83%,end
WE ARE THE VICTIMS OF THE ELECTION SCHEME

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.090 line:85.83%,end
Before they break in,

01:03:25.259 --> 01:03:27.428 line:85.83%,end
we will get out of the dorm.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.435 line:85.83%,end
Let's all go to the prayer room. Now.

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:36.687 line:85.83%,end
Come on. Let's go!

01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:38.231 line:85.83%,end
Let's go. Hurry!

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:40.733 line:85.83%,end
-Hurry up!
-I'm so scared!

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:43.069 line:85.83%,end
-I'm scared.
-Let's go.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:48.741 line:85.83%,end
-Salute!
-Salute!

01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:52.995 line:85.83%,end
-Welcome back, sir.
-Sir.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.001 line:85.83%,end
Hey.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:01.087 line:85.83%,end
Why is that bastard still here?

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.255 line:85.83%,end
Huh?

01:04:04.757 --> 01:04:07.552 line:85.83%,end
God, you think
you can be here as you like?

01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:09.262 line:85.83%,end
Get them out!

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:14.058 line:85.83%,end
-This way, sir.
-Hey, get me the detonator. Now.

01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:15.184 line:85.83%,end
Are you looking for this?

01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:19.272 line:85.83%,end
You bastard--

01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:37.415 line:85.83%,end
Honey!

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:39.292 line:85.83%,end
Honeyâ€¦

01:04:40.334 --> 01:04:41.836 line:85.83%,end
You idiot.

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:45.381 line:85.83%,end
You know Han-na said on the radio

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:48.175 line:85.83%,end
we'd kill all the students

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:50.261 line:85.83%,end
We must

01:04:50.344 --> 01:04:53.014 line:85.83%,end
save all of them to win the election.

01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:57.560 line:85.83%,end
We must save the students.

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:00.897 line:85.83%,end
The President ordered to kill them all,
you bastard!

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:04.358 line:85.83%,end
-The President ordered to kill them!
-Get them out now!

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:06.986 line:85.83%,end
-How dare you!
-Calm down.

01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:15.786 line:85.83%,end
Let's go to the hospital first.

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:16.913 line:85.83%,end
Hold on.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:19.832 line:85.83%,end
Yes, Seung-jun.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.711 line:85.83%,end
Let Jang Han-na go.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.630 line:85.83%,end
Jang Han-na, sir?

01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:28.591 line:85.83%,end
Are you trying to make an enemy of Code 1?

01:05:28.674 --> 01:05:30.301 line:85.83%,end
What's wrong with you?

01:05:30.384 --> 01:05:34.180 line:85.83%,end
Well, but she's being questioned
about the broadcast.

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.264 line:85.83%,end
Now!

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.183 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:38.476 line:85.83%,end
<i>Understood, sir.</i>

01:05:45.232 --> 01:05:47.234 line:85.83%,end
-How did it go last night?
-I lost it all.

01:05:49.153 --> 01:05:50.988 line:85.83%,end
-You really lost it all?
-Yes.

01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:53.908 line:85.83%,end
Okay, then. It'll be my treat tonight.
