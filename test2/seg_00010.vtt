00:50:52.799 --> 00:50:55.093 line:85.83%,end
That sounds like
some pseudo-religious cult.

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:58.346 line:85.83%,end
You people don't understand.

00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:01.016 line:85.83%,end
You'll never understand.

00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:13.320 line:85.83%,end
You're all vermin
living without any ideology!

00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:14.905 line:85.83%,end
So how can you

00:51:15.363 --> 00:51:16.823 line:85.83%,end
possibly understand us?

00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:23.538 line:85.83%,end
Now I can see.

00:51:24.039 --> 00:51:25.582 line:85.83%,end
I feel…

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.169 line:85.83%,end
so bad for you.

00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:39.012 line:85.83%,end
I… pity you.

00:52:23.431 --> 00:52:25.183 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol and Gyeok-chan are…

00:52:28.103 --> 00:52:29.813 line:85.83%,end
I'm sure they killed them.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:34.151 line:85.83%,end
Like pawns they're done using.

00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:39.531 line:85.83%,end
Once you get to Qingdao,

00:52:40.532 --> 00:52:42.576 line:85.83%,end
you should leave for somewhere safer.

00:52:58.508 --> 00:52:59.593 line:85.83%,end
You take it.

00:53:00.594 --> 00:53:01.761 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Kang.

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.096 line:85.83%,end
If you have this,

00:53:03.597 --> 00:53:05.849 line:85.83%,end
they won't try to kill you rashly.

00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:10.353 line:85.83%,end
If it can save your life,

00:53:11.563 --> 00:53:13.023 line:85.83%,end
that's enough for me.

00:53:29.956 --> 00:53:32.584 line:85.83%,end
You need it to live a comfortable life.

00:53:34.836 --> 00:53:36.713 line:85.83%,end
Don't make my heart

00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:39.799 line:85.83%,end
heavier than it already is.

00:53:42.677 --> 00:53:44.596 line:85.83%,end
Eung-cheol, Gyeok-chan, and I

00:53:45.096 --> 00:53:46.765 line:85.83%,end
are all branded traitors,

00:53:48.516 --> 00:53:50.227 line:85.83%,end
so our families must be in danger.

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:53.480 line:85.83%,end
Please get them

00:53:54.981 --> 00:53:57.400 line:85.83%,end
out of the country for us…

00:53:59.986 --> 00:54:02.030 line:85.83%,end
and help them live comfortably.

00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:05.533 line:85.83%,end
I will.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:10.538 line:85.83%,end
I will keep that promise no matter what.

00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:13.750 line:85.83%,end
Thank you.

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:19.673 line:85.83%,end
My name is Eun-hye.

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:21.967 line:85.83%,end
Kim Eun-hye.

00:54:29.057 --> 00:54:30.350 line:85.83%,end
I hope…

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.229 line:85.83%,end
you live an ordinary, happy life

00:54:35.522 --> 00:54:36.940 line:85.83%,end
as Kim Eun-hye,

00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:40.944 line:85.83%,end
leaving behind the lives

00:54:42.487 --> 00:54:44.739 line:85.83%,end
you lived as Kang Cheong-ya
and Moran Hill 1.

00:54:57.419 --> 00:54:58.545 line:85.83%,end
And I…

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:39.419 line:85.83%,end
GIVE BACK MY DAUGHTER

00:55:41.254 --> 00:55:43.923 line:85.83%,end
STOP THIS EVIL MASSACRE
