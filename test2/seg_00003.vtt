00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:40.022 line:85.83%,end
I'm not a man of conviction
or a patriot like you,

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:44.026 line:85.83%,end
but those trying to kill innocent students
to regain power…

00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:46.195 line:85.83%,end
I can't sit by and watch anymore.

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:49.114 line:85.83%,end
<i>I'm going to fight against those bastards.</i>

00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:51.742 line:85.83%,end
<i>So get out of there alive.</i>

00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:54.536 line:85.83%,end
<i>And kids, are you listening?</i>

00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:56.330 line:85.83%,end
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:58.499 line:85.83%,end
<i>You never give up too!</i>

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:04.505 line:85.83%,end
You have hard evidence
that it's an election scheme, right?

00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:06.548 line:85.83%,end
Yes, I do.

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:10.386 line:85.83%,end
<i>When I obtained it, I sent it
to the press, but the ANSP confiscated it.</i>

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:13.097 line:85.83%,end
<i>That's why
I've decided to expose it myself.</i>

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.432 line:85.83%,end
I was in the task force myself,
and I recorded

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:18.686 line:85.83%,end
<i>-those leading the scheme with the North--
-You have listened</i>

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:20.646 line:85.83%,end
<i>to the JBC network radio channel</i>

00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:24.149 line:85.83%,end
<i>from Seoul, the capital
of the Republic of Korea.</i>

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:27.277 line:85.83%,end
<i>-Thank you for listening.</i>
-What the hell?

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:31.156 line:85.83%,end
Why are you here?

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:39.873 line:85.83%,end
Anyway, she couldn't finish
what she was saying.

00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:43.168 line:85.83%,end
Still, she managed to say the hostage
situation is an election scheme.

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:45.921 line:85.83%,end
You're right.
An ANSP agent blew the whistle,

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.756 line:85.83%,end
so it'll cause a huge stir.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.341 line:85.83%,end
Shouldn't we do something too?

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:52.469 line:85.83%,end
You're right. We can't just sit by
and watch. Don't you agree?

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:53.637 line:85.83%,end
You're right.

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:56.473 line:85.83%,end
Then how about we hang a banner that says

00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:59.268 line:85.83%,end
this hostage situation
is an election scheme?

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:00.936 line:85.83%,end
-I'm for it.
-Me too.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.604 line:85.83%,end
-I'm for it too.
-Me too.

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.441 line:85.83%,end
I'll help too.
But do we have what we need to make it?

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:46.148 line:85.83%,end
If you make it to another country,

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.819 line:85.83%,end
what do you want to do?

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.540 line:85.83%,end
What about you, Comrade Kang?

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.466 line:85.83%,end
I just want to live

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:14.802 line:85.83%,end
an ordinary life

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:18.889 line:85.83%,end
having babies, cooking, doing the laundry,

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:23.477 line:85.83%,end
and nagging at my kids and husband

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:26.814 line:85.83%,end
from time to time.

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.651 line:85.83%,end
I want to live like that.

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:35.906 line:85.83%,end
Without thinking about things
like country,

00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:38.033 line:85.83%,end
revolutions, or missions.

00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:47.042 line:85.83%,end
Will that be possible?

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.384 line:85.83%,end
Yes, you'll live that life.

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:38.135 line:85.83%,end
-Save my child! Please!
-Save my kid!

00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:40.220 line:85.83%,end
STOP THIS ELECTION SCHEME IMMEDIATELY

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:42.139 line:85.83%,end
-Give me back my child!
-Save them!

00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:45.184 line:85.83%,end
-Let me through!
-Save my kid!

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:48.896 line:85.83%,end
-Give me back my child!
-Save them!

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:51.523 line:85.83%,end
-Let me through!
-Give me back my daughter!

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:54.860 line:85.83%,end
Take all of the parents
to the interrogation rooms right away.

00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:56.153 line:85.83%,end
And…

00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:58.822 line:85.83%,end
Release An Gyeong-hui.

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.574 line:85.83%,end
Tell him to get rid of Han-na. Now!

00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:01.909 line:85.83%,end
Yes, sir.

00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:08.874 line:85.83%,end
Understood, sir.

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:11.376 line:85.83%,end
I will cover this up at all costs.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.129 line:85.83%,end
I will serve you with my life, Mr. Eun.

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:21.136 line:85.83%,end
Once those running
with the 300 million dollars are caught,

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.889 line:85.83%,end
we'll be able to live in luxury
like we used to.

00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:25.098 line:85.83%,end
Honey, listen.

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:28.894 line:85.83%,end
This is a heaven-sent opportunity.
You must get it done.

00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:30.020 line:85.83%,end
Charlotte.

00:20:30.103 --> 00:20:31.063 line:85.83%,end
Yes?

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.273 line:85.83%,end
Give me my Ray-Ban.
