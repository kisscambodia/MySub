was really good.

00:30:46.553 --> 00:30:48.847 line:85.83%,end
God, I'm so hungry.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.098 line:85.83%,end
I wish

00:30:50.473 --> 00:30:52.892 line:85.83%,end
I could have a bite
of that Southern fried chicken

00:30:52.976 --> 00:30:54.227 line:85.83%,end
before I leave.

00:30:55.478 --> 00:30:56.563 line:85.83%,end
Cup noodles for me.

00:30:57.522 --> 00:30:58.815 line:85.83%,end
Cup noodles?

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.483 line:85.83%,end
Comrade Joo.

00:31:00.984 --> 00:31:03.069 line:85.83%,end
The thing about Southern fried chicken--

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:44.319 line:85.83%,end
Where are Cheong-ya and Soo-ho?

00:31:46.946 --> 00:31:49.073 line:85.83%,end
Don't tell…

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.495 line:85.83%,end
my mother about my death.

00:32:00.126 --> 00:32:02.337 line:85.83%,end
You should've waited until he answered.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.922 line:85.83%,end
Isn't it obvious?

00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:06.966 line:85.83%,end
They must've split up
to avoid the checkpoints.

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:36.454 line:85.83%,end
What time is it?

00:32:37.246 --> 00:32:38.873 line:85.83%,end
We should watch the news. Wake up.

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:41.417 line:85.83%,end
It's time for the news. Guys, wake up.

00:32:44.003 --> 00:32:47.131 line:85.83%,end
Guys, the news is about to start!

00:32:47.215 --> 00:32:48.383 line:85.83%,end
Hurry up!

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:52.178 line:85.83%,end
<i>Full of indignation about the
opposition party politically exploiting</i>

00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:54.889 line:85.83%,end
<i>the hostage situation,
the national tragedy,</i>

00:32:54.973 --> 00:32:58.434 line:85.83%,end
<i>and putting taking power
before the innocent students' safety,</i>

00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:00.061 line:85.83%,end
<i>I have</i>

00:33:01.354 --> 00:33:04.107 line:85.83%,end
<i>decided to reveal the truth
that was kept to the public</i>

00:33:04.732 --> 00:33:06.693 line:85.83%,end
<i>as Director Eun Chang-su wished.</i>

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:10.905 line:85.83%,end
<i>Director Eun's only daughter Yeong-ro,</i>

00:33:11.447 --> 00:33:14.325 line:85.83%,end
<i>a freshman English Literature major
at Hosu Women's University,</i>

00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:16.911 line:85.83%,end
<i>is being held hostage in the dorm.</i>

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:21.124 line:85.83%,end
<i>Every ANSP agent as well as Director Eun
has been fighting</i>

00:33:21.207 --> 00:33:23.418 line:85.83%,end
<i>against those Northern spies</i>

00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:27.005 line:85.83%,end
<i>as if the hostages were our own children.</i>

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.590 line:85.83%,end
-That crazy…
<i>-So how could it</i>

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:31.926 line:85.83%,end
<i>possibly be an election scheme?</i>

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.097 line:85.83%,end
<i>Respectable citizens,
the ANSP, the military, and the police</i>

00:33:36.597 --> 00:33:42.103 line:85.83%,end
<i>are doing our best to save those innocent
young lives with our sacred duties</i>

00:33:42.478 --> 00:33:43.938 line:85.83%,end
<i>as public servants in mind.</i>

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:52.030 line:85.83%,end
Are you out of your mind?

00:33:52.113 --> 00:33:54.490 line:85.83%,end
Now that people know
Yeong-ro is my daughter,

00:33:54.574 --> 00:33:56.868 line:85.83%,end
I can't get her out first.

00:33:58.077 --> 00:34:00.455 line:85.83%,end
That did occur to me, but…

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:01.914 line:85.83%,end
It's not his fault.

00:34:01.998 --> 00:34:03.416 line:85.83%,end
I told him to do it.

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:05.752 line:85.83%,end
What if Yeong-ro gets killed?

00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:09.255 line:85.83%,end
Enough with Yeong-ro!

00:34:09.338 --> 00:34:12.175 line:85.83%,end
I know that 1 a.m. radio show is
for young people,

00:34:12.258 --> 00:34:13.718 line:85.83%,end
but it aired nationwide.

00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:16.429 line:85.83%,end
Every ANSP office is
getting calls about it!

00:34:17.138 --> 00:34:18.473 line:85.83%,end
If you don't put an end to it,

00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:20.975 line:85.83%,end
what do you think Code 1 will do to you?

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.697 line:85.83%,end
This is Eun Chang-su.

00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:38.785 line:85.83%,end
<i>Now people think
it might be an election scheme.</i>

00:34:41.537 --> 00:34:43.539 line:85.83%,end
What's taking so long?

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:47.502 line:85.83%,end
You must finish cleaning
and empty the trash can.

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:50.671 line:85.83%,end
But, Mr. President.
The suspicion has grown

00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:54.383 line:85.83%,end
that it is an election scheme,
so if we kill all the students,

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:57.178 line:85.83%,end
the opposition party
will make an issue of it

00:34:57.845 --> 00:34:59.430 line:85.83%,end
until the end.

00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:01.641 line:85.83%,end
So I think it's best

00:35:02.183 --> 00:35:04.018 line:85.83%,end
to save the students.

00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:07.396 line:85.83%,end
It'll give us an edge in the election.

00:35:08.523 --> 00:35:10.942 line:85.83%,end
<i>Please reconsider, sir.</i>

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:14.112 line:85.83%,end
The press is running wild and bashing us,

00:35:14.695 --> 00:35:17.281 line:85.83%,end
<i>but you want to release the 33 hostages?</i>

00:35:18.032 --> 00:35:21.327 line:85.83%,end
Are you confident
you can keep their mouths shut?

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.871 line:85.83%,end
Yes, I will make sure

00:35:24.747 --> 00:35:28.376 line:85.83%,end
they keep their mouths shut.

00:35:29.085 --> 00:35:30.545 line:85.83%,end
Trust me, sir.

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:32.880 line:85.83%,end
I'll call you back.

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:42.765 line:85.83%,end
So you're trying to save all the students
to save your daughter, is that it?
