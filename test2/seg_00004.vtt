Hey, open the door! Now!

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:45.786 line:85.83%,end
Open up!

00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:47.329 line:85.83%,end
-Open up!
-You wench!

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:49.831 line:85.83%,end
-Open the door now!
-Han-na.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.792 line:85.83%,end
-Han-na?
-Yes, sir.

RECORDING STUDIO 1

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:05.681 line:85.83%,end
Damn it.

00:21:07.015 --> 00:21:08.058 line:85.83%,end
Han-na.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:09.851 line:85.83%,end
You're scaring me.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.834 line:85.83%,end
Let go of me, you bastards!

00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:35.669 line:85.83%,end
What are you doing? Let go of me!

00:21:35.752 --> 00:21:37.129 line:85.83%,end
-Let go of me!
-Stay still!

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:44.636 line:85.83%,end
Are you out of your mind, Gyeong-hui?
You can't do this!

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.681 line:85.83%,end
You're a public servant, not a gangster!
You can't--

00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:49.433 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Gal!

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:53.312 line:85.83%,end
-Mr. Gal!
-Get him out of here.

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:54.646 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Gal!

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.772 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Gal…

00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:58.191 line:85.83%,end
Sang-sik, you got to press it hard
if you want to live.

00:21:59.026 --> 00:21:59.943 line:85.83%,end
Gun.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.611 line:85.83%,end
Mr. Gal!

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.163 line:85.83%,end
I know your father is
an assemblyman in his third term,

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:14.041 line:85.83%,end
but you've gone too far. Don't you think?

00:22:16.543 --> 00:22:18.211 line:85.83%,end
Jang Han-na!

00:22:22.966 --> 00:22:23.800 line:85.83%,end
My goodness.

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:25.969 line:85.83%,end
Sir, please calm down.

00:22:27.387 --> 00:22:30.223 line:85.83%,end
An… I mean, Mr. An.

00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:32.392 line:85.83%,end
Thank you for calling me.

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:35.437 line:85.83%,end
That bastard Gang-mu is solely responsible

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.522 line:85.83%,end
for all this.

00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:39.149 line:85.83%,end
You know that, right?

00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:41.735 line:85.83%,end
Of course.

00:22:41.818 --> 00:22:43.612 line:85.83%,end
That bastard once pulled

00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:46.615 line:85.83%,end
a knife on you before, right?

00:22:47.741 --> 00:22:49.993 line:85.83%,end
What are you talking about?

00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:51.536 line:85.83%,end
The ANSP exists

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.997 line:85.83%,end
to protect
the security of people in power.

00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:58.460 line:85.83%,end
I know I dug up dirt on someone I hated,
and destroyed him,

00:22:58.543 --> 00:23:01.755 line:85.83%,end
but how dare he rat on Director Park,
my right-hand man?

00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:05.926 line:85.83%,end
I was almost removed
from office because of that bastard!

00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:09.054 line:85.83%,end
Was it…

00:23:10.347 --> 00:23:12.224 line:85.83%,end
Was it because of you, Dad?

00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:19.564 line:85.83%,end
I only joined the ANSP to find out
why he left me all of a sudden.

00:23:20.357 --> 00:23:22.109 line:85.83%,end
But was it because of you, Dad?

00:23:22.609 --> 00:23:26.196 line:85.83%,end
Why did you have to
fall for a good-for-nothing like him?

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:27.531 line:85.83%,end
He was different from you.

00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:30.742 line:85.83%,end
I fell in love with him
because he was so different from you!

00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:33.578 line:85.83%,end
Because he wasn't
a good-for-nothing like you!

00:23:33.662 --> 00:23:35.247 line:85.83%,end
-You little!
-Calm down.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.624 line:85.83%,end
-You!
-Gosh. Whoa, whoa.

00:23:41.128 --> 00:23:42.712 line:85.83%,end
-Please.
-Chief An.

00:23:42.796 --> 00:23:46.007 line:85.83%,end
Take her and beat her to a pulp!

00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:50.053 line:85.83%,end
Kill Lee Gang-mu, that bastard.

00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:53.598 line:85.83%,end
And make sure what she said
won't be in the news.

00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:58.478 line:85.83%,end
As you wish, sir. Leave it to me.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.608 line:85.83%,end
-Take her.
-Yes, sir.

00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:06.987 line:85.83%,end
Try to kill Gang-mu, and I'll kill you!

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.738 line:85.83%,end
Remember that! Okay?

00:24:08.822 --> 00:24:10.949 line:85.83%,end
God damn it! Let go of me!

00:24:11.032 --> 00:24:13.493 line:85.83%,end
Let go of me, you bastards! Let go!

00:24:14.077 --> 00:24:16.121 line:85.83%,end
Han-na, come on, answer me.

00:24:18.373 --> 00:24:19.499 line:85.83%,end
Jang Han-na?

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.377 line:85.83%,end
Han-na.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.381 line:85.83%,end
You fool.

00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:28.842 line:85.83%,end
You shouldn't have been so reckless.

00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:46.776 line:85.83%,end
Yes.

00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:49.529 line:85.83%,end
Your sister and I

00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:53.074 line:85.83%,end
used to be best friends.

00:24:54.701 --> 00:24:56.411 line:85.83%,end
Then I found out

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:03.168 line:85.83%,end
Yeon-ok was pregnant with the baby
of my fiancé that I loved so much.

00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:08.924 line:85.83%,end
But I couldn't do anything.

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:14.346 line:85.83%,end
I couldn't stand it, so I came back to
Korea in the middle of writing my thesis.

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:18.016 line:85.83%,end
And three days later,

00:25:18.558 --> 00:25:21.186 line:85.83%,end
I was dragged to the ANSP
without knowing why.

00:25:25.106 --> 00:25:27.442 line:85.83%,end
NAME: PI SEUNG-HUI
I…

00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:40.539 line:85.83%,end
<i>I didn't know back then</i>
