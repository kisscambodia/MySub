(Final Episode)

2
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:20,049
We did it.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,590
I'm glad.

4
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,599
- Hello?
- Did it go well?

5
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:40,870
Secretary Ju.
We're done with the exorcism.

6
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,679
We did it.

7
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,419
- Thank you.
- All right.

8
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,389
Great work. Great work, really.

Ji A. Ji A?

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,470
I told you to look forward...

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,799
to the kind of interesting things
that will happen...

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,939
once you turn me into your enemy.

17
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:23,019
Did you think you could do
a number on me...

18
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,450
and get away with it? Did you?

19
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,930
You scumbag.

20
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,769
How dare you?

21
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:59,849
- Hey!
- You scumbag!

22
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,850
Darn it.

23
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,290
Ji A!

24
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:07,290
Oh, no!

25

In Bum!

26
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:21,009
- Hey, I'm going to pee.
- Where are you going?

27
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,310
- Okay.
- Gosh.

28
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,149
You scumbag.

29
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,419
Wait. Hey.

30
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,250
You should apologize for hitting me.

31
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,190
Let me go, you punk!

32
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:41,130
- Are you okay?
- What's your problem?

33
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,100
- Get him.
- Wait.

34
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:48,940
Let go!

35
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,540
Hey. He hit me!

36
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:54,208
- Hey!
- Get him!

37
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,679
- Hey! Come here!
- Get him!

38
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,810
Let go!

39
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,589
Are you looking down on us
for being poor?

40
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,419
Let go, you scumbag!

41
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:44,889
Ms. Hong! What do I do?
In Bum's still inside!

42
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:46,988
- See you at the hospital.
- Okay!

43
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,560
Hurry up! Hurry!

44
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,579
In Bum!

45
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,220
Please save him!

46
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,220
Please save him!

47
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,459
Please prepare an OR
for immediate surgery.

48
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:21,959
Thank you.

49
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,240
Don't die.

50
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:37,709
Don't die.

51
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:43,219
- Sir, are you awake?
- In Bum.

52
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,979
Are you okay?

53
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:48,089
What?

54
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,588
- What?
- What's going on?

55
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:52,990
What's going on?

Mom.

59
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,349
Are you finally awake?

60
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,959
Had he stabbed 1cm deeper,
it could've been life-threatening.

61
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,630
How's In Bum doing?

62
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,709
Don't tell me he's still unconscious.

63
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,250
According to the ambulance driver,

64
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,180
the car suddenly malfunctioned,

65
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,849
and they crashed.

66
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:01,649
When he had regained consciousness,
In Bum had disappeared.

67
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,319
Did you say Do Hak Sung died
at the scene?

68
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,360
Correct.

69
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:09,399
His body was found in an underpass
near Sky Building.

70
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,098
We believe he fell down the stairs.

71
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,529
It was a freak accident,

72
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,670
but I think karma got to him.

73
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,209
I think his unrested spirit entered
In Bum.

74
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,839
But In Bum was wearing his necklace.

75
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,750
It broke during the exorcism.

76
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,619
I've analyzed all CCTV...

77
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,360
in a 20km radius from the car accident.

78
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,070
Electronic devices malfunction
when a ghost appears.

79
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:23,398
So I connected all CCTV cameras
that temporarily disconnected...

80
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,500
for no apparent reason.

81
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,879
I think he's headed to our realty.

82
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,979
You're right.

83
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,550
Do Hak Sung wants to kill me.

84
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:37,019
He failed to do so the day he died.

85
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,650
This is infuriating.

86
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,359
How dare he turn
into an unrested spirit...

87
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:46,589
after all the evil deeds he had committed?

88
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,359
First,

89
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,759
let's ask the police for help.

90
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,128
He's an evil spirit who's out to get you.

91
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:55,199
We don't know what he's capable of.

92
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,738
No, not the police.

93
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:59,868
What if the unrested spirit
gets caught red-handed?

94
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:01,838
Then In Bum will go to prison.

95
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,109
That won't happen.

96
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,739
Don't worry.

00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,910
It's not too late to back out.

100

You can't hold your own
when you haven't fully recovered.

101
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,589
First, let's leave this up
to the police.

102
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:51,159
After that, we'll think
about how to save In Bum.

103
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,889
I'll get help from everyone I know.

104
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,829
I made a promise to him
during our first exorcism.

105
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,299
You'll never wake up
with bloody hands again.

106
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,640
I won't let that happen.

107
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,180
I must keep my promise.

108
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:05,129
Where is he?

109
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,530
He's almost there.

110
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,670
Okay.

111
00:11:33,229 --> 00:11:35,229
I think he'll arrive at the realty
in five minutes.

112
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:38,129
Okay. You should get out of there first.

113
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,099
Okay. I got it.

115
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,779
Why are you walking on the road?

116
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,849
Have you gone mad? Are you crazy?

117
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,589

When I was possessed
by Do Hak Sung's spirit,

141
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,729
I tried to kill you.

142
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,029

Pardon?

147
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:14,409
Even when you were possessed,
your will...

148
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,809
dominated the evil spirit.

149
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:18,249
So I was able to finish the ritual.

- Did you have lunch?
- Yes. I just did.

155
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,919
I heard that there's a great
makguksu restaurant nearby.

156

That sounds delicious, right?

158
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,319
By the way,
how did you hurt your hand?

159
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,489
It looks like it got burned.

160
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,728
What happened?

161
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,559
The side effect of sealing the spirit.

Sealing the spirit?

163
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:11,469
The method you were going to use
on the egg ghost?

164
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,110
I didn't want Do Hak Sung
to dissipate without any pain.

165
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:20,479
He'll feel burning pain
all over his body for eternity.

166
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:26,080
That's a glorious injury, then.

She'll be discharged in a week.

Goodness,
it must be a lot of work for you.

171
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,549
It's not bad.

172
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,830
- Ji Chul.
- Yes?

174
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:49,830
What? For what?

175
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,569
I heard you hurt your arm...

176
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:53,640
because of me.

177
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,308
No, I slipped in the bathroom.

178
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,239
Ms. Ju told me.

179
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:02,248
She said you stopped me
from hurting other people...

180
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:03,450
while I was possessed.

181
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,019
Come on, Ms. Ju.

182
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,390
I knew you'd feel bad,
so I asked her not to tell you.

183
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,259
- Ji Chul.
- Yes?

184
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,759
Did I ever tell you that I love you?

185
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,630
All of a sudden? You're scaring me.

186

00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,069
I should say thanks when I'm grateful...

188
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,940
and say sorry when I feel bad.

189
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,469
And if I love someone,
I need to tell them that I do.

190
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,480
That's how we won't turn
into unrested spirits.

191
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:32,809
Ji Chul.

192
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:35,610
Thank you, and I love you. Lots.

193
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:37,719
My gosh!

194
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:40,288
Hey, I just got goosebumps.
Look. Look at this.

195
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:42,890
You really startled me. My gosh.

196
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,819
- Man.
- My gosh.

197
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,130
Hey, I'm feeling great. Take these.

198
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,829
Aren't these from Soo Jung?

199
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,568
No, I bought those.

200
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:55,609
I wouldn't give you something
my sweetheart gave me.

201
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,079
You bought a lot of these.

202
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,419
Ever since I got these as gifts,
I've only been wearing these.

203
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,690
- I can't wear anything else now.
- Really?

204
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,988
It's a lot of work to travel
back and forth from the hospital,

205
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:21,430
so you can make use of those.

206
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,360
I got a lot, so don't worry.

207
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,100
- Thanks.
- Me too.

208
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,499
Thank you, and I love you.

209
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,299
Lots.

210
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:42,410
Don't you feel like the time is flying?

211
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,279
It was freezing when we first met,

212
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,319
but it's summer now.

213
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:00,370
What's on your mind?

214
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:02,999
Once I get discharged tomorrow,

215
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,640
I'd like to give another shot
at letting my mom go.

216
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:10,809
Will you help me?

217
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,140
Of course.

218
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,749
It won't be easy...

219
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,979
because I hurt her.

220
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:32,299
She hasn't shown herself since that day.

221
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:36,700
She must be furious at me.

222
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,900
I don't think she's furious.

223
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,370
She must be heartbroken.

224
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:45,739
I'm sure she knows how you feel.

225
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,650
She's your mom.

226
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,819
What's wrong?

227
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,690
Is there...

228
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,130
an unrested spirit around here?

229
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,289
No. No, I don't know.

230
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,930
I don't see anything.

231
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:52,779
Is something going on?

232
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,818
You're back!

233
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:04,559
Congratulations on your...

234
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,459
Did something happen to her?

235
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,600
Let her be alone for a moment.

236
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,769
Then, no one has to sacrifice their lives.

237
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,539
The exorcist will experience
a side effect.

238
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,540
That's why we don't usually seal spirits.

239
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,479
What do I do now?

240
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,719
What do I do now, Mom?

241
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,690
I have to send you away.

242
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:54,630
She was...

243
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,569
just getting better
physically and emotionally.

244
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,769
What if she breaks down like last time?

245
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,769
I'm worried.

246
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:05,910
I'm sure she'll overcome this.

247
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:07,739
Ji A is...

248
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,450
much stronger
than you think she is, Hwa Jeong.

249
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,920
How is she?

250
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,828
Let's give her some time.
I'm sure she's sorting things out.

251
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:03,470
Gosh, how can this happen?

252
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,839
I can't believe
her exorcism powers are lost.

253
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,809
Gosh! Do Hak Sung,
that disgusting scumbag.

254
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,008
Not only was he a problem
when alive or dead,

255
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:13,809
but he's also a problem
after being exorcized.

256
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,950
What? Wait a minute. Hey.

257
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,980
You still have your psychic skills.

258
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,789
Can't you let yourself
get possessed by her...

259
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,619
and then get stabbed?

260
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,689
Wouldn't that help her mother find peace?

261
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,230
If someone who has
no exorcism powers stabs a psychic,

262
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:31,759
the psychic will die.

263
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,289
Are you going somewhere?

264
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:02,259
Let's go eat.

265
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,529
This looks delicious.

266
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,450
Eat up.

267
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:40,430
It's my fault for thinking lightly
about the side effect...

268
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,400
of sealing a spirit.

269
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,440
But I don't regret it.

270
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,869
Do Hak Sung deserved a cruel punishment.

271
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,839
Even if I could turn back time,

272
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:56,079
I'd make the same decision.

273
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,549
You're right.

274
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,619
And come to think of it,

275
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,990
no one has ever said
that the side effect was permanent.

276
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,459
Does that mean you'll regain
your power?

277
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,529
There's no guarantee.

278
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,430
But I can't just sit back and wait.

279
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,729
I'm going to look for a way.

280
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,670
We'll do the same.

281
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:28,279
What is this?

282
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,380
Gosh, that's hot!

283
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:36,788
This is something martial artists do.

284
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,088
It's called the Iron Palm.

285
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,788
It's something they do
when they lack strength.

286
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:43,059
I've replaced the sand with salt.

287
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,900
You want me to put my hand in this?

288
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,569
- Have you gone insane?
- Give it a try.

289
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,869
Who knows?

290
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,440
She didn't buy it.

291
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:05,380
Strengthening your vigor could solve it.

292
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,829
This proves
that your vigor isn't the problem.

293
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,000
I'll be counting down from ten.

294
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,940
And you...

295
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:29,539
will time travel to the past.

296
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,339
Go back...

297
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,279
and retrieve your power.

298
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,410
Ten,

299
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:41,619
nine... Go back to the past.

300
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:45,420
- Eight...
- There's a tunnel.

301
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,829
On the other side
of the tunnel is...

302
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:53,359
a big flower bed.

303
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,499
It's pretty.

304
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,500
I didn't know there was a flower bed
in his heart.

305
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,039
How fragrant.

306
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:13,380
Are you okay?

307
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:15,349
What do you mean?

308
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,150
You seem to be straining yourself.

309
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,690
When I was young,

310
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,960
I'd pray every single day...

311
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,599
that I'd stop seeing unrested spirits.

312
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,000
I didn't want my exorcism power.

313
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,570
I wanted to get rid of it.

314
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,109
I hated myself for being different
from others.

315
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,079
I wanted to be normal.

316
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,949
But now that I've lost it all,

317
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:54,719
I think I'm nothing without it.

318
00:34:57,989 --> 00:34:59,199
Ms. Hong.

319
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,400
Don't worry.

320
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,139
I won't blame myself
or be depressed anymore.

321
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,809
I haven't found a way yet.

322
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:16,078
But I will retrieve my power...

323
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,679
and help my mom find peace.

324
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,719
I know you will.

325
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,130
Goodness. You brought so much.

326
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:43,710
We left in such a hurry...

327
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,879
and couldn't even say our goodbyes.

328
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,139
I couldn't thank you either.

329
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:51,010
You did that day.

330
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:52,880
Did I?

331
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,320
Thanks to you,

332
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:59,919
I was able to feed my boy one last time.

333
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,730
That had always been something
I regretted.

334
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:09,269
I'm truly grateful.

335
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,130
Chang Hwa.

336
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,739
I'm sorry.

337
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,440
This is the last meal I'm making for you.

338
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,280
I hope you enjoy it...

339
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,409
and find peace.

340
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:55,079
- Ms. Ju.
- Yes?

341
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,449
I think I can help my mom find peace.

342
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,989
Did you get your power back?

343
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:10,690
No. I'm going to perform
the exorcism without the stick...

344
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,659
like I did with Chang Hwa.

345
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,929
The moment she let go
of her obsession over her son,

346
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,269
the unrested spirit left on its own.

347
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:23,369
Are you saying her obsession
hindered his spirit from leaving?

348
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:28,110
I hindered my mom from leaving as well.

349
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,579
My reluctance to let her go,

350
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,650
my resentment toward her
for leaving me behind,

351
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,420
and my guilt for killing her.

352
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:41,460
It wasn't your fault.

353
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:43,360
I know.

354
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,400
Nevertheless,

355
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,199
I couldn't let go
of the reluctance and resentment.

356
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,809
After exorcizing the egg ghost,

357
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:01,010
I finally understood
why my mom made that decision.

358
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,610
Although I can't agree
with her decision,

359
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,190
I can now at least understand her.

360
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:17,360
That's why I think
I can finally let her go.

361
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,130
It took too long.

362
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,429
That's natural.

363
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,170
Letting go of a beloved...

364
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,539
is always painful.

365
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,860
(Chinese Character Dictionary)

366
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:54,699

I'm trying to find a way
to retrieve your power,

368
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,939
but your ancestors aren't helpful.

369
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,540
Why is everything in Chinese characters?

370
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:07,510
There are too many characters
that aren't even in the dictionary.

I'm sorry, Mom.

387
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:35,349
I made you stay here.

388
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:40,289
I made you suffer in cold...

389
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:44,389
and stopped you from leaving me.

I'm sorry, Mom.

391
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,730
No. I was so happy...

392

that I got to see you grow up.

for growing up into a fine lady
without me.

go now.

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,630
Can you tell that boy that I'm sorry?

399
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,269
He had done nothing wrong,

400
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:29,099
but I almost took away his life.

401
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:33,479

402
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,909

403
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:39,110

you won't be here now.

You have so many people who love
and cherish you by your side.

417

You were a much better exorcist
than me 20 years ago.

And you still are.

419

450
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,929
you've never been here...

451

ever since your mother passed.

452
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,468
I knew her spirit wasn't here.

453
00:51:50,469 --> 00:51:51,940
I had no reason to come.

It's your first time
at your mother's resting place,

455

Why would I come here?

That's how ordinary people live.

462

Not because they believe
their spirits actually rest here,

463
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:38,250
but because they can be comforted
when they miss them so much...

464

- I'm not.

and In Bum become so close?

00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:33,300
Did you say goodbye to him?

if you leave without a word.

- No.

I've been meaning to ask.

512
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,670
Have you been dating Mr. Jung?

513

- No?
- No.

514

You should start going on dates.
It doesn't have to be him.

515

but I've enjoyed
a fair share of personal time.

a devastating sacrifice,

520

to start preventing wrinkles.

As per your request, I've deleted...

all of your daughter's traces
on the Internet.

as well as records

related to your daughter,

563

please give me a call.

until everything is gone.

Tomorrow?

574

Of course, I'm free.

It's okay. It's not far.

Okay, but let me go.

589
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,178
Someone as old as you
shouldn't be carrying heavy things.

590
01:00:57,179 --> 01:00:58,320
I'll go.

591
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,518
I'll be back. Enjoy your food.

592

such a reliable son.

What?

595
01:01:08,059 --> 01:01:09,860
He's not reliable at all.

596

He's still a kid.

603
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:35,159
Because I'll be needing
your help often in the future.

604
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:37,319
Excuse me.

01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,388
Please give us your raw tuna special
and sprinkle some gold dust on top.

- I just need kimchi.

malfunctioned for no reason...

repetitive power failures?

in your building recently...

631
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:44,980
or has a murder taken place there?

632

I've secured the area,

633
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,988
