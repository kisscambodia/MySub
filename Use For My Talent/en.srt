1
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,825
WATCHER: Time.

2
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:47,881
Space.

3
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,543
Reality.

4
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,541
It's more than a linear path.

5
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:04,543
It's a prism of endless possibility,

6
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:10,626
where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,

7
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,206
creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,750
I am the Watcher.

9
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,670
I am your guide
through these vast new realities.

10
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,961
Follow me and ponder the question...

11
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,165
"What if?"

12
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,375
There was an idea
to bring together a group of--

13
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,498
ROMANOFF: Remarkable people?

14
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,503
To see if they could
become something more?

15
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,043
I know. I've heard the speech.

16
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,575
Then you realize what's at stake.

17
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,706
Which is why I'm surprised you'd wanna bet

18
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,831
the future
of the Avengers Initiative on that.

19
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,921
Stark may be eccentric,
but he's got potential.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,420
What he's got is a hangover.

21
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,920
Did I ever tell you about this one time

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,170
I actually recruited a Russian assassin
to join my American covert ops team?

23
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,540
Vaguely rings a bell.

24
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,325
Then you should know,
I'm not afraid of a big swing.

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,580
Sir, I'm going
to have to ask you to exit the donut.

26
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,376
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boyband.

27
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:31,288
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

28
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,915
-How's that working out for you?
-I've been worse.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,380
You've become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

30
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:41,208
Contrary to your belief,
you are not the center of my universe.

31
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,081
-STARK: I get it.
-Hit him.

32
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,626
God. What'd she just do to me?

33
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,828
What did we just do for you?

34
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,626
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

35
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:53,958
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms?

36
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,421
Stark! You okay?

37
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,826
-FURY: Stark!
-ROMANOFF: Tony. Tony!

38
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,960
He's dead.

39
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,420
WATCHER: Humanity, so eager,
so willing to face the impossible,

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,830
yet blind to the bigger picture.

41
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:19,246
Inside one week, three strange
and separate stories unfolded.

42
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:23,543
A genius battled
his demons both inside and out,

43
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,043
while the world
met the monster hiding in the man.

44
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,043
And a godly prince fell to Earth.

45
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,626
I am the Watcher.

46
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,628
And where humans see chaos,

47
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,038
I see the crucible that would transform

48
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,995
this collection of individuals
into a team of heroes.

49
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,325
At least, that's how things
played out in one universe.

50
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,535
But in this one...

51
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,206
Sir, we found it.

52
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,501
Kind of in the middle
of something here, Coulson.

53
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,963
COULSON: Not sure it can wait, sir.
Locals are getting curious.

54
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,501
Set up a perimeter
and tell the team I'm en route.

55
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,706
I may not have been a fan of Tony Stark,
but I didn't kill him.

56
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,331
Save your spin for Pierce.

57
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,916
He wants you in New York
first thing for questioning.

58
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,630
Wanna give us a minute?

59
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,326
This wasn't me.

60
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,286
I know that,
but S.H.I.E.L.D. has protocols,

61
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,785
so my hands, like yours, are tied.

62
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,705
-You know these won't hold me.
-Oh, I'm counting on it.

63
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,961
Someone inside S.H.I.E.L.D.
compromised Stark's antidote.

64
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,081
I need someone on the outside
to find out who.

65
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,326
Sure you wanna take
another big swing on me, boss?

66
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,126
Safest bet I'll ever make.

67
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,326
Wow. So serious.

68
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,633
Maybe we should get some tunes going.

69
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,705
Lighten the mood.

70
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,626
You guys are no fun.
Here. Mind holding these for me?

71
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,168
Of course. Uh... What?

72
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,881
I never did get what he sees in her.

73
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:23,288
Sure, she can land a punch,
but only 'cause people don't expect it.

74
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,290
What? Stop! Stop the truck!

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,290
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

76
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,826
Oh! Come on!

77
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:59,076
BARTON: Best we can tell, it's extremely
powerful and not from around here.

78
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:03,126
Electromagnetic, neutron,
vita radiations, all off the charts.

79
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,458
-

80
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,038
Well, that doesn't sound ominous at all.

81
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,915
It's been happening all night.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,040
The artifact has a bit of an attitude.

83
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,125
Also, no one can lift it.

84
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,288
Not even Jackson and he does CrossFit.

85
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:23,285
Something that powerful goes missing,
someone always comes looking.

86
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,383
We just have to cross our fingers
that someone is an ally.

87
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,035
So, what's the move?

88
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:42,035
Same as always.
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

89
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,668
We got a man down. Sound the alarms.

90
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,880
-

91
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,878
I think the worst just got here.

92
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,706
FURY: Coulson, talk to me.

93
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,751
We got a perimeter breach.
Multiple agents down and...

94
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,165
Whoa.

95
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,420
I got visual on the intruder.

96
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,498
He's a Caucasian male,
mid-twenties with...

97
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,753
really great hair.

98
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,673
Excuse me?

99
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,830
COULSON: It's an accurate description.
Sir, he's gorgeous.

100
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,826
-I need eyes in the sky. Barton.
-BARTON: Already on it.

101
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,626
He's making a move on the hammer.

102
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,128
One shot, one kill, sir.
Just say the word.

103
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,633
FURY: Hold your fire. I wanna see this.

104
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:36,381
Whoa. Coulson wasn't lying
about the hair. That's nice.

105
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,173
Fury, now or never.

106
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,211
-FURY: Hold your--

107
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,035
Damn it, Barton. I told you to stand down.

108
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,495
I did! Wasn't me! I didn't shoot!

109
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,166
GUARD 2: Drop your weapon!

110
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,960
I swear, I didn't shoot.

111
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,383
Your arrow would indicate otherwise.

112
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,380
This doesn't make any sense.
I don't slip. I don't misfire.

113
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,501
-What's the word on our intruder?
-Dead.

114
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,543
And if his blood samples
are to be believed,

115
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,375
he's almost a thousand years old
and not of this world.

116
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,668
First Stark, now Muscle Beach.

117
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,830
That's two high value S.H.I.E.L.D. targets
killed by our own agents inside 24 hours.

118
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,036
-Barton's sticking to his story?
-He's pretty bent out of shape.

119
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,205
-Won't talk to anyone.
-He'll talk to me.

120
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,916
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

121
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,253
Barton.

122
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,541
Barton. Coulson, get a medic.

123
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,075
How could this... Who did you let in here?

124
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,326
-No one.
-COULSON: No one.

125
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,076
Stay with me. Stay with me.

126
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,745
We're running a tox screen
to see if it was a cyanide capsule.

127
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,333
Barton had a wife and kids.

128
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,706
If he was gonna go,
it wouldn't be willingly.

129
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,961
You think he was murdered.

130
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:07,171
If I had to guess, my money
is on the same someone who killed Stark.

131
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,380
But Barton
was in a locked cell under observation.

132
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,748
There was no sign of struggle,
no entry wounds.

133
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,633
It's weird, but I also have a space corpse

134
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,958
that looks like a Chippendales dancer
rotting on the next table over.

135
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,671
Oh, wow.

136
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,420
Even while rotting,
he smells like lavender.

137
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,291
Mmm.

138
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,915
Still, there's not a lot
connecting a billionaire playboy

139
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,040
and a S.H.I.E.L.D. assassin,
unless you have any ideas.

140
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,128
There was an idea.

141
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,958
Dr. Ross.
Not sure if you remember me, but--

142
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,211
Oh, I remember.

143
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,131
And I'll tell you
the same thing I told you

144
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,538
the last time
S.H.I.E.L.D. came poking around.

145
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,825
I haven't seen him.

146
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,666
I'm not here about the green guy.

147
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,580
His name is Dr. Bruce Banner.
And I'm in a rush, Agent Romanoff.

148
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,376
I'm here about Tony Stark.
I believe he was murdered.

149
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
What? By whom?

150
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:21,253
Me. Or at least someone's trying
to make it look that way, using this.

151
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,626
So, why did you come to me?

152
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,578
You're an expert in the tactical
applications of cellular biology.

153
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:33,036
There are plenty of others.
Why did you really come here?

154
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,920
I need to keep this
off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar

155
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,578
and you seem to have
some experience in that department.

156
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,000
Mmm. Well, your injector's clean

157
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,793
and there's no traces
of lethal pathogens of any kind.

158
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:49,875
Then what killed him?

159
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,788
BETTY: Whatever it was,
it wasn't biological.

160
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,495
Your antidote didn't even
make it out of the syringe.

161
00:10:55,583 --> 00:11:00,003
It looks to me like a tiny projectile
of some kind was fired from the needle.

162
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,003
You're thinking nanotech?

163
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,133
I'm a biologist, not a ballistics expert.

164
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,918
And I believe we're done here.

165
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,538
Huh. You got a side job, Dr. Ross?

166
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,415
What? I don't know. I...

167
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,080
A student must have left it there.

168
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,671
-

169
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,790
FURY: I got bad news and worse news.

170
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,455
-You in a secure location?
-Not currently.

171
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,918
FURY: Barton's dead.

172
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,961
FURY: I know what he meant to you.

173
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,003
Who do I kill?

174
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,286
FURY: Looks like his
and Stark's murders are connected.

175
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,788
-ROMANOFF: By what?
-FURY: The Avengers Initiative.

176
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,455
Seems our killer
is going after the candidates.

177
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,381
ROMANOFF: If someone wanted
to kneecap S.H.I.E.L.D.,

178
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,668
that's a good place to start.

179
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,633
Who else is on the list?

180
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,538
FURY: That's the thing.
Bruce Banner and you.

181
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:06,495
ROMANOFF: Under different circumstances,
I'd be flattered. So would Clint.

182
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:10,253
FURY: You need to get yourself to ground.
But first, find Banner.

183
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,423
Funny thing, boss. Think I already have.

184
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,825
I... I'm sorry,
but I can't let you in there.

185
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,206
Move, or I'll make you move.

186
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,750
No need for violence, Agent Romanoff.

187
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,883
That's probably not gonna work out.
For anyone.

188
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,500
What? What is it?

189
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,080
We need to go. Now.

190
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,541
FURY: What's your 20, Coulson?

191
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,665
Coffee run. Needed a breather.

192
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,460
Got you a double macchiato.
Just how you like it.

193
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,131
What the...

194
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:10,081
Director, sensors are reporting
a massive energy surge.

195
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,576
-Seems like it came out of nowhere.
-What are you seeing, Coulson?

196
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,416
A meteorological phenomenon of some kind.

197
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,245
Oh, boy. Whatever it is,
it came with bogeys.

198
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,923
-They look like they're from Earth?
-COULSON: Maybe Middle-earth?

199
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,080
Go get 'em, boss.

200
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,713
Looking for directions, sir?
Because you seem to have lost your way.

201
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:54,041
You would do best
to kneel before a god.

202
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:58,825
We don't really do that here.
No matter who or what you are.

203
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:03,036
-I am Loki, Crown Prince of Asgard.
-

204
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,535
The rightful king of Jotun--

205
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:10,285
Jotunheim. And God of M--
-

206
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,378
Mischief. Are you gonna take that?
I'm in the middle of something.

207
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,748
Damn it, Fury! Pick up.

208
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:19,423
Hey, I'm telling you, it's safer
for everyone if I fend for myself.

209
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
-I sort of can't die.
-Then I guess you're in luck.

210
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,036
Look alive, people.

211
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,665
I want strike teams locked, loaded,
and ready to move in on my mark.

212
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,956
I'm a little busy here, Widow.

213
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,831
ROMANOFF: Oh, good.
We'll start a support group.

214
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,326
I've got General Ross,
a dozen snipers and a few tanks.

215
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,416
-What are you dealing with?
-FURY: Space Vikings.

216
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,000
-Show-off.
-FURY: Handle it, then get to ground.

217
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,253
-

218
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,383
Lady trouble?

219
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,578
Well, what exactly is it
that brought you here, Mr. Loki?

220
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,996
Vengeance.

221
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:04,423
An agent of this planet murdered
Thor Odinson, the Crown Prince of Asgard.

222
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,290
Natasha Romanoff, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

223
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,995
I have Bruce Banner in my custody.
You need to stand down.

224
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,883
-Hey, hey! Don't shoot!
-Who the hell opened fire?

225
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,128
SOLDIER 3: Not us, sir.

226
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,538
Bruce! It's okay. We're okay, right?

227
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,705
I'll get you out of this.
I swear on my life.

228
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:25,881
Director Fury, you fail to comprehend
the enormity of the situation.

229
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,958
Oh, I'm comprehending, all right.

230
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:34,711
Agent Romanoff, I think you might
be better off getting out of here.

231
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,751
Which is why I have to ask,
what's in the box?

232
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,133
Ooh.

233
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,458
Such insolence will not be tolerated.

234
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,961
And your planet
will be taken as retribution.

235
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,670
-Take it down!
-

236
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,713
Oh, you want some of this? Come on!

237
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,041
Father! No! Stop! Stop, please!

238
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,631
- Stop!

239
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,038
-There's nothing you can do.
-That's my father. He'll listen to me.

240
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,075
The General
isn't the one who started this.

241
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,828
Then who did?

242
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,503
Bruce!

243
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,083
Bruce!

244
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,708
No. No, no, no. Bruce.

245
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:18,131
But he can't die. He can't die.

246
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,171
He can't.

247
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:32,083
Declaring war on this planet
will not bring your prince back!

248
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,286
SIF: Wait.

249
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:37,165
He's not wrong.
The All-Father would want us to listen.

250
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,080
We have the same enemy here.

251
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,206
The person who killed your brother
also killed two of my people.

252
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,291
Good people.
We should be working together.

253
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,495
We are not allies.

254
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,463
Then let me help you.

255
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,081
I promise,
when I find your brother's killer,

256
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,826
you will have your pound of flesh.

257
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,166
What a fascinating choice of words.

258
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,246
But I shall require the entire corpse.

259
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,333
You need to give me time.

260
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,498
Very well.

261
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,753
You have until the next rise of Midgard's
sun to deliver my brother's assassin,

262
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:21,003
or I will reduce
this planet to ash and ice.

263
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,331
Why do you need my password?

264
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,248
I need to get
into the Avengers Initiative files,

265
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:42,043
but I'm locked out of the system
and wanted for murder.

266
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,995
COULSON: I'm not telling you
my password, Romanoff.

267
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,963
-ROMANOFF: Why not?
-COULSON: Because I'm not.

268
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,881
ROMANOFF: Coulson.
Clint was your friend, too.

269
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:56,286
Hashtag-Steve-Steve-Steve-
I-heart-Steve-0-7-0-4.

270
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,415
Wow.

271
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,130
-Good one, Coulson.
-What?

272
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,378
No, nothing. That's great. Thank you.

273
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,376
Huh. How did a woman
who died two years ago

274
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,128
access the database yesterday?

275
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:44,543
You won't win. Not against me.
Not against S.H.I.E.L.D.

276
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,208
FURY: You found me. You know what to do.

277
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,330
Fury, it's Hope! It's all about Hope!

278
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,125
It's Hope! It's all about Hope!

279
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,875
It's Hope! It's all about Hope!

280
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,673
It's Hope! It's all about Hope!

281
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,915
COULSON: Four hours to sunup, sir.

282
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,633
I haven't forgotten.

283
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,248
Sir, I understand that this
Prince Loki situation is the very reason

284
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,293
you proposed the Avengers Initiative

285
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,575
for a group of remarkable individuals
to fight the battles we can't.

286
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,746
I wrote the speech.

287
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,575
There's still one name left, sir.

288
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,206
Yours.

289
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,415
I'm not the only Avenger left.

290
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,130
What?

291
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,078
COULSON: Is that a beeper from the '90s?

292
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,580
Also our last hope.

293
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:30,665
"Hope. It's all about Hope."

294
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,423
Widow.

295
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,791
COULSON: Boss?

296
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,538
-Where are you going?
-Not sure.

297
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,245
Either make a pact
with a god or deal with a devil.

298
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,830
You got a name, soldier?

299
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,331
I'm here to see your boss.

300
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,753
If it isn't Hank Pym.

301
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:43,633
HANK: The balls you have to come here
and stand over her grave.

302
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:44,958
Oh, don't worry about her.

303
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,631
I doubt she'd mind,
considering she's dead.

304
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:51,168
She died because S.H.I.E.L.D. killed her.

305
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,376
She died because of you.

306
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:58,958
Agent Hope Van Dyne was killed
on a mission outside Odessa, Ukraine.

307
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,291
Agent?

308
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,375
She was my daughter! My little girl.

309
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,748
She missed her mother
and you exploited that!

310
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,753
Her mother was an agent?

311
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,583
Don't play the fool with me, Fury.

312
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:17,496
You filled her head with nonsense about
protecting humanity and saving the world.

313
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:21,633
You just left out how she died
the same way her mother did,

314
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,668
doing S.H.I.E.L.D.'s dirty work!

315
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,630
And that gave you
permission to murder them?

316
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:32,998
Anthony Stark? Clint Barton?
Bruce Banner? Natasha Romanoff?

317
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,083
You took everything from me.

318
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,173
I wanted you to hurt.

319
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,825
To witness everything
you've ever worked for...

320
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,423
fought for...

321
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,668
hoped for...

322
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,078
die.

323
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:02,166
And what of Thor, Prince of Asgard?

324
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,830
Goldilocks? You would have
recruited him in a heartbeat.

325
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:09,246
Sold him some malarkey about being a hero.

326
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,713
That's what you do.
What S.H.I.E.L.D. has always done.

327
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,631
Find others to fight your battles.

328
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,418
That's it?
You murdered him because you could?

329
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,130
His death was a favor.
Yours will be a triumph.

330
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,251
What the...

331
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,883
You're still pretty spry
for a guy with a corner office.

332
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,748
You never cared about Hope.

333
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,753
I don't give a damn about any of them.

334
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,333
-

335
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,710
Fury! Come on.

336
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:07,631
You're supposed to be a killer?
Well, come on, then. Kill me.

337
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,825
-Ooh.

338
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,381
HANK: How are you...

339
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:19,038
-Stop moving, Fury.

340
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,125
What are you doing? Let's go--

341
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,878
It's like you're everywhere. Aah!

342
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:53,918
Uh, what's with the goth kid?

343
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,420
Hello. Trickster God. Hi.

344
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,790
S.H.I.E.L.D. is people,

345
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:02,535
people willing to give their lives
for something greater than themselves

346
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:06,455
to save the world from men like you.

347
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,380
Agent Hope Van Dyne understood that
and she will never be forgotten.

348
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:17,458
Then you honor her.

349
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,248
Then honor her.

350
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,378
Well, this was
an absolute pleasure, Director Fury.

351
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,168
Good. Now take your hammer
and get off my planet.

352
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,500
About that,
we should be allies.

353
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,503
You know, I've just had an idea.

354
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,833
I was thinking I might extend
my stay here on Midgard.

355
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,000
For how long?

356
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,745
Good evening, my loyal subjects.

357
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,753
It is with great pride
that I stand before you today

358
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,423
to announce that in just one day's time,

359
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,080
the nations of Earth
have put aside their differences

360
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:08,416
and united under my command.

361
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,420
It's the unspoken truth of humanity
that you crave subjugation.

362
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,000
The bright lure of freedom hobbles you,
diminishes your life's joy.

363
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:20,293
You were made to be ruled.

364
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:27,125
So I have come
to help you fulfill your destiny.

365
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:36,456
The Avengers fell
before they had a chance to rise.

366
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,001
May they rest in peace.

367
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,083
They can, but we won't.

368
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:44,668
The Avengers were always
meant to be more than a team.

369
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,290
They were an idea,

370
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:52,325
the affirmation of humanity's need
to believe that in our darkest hour,

371
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:55,576
we will find our heroes.

372
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:03,671
I believe that in this universe,
as in every other, hope never dies.

373
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:09,833
As long as someone keeps
their good eye on the bigger picture.

374
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,825
Welcome back, Captain.

375
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,535
So where's the fight?
