1
00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:05,953
YOU ARE MY SPRING

2
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:17,657
18 YEARS AGO
AT A BAR

3
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:21,953
-I'm soju!
-I'm a peanut!

4
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,800
All right, red ginseng!

5
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:38,386
-Encore! Red Ginseng!
-Encore! Red Ginseng!

6
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:39,846
-You and you.
-All right, you!

7
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,473
Young-do. Have a drink with us.

8
00:00:42,557 --> 00:00:44,767
Okay, I'll come back later.

9
00:00:44,853 --> 00:00:46,521
-Where are you going?
-I'll be back.

10
00:00:46,602 --> 00:00:48,187
-Have fun.
-You better come back.

11
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:56,112
RESTROOM

12
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:55,713
You.

13
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,632
Stop seeing her.

14
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:25,201
Hey, it's Kang Da-jeong.

15
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:32,083
Hey, it's her.

16
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:43,594
Sociopath.

17
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,077
Gosh. I thought I wouldn't be able
to see you before I left, but I was wrong.

18
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:10,788
I'm glad I waited for you.

19
00:03:22,383 --> 00:03:25,511
You're not avoiding me
because you're embarrassed, are you?

20
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:28,055
Because I caught you
pretending to be busy?

21
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,182
No, I'm not.

22
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:31,309
Then why are your ears red?

23
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:34,520
Because I ate a mailbox on my way here.

24
00:03:34,604 --> 00:03:37,190
God, that's so adorable.

25
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:42,236
Oh, thank you.

26
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:46,032
My feet were swollen
from running around all day,

27
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:49,911
but your cheesy reply just shrank them.

28
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:51,871
I feel like I can go back to work now.

29
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:54,081
Hold on. Your feet are swollen?

30
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,501
Stop looking at my feet.

31
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:00,004
It must've been a long day.

32
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:02,465
Why did you touch my head?

33
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,301
Will you accept this rose?

34
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:08,387
More trash?

35
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:12,058
You said flowers wither,
are prickly, and can't be recycled.

36
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:14,560
So I brought this. It's a paper rose.

37
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:16,520
Here.

38
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:20,149
It won't wither, it's not prickly,

39
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,359
and it's recyclable.

40
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:23,611
You could also jot things down on it.

41
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:39,001
EPISODE 2

42
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:17,206
Maybe I shouldn't fix it after all.

43
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:32,138
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

44
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:03,878
-Hi.
-Hello.

45
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:11,177
Yes! I got the king worm!

46
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,637
Check this out. Hey, look.

47
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:22,229
-Hey.
-What?

48
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:24,732
-Come with me, please?
-I said no.

49
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:27,443
-You just need to drive.
-I don't want to.

50
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:28,986
Fight outside.

51
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,863
If it's urgent, take her.

52
00:06:30,946 --> 00:06:32,073
She's useless.

53
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:35,201
I can hear you. What is it?

54
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:37,787
She drives 80km/h on the highway.
Forget it.

55
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,038
What's wrong with that?

56
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:41,332
You shouldn't have gotten
your license revoked.

57
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:43,793
-I had no accidents for a decade.
-I'm repenting.

58
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,669
Then don't mock my safe driving.

59
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:48,798
I really need to see her today!

60
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:51,133
Then just let me drive you!

61
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:56,972
Who do you need to see?

62
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:01,394
Date of birth.

63
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:04,230
-November 11, 1988.
-Not you.

64
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:12,113
We're here because of him.

65
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,991
-Yes, me.
-No, it's you.

66
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:17,660
Date of birth.

67
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:23,541
-I was born in 1988.
-Born 1988.

68
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:25,793
On March 29.

69
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,545
That's the lunar date.

70
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:34,093
Everyone around you has it easy
and walks on easy paths,

71
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:38,889
but every path you've faced
is uphill, isn't it?

72
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:42,768
You climb with all your might
lest you slip, and when you finally see…

73
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:47,273
Right, a ladder.
When you finally see a ladder,

74
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:49,275
someone drags you down.

75
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:52,736
It could be your parents

76
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:56,157
or a guy you're seeing.

77
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:58,117
It's not that bad.

78
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:00,453
Hey.

79
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,622
What would that make my mom?

80
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:05,583
Endure a bit more pain.

81
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,085
There's more pain?

82
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:10,379
My sweet child.

83
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:14,800
I'm a little too old to be called a child.

84
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:15,926
Listen carefully.

85
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:22,600
There's something glistening
in front of you,

86
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:26,061
and darkness below your feet.

87
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:32,776
And there's a sharp sword in the wind.

88
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:43,537
-I made the appointment,
-She's gifted?

89
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:45,664
-but she didn't care.
-She only talked nonsense.

90
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:47,750
I could've just bought a Magic 8-Ball.

91
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,293
I could've visited Young-do.

92
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:51,462
The ball would've given me
the same answers.

93
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:53,255
Young-do is much more competent.

94
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:56,592
He guessed everything about you right.

95
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,679
Not really.

96
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:02,681
"Not really"?

97
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:05,768
You grabbed him by his collar
because you were surprised.

98
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:09,730
<i>A legless bird, a trash magnet,
a black cat, and a red foxtail.</i>

99
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:12,358
You probably watered them
until their roots rotted.

100
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:16,237
Whether it's dating or growing plants,
you give them every piece of you.

101
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,614
Don't see him.

102
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,202
Competent, my foot.

103
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:26,205
<i>"Year 2003,</i>

104
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,832
Anam-dong, high school student."

105
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,502
What are you looking for?

106
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:35,798
I'm not getting anything.
Should I search all of Seoul?

107
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:38,008
What are you looking for?

108
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,720
I saw something eighteen years ago.

109
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:43,138
And it's bothering me.

110
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:46,850
But why now?

111
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:49,061
Goodness.

112
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:51,480
You're eagerly looking for a case

113
00:09:51,564 --> 00:09:53,941
that hasn't even been known.

114
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:55,484
What a proactive investigation.

115
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:57,987
-You're a real detective now.
-Hey.

116
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,780
Don't do that. Don't.

117
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,660
<i>This is the final round.</i>

118
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:06,328
Ahn Ga-yeong or Jeon Ji-hyun?

119
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:09,081
This is hard. Who should I pick?

120
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:11,625
Ahn Ga-yeong is my type, but…

121
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,425
She has a bad reputation.
Jeon Ji-hyun is perfect,

122
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:20,718
but she likes hiking.

123
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:24,013
I prefer the beach to the mountains.

124
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:26,265
Okay. I'm sorry.

125
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:28,058
Okay.

126
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:32,938
You think I'm your slave, you asshole?
How dare you swear at me?

127
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:34,690
My manager will hear about this.

128
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:37,151
He's going to kick your ass,
you fucking moron.

129
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:38,819
Excuse me.

130
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:46,035
I can swear at the customers
after they've hung up, right?

131
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:47,786
It's not right.

132
00:10:49,872 --> 00:10:50,789
Welcome…

133
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,794
A-ri, I'm taking out the trash.
Can you cover for me?

134
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:57,463
Okay.

135
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:58,756
No, let me.

136
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:05,387
What would you like to order?

137
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,182
There's no tiramisu, baby.

138
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:11,310
You're right. Do you have any?

139
00:11:11,393 --> 00:11:13,103
-Not yet.
-Do you know when you will?

140
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:14,396
-No.
-Can you check?

141
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:17,733
Hold on.

142
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:20,861
-Have a bite of this cheesecake.
-No.

143
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:22,279
Why not?

144
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:25,532
Hello, sir.
When will you deliver the tiramisu?

145
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:27,076
You told me not to order any.

146
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,744
I understand, sir.

147
00:11:28,827 --> 00:11:31,955
Why are you using honorifics?
Who are you talking to?

148
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,208
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

149
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,250
What?

150
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:37,169
Hello?

151
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:39,755
Eun-ha.

152
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,799
I'm afraid they won't be delivering any.

153
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:43,884
Not tomorrow. Not the day after tomorrow.

154
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,094
No tiramisu.

155
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:47,221
Forever, never, ever.
We won't be getting any.

156
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:51,725
-But I came here for that.
-What should we do?

157
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:53,143
How about carrot cake?

158
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:55,979
I hate carrots. Give them to the rabbits.

159
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,940
Okay, the rabbits can have them.

160
00:11:58,023 --> 00:11:59,691
Bad carrot cake. Go away.

161
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:03,487
I'm feeling down.
Should I have a macchiato?

162
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,822
What if I gain weight?

163
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:06,407
We can go run after this.

164
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,826
I hate running. Leave that to the horses.

165
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:10,619
Okay. Run, horses!

166
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,538
Welcome.

167
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:21,964
Da-jeong won't be getting off work
anytime soon.

168
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:25,509
I purposely came early.

169
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:28,470
I don't want her to think I'm a stalker
for real.

170
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:33,350
We allowed you to film at our hotel
despite the inconvenience

171
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,602
because we wanted
to promote something as well.

172
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,188
And it's all written here.

173
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:41,233
"List of things that can't be replaced.
Number three, amenities."

174
00:12:41,316 --> 00:12:44,403
That's why we're asking you
for permission like this.

175
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:48,907
The writer hates product placements,
so we barely added in that condition.

176
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:51,034
-Hello.
-Could you please help us out?

177
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:53,412
I empathize with you

178
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:55,456
-as a fellow laborer.
-Hello.

179
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:58,083
But that item is being used by our…

180
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:00,377
competition.

181
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:03,464
Hello.

182
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:06,467
Let's make this quick.

183
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,427
I didn't get much sleep last night,

184
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,889
so my eyebags will get worse and worse.
It won't be easy to touch it up.

185
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:15,642
Why don't you just add a scene of me
washing my hands tomorrow?

186
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:19,062
"It's fragrant and moisturizing."
I'll improvise a line.

187
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,648
-But the writer said--
-Let me talk to them.

188
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:23,567
Here.

189
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:35,454
Good luck.

190
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:39,124
Oh. Thanks.

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,587
Hello? Hi, have you eaten yet?

192
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:48,050
You had <i>jjamppong</i>? God, I love it too.

193
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,678
What did you have for lunch?

194
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:54,139
Donuts.

195
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,402
I also wanted to drink some water,

196
00:14:08,403 --> 00:14:10,364
but my mom didn't let me.

197
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,243
See? She keeps telling
absurd lies like this, doctor.

198
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:16,370
When did I not let you drink water?

199
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:19,456
And what donut?
You're not eating anything lately.

200
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,583
Why?

201
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:25,420
-Well…
-The doctor

202
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,590
told me not to eat.

203
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:31,009
That's ridiculous.

204
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:36,014
She decided to go on a diet on her own.
That's why.

205
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,103
She keeps telling ridiculous lies.
This is a mental illness, right?

206
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:44,815
Have you been dieting for a while?

207
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:46,441
Sorry?

208
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:49,152
Stop playing innocent.

209
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:53,073
She's always on a diet

210
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:54,658
but secretly eats.

211
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:56,869
I see.

212
00:14:57,744 --> 00:15:02,624
Brain damage due to lack of nutrition
could lead to short-term memory loss.

213
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,836
It's called Korsakoff's syndrome.

214
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:07,838
Since she can't remember,

215
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:10,424
she makes up replies
with things around her.

216
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:12,885
Such an illness really exists?

217
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,479
Do you remember the color
of the taxi you rode today?

218
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:27,316
-Purple.
-I see.

219
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:31,361
-What about yesterday's taxi?
-Sky blue.

220
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:36,742
It's neither a mental illness nor lying.

221
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,202
Have a well-balanced diet

222
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:42,122
and plenty of vitamin B.

223
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:48,128
I asked to have a word with you

224
00:15:48,962 --> 00:15:51,131
because you seem to lack trust in her.

225
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:56,011
We've spent a hefty amount of money
on diet pills.

226
00:15:57,137 --> 00:16:00,223
But to no avail.
She always eats behind my back.

227
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:04,811
At times, she eats five packs
of <i>ramyeon</i> at once.

228
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:10,734
No one trusts her. Not even herself.

229
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:13,195
But she's desperate to lose weight.

230
00:16:14,237 --> 00:16:17,491
What do you think is the easiest way
to relieve her stress?

231
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:18,700
Eating.

232
00:16:19,868 --> 00:16:22,663
If someone tells you
that you'll trip for sure

233
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:24,706
and watches intently from the side,

234
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,625
you'll stiffen trying not to trip.

235
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:31,129
And it'll only make you trip more easily
and get injured more severely.

236
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:35,926
I know you're frustrated,

237
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:38,720
but stop pointing out her mistakes.

238
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:40,681
Support her.

239
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:04,473
PSYCHIATRIST JU YOUNG-DO

240
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:14,399
What happened to the pot I gave you?

241
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,801
See? It's over there.

242
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,930
Exactly. Why is it over there?

243
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:07,244
Hurry up.
I have to see a patient in ten minutes.

244
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:08,662
Don't you worry.

245
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:10,789
A suicidal person
will still remain suicidal,

246
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:13,416
and a lunatic will still be crazy
even if you're late.

247
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:15,544
This is more urgent.

248
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:18,255
Go consult your psychiatrist, not me.

249
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:21,049
Since I know you well already,

250
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,426
I won't listen to what you say as it is

251
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,637
and will nag you about the most trivial--

252
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,097
There's someone I like.

253
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:33,728
Okay.

254
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:36,314
Can you not make it obvious
that you're happy?

255
00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:40,235
If it doesn't work out, I may whine again
about feeling suicidal.

256
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:49,703
He fell head over heels for me,
but it makes no sense.

257
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:52,998
He's an idol singer.
He's so young and popular. He's crazy.

258
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:57,460
I don't know many idol groups.

259
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,297
BTS, EXO, K Men.

260
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,798
-That's all--
-It's K Men.

261
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:05,719
I only know one member.

262
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:08,221
-Patrick? The most popular--
-It's him.

263
00:20:10,724 --> 00:20:12,893
But you're just as popular.

264
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:14,519
-The age gap isn't--
-Nine years.

265
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:16,062
It's not even a decade.

266
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:19,274
I actually subtracted one year
because I was embarrassed.

267
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:23,320
Well, in any case, he's an adult.

268
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:25,655
-He must've finished military--
-Not yet.

269
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:26,907
Oh, dear.

270
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:29,159
Should I not go for him?

271
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:32,579
Why not? Because of what I just said?

272
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:34,286
Excuse me. Hello?

273
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:36,416
Don't you know me? Have you forgotten?

274
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:38,710
I'm like a ticking time bomb.

275
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:41,922
If he finds out what I'm like,
he'll run for his life.

276
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:43,340
He'll push me away.

277
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:45,508
I'll be too old and frail to get back up.

278
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,761
I'll stay on the ground
for a very long time.

279
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:52,140
It's ridiculous
that I still want to pursue this.

280
00:20:52,224 --> 00:20:53,350
I must be crazy.

281
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:57,437
It's been well over a decade
since you truly liked someone, right?

282
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,521
Hello?

283
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:02,734
We got married six years ago,
and I actually liked you.

284
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:04,861
And you married me because I was suicidal.

285
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:07,322
That's not true.

286
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:09,074
I see.

287
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:10,951
Is that why we slept in separate rooms?

288
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:13,328
Is that why whenever I came to you
feeling horny,

289
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:15,997
you'd flee to the study and lock the door?

290
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,961
I don't think you're intimidated
by the fact

291
00:21:21,836 --> 00:21:23,838
that he's young and famous.

292
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:27,175
You're just looking for reasons

293
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:29,844
not to fall in love
since you're scared of getting hurt.

294
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:35,141
Is that why
you're not dating anyone either?

295
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:37,227
Because you're afraid?

296
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:56,788
Hello.

297
00:21:58,415 --> 00:21:59,374
Please sit down.

298
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,836
<i>The biggest fear you feel
when you fall in water</i>

299
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,381
<i>is not that you can't swim</i>

300
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:10,218
<i>but that you don't know
how deep the water is.</i>

301
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:15,015
<i>So the fear grows for those who have never</i>

302
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:18,101
<i>sunk deep into the water.</i>

303
00:22:19,644 --> 00:22:21,021
<i>The same goes for rivers,</i>

304
00:22:22,313 --> 00:22:23,398
<i>seas,</i>

305
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:25,900
<i>and love.</i>

306
00:22:36,745 --> 00:22:37,746
Okay.

307
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,043
Okay.

308
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:52,093
<i>This time, Mr. Hong bought me rice cakes.</i>

309
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:54,637
Now I'm craving some.

310
00:22:56,389 --> 00:22:58,141
But why rice cakes?

311
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,727
Does he want to get all sticky with me?

312
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:05,065
I don't want to talk with someone
who has her mind in the gutter.

313
00:23:05,148 --> 00:23:08,109
What do you mean?
I'm just talking about rice cakes.

314
00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:09,903
<i>Your mind is in the gutter.</i>

315
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,113
Fine.

316
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:16,367
Rice cakes.

317
00:23:17,285 --> 00:23:19,370
Bean rice cakes.

318
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:25,502
Mom, please. Someone might hear you.

319
00:23:26,294 --> 00:23:28,046
How's it going with the tangerine guy?

320
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:31,382
Nothing's going on.

321
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:34,803
<i>Why? Does he not look handsome anymore?</i>

322
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:36,513
<i>Does he have nasty drinking habits?</i>

323
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,765
It's not that.

324
00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:42,102
I'm neither head over heels for him

325
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:44,270
nor do I see the need to date anyone.

<i>There's a package for you.</i>

328
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,835
Hello.

329
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:30,963
This came to my clinic.

330
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:33,674
I'm sorry. Why did it go there?

331
00:24:34,216 --> 00:24:36,134
-It looks heavy. I'll--
-It's heavy. Let me--

332
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:37,761
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

333
00:24:38,762 --> 00:24:39,888
-Let me--
-Let me--

334
00:24:59,992 --> 00:25:01,702
It's not heavy. I can do it.

335
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:03,662
I didn't say anything.

336
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:06,790
All right, then.

337
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:22,848
The pot's looking fine.

338
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,559
Yes. I give it a lot of delicious food.

339
00:25:25,642 --> 00:25:27,019
I feed it Coke and coffee.

340
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:28,645
Hold on.

341
00:25:34,985 --> 00:25:36,445
Don't worry.

342
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:39,489
I give it Diet Coke
and decaffeinated coffee.

343
00:25:42,826 --> 00:25:43,869
Oh, dear.

344
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:52,794
Here.

345
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:55,047
For me?

346
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:03,639
-Do you want me to drink this?
-Yes.

347
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:15,150
Now that you've had some to drink…

348
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:32,000
Can you hold it more firmly?
It's very unstable.

349
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,045
You must love camping.

350
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:38,382
Don't you dare do it again.

351
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:40,342
Do what?

352
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:42,719
Weren't you going to analyze me again?

353
00:26:44,638 --> 00:26:45,931
Not really.

354
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:51,895
Speaking of which, I have some questions.

355
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:53,313
No, thanks.

356
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:56,316
Then just one question.

357
00:26:58,235 --> 00:27:02,739
Do you know
which high school Mr. Chae went to?

358
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:06,118
Why do you ask?

359
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,246
He looked familiar. So do you know?

360
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:10,539
No.

361
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,042
I see.

362
00:27:17,587 --> 00:27:19,756
It's my turn to ask a question, right?

363
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:22,467
We never agreed on that.

364
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,806
Why did you tell me not to date him?

365
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:34,021
When you met him,

366
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,690
have you ever found
anything odd about him?

367
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,861
Something that got on your nerves.

368
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,871
You can learn more about someone

369
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:54,791
when they're naked
than when they're wearing something.

370
00:27:58,628 --> 00:28:01,673
The absence itself tells you
what's important.

371
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:08,555
Do you find it odd that I'm not bothered
by anything about him?

372
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:10,432
Is that why you told me not to see him?

373
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:13,727
I want to tell you in detail,

374
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,520
but I'm still looking into it.

375
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:20,609
Gosh, I've gotten much more curious
than I already was.

376
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:24,196
Why do you not want me to date him?

377
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:30,911
Anyway, this is…

378
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:44,383
TARP INSTALLATION MANUAL

379
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:55,018
Do you like me?

380
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:57,104
Sorry?

381
00:28:58,814 --> 00:29:00,440
Why would you suddenly…

382
00:29:00,524 --> 00:29:02,234
That's… Why do you think so?

383
00:29:02,317 --> 00:29:04,111
That's most plausible.

384
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:07,864
You suddenly tell me not to date him
but won't tell me why.

385
00:29:08,407 --> 00:29:10,951
Look at you right now.
You're so flustered.

386
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,994
Oh, dear.

387
00:29:16,581 --> 00:29:18,291
-If that's it--
-That's not it.

388
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:21,420
You're looking away.

389
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:24,756
This is a normal reaction.

390
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,719
Those who are lying look you in the eye
to see if you believe them.

391
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:32,180
I even wrote a book about it.

392
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:34,433
Check it out. I'll lend it to you.

393
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:37,727
Never mind then.

394
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:41,106
Thanks for your help.

395
00:29:41,189 --> 00:29:43,525
I've been meaning to tell you this.

396
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:48,864
This tarp should be fixed to the ground.

397
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:53,910
Keep it here, and you'll find it in Busan
if a typhoon hits.

398
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:55,996
A legless bird

399
00:29:56,496 --> 00:29:57,998
and a poleless tarp.

400
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,128
No way.

401
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:04,421
Weaving.

402
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:06,465
Jab.

403
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:21,104
Either pick it up or work out.

404
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:23,982
It's not that easy to decide.

405
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,070
Then just get hit.

406
00:30:37,746 --> 00:30:39,039
He came by yesterday.

407
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,126
I never asked.

408
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:53,678
What are these?

409
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:59,601
He asked us to treat you like a customer
and not like a friend who has free coffee.

410
00:30:59,684 --> 00:31:03,146
He said he doesn't want you to think
he's a stalker and will be more careful.

411
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,857
He came to say bye
since he won't be coming for some time.

412
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:22,249
What was that for?

413
00:31:22,332 --> 00:31:24,834
You must've been really mean to him.

414
00:31:24,918 --> 00:31:27,128
That once happy-go-lucky guy
looked miserable.

415
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:30,048
-I wasn't mean to him.
-Of course not.

416
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:32,217
I bet you were really harsh
on him instead.

417
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:37,097
You dated every single guy I didn't
approve of, and you turn him down?

418
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:39,808
Where do you think you're going?

419
00:31:41,893 --> 00:31:42,769
To bed.

420
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:45,939
-It's 4:30 p.m.
-I know.

421
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:57,701
<i>You said flowers wither,
are prickly, and can't be recycled.</i>

422
00:31:57,784 --> 00:31:59,869
<i>So I brought this. It's a paper rose.</i>

423
00:31:59,953 --> 00:32:01,871
<i>It won't wither, it's not prickly,</i>

424
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:02,998
<i>and it's recyclable.</i>

425
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:05,208
<i>You could also jot things down on it.</i>

426
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:09,212
Have you ever seen a lunatic pick herbs?

427
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:12,924
They'd be digging at one place

428
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:15,927
then pulling herbs out at another.

429
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,140
No, I haven't.

430
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:23,268
I've been like that lunatic lately.

431
00:32:26,396 --> 00:32:27,689
I was greedy

432
00:32:28,732 --> 00:32:29,983
then afraid

433
00:32:31,192 --> 00:32:32,652
then doubtful.

434
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:40,076
I thought about why I was feeling
this way.

435
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:43,913
It turned out I was feeling uncomfortable.

436
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:50,003
I felt pressured to reciprocate
your feelings.

437
00:32:51,046 --> 00:32:52,422
You don't need to do that.

438
00:32:53,757 --> 00:32:55,383
I like how things are right now.

439
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:02,974
But I don't.

440
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:14,319
It's not that I'm kind.
I just don't want to be the antagonist.

441
00:33:16,696 --> 00:33:18,531
It's easier to be the victim.

442
00:33:23,411 --> 00:33:27,082
I know it's wrong and unhealthy
to have this kind of relationship.

443
00:33:27,165 --> 00:33:29,250
I want to change, and I will.

444
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,551
But that's who I am right now.

445
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:46,017
I'll make the same mistakes

446
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:48,687
if I see someone right now.

447
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:50,313
Then…

448
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:53,858
you can change.

449
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:10,583
I wish that was possible.

450
00:34:22,303 --> 00:34:23,513
<i>The problem is</i>

451
00:34:24,347 --> 00:34:27,183
<i>that the feeling of excitement
comes before trust does.</i>

452
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:31,438
<i>And…</i>

453
00:34:33,523 --> 00:34:35,567
<i>I realized how terrifying</i>

454
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,737
<i>that rash feeling of excitement can be.</i>

455
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:59,883
<i>Letting someone into your heart means</i>

456
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:04,220
<i>that your heart can be
easily broken by them.</i>

457
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:05,889
No way.

458
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:07,932
Out of the blue?

459
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:12,979
<i>It also means you won't let go of them</i>

460
00:35:13,062 --> 00:35:16,316
<i>despite knowing that.</i>

461
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,078
I bought tangerines, kids!

462
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:31,498
Dad!

463
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:33,208
Goodness, my dear son.

464
00:35:34,793 --> 00:35:36,044
Have you been well?

465
00:35:37,587 --> 00:35:39,506
All right, let's go inside.

466
00:35:41,466 --> 00:35:43,384
-Dad.
-Let's sit down and eat.

467
00:35:43,468 --> 00:35:45,220
Thank you.

468
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:53,228
<i>I don't want to get hurt.</i>

469
00:35:54,896 --> 00:35:59,150
<i>I don't want to foolishly bring up
my painful past.</i>

470
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,403
<i>Nevertheless,</i>

471
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:05,365
<i>I want to be happy.</i>

472
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:24,509
FLESH AND BLOOD

473
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:32,433
Yes?

474
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:34,602
<i>Guess who's here.</i>

475
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:38,231
-Is Mom in Seoul?
<i>-No.</i>

476
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:40,775
<i>It's the tangerine guy.</i>

477
00:36:50,201 --> 00:36:51,452
Why would he go there?

478
00:36:51,536 --> 00:36:53,288
Beats me. He just came.

479
00:37:01,004 --> 00:37:03,464
When did he arrive?
How long will he be there?

480
00:37:03,965 --> 00:37:05,425
I'm not sure.

481
00:37:05,508 --> 00:37:07,510
-About 30 minutes--
-No, don't tell me.

482
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:09,971
<i>-Okay. Then I'll go--</i>
-Is he alone?

483
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,600
-No, don't tell me.
-Fine.

484
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:15,143
-Then I'll go--
<i>-Who is he with?</i>

485
00:37:16,102 --> 00:37:17,437
No, don't tell me.

486
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,605
Tell me.

487
00:37:18,688 --> 00:37:20,940
No, don't. You better not tell me.

488
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,941
Who is he with?

489
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,321
I'll send you a text.
It's your choice to read it or not.

490
00:37:26,404 --> 00:37:27,447
I'm going back to work.

491
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:49,469
You're not seeing things.

492
00:37:50,595 --> 00:37:52,138
You're not drunk.

493
00:37:57,936 --> 00:38:00,980
Can you come out for a minute?

494
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,238
I was avoiding you.

495
00:38:09,906 --> 00:38:11,366
You shouldn't have come.

496
00:38:12,742 --> 00:38:14,035
Are you not happy to see me?

497
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:18,039
What do you think?

498
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:24,295
I just don't know what you see in me.

499
00:38:25,922 --> 00:38:28,925
I know I'm a decent person,

500
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:31,135
-but you're head over heels.
-I missed you.

501
00:38:37,141 --> 00:38:39,143
Did you miss me?

502
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:57,912
Well…

503
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:01,958
That snowy night…

504
00:39:06,212 --> 00:39:07,422
With the TV

505
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,882
and tangerines…

506
00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:13,428
In that dream of yours,

507
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:18,599
was there a cat too?

508
00:39:24,522 --> 00:39:27,025
Because I'm planning to get a cat later.

509
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:39,495
Yes.

510
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,040
Definitely.

511
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,751
There are many of them.

512
00:40:04,812 --> 00:40:07,356
Those with
antisocial personality disorder,

513
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,985
also called sociopaths,
are different from psychopaths.

514
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:13,780
There's nothing wrong with
the structure of their brain.

515
00:40:13,863 --> 00:40:17,408
However, studies have shown
that their cerebral cortex

516
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:20,161
reacts differently to average people's.

517
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:24,957
When average people read
"mother" and "strictness,"

518
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:29,504
they become more sensitive to the former
because it's related to their emotions.

519
00:40:29,587 --> 00:40:31,130
A STUDY ON THE CHARACTERISTICS
OF A SOCIOPATH

520
00:40:31,214 --> 00:40:34,133
When this individual read
the word "mother,"

521
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:36,552
<i>blood flow increased
in their temporal lobe.</i>

522
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:41,224
<i>Such a reaction usually happens
when you're calculating numbers.</i>

523
00:40:41,307 --> 00:40:44,602
<i>In other words,
sociopaths need to recognize and calculate</i>

524
00:40:44,685 --> 00:40:48,106
<i>before expressing emotional reactions
to look like a normal person.</i>

525
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:51,150
<i>The problem here is that they're quick.</i>

526
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:59,033
<i>So much so that they often look
much more empathetic than most people.</i>

527
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:06,124
How was the movie?

528
00:41:06,624 --> 00:41:08,000
I hated it.

529
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:11,003
Masterpiece, my foot.
It was a train wreck.

530
00:41:11,087 --> 00:41:12,296
Was it that bad?

531
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:16,551
They copied <i>Rain Man</i> and <i>The Shining</i>

532
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:19,679
then inserted tearjerkers.

533
00:41:20,388 --> 00:41:21,973
It took up all the spots

534
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:24,350
so no other movies could premiere.

535
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:26,853
Gosh, you must be a film enthusiast.

536
00:41:27,812 --> 00:41:30,189
That's why I have so many complaints too.

537
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:32,567
This is why old movies are the best.

538
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:34,819
They aren't imitations.

539
00:41:34,902 --> 00:41:37,155
Right. I forgot you like old movies.

540
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:40,158
Did I tell you that?

541
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:43,911
You sing that song at the cafe
while secretly making juice.

542
00:41:43,995 --> 00:41:45,621
What was it? "Moon River."

543
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:47,582
But you only know two words.

544
00:41:47,665 --> 00:41:49,417
What are you talking about?

545
00:41:50,168 --> 00:41:54,005
"A-ri, don't tell Eun-ha.
I'm going to add a lot of strawberries."

546
00:41:54,088 --> 00:41:55,548
<i>Moon river</i>

547
00:41:58,926 --> 00:42:01,512
Were you staring at me all day
at the cafe?

548
00:42:01,596 --> 00:42:04,891
Didn't you know? I didn't even
watch the movie just now either.

549
00:42:08,686 --> 00:42:11,314
How could you only know
two words to a song?

550
00:42:12,023 --> 00:42:14,859
Be honest. There are songs you only know
one word to, right?

551
00:42:15,943 --> 00:42:17,153
<i>She</i>

552
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:22,950
English is the only foreign language
you speak, right?

553
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:27,705
I speak three different languages at work.

554
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:30,208
Don't get cute.

555
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:33,586
-What did you just say?
-Shut up.

556
00:42:39,508 --> 00:42:42,094
Where are you going?
The parking lot's over there.

557
00:42:44,013 --> 00:42:47,141
You're not going home, right?
Because that's the wrong direction.

558
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:54,232
I know.

559
00:43:01,155 --> 00:43:02,448
Your ears are red again.

560
00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:05,243
-I ate a mailbox.
-That's not tasty.

561
00:43:05,785 --> 00:43:08,287
-Do you like coffee candy?
-Strawberries are the best.

562
00:43:08,371 --> 00:43:10,748
Right? I should throw it away.

563
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:12,833
-Why would you…
-Let's go.

564
00:43:14,377 --> 00:43:16,671
Why would you put it in his hoodie?

565
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:18,881
Gosh.

566
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:21,342
Why do you keep doing that?

567
00:43:21,926 --> 00:43:24,971
-Then have this.
-I want a strawberry one.

568
00:43:26,055 --> 00:43:27,723
-It won't take long.
-Okay.

569
00:43:32,186 --> 00:43:35,314
Isn't it awkward
to sit face to face quietly with me?

570
00:43:36,274 --> 00:43:38,150
No, it's not awkward at all.

571
00:43:38,234 --> 00:43:40,653
Then why are you grabbing your bag
so tightly?

572
00:43:41,862 --> 00:43:43,656
I'm just covering my belly.

573
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,741
But you're not fat.

574
00:43:46,492 --> 00:43:47,660
Where are you looking?

575
00:43:56,544 --> 00:43:57,503
What?

576
00:43:58,087 --> 00:43:59,588
Never seen someone drinking?

577
00:44:00,423 --> 00:44:01,882
It's not that.

578
00:44:01,966 --> 00:44:04,885
I've never seen someone
with such pretty lips drinking.

579
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,307
How do you like it here?

580
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:13,144
I feel quite dispirited
since you hated the movie.

581
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:17,773
I hated the movie,
but I enjoyed watching it with you.

582
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:20,901
The popcorn and the Coke were tasty.

583
00:44:20,985 --> 00:44:22,278
This place is nice too.

584
00:44:28,117 --> 00:44:30,244
-Who ordered coffee?
-I did.

585
00:44:32,163 --> 00:44:33,122
Thank you.

586
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:37,835
Excuse me. Is that a music box?

587
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:39,462
Yes. Isn't it unique?

588
00:44:39,545 --> 00:44:41,464
-Would you like to see?
-Yes.

589
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:46,469
Thank you.

590
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:58,898
Do you like music boxes?
Should we go get one?

591
00:45:01,776 --> 00:45:03,778
The noodles are cooked perfectly.

592
00:45:07,782 --> 00:45:09,325
I'm glad I came.

593
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:16,415
About that high school incident
I was looking for…

594
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:18,751
Yes. Did you find anything?

595
00:45:19,376 --> 00:45:21,962
Wait. What is it you saw?

596
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:26,634
A high school kid was washing his clothes
in a bar's restroom.

597
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:29,345
I think there was blood on them.

598
00:45:30,054 --> 00:45:31,597
There was blood on the tissue.

599
00:45:32,139 --> 00:45:34,058
Maybe he fought and got a bloody nose.

600
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:36,060
Maybe.

601
00:45:36,852 --> 00:45:40,523
But he was only wearing his underwear.

602
00:45:42,858 --> 00:45:45,069
Only his underwear? In a bar's restroom?

603
00:45:45,152 --> 00:45:46,320
Yes.

604
00:45:47,655 --> 00:45:49,990
We locked eyes through the mirror,

605
00:45:50,074 --> 00:45:52,201
<i>and he kept staring at me.</i>

606
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:55,287
He was neither embarrassed nor flustered.

607
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:59,250
Damn it. I got goosebumps.

608
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,296
And I think
I felt a similar gaze recently.

609
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:08,342
If that's true, you must be wary of them.

610
00:46:09,176 --> 00:46:11,804
Those who are shameless
are the most dangerous.

611
00:46:11,887 --> 00:46:13,222
They're capable of anything.

612
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:36,203
-What are you doing here?
-Did I startle you?

613
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:38,581
This isn't right.

614
00:46:39,582 --> 00:46:43,127
-Do this again, and I'll teach you--
-I'd love to be taught a lesson or two.

615
00:46:55,514 --> 00:46:56,557
I knew you'd get upset.

616
00:47:03,189 --> 00:47:06,025
I'll wait outside.
Call me when you get off.

617
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,129
You got off work early today.

618
00:47:32,009 --> 00:47:34,470
Are you mad at me?

619
00:47:37,723 --> 00:47:40,226
You should be thankful I work at a hotel.

620
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:41,644
Had I been a doctor,

621
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:44,438
you were pretty much grabbing my hand
during surgery.

622
00:47:44,521 --> 00:47:45,731
Had I been a detective,

623
00:47:45,814 --> 00:47:48,359
you were whispering in my ear
during an interrogation.

624
00:47:49,276 --> 00:47:52,196
I'm not mad, but don't ever do that again.

625
00:47:53,614 --> 00:47:54,949
I won't.

626
00:47:57,451 --> 00:47:59,870
I don't know what I was thinking.

627
00:48:07,503 --> 00:48:09,922
Did you expect me
to be surprised and happy?

628
00:48:10,005 --> 00:48:12,341
Did you expect me to giggle
in front of everyone,

629
00:48:12,424 --> 00:48:16,428
shout out, "Yes, he's my man,"
and kiss you?

630
00:48:18,889 --> 00:48:20,933
Is that what you usually imagine?

631
00:48:28,857 --> 00:48:31,443
No, it's not.

632
00:48:32,736 --> 00:48:34,196
I didn't know you liked that.

633
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:44,290
A date?

634
00:49:00,681 --> 00:49:02,266
This is bad.

635
00:49:04,643 --> 00:49:05,894
Excuse me for a minute.

636
00:49:18,657 --> 00:49:20,701
Are you going to keep chasing me?

637
00:49:20,784 --> 00:49:22,953
Your boyfriend might leave.

638
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:29,835
He's not my boyfriend.

639
00:49:30,544 --> 00:49:31,962
Keep this a secret.

640
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:34,965
Fine. I'll just tell people
you're not official yet.

641
00:49:38,677 --> 00:49:40,262
Damn it.

642
00:51:27,661 --> 00:51:29,663
May I clean up your table?

643
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:33,167
-Sorry?
-Oh, never mind.

644
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:21,340
I heard you went to a conference.

645
00:52:22,132 --> 00:52:23,008
Is this for me?

646
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:25,010
No, it's for my mom in Gangneung.

647
00:52:26,595 --> 00:52:28,055
Is that your hometown?

648
00:52:28,138 --> 00:52:30,807
No, it's at the southeast
of Ulleung Island.

649
00:52:34,061 --> 00:52:36,230
Why do you keep
asking meaningless questions?

650
00:52:39,942 --> 00:52:41,985
You must have something to say to me.

651
00:52:42,778 --> 00:52:45,155
-Or something to complain about.
-What makes you think so?

652
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:49,326
"I'm tearing this instead
since I can't rip your mouth."

653
00:52:50,035 --> 00:52:51,411
That's the vibe I'm getting.

654
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:58,126
You caught me.

655
00:53:00,212 --> 00:53:02,464
I'll answer your questions honestly.
Go on.

656
00:53:13,642 --> 00:53:14,810
Last time,

657
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,816
you said you were looking for an answer.

658
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:28,365
About the reason you didn't want me
to date him.

659
00:53:31,451 --> 00:53:32,661
Did you find it?

660
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:40,669
No, not yet.

661
00:53:43,297 --> 00:53:44,965
It's taking ages.

662
00:53:51,972 --> 00:53:55,100
-Are you doing okay?
-Not bad.

663
00:53:56,893 --> 00:53:57,811
Oh, dear.

664
00:54:01,273 --> 00:54:02,399
What's wrong?

665
00:54:03,317 --> 00:54:05,652
-Sorry?
-Whenever you say that,

666
00:54:06,528 --> 00:54:09,072
it means "Goodness, no way, oh, my god.

667
00:54:09,156 --> 00:54:11,658
This is bad. Oh, no.
What the hell's going on? Damn it."

668
00:54:11,742 --> 00:54:13,744
It includes all of them.

669
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:16,747
I clearly said not bad.

670
00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:26,048
You don't ask that question
to someone who's obviously doing fine.

671
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:31,928
When you ask it to someone
who seems to be struggling,

672
00:54:33,138 --> 00:54:35,015
and they say they're doing well,

673
00:54:35,515 --> 00:54:37,726
they're trying to think positively.

674
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:42,439
"Fine" means that they have no energy to
talk about it and want you to stop asking.

675
00:54:44,232 --> 00:54:45,776
"Not bad" means

676
00:54:46,985 --> 00:54:49,696
that something's definitely going on,

677
00:54:50,322 --> 00:54:52,741
but they don't want to explain it to you.

678
00:54:57,913 --> 00:54:59,206
You're going overboard.

679
00:55:03,585 --> 00:55:05,379
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

680
00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:08,548
But if you want to…

681
00:55:14,596 --> 00:55:15,847
Anytime.

682
00:55:27,234 --> 00:55:28,527
Okay.

683
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:33,323
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

684
00:55:36,201 --> 00:55:37,619
-Then I'll--
-Then I'll--

685
00:55:45,794 --> 00:55:47,170
Thank you for this.

686
00:57:01,873 --> 00:57:03,625
So I brought this. It's a paper rose.

687
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:06,044
<i>It won't wither, it's not prickly,</i>

688
00:57:06,127 --> 00:57:07,378
<i>and it's recyclable.</i>

689
00:57:07,462 --> 00:57:09,964
<i>You could also jot things down on it.</i>

690
00:57:23,936 --> 00:57:25,938
YONGSAN STATION, 99, 7641

691
00:58:35,091 --> 00:58:36,259
Hello, Detective Ko.

692
00:58:36,342 --> 00:58:38,344
<i>I'm sending you a photo.</i>

693
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,972
<i>Tell me if you recognize any of them.</i>

694
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:41,931
Sure.

695
00:58:53,317 --> 00:58:55,194
I know both of them. Why?

696
00:58:56,738 --> 00:59:00,450
We received a tip-off
that he's the killer.

697
00:59:00,533 --> 00:59:01,993
So we're looking into it.

698
00:59:03,077 --> 00:59:05,371
<i>Han River Patrol Division arrived
at his house.</i>

699
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:08,249
<i>The door was open,
and there was a knife in the drawer.</i>

700
00:59:08,332 --> 00:59:09,709
<i>The tip-off must be true.</i>

701
00:59:12,003 --> 00:59:14,213
<i>Detective Park, come with me.
I'm on my way.</i>

702
00:59:24,432 --> 00:59:28,561
YONGSAN STATION, 99, 7641

703
00:59:38,404 --> 00:59:39,947
Hello.

704
00:59:43,868 --> 00:59:46,037
Do you know Ms. Kang Da-jeong's number?

705
00:59:46,746 --> 00:59:47,830
No.

706
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:28,955

01:00:50,518 --> 01:00:52,270
<i>Do you like music boxes?</i>

708
01:00:52,353 --> 01:00:53,521
Should we go get one?

709
01:00:54,856 --> 01:00:58,985
There's a movie called <i>Music Box</i>,
and it had one similar to this.

710
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:01,529
Is it a musical?
Do you want to go watch it?

711
01:01:02,321 --> 01:01:05,575
It's an old movie about former Nazis
getting punished.

712
01:01:05,658 --> 01:01:07,159
That doesn't suit the title.

713
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,998
Do you know Edgar Allan Poe's novel
called <i>The Black Cat</i>?

714
01:01:12,623 --> 01:01:14,625
I do. It's a scary one.

715
01:01:15,668 --> 01:01:17,086
In the movie,

716
01:01:18,254 --> 01:01:20,715
the music box is like the black cat.

717
01:01:22,174 --> 01:01:24,886
The music box points to the real criminal

718
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,096
at the end

719
01:01:27,972 --> 01:01:29,849
and prevents the truth

720
01:01:30,975 --> 01:01:32,560
from getting buried.

721
01:01:36,564 --> 01:01:39,275
INCOMING CALL

722
01:04:42,917 --> 01:04:47,254
06M 5381

723
01:06:20,347 --> 01:06:23,851
I FINALLY FOUND YOU

724
01:06:25,187 --> 01:06:30,747
YOU ARE MY SPRING

725

Subtitle translation by: Soo-ji Kim

726
01:06:49,919 --> 01:06:51,921
<i>Who is Chae Jun?</i>

727
01:06:52,004 --> 01:06:54,173
<i>Is he even a real person?</i>

728
01:06:54,673 --> 01:06:56,634
<i>None of this is your fault.</i>

729
01:06:56,717 --> 01:06:58,636
<i>I will be by your side.</i>

730
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:02,890
<i>You merely can't see the wound.
But the injury is real.</i>

731
01:07:02,973 --> 01:07:05,476
He shouldn't have done
something like that.

732
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:08,437
<i>Everything falls into place so perfectly,
it's creepy.</i>

733
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,730
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

734
01:07:09,813 --> 01:07:12,483
<i>Though you probably
already figured it out.</i>

735
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:15,694
<i>I don't think Choi Jeong-min
is the real culprit.</i>

736
01:07:16,278 --> 01:07:18,072
<i>There's something strange about it all.</i>
