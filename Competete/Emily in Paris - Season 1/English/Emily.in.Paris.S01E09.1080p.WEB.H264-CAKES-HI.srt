1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,427
[announcer] <i>The Cubs have done it!</i>

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,553
[patrons cheering]

3
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:15,181
- [announcer continues indistinctly]
- [chanting] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,228
[Emily inhales sharply]

5
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:23,857
- So that's your plan for her champagne?
- [Emily] Yep.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,221
I shipped a box of Champère
to my favorite bar in Chicago,

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,194
and people went bananas.

8
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,278
Like apes.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,698
We market Champère as a spray.

10
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,577
Champagne showers don't just have to be
for pro athletes after a big win.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,122
They can be for everyone.
We're making extravagance accessible.

12
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,498
And very American,

13
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,875
to be so wasteful.

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,502
Actually, the tradition began in France

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,338
with Formula 1 drivers in the '60s.

16
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,092
But now we use it to make bikinis wet.

17
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,218
Well, thank you, Luc.

18
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,264
- [mouthing]
- So when do we meet these clients?

19
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,027
Well, Camille invited us to an art opening

20
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,394
at her gallery in the Marais tonight,
and there will be lots of champagne.

21
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,937
I'll wear a raincoat.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,106
Well, um…

23
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,692
[Julien] Sylvie, Antoine called again.

24
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,776
Unavailable.

25
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,892
I think he's calling
about the scent for the Zimmer hotel.

26
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,281
[Sylvie] Unavailable!

27
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,700
Oh, and, uh, Judith Robertson

28
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,495
from the American Friends
of the Louvre called for you.

29
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,456
For me? Any idea what she wants?

30
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,666
[chuckles] A new friend, I suppose.

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,502
["La valse du p'tit café de minuit"
playing]

32
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,636
[in Texas accent]
Thank you so much for meeting me, hon.

33
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,932
[clicks tongue] Hey, are you familiar
with the American Friends of the Louvre?

34
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,183
Googled it.

35
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,142
But to be honest,

36
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,187
it's just so nice to sit down
with an American friend of anything.

37
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,647
Oh, don't I know.

38
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,483
Sometimes
I just long to hear that <i>r </i>sound.

39
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,400
Oh, I know.

40
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,320
It's like the French <i>r </i>can't be bothered
to come out of their mouths.

41
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,406
[chuckles]
Try having a name like Robertson.

42
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,910
Every French person
dry heaves just trying to pronounce it.

43
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,287
[in French accent] Judith Robertson.

44
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,539
[both laugh]

45
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,290
My name sounds like an airline.

46
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,584
Emily Coop-<i>air. </i>Fly me.

47
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,044
[both laugh]

48
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,713
Well, that's the price we pay. [chuckles]

49
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,465
I'll get down to brass tacks.

50
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,717
I know that you work for Pierre Cadault.

51
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,345
I've been following you on Insta.

52
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,890
Do you think
that Pierre would donate a dress

53
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,143
to be auctioned for the AFL?

54
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,937
Well, first of all, Pierre is wonderful

55
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,480
and… and very charitable,

56
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,608
but, um, well,
he's also very particular about his image.

57
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,319
Oh, of course.
I mean, it's gonna be a big to-do.

58
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,531
It'll be a whole lot of press coverage.

59
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,659
Well, wow. [chuckles]
Um, from a marketing point of view,

60
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,329
I don't see how that couldn't be good
for his brand, so I'll definitely ask him.

61
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,747
<i>- Très bien.</i>
- [both laugh]

62
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,541
- [glasses clink]
- Let's order.

63
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,210
Oh. It's all in English.

64
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,130
Oh, honey, this is Ralph Lauren's place.

65
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,008
They're not even allowed
to speak French here. [laughs]

66
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,467
[sighs] What a relief.

67
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,637
[gasps, whispers] Look, a cheeseburger.

68
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,099
Ooh. Do you mind? It just looks so good.

69
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,268
- [quietly] Okay.
- [camera shutter clicks]

70
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:11,816
[chuckles] The irony of how a french fry
can make you feel so at home.

71
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,402
[sighs] Mm!

72
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,492
[cell phone ringing]

73
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,788
- Emily from Savoir, how are you?
- <i>I am good, thanks, Mathieu.</i>

74
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,790
I was wondering
if I could come by the atelier

75
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,751
to discuss something with you and Pierre.

76
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,795
[inhales] <i>He's working nonstop
with Fashion Week so close.</i>

77
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,673
But I can meet you
for a drink tonight, if you'd like.

78
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,301
Oh, I'm going
to a gallery opening with some friends.

79
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,261
Text me the address,
and I'll see you there.

80
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,806
[upbeat instrumental music plays]

81
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,312
I'm so excited to meet
this scary boss you always talk about.

82
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,064
Oh, I've met her. She's not so bad.

83
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,150
- Ooh, she scares most French people.
- [Camille and Gabriel chuckle]

84
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,611
[Emily] There she is.
Sylvie, Luc! You came.

85
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,196
- This is Camille.
- [Sylvie] Oh!

86
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,615
<i>- Enchantée. </i>Very nice to meet you.
<i>- Enchantée.</i>

87
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,659
- A pleasure.
- Ah, thank you. [chuckles]

88
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,871
Yeah, we are really looking forward
to representing your family's champagne.

89
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,665
[Mathieu] Emily.

90
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,249
Hi. [chuckles]

91
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,252
[Sylvie] Oh, Mathieu Cadault,

92
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,045
honoring us with his presence.

93
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,755
Emily asked me to meet her here.

94
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,009
- She can't stop working, can she?
- [Emily and Camille chuckle]

95
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,429
So, guys, let's see some art.

96
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,889
Please. [exhales]

97
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,808
- Follow me.
- [energetic music plays]

98
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:32,355
[chuckles] So this is a new artist
we just signed.

99
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,985
- Hmm. Interesting.
- I find this very sexual.

100
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,963
- Really?
- [Camille] Yeah, he's right.

101
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,197
The artist told me
this piece was, uh,

102
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,324
all about her last love affair, so…

103
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,410
Of course. Look at this slit.

104
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,122
Obviously, it represents her vagina.

105
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,124
And the four colors chosen

106
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,417
were very intentional.

107
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,461
Red is blood. The yellow is urine.

108
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,672
And… and so on.

109
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,550
So what does the white represent?

110
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,343
[Sylvie scoffs]

111
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,929
She's been pitching
an entire beverage campaign

112
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,016
based on ejaculation,
and she doesn't know what the white is.

113
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,978
- It's the spray, Emily.
- [Camille and Luc laugh]

114
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,189
Oh, Mathieu,
I'm so honored to work with Pierre.

115
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,859
Please tell me everything
about his new collection.

116
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,445
What's going on between you two?

117
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,613
- Who?
- You and Mathieu.

118
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,408
- What? Nothing.
- Don't you see the way he looks at you?

119
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,743
He's a client.

120
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,121
Who cares if he's a client?
He's, um, handsome, wealthy,

121
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,914
and he's the heir of Pierre Cadault.

122
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,167
- How do you know all this?
- How do you not?

123
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,545
I mean, he's in <i>Voici </i>and <i>Paris Match</i>
all the time dating some celebrities.

124
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,963
Ugh. God, really?

125
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,424
Yes, Emily. He's perfect for you.

126
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,347
Oh, because he's rich
and he dates celebrities?

127
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:47,263
Because he's successful,
and he's got his life on track.

128
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,391
A track paved with money
he hasn't had to work for.

129
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,394
<i>Oh mon Dieu, Gabriel.</i>
Struggling isn't the only way.

130
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,230
Guys, this conversation
is ridiculous. [chuckles]

131
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,691
- He's a client, not a boyfriend.
- [Camille] Mm-hmm.

132
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,446
Lovely gallery, but I'd better
get out of here before I buy something.

133
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,655
[Camille chuckles]

134
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,115
Shall we have dinner?

135
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,495
Uh, there is a wonderful bistro
just around the corner.

136
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,373
Anywhere quiet
where we can discuss business is good.

137
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,501
- [Camille] Mm.
- ["C'est si bon" playing]

138
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,806
Mm, this is so good.

139
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,016
It's my favorite crepe stand in Paris.

140
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,560
It's funny
how every culture has its pancake.

141
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,812
Uh… [scoffs]

142
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,815
You can't compare
our crepes to your pancakes.

143
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,734
- I mean, no contest. We win.
- [hip-hop music playing]

144
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,405
- Well, you haven't tried mine.
- You'll have to make them for me sometime.

145
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,824
[Emily chuckles, gasps]

146
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,786
Oh, look, I've read about this.
It's Grey Space, the designers.

147
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,665
They're releasing this
limited edition hoodie. It's 900 euros.

148
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,084
[Mathieu] Oh,
the streetwear guys from the States.

149
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,145
- They have a show at Fashion Week?
- [Emily] Yeah.

150
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,339
And they're doing this whole thing,
not releasing the location of their show,

151
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,259
and, of course,
it's making everyone wanna go. [sighs]

152
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,262
- They're good at getting noticed.
- I can see that.

153
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,932
So, um,
how's Pierre's collection coming along?

154
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,435
Hmm, it's always
a challenging time of year,

155
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,479
but at this point,
I know how to manage the moods.

156
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,024
- How long have you worked together?
- Since university.

157
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,861
But I moved in with him
in London when I was 13.

158
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,197
[sighs]
It wasn't the most stable childhood.

159
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,908
But every day was something new.

160
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,582
- You and I are so different.
- Oh, is that so?

161
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,330
Yeah, I grew up in the suburbs,
in the same town as my parents,

162
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,208
and went to high school
where my mom was the math teacher.

163
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,793
Every day was the same.

164
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,087
I didn't get on a plane until I was 12

165
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:47,091
and hadn't been to Europe until now.

166
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,595
Ugh, God,
you must think that I am so boring.

167
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,972
Oh, I'm not bored at all. Are you?

- No.
- Ah.

169
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,311
Okay, so,
the American Friends of the Louvre

170
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,188
are hosting this big charity event

171
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,565
and asked if Pierre would donate a dress.

172
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,067
[scoffs] Oh. Is that how it works?

173
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,070
We pay you,
and you come in and ask for favors?

174
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,656
Oh, all right.

175
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,317
Come by the atelier tomorrow,

176
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,202
and we'll see
if there's a dress that works.

177
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,412
Oh, thank you. I really appreciate it.

178
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,831
- All right.
- Okay, well, I should be heading home.

179
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,501
- All right. Well, good night, Emily.

- We'll talk soon.
- Yep. Bye.

[Emily groans]

186
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,781
That was strange to see you last night
with Mathieu Cadault.

187
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,698
Why?

188
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,659
Well, if I recall,
your corporate commandments

189
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,578
were very specific
about not mixing business with pleasure.

190
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,248
We were just meeting
at the gallery to discuss Pierre.

191
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,124
He's donating a dress to the AFL auction.

192
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,044
- AFL?
- American Friends of the Louvre.

193
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,839
Oh, God, the last thing the Louvre needs
is more friends from America.

194
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,216
It's gonna be a big event.

195
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,099
There'll be a lot of press.
We're all invited.

196

- [sighs]
- Sylvie, this just arrived for you.

197
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,769

00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,122
Did they break up? Can they break up?

205
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,540
Open it.

206
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,458
- No.
- What's going on?

207
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,045
Antoine sent a gift to Sylvie,

208
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,839
and she won't open it.

209
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,840
Ah, give it to me.

Mm! Beautiful earrings.

214

Nah, not for the ear.

215
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,729
For the nipple.

216
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,522
What? No.

217
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,567
No. No! No.

What a great turnout.

Oh, yes, ma'am.

their eyes on that Pierre Cadault.

Thank you so much for lending us this one.

233

Oh, well, you can have her
for your permanent collection.

Why are there exterminators here?

[Sylvie] Oh, it's Paris,
there's always a rat somewhere.

237
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,791
No, they're not exterminators.
They're a designer duo called Grey Space.

238
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,543
- American and very avant-garde.
- [Sylvie] Oh.

That's another word for ugly.

I'll leave you two.

that sticks out like a sore thumb here.

- Let me guess. Ghostbusters?

- [inhales sharply] Oof.
- No, workwear. It's our spring collection.

- Well, I think it's cute.
- Oh. Is this your event?

00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,363
Well, it wouldn't have happened
without this lady.

Honey, she has hooked us up
with the pièce de résistance.

ever considered taking on a team?

You're growing so fast, I imagine
you're not as hands-on as you'd like.

Well, we do our marketing in-house.

And we manage
to stay pretty hands-on, but thanks.

[gasps] Oh, damn, we have a problem.

- There are thunderstorms in Dallas.

got delayed.

Do you want me
to translate the article for you?

really don't wanna go into work today.
