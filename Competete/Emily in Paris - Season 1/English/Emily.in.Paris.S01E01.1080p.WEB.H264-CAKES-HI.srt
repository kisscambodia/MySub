00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,740
How was your journey here?
The new apartment and everything?

170
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,748
[in English, chuckling]
You lost me at<i> bonjour.</i>

171
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,871
Oh.

172
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,626
Yeah, I was told the American coming here
spoke French.

173
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,919
Oh, that was Madeline.

174
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,504
Oh, so you're <i>not</i> Madeline.

175
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:10,591
Uh, I'm Emily. Emily Cooper.
And I am so excited to be here.

176
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,302
Well, that's very unfortunate.
[sighs softly]

177
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,596
- Excuse me?
- That you don't speak French.

178
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,764
It's a problem.

179
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,407
Well, I'm going to take a class, but...

180
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,560
[American accent]
<i>...je parle un peu français </i>already.

181
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,937
Well, perhaps it's better not to try.

- [knocking on door]
- Oh, Paul.

183
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,066
May I introduce Emily,

184
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,443
the American girl
who's come to work with us?

185
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,113
This is Monsieur Brossard,
he's the founder of Savoir.

186
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,490
- Ah. Emily Cooper. Oh.
- [Paul] Hello.

187
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,574
[Emily chuckles]

188
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,202
It is so nice to meet you,
Monsieur Brossard.

189
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,246
It's a pleasure. Welcome to Paris.

190
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,749
So, you've come to teach the French
some American tricks?

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,085
I'm sure we have a lot to learn
from each other.

192
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,462
But your experience is not with fashion

193
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,381
- and luxury brands, hm?
- [Emily] True.

194
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,925
Most of my experience
has been in promoting pharmaceuticals

195
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,635
and geriatric care facilities.

196
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,595
In Chicago.

197
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,305
Yes. I mean, <i>oui.</i>

198
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,388
[scoffs]

199
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,890
I was in Chicago once,

200
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,934
- and I ate the deep-dish pizza.
- Ah.

201
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,477
That is our specialty.

202
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,854
We take a lot of pride.

203
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,647
It was, uh, <i>dégueulasse.</i> How you say?

204
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,065
- Disgusting.
- [Paul chuckles]

205
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,359
- Like a quiche made of cement.
- Uh...

206
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,278
Oh, no, you must have gone
to Lou Malnati's.

207
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,863
And the people are so fat.

208
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,698
Why are they all so fat?

209
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,825
Well, perhaps from the disgusting food.

210
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,869
True, we are in the midst
of an obesity epidemic.

211
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,121
In fact,
Merck was one of our biggest clients.

212
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,749
They make a diabetes drug
that we marketed the heck out of.

213
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,459
Sales went up 63 percent.

214
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,420
So you create the disease,
then you treat the disease,

215
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,714
and then you market the treatments
of the disease.

216
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,091
- Well...
- Perhaps stop eating.

217
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,968
- There is no money in that.
- True.

218
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,430
Cigarettes cause diabetes and cancer.

219
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,348
Yes.

220
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,516
[chuckles] Well, smoking is a pleasure.

221
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,727
And without pleasure, who are we?

222
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,520
- German?
- [Paul chuckling]

223
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,897
Exactly right.

224
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,649
[Emily chuckles]

225
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,402
All of the brands we market here,
from perfume to cognac to couture,

226
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,697
- are all to do with beauty and refinement.
- [Emily] Mm-hmm.

227
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,117
Perhaps <i>you </i>have something
to learn from us,

228
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,204
but I'm not sure
if we have much to learn from you.

229
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,207
With all due respect,
I have been sent here for a reason,

230
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,918
so if you wouldn't mind,
I would really like to share

231
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,041
some of my ideas
about your social media strategies.

232
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,963
You mean the Twitter and the Snapchat?

233
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,465
Yes. And the Instagram.

234
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,008
Ah, by all means.

235

- [upbeat music plays]

for speaking English.

but it hasn't kicked in yet.

00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,652
Please continue.

240
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,864
For those of you who haven't met me,
I'm Emily Cooper,

241
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,991
and I'm so excited to be here in Paris.

242
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm looking forward to getting to know
each and every one of you

243
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,288
and, likewise, having you get to know me.

244
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,666
Your name, <i>monsieur?</i>

245
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,750
My name is Luc.

246
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,126
Yes, Luc?

247
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,295
Why are you shouting?

248
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,632
[sighs, quietly] Sorry.

249
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,716
[Luc grunts]

250
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,678
Your company works
with some of the biggest brands

251
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,264
in the luxury sector, from Chanel to YSL.

252
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,435
And that makes Savoir, your company,
or, if I may be so bold,

253
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,478
<i>our </i>company, a brand in itself.

254
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,688
But to build a brand,

255
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,274
you must create
meaningful social media engagement.

256
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,860
May I ask who's responsible
for your social media here?

257
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,694
Patricia.

258
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,488
Makes sense.

259
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,115
[inhales sharply] Anyway,

260
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,033
it's not just about
the number of followers.

261
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:27,872
It's about content, trust,
interest, and engagement.

262
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,501
Excuse me, but the French
are masters of social media.

263
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,585
True.

264
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,880
But Americans invented it,

265
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,758
which is why I hope to become
a valuable member of your team

266
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,344

to your fabulous French clients.
