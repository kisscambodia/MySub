A little retail therapy before work?

4
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:34,284
[sighs] Unlike you, Emily,
I don't have much time for shopping.

5
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,661
And I'll be away next week.

6
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,913
Ooh! Is it a work trip?

7
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,582
[gasps] Or a girls' trip?

8
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,708
<i>Femme voyage?</i>

9
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,377
No, actually,
it's a none-of-your-business trip.

10
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,421
Oh, we have those in America, too.

11
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,298
Well, you deserve a vacation.

12
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,925
And you can count on me
to make sure everything runs smoothly

13
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,010
while you're gone.

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,138
Oh, I could help with
the Fourtier flagship party this week.

15
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,516
Oh no, no, no, no.
I don't need another problem right now.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,436
Well, given that there's
an American actress hosting the event,

17
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,397
I just think that you should be utilizing
the American in your office.

18
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,525
You really think you're up for the task?

19
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,651
Absolutely.

20
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,528
<i>Très bien,</i> then you babysit the actress,

21
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,572
but don't come to me
with any stupid questions.

22
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,201
If you're doing it,
you should be saving me time and energy.

23
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,078

I have Brooklyn Clark's travel itinerary
and her talking points for the party.

26
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,676
Sylvie says this is your problem now.

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,303
"Problem"? I love her.

28
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,679
I've seen all of her movies.

29
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,681
I can't believe
Sylvie's letting me do this.

30
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,845
She's in a good mood
because she's going on vacation.

[whispering] Yes,
to St. Barts with Antoine.

32
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,231
- But you didn't hear it from me.
- I'm gonna pretend like I never heard it.

33
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,315
Heard what?

34
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,652
Just that I'm running point
for Brooklyn Clark at the Fourtier launch.

35
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,321
- [Luc] Pfft.
- You're not a fan? She's a big movie star.

36
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,032
Yeah, in America. In France, she is so-so.

37
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,702
Her genre of movies
are seen as a little bit foolish.

38
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,786
Really? Why?

39
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,540
American romantic comedies,
they are so dishonest.

40
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,417
Here, we like more of a French ending.

41
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,545
- Which is what?
- Tragic.

42
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,629
More like life.

He dies or loses a limb.

44
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,676
Or she prefers to be a lesbian,
which happens.

45
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,803
Yeah, happy endings are very American.

46
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,264
But they give you hope,
and the hero wins in the end.

47
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,373
Don't you want to see the hero win?

48
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,309
No, I want to see life,

49
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,228
the hero tortured for his love,

50
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,437
and the actress naked.

51
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,065
But don't you want to go
to the movies to escape life?

52
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,484
Thinking you can escape life
is your problem.

53
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,238
You can never escape life.

54
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,989
Never.

Uh, it's fine, Ratatouille. She's with me.

I'm under Marie Curie.

62

[laughs] I'm Emily Cooper from Savoir.
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

65
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,277
I wanted to tell you that now

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,613
in case I blurt it out
middle of a conversation.

67
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,072
[chuckles] You're so sweet.

68
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,282
Do you have any weed?

69
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,575
Um, not on me.

70
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,119
[chuckles] Actually,
marijuana is highly illegal in France.

71
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,663
- Oh. I'm just kidding.
- [both chuckle]

72
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,126
Oh, my God.

73
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,380
Okay, so I thought that we could go over
the agenda for the Fourtier party.

74
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,966
Thank God.
First off, I have nothing to wear.

75
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,719
Uh, yeah. [chuckling] I can see that.

76
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,139
I mean, usually, I just, like,
unzip whatever they send to the hotel,

77
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,142
which is how I ended up
in that atrocious romper at the VMAs.

78
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,854
What? No, no,
you… you… you looked great.

79
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,398
I looked like a camel-toed toddler.

80
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,734
Well, um, I have a connection,

81
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,944
um, at Pierre Cadault.

82
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,071
Oh. Isn't he dead?

83
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,156
No, no. He's definitely alive.

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,908
Ah. I love that for him.

85
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:06,120
- Feels a little dusty for me, though.
- Uh, no, he's not dusty.

86
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,039
He's sophisticated, he's classic

87
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,500
and certainly never designed a romper.

88
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,628
[chuckles] Yeah. I mean, I see your point.

89
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,964
- [chuckles]
- Give me your phone, Bucket Hat.

90
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,090
[Emily grunts]

91
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,720
Just text me the details tomorrow.
I'm free from three to five.

92
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,265
Oh, and don't tell my fat publicist.
I hate her.

93
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,850
[hesitates] Uh, great.
Okay, sounds like a plan.

94
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,020
Um, but, really,
about this Fourtier agenda…

95
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,564
I'm so sorry. Can you give me, like, 15?

96
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,566
I have to masturbate after a long flight.

97
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Kidding?

98
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,324
Okay, well, I'll… I'll just, like,

99
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,326
put this on the table,
then, for you. Okay.

100
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,078
Thanks. You're the best.

Oh, my God, I can't believe
you saw Maid of Dishonor's boobs.

104
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,594
- Wait, who?
- One of Brooklyn's most popular movies.

105
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,781
You know, the one
about the widowed wedding cake baker

106
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,086
who all the grooms fall in love with,
and then we find out

107
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,935
- that they're actually ghosts?
- Oh, yeah. That was stupid.

108
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,271
- Uh, I cried.
- [Camille laughing]

109
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,523

I know. I'm exhausted.
What are you guys talking about?

114
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,577
- Oh, Emily saw a movie star naked today.
- Almost naked.

115
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,079
- Cool. Who?
- [Emily] Brooklyn Clark.

116
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,444
She's hosting this party for Fourtier.
They're our client.

[inhales sharply]
Actually, you guys should come.

118
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,545
It's gonna be super fancy,
and I control the guest list.

119

121
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,969
Yeah, me too. I mean, I have to go
to Brussels and meet a collector.

122
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,889
But Gabriel is in town.
You should go, honey.

123
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,390
No pressure.

124
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,351
Oh, sure. Sounds fun.

125
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,228
And also, you need to celebrate.

126
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,231
- Can I tell them the news?
- Oh, there's nothing to tell.

127
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:01,319
Okay, Gabriel's boss has finally agreed
to sell him the restaurant.

128
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,072
- What? Congratulations!
- Oh, my God! That's huge! Yay!

129
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,867
So he will be able to do everything
he wants to do with the place.

130
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,786
Except that's not
what's happening, Camille.

131
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,412
- Uh, I can't afford it.
- [sighs]

132
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,207
The down payment alone
is completely out of my reach.

133
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,352
Yeah, but my parents are happy
to loan him the money,

134
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,294
so it <i>can </i>work, actually.

135
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,424
I have to get back to the kitchen.

136
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,969
Is everything okay?

137
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,806
[clicks tongue] Yes, it's fine.

138
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,058
It's just, um,

139
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,436
Gabriel really wants to buy this place,
and, um, getting help

140
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,980
is the only realistic way
it's going to happen.

141
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,943
I hear you,
but mixing family and money is tricky.

142
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,528
I know firsthand.

143
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,695
Oh, I'm super rich.

144
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,323
No, really.

[chuckles, gasps softly]

146
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,287
Oh, my God. Am I being that
annoying girlfriend just right now?

147
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,665
- No, no. Come on, no.
- No, you're being supportive.

148
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,166
[Camille] Okay, you know what?

149
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,545
Maybe it's good for Gabriel and I
to have some time apart this weekend.

150
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,549
Just make sure
he has a fun time at the party, okay?

He doesn't make those kinds of decisions.
