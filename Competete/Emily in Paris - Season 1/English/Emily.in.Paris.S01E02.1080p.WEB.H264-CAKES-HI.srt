00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,599
Ah, it smells really good.

174
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,059
I'm just not usually a perfume girl.

175
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,145
[Antoine] And why not?

176
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,355
It's like wearing beautiful lingerie.

177
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,442
Makes you feel more confident. Sexier.

178
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,775
Happier.

179
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,238
And, of course, with the right chemistry,
it can be an aphrodisiac.

180
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,408
I will keep all of that in mind
for our marketing materials.

181
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,243
User experience is key.

182
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,413
Mm-hm. And how do you experience it?

183
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,332
What does it smell like to you?

184
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,919
- [sniffs] Gardenia.
- [Antoine] Mm-hm.

185
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,377
Leather.

186
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,255
Musk.

187
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,938
And a little bit like sweat... [chuckles]

188
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,468
...although that's probably me.

189
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,803
It's like wearing poetry.

190
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,679
<i>Génial.</i>

191
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,348
I love it.

192
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,018
Like wearing poetry. Exactly.

193
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,438
Perhaps you wear it and see how you feel?

194
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,774
And how other men feel around you?

195
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,235
Or other women. As you please.

196
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,611
I usually please men.

197
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,072
Uh, prefer.

198
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,615
I usually prefer men.

199
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,702
Ah. Well then, you need to find yourself
a nice French boyfriend.

200
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,706
That's the best way to learn the language.
In bed.

201
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,543
I have a boyfriend. In Chicago.

202
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,171
We're basically engaged to be engaged.
He's... He's coming here soon.

203
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,549
I'm not sure that's gonna help
with your French.

204
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,219
I'm very happy to have an American
on my team.

205
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,804
We will learn from each other.

206
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,474
[sniffs]

207
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,687
[smacks lips] Expensive sex.

208
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,897
Excuse me?

209
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,774
[Antoine]
That's what it smells like to me.

210
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,317
Expensive sex.

211
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,986
Well,

212
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,281
better than a cheap date.

213
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,618
[chuckles]
I look forward to working with you.

214
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,997
And to get to know you, Emily.

215

[energetic music playing]

220
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,934
<i>Bonjour, Emily.</i>

221
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,102
<i>Bonjour, Julien.</i>

222
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,939
[Paul] Hey.

223
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,525
Very successful party last night.

224
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,319
Antoine was impressed with you.

225
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,279
He would like you to work on the account.

226
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,530
- Really?
- [Paul] Yeah.

227
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,366
[sighs] That's great.
I thought maybe I was too enthusiastic.

228
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,994
Oh, I would...
I would love the help on the account,

229
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,663
but we discussed that Emily

230
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,875
- was gonna work on Vaga-Jeune.
- Uh, what... what's Vaga-Jeune?

231
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,043
Uh, <i>suppositoires</i>

232
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,546
- so that the vagina can become <i>mouillé.
- </i>I'm sorry?

233
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,716
Suppositories to promote vaginal wetness
in older women.

234
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,553
Because the weather in the vagina
when the lady is older...

235
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,598
Isn't so <i>moye</i> anymore, I... I get it.

236
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,141
[chuckling] <i>Mouillé. Très bien.</i>

237
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,643
So you learnt a new word.

238
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,561
So, Emily will work on this for now?

239
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,563
<i>Oui, oui. </i>It's an important product.

240
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,023
A necessity.

241
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:53,152
So first, you start with the necessities,
and then you move to the luxuries.

242
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,362
[Sylvie] Yeah, <i>exactement!</i>

243
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,739
And your experience
is with pharmaceuticals,

244
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,074
so this makes total sense.

245
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,700
Of course.

246
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,285
- Good.
- Good.

247
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,204
Oh, also...

248
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,956
[quietly]...I think perhaps

249
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,710
last night you were a little too friendly
with Antoine.

250
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,879
What? No.

251
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,340
Mm, he seemed very friendly with you.

252
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,592
I think he was just being French.

253
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,095
[chuckles] And you find him attractive?

254
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,389
Yes. No! No.

255
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,141
- He's married. I met his wife.
- [Sylvie] Hm.

256
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,601
So you do find him attractive.

257
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,894
He's a client.

258
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,562
A married client.

259
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,646
<i>Exactement!</i>

260
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,775
And his wife is very nice
and a very good friend of mine.

261
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,696
I will send you all the materials
for Vaga-Jeune.

262
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,409
[energetic instrumental music playing]

263
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,248
[quietly] Something you should know.

264
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,419
[whispers] Sylvie is Antoine's mistress.

265
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,390
[Emily sighs]

266
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,372
[phone locks]

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,669
You never flirt with another woman
in front of your mistress.

268
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,593
It's worse than doing it
in front of your wife.

269
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,309
They were in the same room, to be precise.

270
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,467
Oh. Then they probably know each other.

271
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,260
- I'm sure they're friends.
- Really?

272
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,697
You think Antoine's wife knows
about his affair with Sylvie?

273
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,848
Of course. I'm sure she approves.

274
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,807
Why?

275
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,977
Nobody wants to have to have sex
with the same person forever.

276
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,437
I bet she has a lover, too.

277
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,398
Okay, my head is just completely spinning.

278
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,151
- They're all in it together?
- [laughs]

279
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,237
I think it's probably tolerated
more than discussed.

280
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,406
But I don't get it.

281
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,260
What's the point of being married
if you're gonna cheat on your spouse?

282
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,121
Uh, maybe after you're married
for 20 years, you might feel differently.

283
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,999
I mean, the French are romantics,
but they're also realists.

284
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,835
Ah. Cute alert!
How do you know about this place?

285
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,397
I live right down there,
and every time I pass by, it's packed.

286
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,131
Ah. <i>Bon appétit.</i>

287
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,259
<i>- Santé.
- Santé.</i>

288
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,345
So, what brought you to Paris?

289
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,306
[smacks lips] Mm.
At first, business school.

290
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,142
My father insisted,
and he's used to getting his way.

291
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,645
Uh, he's the Zipper King of China.

292
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,539
- The Zipper King?
- [Mindy] Yes.

293
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,399
And also many other kinds of... fasteners.

294
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,323
- He's got the world by the balls.
- [chuckles]

295
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,445
- Literally.
- [both laugh]

296
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,446
[Mindy] And, um,

297
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,073
well, it's his dream

298
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,493
to have his only child, me,
take over the family business.

299
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,454
- Well, what's your dream?
- Just anything but that.

300
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,164
[scoffs] But ever since I was a child,

301
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,501
I was obsessed
with the idea of living in Paris.

302
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,796
Um, so I enrolled in school here
and dropped out.

303
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,757
- I'm used to getting my way, too.
<i>- Merci.</i>

304
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,384
So that's why you became a nanny?

305
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:07,012
Yes, because when my father found out,
he cut me off.

306
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,348
Ow. I'm sorry. That's harsh.

307
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,141
No. No, no, no, it's wonderful.

308
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,602
I mean, I'd...
I'd much rather have my freedom.

309
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,231
Otherwise I'd be living
a very predictable life in China.

310
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,149
You know, it's funny,

311
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,569
I grew up with nannies, and now I am one.

312
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,944
- Well, I'm very glad you're here.
- [Mindy] Mm-hm.

313
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,740
Ugh. This steak isn't cooked at all.

314
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,033
- Um...
- Ooh.

315
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,285
Excuse me! <i>Pardon.</i>

316
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,578
<i>- Monsieur.</i>
- [waiter] <i>Oui.</i>

317
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,870
[Emily] Uh...

318
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,498
I ordered this medium,
and it's still kind of bloody.

319
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,042
<i>Elle aimerait son steak mieux cuit,
s'il vous plaît.</i>

320
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,502
Uh, yeah. What she said.

321
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,339
[waiter clears throat]

322
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,759
Yeah. Just make sure
to never order the <i>ris de veau.</i>

323
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,261
What's that? Rice with veal?

324
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,638
No. See, that's what I thought.
[inhales sharply]

325
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,683
I think it's brains or balls,
but it tastes like ass.

326
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,018
- [chortles]
- [Emily] Ew.

327
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,646
The chef tells me the steak is correct.

328
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,859
Um, well, correct for <i>him</i>
but not correct for me.

329
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,987
- I suggest you try it.
- Ah,

330
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,989
maybe you suggest he cook it longer?

331
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,326
- I'll take yours, you take mine.
- No. Come on. The customer's always right.

332
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,578
See, no,
here the customer is never right.

333
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,247
Well,
maybe I'll educate the chef a little bit

334
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,832
about customer service.

335
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,251
You think you're gonna change
the entire French culture

336
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,461
by sending back a steak?

337
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,007
- Gabriel?
- Emily.

338
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,676
Mindy.

339
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,470
Wait, you're the chef here?

340
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,597
<i>Oui.</i> Is there a problem?

341
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,558
- Well, you...
- No! No. I love it.

342
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,935
Everything is perfect.

343
