he was taking agency meetings.

I don't need you to come in and rescue me.

for an idea I don't even know I like.

The point is,

215
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,967
Antoine was a young, hot client,
and he pursued Sylvie. Hard.

216
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,344
- Well, was he married then?
- Of course.

217
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,889
He had a wife, and then he got a Sylvie.

of starting something with him,

For our current signature scent,

- Top notes of bergamot, mandarin, vetiver.
- [sniffing]

the heart of the fragrance.

base notes of indole.

326
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,616
Which, surprisingly,
has the same molecular compound as <i>merde.</i>

00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,201
- Shit.
- Your specialty.

I know, that sounds crazy, but it's true.

Oh, what a pity.

339
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,099
Maybe you'll find
a nice perfumer in Chicago.

340
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,895
[clears throat]
I want to make this happen, Sylvie.

341
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,939
Are you still a client here?

342
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,984
Uh, why don't we all get dinner tonight
and keep talking?

343
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,655
That's a great idea.
I'm up for anything with a Michelin star.

344
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,338
- I've got some ideas.
- [Sylvie] No, no.

345
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,618
Emily,
you're the expert on everything in Paris,

346
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,495
so you make the reservation

347
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,039
and make sure
we don't disappoint our friend Randy

348
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,122
on his last night.

349
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,792
- Hmm?
- I'm on it.

350
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,251
- [Sylvie] Good.
- Thanks.

Yes.

- [splutters] Tonight. Now?
<i>- Ce soir? Non, malheureusement...</i>

355
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,682
- It's <i>très</i> important. [sighs]
<i>- It's impossible.</i>

356
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,769
<i>- We are completely booked.</i>
- Yes, I understand it's completely full.

357
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:19,852
Thank you.

358
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,440
Thank you for this wonderful idea.

359
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,193
[clicks tongue] And I know it was you.

360
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,737
- We aim to please.
- That's good to know.

361
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,343
Did my gift please you the other day?

362
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,577
Oh, um…
Yes, it… it was very thoughtful, but, uh…

363
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,579
no, it was unnecessary.

364
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,081
Oh, not at all.

365
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,292
- And a tad inappropriate.
- Ah. According to whom?

366
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,630
Me. I don't usually accept lingerie
from clients.

367
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,800
- Especially married clients.
- [chuckles]

368
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,053
Is that what you think?
You think I bought it for me?

369
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,014
Yes?

370
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,100
I didn't buy it for me. It was for you.

371
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,228
I wanted you to feel sexy and powerful.

372
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,523
A bold woman,
unafraid to take on the world.

373
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,191
Even Paris.

374
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,071
But I apologize. I understand
you may have different boundaries.

375
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,366
Yes, I… I do.
I like to keep things tidy.

376
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,660
Professional life
and personal life separate.

377
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,413
The Container Store is my happy place.

378
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,168
Well, this is the French way.
And now that you're in Paris,

379
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,920
you'll find that the most wonderful things
exist outside of your…

380
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,798
[clears throat] How do you say? Your… box?

381
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,925
Let's just keep it to container.
[chuckles]

382
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,220
Emily,
make a reservation at the Grand Véfour.

383
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,015
- Okay.

385
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,441
No one can get in there last minute.
It's impossible.

386

00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,121
How did you do this?

390
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,249
I went online every five seconds
until there was a cancellation.

391
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,919
All right. Wait right here.

395
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,555
Well, I'm impressed.

396
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,391
I've never been able
to get a reservation here.

397
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,726
Emily is amazing.

398
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,313
Yeah, what would be amazing
is if we eventually sat down.

399
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,983
Remember the first time
I took you here, Sylvie?

400
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,153
Nope. [exhales]

We don't have a reservation for that name.

00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,700
Uh, yes, you do. Uh, I confirmed online.

404
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,369
No, I'm sorry.

405
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,874
- Hmm.
- [clicks tongue] Okay. See?

406
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,418
Here's the e-mail confirmation.

407
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,421
Six people, 9:00 p.m., 08/11.

00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,465
Wonderful. We'll see you November 8th.

409

You're booked 8th November.

This is 11th August.

What's the good news?

435
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,084
Dinner tonight is actually in the fifth.

00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,168
Personally prepared

437

by one of the most up-and-coming
young chefs in Paris.

438
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,049
And what's the great news?

439
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,051
We're all coming back to Le Grand Véfour

440
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,136
on November 8th
for the opening of Zimmer Paris!

441
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,514

[group speaking indistinctly]

445
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,235
[Antoine]
We need that personality element.

446
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,904
<i>Une note de sensualité,
une note d'élégance.</i>

447
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,241
<i>Une note… une petite pincée d'érotisme
et un peu de romance.</i>

448
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,409
I'm thinking, uh, cashmere wood,

449
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,036
blooming jasmine,

450
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,415
exotic orchids
could be exquisitely romantic.

451
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,044
Oh, of course, for your hotel,
you'd want something a bit more<i> coquin.</i>

452
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,879
<i>- Coquin?</i>
- Naughty.

453
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,964
[Randy] Hmm.

454
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,508
And lucky for you,
that's Antoine's specialty.

455
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,637
I just think there's something so romantic
about a signature scent in a hotel chain.

456
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,222
You know, like a perfect marriage.

457
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,224
Let's call it an affair.
Much more romantic.

458
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,141
Exactly.

459
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,977
That's why people go to hotels.

460
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,561
[Antoine] Especially in Paris.

461
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,313
You want your fragrance to remind people

462
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,277
of the beauty
of the moment they spent together.

463
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,943
And that they can revisit
again and again and again.

464
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,404
[sighs] Yeah, well, fragrances fade
over time.

465
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,698
Well, one only needs to reapply,

466
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,825
and the passion comes flooding back.

467
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,078
From my point of view, Randy,
the scent of your hotel

468
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,538
becomes an aphrodisiac.

469
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,790
Very interesting proposition.

470
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,126
So many possibilities.

471
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,669

00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,512
Okay, Antoine.

477
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,973
Let's nail down the scent.

478
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,183
I'll have my attorneys
contact you tomorrow.

479
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,267
[Antoine] Fantastic.

480
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,522
Well, I guess that means
you're staying at Savoir, huh?

481
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,524
Of course, Sylvie.
I would never leave you.

482
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,860

It may not be Le Grand Véfour, but…

00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,547
Oh, I'd rather go where no one's gone
and let them follow.

491
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,342
You be careful.
We may steal you for the Zimmer.

Well, she has my number.

Yes.

500
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,489
- That… That was amazing.
- That was nothing.

501
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:49,242
No, it was above and beyond.
You made me look great out here.

502
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,328
Well, it's not a hard thing to do.

503
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,412
[Sylvie] Shall we go?

504
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,041
Oh! Thank you for the meal.

00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,631
- I have what?
- You do.

508
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,174
- He really does. Yeah.
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>

509
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,257
Thank you again.

510

<i>- Au revoir.</i>

511
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,094
I'll see you later.

Emily…

513
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,312
I have to say
that you did a good job today.

514
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,650
Look, Sylvie, I want us to win <i>together.</i>

515
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,777
And maybe
some things get lost in translation,

516
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,696
but… just… just know
that I'm finding my way.

517
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,949
We're going for drinks.
You can join us if you want,

518
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,576
but I think you have better things to do.

00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,330
He lives downstairs.
I don't wanna make it complicated.

520
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,583
Oh, sometimes
the best relationships are complicated.

We keep running into each other

I just had dinner with Randy Zimmer.

- Here?
- Yeah, no, the food's fabulous.

534

I know. The chef is my boyfriend.

- Yes. Do you know him?

00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:43,023
Not really… Um, well, he lives
in the apartment right below me,

537
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:47,319
which is right down the street
from the flower market

00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,330
I told you.

542
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,666
Paris seems like a big city,
but it's really just a small town.

[sighs] I'm so happy to see you. Mwah!
