00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,433
Okay, so the chef has a girlfriend,
and guess who it is.

Beautiful and genuinely nice,
which shouldn't be allowed.

Gabriel had told me he had a girlfriend

10
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,365
- I thought you just kissed him.
- I did.

Your English
is as confusing as your French.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,164
- Yeah, I feel stupid. In both languages.
- [laughs] Look, French men are flirts.

13
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,207
Just act normal when you see him.

14
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,792
- But I'm trying not to see him.
- Oh.

15
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,587

It's "doctor."

34

<i>- Faux amis, </i>is that, like, fake friends?
- Yep.

35
