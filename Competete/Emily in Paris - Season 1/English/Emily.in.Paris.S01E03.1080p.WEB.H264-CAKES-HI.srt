518
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,017
But a lot of people don't like it.

519
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,187
Did you send me over here
to increase brand visibility or be liked?

520
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,855
<i>Honey, I think you can do both.</i>

521
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,357
Look, now that you're single,

522
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,609
why don't you go find
some of that French D?

523
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,780
Actually,
I'm on the hunt for one right now.

524
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,924
<i>Donc, là. C'est pas que c'est mauvais,
c'est juste qu'on voit pas,</i>

525
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,262
<i>- si tu veux, donc...
- Ben, je vois pas.</i>

526
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,122
I believe you have an expression:

527
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,415
"Let them eat cake."

528
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,125

529
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,586
[Luc and Julien laughing]

530
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,755
<i>Merci!</i>

531
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,633
Ah. Oh!

532
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,802
- [Julien gasps]
- [Luc] Mm!

533
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,023
["Rouge soleil" playing]

534
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,782
We have a meeting...
for the Renault account.

535
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,201
Exactly five minutes ago.

536
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,286
I'll be right there.

537
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,788
Who's that from?

538
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,290
Nobody. Just a friend.

539
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,834
[Sylvie] Mm-hmm.

540
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,754
[sighs deeply]

541
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,632
[groans]

542
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,181
