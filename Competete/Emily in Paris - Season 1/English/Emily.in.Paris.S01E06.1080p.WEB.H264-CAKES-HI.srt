00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,775
Everybody in Paris flocked to see them.

176
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,111

Most of it.

178
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,074
But did you know that,
for the longest time,

179
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,369
the café across the street,
Les Deux Magots, was the cool place?

180
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:19,081
Hemingway and Picasso,
they used to drink there.

181
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,790
And what happened?

182
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,045
Sartre and de Beauvoir
decided it was too bourgeois,

183
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,172
and they fled to the Café de Flore

184
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,966
'cause it was empty, and suddenly…

185
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,511
Café de Flore was the cool place.

I just wanted to keep talking to you.

If we go upstairs now,
we'll never make it to dinner.

Oh, introduce us to your friend.

Oh, uh, this is Thomas.

Yes, we've heard you. We heard… of you.

Um, Gabriel is, uh, the chef
at a restaurant across the square.

375

Yeah, except tonight,
another chef is gonna cook for us

Yep. Oh! You should join us.

Oh, no,
we wouldn't wanna crash your dinner.

[Emily] Oh, this area is so pretty.
What's it called?

00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,449
[Gabriel] Canal Saint-Martin.

388
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,501
It used to be gritty and authentic.

389
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,503
It is a shame how popular it's gotten.

390
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,672
None of the charm it had before.

Did you both grow up in the city?

394

- No.
- Gabriel's from, um, Normandy.

395
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,392
I grew up on a farm in Brionne.

396
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,939
His whole family raised money
so he could attend cooking school here.

They are so proud of my guy.

398
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,192
Oh, I love that.

399
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,778
Well, the two of you
have something in common.

400
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,196
Neither from Paris.

- [Gabriel] Cigarette, anyone?
- [Thomas] I'd love one, thanks.

405
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:49,294
[chuckles] I'm surprised.
All the chefs I know roll their own.

406
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,507
[chuckles] Well…
Well, now you know one who doesn't.

407
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,135
[Camille] Hmm.

408
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,303
Gabriel, you…
you picked a really great wine.

409
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,764
Oh, thank you.
It's a small organic producer from Rioja.

410
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,767
Gabriel knows his wine inside and out.

411
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,019
Except for champagne.
That is Camille's specialty.

412
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,855
Oh, only because of where I grew up.

413
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,440
My family has a little <i>château</i>
in Champagne.

414

- It's called Domaine de Lalisse.
- Hmm. Domaine de Lalisse?

415
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,002
- [Camille] Mm.
- I've never heard of it.

416
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,947
[Camille] Well, it's, um, small.

417
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,200
But we don't have to talk about that.
That's so boring.

418
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,201
Yeah, I agree.

419
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:25,205
So dull, talking about wine.
It's like conversation about the weather.

420
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,749
Far more interesting to drink it. No?

that he's jealous that I'm with you.

it was for <i>Boléro,</i> a masterpiece.

Uh, <i>Swan Lake </i>is for tourists.

482

Hmm. Clever,

you missed the point of what I was saying.

Okay. Well,
I would like to find Pierre Caudault

so maybe you can endure it until then.

00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,219
Because my friends
and I were obsessed with <i>Gossip Girl.</i>

513
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:17,891
We all wanted to be Serena van der Woodsen
in her gorgeous, crazy-expensive couture.

514
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,207
But the only thing we could afford
from any of those designers

515
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:25,065
was a clip-on bag charm
from a outlet mall in Winnetka.

516
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,942
[chuckles] So… yeah.

517
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,945
I guess that made us pretty <i>ringarde.</i>

518
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,906
Mm-hmm. I'm calling security.

519
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,158
You think <i>ringardes</i>
don't respect designers.

520
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,662
We worship designers so much

521
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,958
that we spend all we've saved
on a dumb accessory

522
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,460
just to feel
like we're somehow on your runway.

523
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,671
You may mock us…

524
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,298
but the truth is…

525
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,050
[chuckles] …you need us.

526
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,680
Without basic bitches like me,
you wouldn't be fashionable.

527
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,433
[sighs] I can't believe it was Dan.

528
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,853
- What?
<i>- Gossip Girl.</i>

529
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,231
We watched the entire series
to find out…

530
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,358
it's Dan.

531
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,402
- [chuckles]
- [usher] <i>Mademoiselle, </i>sorry.

532
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,153
This box is only for VIP guests.

533
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,658
It's fine. I don't belong here anyway.

534
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,123
[music swells, fades]

535
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,501
[lively rock music plays]

536
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,304
You did go
to the ballet last night, didn't you?

537
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,055
I, uh…

538
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,891
I just got a call
from Pierre Cadault's office.

539
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,061
- I'm so sorry.
- He wants to meet.

540
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,440
He insisted Gossip Girl be there.

541
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,525
I can only assume that's you. [chuckles]

542
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,529
- Oh. Well, that's… that's good, right?
- [Sylvie] Mm.

543
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,991
I don't know how it happened.
I don't want to know.

544
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,493
But I need you to be…

545
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,537
[sighs, clicks tongue] …less.

546
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,374
How about you do you,
and I'll do me? [chuckles]

547
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,127
And how about a one-way ticket
back to Chicago?

548
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,672
- ["Espiègle" playing]
- Less. Got it.

549
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,715
A lot less.

550
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,511
[mouthing silently]

551
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,607
[music swells]

552
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,613
[theme music playing]
