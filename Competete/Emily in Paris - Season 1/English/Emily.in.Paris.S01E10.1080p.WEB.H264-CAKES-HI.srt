Uh, why are we just finding out
about this?

173
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,465
- He just told me.
- I don't believe it. I mean, I'm shocked.

174
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,385
Not more shocked than you, obviously.

175
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,221
- You must be <i>très</i> shocked.
- I'm actually really pissed off.

176
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,391
Ah, me too! For you, I mean, it…

177
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,851
[splutters] What is he thinking?

178
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,270
I don't know.

179
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,522
Either he expects me
to move across the country

180
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:28,818
and leave my whole life behind,
or this is his way of breaking up with me.

I'm just gonna go
to my parents' house and, um…

I need to think about all this, you know?

186
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,583
I understand.

187
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,169
And I'm here
if you need anything. [chuckles softly]

188
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,963
- I know.
- [Emily] Yeah.

189
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,425
[Camille] I know. Thank you, Emily.

190

So were you ever gonna tell me?

196

Or just leave me a note?

197
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,200
"Hey, going to Normandy.
Have a nice life."

198
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,119
The deal came together quickly.

199
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,079
And you never discussed it with Camille?

200
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,957
She was always going to say no
to Normandy,

201
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,001
or to anywhere
after I declined her mother's loan.

202
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,338
But, you know, I grew up there,
and it's a great opportunity.

203
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,300
I always dreamed
of a restaurant in Paris, but...

204
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,777
Sometimes your dream
is somewhere you didn't expect it to be.

205
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,636
I get it.

I thought Chicago was it for me,

207
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:43,142
and now here I am, saying goodbye
to one of my first friends in Paris.

208
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,187
I just can't imagine this city
without you living downstairs.

209
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,565
And without your omelets.

210
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,568
I'm really gonna miss your omelets.

211
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,488

I am excited for you. [sighs]

- You have a picture of the new place?
- Of course.

214
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,788
It's next to a restaurant
with two Michelin stars

215
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,955
that is very popular.

216
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,542
Too popular, so I thought,
whenever people can't get in...

217
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,962
- They come to the place next door.
- "The place next door."

- Wait, this is gonna be so much fun.

341
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,569
- [knocking on door]
- Oh, you know, um, can I...

342
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,738
- I'm just gonna change in there.
- [Emily] Okay.

343
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,864
Can I just claim a drawer?

344
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,824
There… There's just one drawer. [chuckles]

345
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,285
Cute!

346
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,496
- [knocking on door]
- Uh, okay.

348
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,833
- [sighs]
- Hey.

349
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,046
- Hi.
- Um, I brought you a going-away present.

350
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,390
I think
I'm supposed to get you one of those.

351
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,050
Oh, uh, right.

352
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,970
Well, I thought
you might like to have this.

353
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,349
Really? [chuckles] Thank you.

354
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,602
And also, if you're not doing anything
tomorrow night,

355
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,979
it's my last night at the restaurant.

356
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,231
[chuckles] Tomorrow?

357
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,025
Wh... Why so soon?

358
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,194
You know, why wait to start my new life?

359
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,239
And you and Camille…?

360
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,954
We want different things right now.
And, uh… we need to be free to do them.

361
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,704
What does that mean?

362
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,250
Well, she's not coming to Normandy,

363
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:51,463
and I'm not staying in Paris,
so we will just go our own ways.

364
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,758
- In America, that's called a breakup.
- [Gabriel] Yeah.

365
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,426
We… We call it that here too.

366
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,428
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,808
It's okay. It's just, uh… life.

368
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,727
All right. [sighs]

369
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,312
Um…

370
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,566
Thank you for the pan.

371
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,818

- [Emily sighs]
- And he's single?

378
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,669
You heard all that from the bathroom?

379
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,754
These walls are made of straw
and horsehair.

380
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,298
It'd be harder not to listen.

381
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,632
What happened?

382
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,467
He's buying a restaurant in Normandy,

383
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,053
and Camille doesn't wanna move,
so he's going alone.

384
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,137
That's it?

385
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,725
Em, you've been mooning over each other
since you got here. You have to...

386
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,226
I have a lot of work tonight, okay?

387
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:48,979

Never.

00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,644
Not exactly. I… I love Paris.

476
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,063
And I love this restaurant.

477
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,982
Actually, the owner wants to sell, but…

478
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,775
[sighs] …it's too expensive.

My girlfriend…

481

- But it was too…
<i>- Compliqué?</i>

00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,042
My wife's family invested
in my business when I began, so…

485
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,835
I understand.

486
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,376

for me in Paris, anyway.

[Emily] Pierre decided to call it a night?

492
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,033
Of course not.

493
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,326
I just put him in a car,

494
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,829
and he is going to crash
a Grey Space event at Caviar Kaspia.

495
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,833
- I told him we'd meet him there.
