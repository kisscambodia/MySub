Oh, no.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
She knows, right?

9
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,097
[sighs] Knows what, though?
I mean, what did you really do?

10
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,284
- I kissed him twice.
- [Mindy] First one doesn't count.

11
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,143
Well, the second one
more than made up for it.

12
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,395
- So don't do it again?
- It's not that easy.

13
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,565
Every time we're in the same room,
it's all we can think about.

14
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,335
It's like a fog sets in with him,
and neither of us can see straight.

15
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,737
You can't punish people
for their thoughts.

16
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,198
I'm from China. We've tried.

17
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,868
I think I should just move.
I feel so guilty. I like Camille so much.

18
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,871
If she knows, she probably just wants
to get it out in the open.

19
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,791
Just go to lunch and maybe avoid anywhere
with steak knives.

20
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,417
- What?
- [Mindy] Sushi's safe.

21
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,585
Or anywhere that's Asian.

22
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,837
Although if she's mad,
a chopstick can puncture skin.

23
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,840
- Don't ask how I know that.
- Can we hang this weekend?

24
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,717
- I need to not be home.
- [Mindy] Ugh.

25
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,470
My friend Li
and her five bridesmaids are in town.

26
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,764
- Wedding dress shopping.
- That sounds fun.

27
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:38,723
Yeah, um…

28
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,809
Wait, why won't a weekend
with your friends be fun?

29
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,812
They're always fun,
but their heads would explode

30
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,062
if they knew I was a nanny.

31
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,815
They're your friends.
I'm sure they'll understand.

32
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,901
Maybe you should just tell them.

33
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,530
Maybe you should just tell Camille
you're obsessed with her boyfriend. Sorry.

34
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,115
We're going clubbing tonight.

35
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,658
- Please come.
- [cell phone chimes]

36
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,660
I need a witness to my fake life.

37
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,207
[sighs] Well, text me details for tonight.
I have to plan lunch with my executioner.

[tense instrumental music plays]

39
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:12,090
[takes a deep breath] I have
something a bit awkward to ask you.

40
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,887
- I talked to Gabriel about it.
- Oh, well, what did he say?

41
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,267
- He said I shouldn't bring it up.
- Well then, maybe you shouldn't.

42
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,020
Well, I need you to be honest.

43
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:31,276
Okay. Uh, just say
whatever it is that you need to.

44
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:36,156
[clears throat]
Would Savoir be interested in taking on

45
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,324
my family's champagne house as a client?

46
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,286
I know we're probably smaller
than your usual clients, but...

47
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,412
Oh, my God!

48
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,582
[splutters] Yes! Of course!

49
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:50,295
Yes! So, my brother and I finally got
<i>Maman </i>to meet with a firm.

50
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,339
But it's her family's company,
so she's so protective.

51
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,676
- But since we're friends…
- [chuckling] We are. We are.

52
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,887
We… We're… We're totally friends.

53
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,639
So come to the château
with me this weekend.

54
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,851
I'd love her to meet you
and hear any ideas you have.

55
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,228
Otherwise,
I will have to drive down all alone.

56
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,397
Oh. Gabriel's not coming with you?

57
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,857
No, he has to work.

58
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,066
And also, he's still upset

59
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,152
that I asked <i>Maman</i>
for the loan of his restaurant.

60
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,362
I… I thought that he didn't want you to.

61
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,115
He never wants help,
especially when he needs it.

62
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,200
He's stubborn.

63
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,536
I mean, I… I do get it.
He wants to build something of his own.

64
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,165
Just don't let me talk
about him all weekend.

65
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,460
- [Emily chuckles softly]
- To the château. You will come, yes?

66
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,047
Okay, yeah. I… I…
I can pitch it to Savoir this afternoon.

67
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,007
- Fantastic!
- [both chuckle]

68
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,302
- ["Oiseau La Fontaine" playing]
<i>- Santé. </i>[laughs]

69
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,349
[Sylvie] Never heard of them.

70
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,393
Can they afford us?
What was their revenue last year?

71
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,353
I'm not sure.

72
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,605
The market is very saturated.

73
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,483
- What's the brand identity?
- [sighs] I… I don't know.

74
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,277
[scoffs] Do you know anything about them?

75
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,737
My friend's parents own it,

76
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,620
and she asked me
to consider them as a client.

77
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,658
How are you friends
with a champagne heiress?

78
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,701
She's dating my friend, my neighbor.

79
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,704
Oh, the one you went home with
from the Fourtier party.

80
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,248
I didn't go home with him.

81
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,611
The chef from the Zimmer dinner.

82
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,669
- Ah, Emily's boyfriend, no?
- Nah, she just has a crush on him.

83
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,355
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

84
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,131
So now you're going home
with his girlfriend to meet her family?

85
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,759
I'm just meeting with a potential client.

86
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,010
[in French] Bullshit.

87
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,263
[in English]
I can tell her Savoir isn't interested.

88
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,466
You'll let your sex life
determine business decisions?

89
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,766
We never had sex!

90
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,561
Well, maybe, you should. You're so tense.

- Ooh, your friends are wild!

98
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,372
Maybe too wild.
Here, you should drink some more water.

Oh, God. Oh, my God.

102
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,170
Oh, Shay. Okay, okay.

103
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,507
Well, I guess you'll get to know Shay
a little bit more later.

104
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,883
But this is Li.

105
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,136
I cannot believe
you came all the way to Paris.

106
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:07,140
Well, you wouldn't come to Shanghai,
so we've had to bring Shanghai to you.

107
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,808
Em, this is Li, the bride.

108
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,103
The bride and her best friend.

109
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,354
Oh, Li.

110
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,815
- [Emily and Mindy] Li.
- [Emily] Li.

111
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,817
Right. Oh, no,
she's told me so much about you.

112
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,486
Too much, in fact. I feel like I know you.

113
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,280
That's so nice to hear.

114
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,032
You know what she hasn't told me?

115
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,951
- Anything about her life in Paris.
- [Mindy chuckles]

116
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,661
Okay, yeah.

117
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,865
- [Li] Yeah.
- [group cheers]

118
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,166
- Oh! Um, are we getting more champagne?
- We are!

119
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,002
- Excuse me!
- [group cheering and laughing]

120
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,921
I will serve.

Wait, we don't get to drink it?

- That's so expensive.
- Relax, they'll buy more.

124

[Li] Drink, bitch!

125

[group laughing]

126
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,476
[Emily] I overpacked.

127
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,439
I've only been to one winery in Wisconsin,
and it had a paintball course.

128
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,693
I wasn't sure about the dress code.
I wanted to look professional but casual.

129
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,030
You're not going on a business trip.
You're coming home with a girlfriend.

130
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,823
We can all squeeze in front.

131
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,907
"We all"?

132
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,452
Oh! Uh… [chuckles]

133
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,204
Gabriel's coming. Yay.

134
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,457
- He finally got a weekend off.
- Hi. Haven't seen you in a while.

135
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,335
[sighs] Squeeze in. It will be tight,

136
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,545
but it's only for a few hours.

137
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,632
- Um…
- Uh, you…

138
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,300
- Yeah, okay. Okay.
- [mutters]

[Emily chuckles]

141
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,267
- [engine revs]
- ["Le Zou" playing]

142
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,352
Everybody okay?

143
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,146
- I'm fine.
- Totally great.

144
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,565
My butt's asleep,
and I can't feel anything.

145
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,038
[Emily] <i>So what else should I know?</i>

146
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,290
Why didn't your mom like the other firms?

147
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,750
- [grunts]
- She hates outsiders.

148
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,502
That's not true.

149
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,003
She's going to love you.

150
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,296
And so is my brother.

151
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,965
What are you doing?

152
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,967
Ignore him.

153
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,261
My brother's finishing business school.

154
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,222
<i>Maman</i> wants us
to take over the vineyard one day.

155
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,851
He might join us this weekend.
I think you will like him.

156
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,602
Oh, yeah, did you get<i> Maman's </i>approval?

157
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,021
- Will she allow it?
- She tried to fund your restaurant.

158
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,482
<i>You </i>wouldn't allow it,
so be nice to her this weekend.

159
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,402
They adore him, Emily. You will see.

160
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,070
Oh, yeah. You will see.

- [mother] <i>Bien, et toi?</i>

164
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,748
- [Camille] <i>Oui. Ça va.</i>
- [in English] Hello!

165
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,459
- So you must be Emily?
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

166
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,253
- Thank you so much for having me.
- Yes. <i>Ça va, Gabriel?</i>

167
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,588

- Bon.</i>

168
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,316
[in French] I didn't go to the market.
Too much to do. So you'll go.

169
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,633
<i>Allez, viens chérie.</i>

170
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,551
Of course.

171
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,510
[Camille chuckles]

172
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,387
[mother clicks tongue, mutters]

173
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,557
[in English]
Oh, the château is so beautiful!

174
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,558
I'd love a tour.

175
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,311
[chuckles]
We don't give tours of the château.

176
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,394
We live here.

177
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,198
[in French] It's an American custom
to show off your home to visitors.

178
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,192
Really? Does she want to see our bins too?

179
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,275
[Camille chuckles]

180
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,862
[in English] If you'd like
a vineyard tour, there's one in 30.

181
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,447
Just follow the road signs.

182
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,925
[in French] I want
to show you something in the office.

183
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,328
[in English] Did I just catch <i>"bureau"?</i>
Does your mother wanna talk business now?

184
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,371
Oh, no, we have
all weekend for that. Don't worry.

185
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,416
Um, show her around. Maybe the pool?

186
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,501
Yeah.

187
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,587
Come on. I'll take you.

188
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,670
Oh, I can find it.

189
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,299
[accordion music playing]

190
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,472
- [gasps]
<i>- Bonjour.</i> [chuckles]

191
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,182
[chuckles, in French] You must be Emily.

192
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,684
[in English] Oh, my God. Um… hi.

193
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,770
I forgot you don't speak French. Uh…

194
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,313
My name is Gérard.

195
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,023
[in French] The champagne father.

196
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,942
<i>Le champère. </i>[laughs]

197
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,777
- [chuckles]
- [Gérard, in English] You see?

198
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,196
Because in French,<i> "père" </i>means...

199
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,781
Father! Yep, I got it.

200
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,449
Uh, I remember that one.

201
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,578
- May I offer you a glass?
- No! No, uh, I… I mean, no, <i>merci.</i>

202
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,539
Um, I'm just looking for my room.

203
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
Oh, okay! Of course!

204
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,127
- I'm gonna show you.
- I'll just give you a minute. Okay?

205
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,380
- [whimpers]
- [playful instrumental music plays]

206
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,550
- [groans]
- So did you meet Gérard?

207
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,677
Yeah. Thanks for the heads-up.

208
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,011
Gabriel!

209
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,888
- Gérard!
- [Gérard] <i>Bienvenue.</i>

210
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,265
Can I get you a glass?

211
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,268
Maybe when I return.
Louise is sending us to the market.

212
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,563
You are seducing us with another
of your delicious meals, eh?

213
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,357
[exclaims, chuckles]

214
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,485
Emily,
have you tasted this man's <i>coq au vin?</i>

215
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,320
I definitely have not.

216
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,616
I tell you, when it hit my lips,
I was ready to propose to him.

217
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,702
Um, we should get going to the market.

218
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,080
Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.
Do as my wife says. She's in charge.

219
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,415
Take the bikes!

220
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,544
It's a beautiful day for a ride. [sighs]

221
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,379
- Great.
- Great.

222
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,506
[Emily chuckles]

223
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,383
[birds singing]

224
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,013
I think I'm gonna go on the tour.

225
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,807
- Sample some product.
- There's plenty of champagne in the house.

226
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,267
We can have a glass before we go.

227
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,230
I want the full experience.
I came here to work.

228
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,520
You're not coming with me?

229
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,690
On a romantic bike ride
to a picturesque country market?

230
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,067
Great idea.
Why don't we just do it in the barn?

231
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,862
They don't have a barn here.
The wine cellar is pretty nice, though.

232
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,905
I'm joking.

233
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,032
I'm not laughing.

234
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,410
You've been avoiding me for a week,
and now this. It's just a farmers market.

235
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,330
You think we cannot keep
our hands off each other for an hour?

236
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,498
I like the odds
when my hands are somewhere else.

237
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,584
I think you're overreacting.
We can be friends.

238
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,128
I feel we've made it pretty clear
we can't just be friends.

239
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,651
- But we live on top of each other.
- You're proving my point.

240
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,008
So what? We just stop speaking?
What do we tell Camille?

241
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,761
We don't tell Camille anything.
We just have to be friendly.

242
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,137
- But not friends?
- Yes.

243
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,820
Can you make me a list of rules?
'Cause it's a little complicated.

244
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,475
Okay, fine. I'll make it easy.

245
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,685
You go to the market, I'll go on the tour,

246
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,569
and everybody
keeps their hands to themselves.

247
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,147
[sighs]

248
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,444
["Yéyé St-Tropez" playing]

[man] <i>…and that brings us
to the subtler step</i>

250
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,388
<i>in the whole process, </i>le remuage.

251
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,099
Each bottle is turned
a tiny bit each day, like this,

252
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,851
to collect,
in the neck, the dead yeast cells.

253
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,897
A professional <i>remueur</i>
can handle tens of thousands of bottles

254
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
in a single day.

255
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,609
It is a delicate and precise skill.

256
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,276
Who wants to try?

257
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,155
<i>Mademoiselle, </i>how about you?

258
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,950
What? Me? No. No, no, no,<i> merci.</i>

259
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,702
[in French]
And an American, too. Perfect.

260
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,954
[in English] Come.
Don't worry, I won't embarrass you

261
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,163
in front of the British.

262
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,332
[laughs] Just kidding.
Everybody take a rack, please.

263
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,169
So we'll make a game,
and the first one to turn all the bottles

264
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,504
one-quarter turn wins.

265
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,088
Are you ready?

266
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,883
- Ready, set, go!

268
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,606
- Done! [sighs]
- Ah! Congratulations, American.

269
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,775
You just won the first taste.

270
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,861
Everybody will have one, of course.

271
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,697
And…
[in French] …to the Queen of <i>Remueurs!</i>

272
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,699
[Emily] <i>A la reine des remueurs!</i>

You're just supposed to taste it, dear.

274
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,539
- Oh, whoops. [laughs]
- [guide] No, it's okay.

275
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,750
We'll continue
to the tasting room, please.

276
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,836
This way.

277
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,421
- [guide laughs]
- Sorry.

278
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,047
No, you paid for the tour.

279
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,884
Actually, I didn't.
My friend's family owns the place.

280
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,303
- Oh, you're my sister's friend?
- Emily.

281
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,430
You're Camille's brother.

282
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,390
<i>- Ouais. </i>I am Timothée.
- [Emily chuckles]

283
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,601
So you're gonna run all this one day?

284
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,977
Maybe someday, yes.

285
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,646
I've been working weekends here
since I finished<i> collège.</i>

286
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,774
Looks like it's gonna be in good hands.

287
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,067
Not fast hands, but...

288
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,319
[chuckles] Okay, I see.

289
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,737
Oh, please, have more.

290
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,540
You know, the bottle costs
just the same whether you drink it or not.

291
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,034
And if you'd like a refill at any time,

292
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,119
just tap me on the shoulder.

293
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,377
<i>Et voilà.</i>
It was a good day at the market.

294
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,173
- [group] Ooh.
- Wow. It looks spectacular, <i>mon amour.</i>

295
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,134
Emily, you must taste his aubergine.

296
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,761
"Aubergine"?

297
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,262
Uh, my eggplant.

298
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,933
Oh, um, I'm allergic,
so probably best not.

299
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,435
Beautiful job, Gabriel.

300
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,354
Oh, thank you. <i>Bon appétit,</i> everyone.

301
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,773
- [Louise] Mm!
- [Emily] Mm!

302
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,692
Wow! This… This chicken is...

303
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,695
I told you. His <i>coq</i> is the best.

304
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,948
It… It really is delicious.

305
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,534
Mm! It's so juicy.

306
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,744
Well,
since you didn't get to try my eggplant,

307
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,830
at least you're enjoying my <i>coq.</i>

308
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,332
Oh, I'm gonna have some more champagne.

309
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,792
[in French] Gérard, serve her.

310
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,460
[in English] I can pour it. It's fine.

311
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,547
Women are not supposed
to touch the bottle at the dinner table.

312
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,841
I know, it's silly…

313
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,928
and it's old-fashioned,
but so is my mother.

314
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,765
Just tap my foot
under the table when you'd like a refill.

315
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,535
- How was the tour, dear?
- [Timothée] Fine.

316
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,727
We went through
more product than usual, though.

317
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,229
The guests were very thirsty today.

318
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,857
Louise, your champagne is so special.

319
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,984
I'm glad I got to really appreciate it.

320
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,862
- Good.
- Yes, she certainly appreciated it.

321
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,865
The point is
that I have some marketing strategies

322
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,575
that I would love to discuss.

323
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,744
[chuckles] The other thing we don't do
at the dinner table is talk business.

324
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,746
<i>Maman</i> has so many rules.

325
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,998
Oh, rules are good.

326
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,249
I like rules.

327
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,959
They force us to behave.

328
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,296
To rules!

329
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,341
Sure. Yeah. To rules.

330
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,636
[all] To rules.

331
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,764
- Gabriel, dinner is amazing.
- [Louise] Agreed.

332
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,684
He really should have
his own restaurant, shouldn't he?

333
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,687
<i>- Maman.</i>
- Well, that's, uh, the goal, someday.

334
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,856
Of course. Just not with our help.

Camille told me
that she wanted me to meet her brother.

509
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,328
And… And he was such an expert

510
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,913
about champagne.

511
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,077
Stop talking, please.
I don't care about any of that.

512
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,625
I need to know,

513
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,587
is my son a good lover?

514
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,215
I worry for my children's future.

515
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,508
It's a mother's job.

516
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,719
And my little boy...

517
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,138
Oh, my God.
Please tell me this wasn't his first time.

518
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,973
Oh, dear, did it seem that way?

519
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,684
What? No. No, no, no.

520
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,853
He was gentle and… and sweet.

521
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,062
Wait. [chuckles]

522
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,441
I'm sorry, um…
How much detail are you looking for here?

523
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,194
His father
finally passed down something helpful.

524
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,322
[sighs] My husband is a fantastic lover,

525
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,491
but beyond that, he is as useless

526
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,242
as this surplus of grapes.

527
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,577
Thank you, Emily.

528
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,079
I will call you a car
to the train station.

529
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,375
I imagine you wanna run away
from this bomb you exploded.

530
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,587
- [phone dialing]
- Uh, hold on.

531
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,632
I came down here to pitch you Savoir,

532
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,383
and you've dodged me all weekend.

533
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,510
Okay.

534
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,849
- You know about the surplus.
- [Emily] Mm-hmm.

535
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,809
We need to find new buyers

536
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,521
or else pour it all
down the drain. [sighs]

537
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,022
How do we do that?

538
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,987
- [friends cheering on cell phone]
- That's how.

539
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,115
A bottle to sip and a bottle to spray.

540
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,285
You make the same amount
whether or not they drink it, yes?

541
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,703
We could make your brand

542
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,455
the official spray of Paris.

543
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,166
Or anywhere, really.

544
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,920
I can hear my grandmother
rising from her grave to strangle me.

545
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,713
[Emily] Um, you're worried about legacy.

546
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,549
Understood. That's your job.

547
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,177
How about we create
a second label for the spray campaign?

548
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,429
But what to call something so useless?

549
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,766
What about "Champère"?

550
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,935
[chuckles]

551
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,897
I'll consider it.

552

["Une Evasion" playing]

553
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,495
<i>Maman </i>said
she was really impressed

554
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,955
with your presentation.

555
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,207
Oh, the whole family was impressed.

556
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,749
[Emily groans]

557
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,712
Camille, I'm so embarrassed.

558
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:29,921
Don't be.

559
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,300
I knew we'd get you
into the family one way or another.

560
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,176
I just didn't know it would be so quick.

561
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,554
I promise,
now that we're working together...

562
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,016
No, Emily, it's really fine.
I can't control who you get into bed with.

563
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,185
- Is this gonna be weird?
- No, we're all adults.

564
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,853
Except for Timothée.

565
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,189
- [laughs]
- Oh, grow up!

566
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,609
But I'm already
far too old for your tastes.

567
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,735
[Emily grunts]
