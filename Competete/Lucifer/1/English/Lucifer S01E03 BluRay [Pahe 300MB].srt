I have a certain skill set.

92
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:41,764
they forget to enjoy it.

93
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:44,058

Yeah.
I...

98
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,571
I want to skip my morning
workout sometimes.

99
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,865
Boring.
Just chill on the couch

100
00:03:59,073 --> 00:03:59,908

101
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:01,034
This is the fantasy life

103
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,954
Come on, Ty, there must
be something deeper.

104
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,581
I, um...

105
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,416
Yeah.

106
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,585

107
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,712
And there it is.

108
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:16,090
You got no idea how hard it is
holding out for marriage, man.

109
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,926
Uncomfortably hard, I'm sure.

110
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,596
Look, I was going to

111
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:23,264

112
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:24,265
Oh...

113
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:25,266
I thought she was gonna be

114
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,976
the mother of my children.

115
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,603
Well, <i>she</i> wants to be

Come on, Ty,
it's the fourth quarter,

117
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,815
but you can still
win this game.

118
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,901
I mean, look at her:
death and taxes

119
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,152
are less of a sure thing.

120
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:37,445
No, I can't.

121
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:38,780
But you desire her.

122
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,281
Why fight it?

123
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,076
Because my mother
taught me that...

124
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,119
Oh, no, don't-don't bring her
into this; that's disgusting.

125
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:48,122
Uh... it's about you.

He performed at a rap battle

144
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,789
Every single part of that

No, monkey, I'm sure
he's just stuck in traffic.

167
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,407
Are you doing
homework?

168
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:47,742
Um, sort of.

169
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,410
What's the assignment?

170
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,749
Uh, well, I saw Lucifer do
some things I can't explain.

171
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,459
Is Lucifer a magician?

172
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,252
That's sort of what
I'm trying to figure out.

173
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,588
When Daddy gets here,
maybe he can help.

174
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,006
Mm.

175
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:03,883
Sometimes Daddy helps me
with my homework.

176
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,219
I'm not sure if Daddy has
the answers to these questions.

177
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,554
Why don't you
just ask Lucifer?

178
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,599
Because if he's a magician, then
he won't reveal his secrets.

179
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:14,602
So I have to find out
on my own how Lucifer does...

180
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:17,605
these things that I can't...

181
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:19,941
explain.

182
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,776
Oh, that can't be him.

183
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:24,612
Decker.

184
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:27,240
Lucifer, how did you
even get this number?

185
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,953
<i>Excuse the mess,</i>

186
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,956
but it's so good of you
to come, Detective Decker.

187
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:38,960
Thanks for being super-cryptic
in a really unhelpful way.

188
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,878
What's the emergency?

189
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,672
Well, it's-it's better to
show than tell, really.

190
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:51,639
I...

191
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:06,070
Petechial
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

192
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,405
Contusions
on the neck.

193
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,115
Signs of strangulation.

194
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,868
And one of the victim's
fake nails was ripped off.

195
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,202
Signs of struggle.

196
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,912
We got a murder
on our hands.

197
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:17,290
Thanks.

198
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,460
<i>So what happened?</i>

199
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,795
Um, well, I woke up early,
'cause my head hurt.

200
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:23,796
I, uh...

201
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,798
I had a hangover.

202
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,467
I... I've never
drank before, so...

203
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:30,094
That's on me. Sorry.

204
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:31,846
Yeah, so I came down
to get some water,

205
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,347
and that's-that's
when I saw her in the pool.

206
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:34,432
Did you know her?

207
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,975
Not before last night.

208
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:37,643
I talked to her for
a little bit.

209
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,645
Her name
was, uh...

210
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,522
Ali, maybe?

211
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:43,900
I don't know. I mean, I'm having
a hard time remembering.

212
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,154
You think she
accidentally slipped,

213
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,655
fell in the pool
and drowned?

214
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,157
No, I think she was murdered.

215
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,159
Oh, my God, that's...
that's terrible.

216
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,912
So why didn't you call
the police right away?

217
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,580
Well, I told Lucifer.

218
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,123
He said... he said that
he would call the police.

219
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:00,583
And I did.

220
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,001
Detective Decker's
a homicide detective.

221
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,711
She's been very helpful

222
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:06,672
in the other murders
that I've encountered.

223
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:09,509
I am not your personal
police concierge.

224
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,177
You are gonna find out
who did this, aren't you?

225
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,472
Of course I am,
because that's my job.

226
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,806
- Right.
- Not because
you want me to.

227
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,475
Right.

228
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,143
First things last:
Do you have any idea

229
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:20,937
who had contact
with her last night?

230
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,940
Um, no, uh, no, but they asked
me to get the... the guest list.

231
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,568
Oh, geez.

232
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:28,903
250 guests.

233
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:29,904
You know what
that means.

234
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,155
Great party.

235
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:35,159
250 suspects.

236
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:38,579
Oh. Uh, I'd be careful
with that thing

237
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:40,122
in the guest bedroom.

238
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:41,332
There's a good chance
you'll go blind.

239
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,042
Unspeakable acts.

240
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:45,127
Yes, we got a little
carried away.

241
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:47,588
Stop interfering.

242
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:48,923
I'm helping.

243
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,633
You forget that
my expertise

244
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:51,884
is finding the right people
to punish, Detective.

245
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:52,885
It's what I do.

246
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:54,720
Or, uh, did, at least.

247
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,389
You want to do something?

248
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,349
Then help account for everyone
who was at the party.

249
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:00,017
- Oh.
- Coroner puts
the time of death

250
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:01,352
between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.

251
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:02,979
Actually, is there someone

252
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,522
who can vouch for your
whereabouts at the time?

253
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,440
Several someones, in fact.

254
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:07,858
Yes.

255
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,652
Get them to tell you
every little detail

256
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,362
just to make sure
that I'm not lying.

257
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:14,574
I'll have someone else
handle that.

258
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,743
So... a bona fide killer on the
loose that needs to be punished.

259
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:18,744
Time to punch in.

260
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,580
There she is.

261
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,915
Do you know anyone here?

262
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,917
No. Sorry.

263
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:26,919
I mean, people just
show up to these things.

264
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,462
Did anyone look suspicious?

265
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,590
Where do
we start, Detective?

266
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,216
I mean, look at those
big strong hands.

267
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:33,759
Perfect for squeezing
the life out of someone.

268
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,429
Oh, ginger lad.

269
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,763
Soulless bastards.

270
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,432
Give even me the creeps.

271
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,766
I...

272
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,268
You need to sit
with the witnesses.

273
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,770
<i>Haven't I proven myself</i>

274
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,522
extremely useful at detectiving?

275
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:49,191
Actually, no, I don't need
your help color-commentating.

276
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,943
I need facts
and hard evidence.

277
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,571
So unless you can help
me with either, stay.

278
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,282
But I don't want to be stuck
out here with these miscreants.

279
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,783
These are your people.

280
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,785
Detective!

281
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:06,751
This won't do at all.

282
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:15,468
Hey.

283
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:16,886
I heard all hands on deck.

284
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,638
I came as quick as I could.

285
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,014
Yeah, and on time.

286
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,601
Look, Chloe,
I'm sorry about earlier, okay?

287
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,144
I got held up at an arrest
in Hollywood.

288
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:26,312
I couldn't get away.

289
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,438
I get it, Dan.

290
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:28,648
Save the apologies for Trixie.

291
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,191
This is work,
and right now,

292
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,068
we have a victim
with no fingerprints on file.

293
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,612
These all the unclaimed items
from the party?

294
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,489
Yeah, I checked everything.

295
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,949
Unfortunately, no I.D.
that matches our victim.

296
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:40,326
So, what are you thinking?

297
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,454
Well, I'm thinking our victim

298
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:45,706
wore a cute red dress.

299
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:48,459
There's no way she'd have
that pink clutch.

300
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:50,086
She was out to have fun,

301
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,338
so that nixes anything big
and bulky, like a tote.

302
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,423
I don't know.

303
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,258
I'm looking for
something small,

304
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:57,468
a little sexy...

305
00:11:57,677 --> 00:11:59,303
classy.

306
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:02,014
Something like this.

307
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:03,599
Wait a minute,
I-I thought you said

308
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:04,892
all this stuff was
searched already for I.D.

309
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:06,018
I'm not looking for an I.D.

310
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,395
I'm looking for a car.

311
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,192
Ali Thornton, 23,
from Boise, Idaho.

312
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,610
Her info matches
the registration

313
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:15,778
we found in the glove box.

314
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,029
Hmm.

315
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,572
She was a long
way from home.

316
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,659
What were you doing here, Ali?

317
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,495
I'll see what I can
find on her.

318
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:25,705
Detectives,

319
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,039
found something
in the master bedroom.

320
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,463
Found this here in the bed.

321
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:37,425
And it matches the missing
fingernail of the victim.

322
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,428
Isn't this Ty's bedroom?

323
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:45,683
Yeah, looks like they did
a lot more than talk.

324
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,235
What the hell are you doing?

325
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:58,738
Well, since you banished me
outside with the lepers,

326
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,906
I decided to make myself useful.

327
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,701
You call watching porn
on your phone useful?

328
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,411
This isn't my phone, Detective.

329
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,246
I think it's
our recently departed's.

330
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,377
Where did you get this?

331
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:15,212
Just heard a ringy-ding
and followed the noise.

332
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:16,797
- Now, is delete
the little rubbish bin--?
- No.

333
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,966
You can't delete
anything on this phone.

334
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,593
But it shows
Ty and Ali having sex.

335
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,052
It's very distracting.

336
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:23,387
Wait.

337
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:24,680
Ooh, you've reached
the money shot?

338
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,515
Are you taping this?

339
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,394
I don't know.

340
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,396
Over there,
we had a drink.

341
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:34,482
And I didn't know
the girl that well.

342
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,486
Where are you going?

343
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,988
Detective!

344
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,115
Hey!

345
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,785
- What's going on?
- Detective, you're
making a mistake.

346
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:46,911
Stay out of this, Lucifer.

347
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,662
Cuff him.

348
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,414
- Wait, what?
- Ty Huntley,
you're under arrest

349
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:51,624
for the murder
of Ali Thornton.

350
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,250
This is ridiculous.
Lucifer,

351
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,002
this is all your fault.
I wish I'd never met you.

352
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,434
Trust me, Detective.

353
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:11,769
I have been doing
this a long time.

354
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,145
I know evil.

355
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:14,688
You've arrested the wrong man.

356
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,273
The person responsible
is still out there.

357
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,775
How are you so sure?

358
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,485
What desire would Ty have
to kill a girl

359
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,237
giving him a
wonderful time?

360
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,239
Ty had a squeaky-clean image.

361
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,449
He sleeps with a girl.

362
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:27,034
Then he finds out
she's taping him.

363
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,869
She's gonna ruin everything.

364
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:30,246
He gets angry
and loses control.

365
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:31,705
You saw the video.

366
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:32,957
The only thing that
that video proves

367
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,124
is that Ty had sex.

368
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,252
He was horny, not murderous.

369
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,586
Then why would he lie about it?

370
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,171
Blame the tequila.

371
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,465
He had motive and opportunity.

372
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:43,634
Look, I just want to make sure

373
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:45,261
that you're punishing
the right person.

374
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,470
I will.

375
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,596
That's what I do.

376
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:49,098
Lovely, we want the same thing.

377
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,266
And there's
something else on the phone

378
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:51,517
that you should look into--

379
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,102
No more porn.
I'm good.

380
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,645
No, it's not that.
We should look into it--

381
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:56,981
"We," as in the LAPD,
will look into it.

382
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,440
You can go now.

383
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,168
Line up some shots, Maze.

384
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,797
Oh, hell, I may
just take a bottle.

385
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,340
Thank you.

386
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,803
That was the LAPD.

387
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:31,056
Ah, was Detective Decker
calling to apologize?

388
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,350
Unless it involves lingerie,
I don't accept.

389
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,685
Financial Investigations Unit.

390
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:36,353
Hmm?

391
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,856
Apparently, you destroyed
the honeymoon suite

392
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,233
at the Budget Hut
in Tarzana last night.

393
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,360
I'd rather return
to the fires of Hell

394
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,237
than spend a night in Tarzana.

395
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,239
And then, someone
with your name and credit card

396
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,200
skipped out on a $2,000 tab

397
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,244
at Zany Wings.

398
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:55,831
Do I look like
I'd eat a Zany Wing?

399
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,249
Someone is

400
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,168
clearly masquerading as me!

401
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,544
Rap battles
and hot wings?

402
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:02,546
You need to find
this cheap knockoff

403
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:04,214
and make him suffer--
do you understand?

404
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,175
Why?
You said it yourself--

405
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,177
humans are fascinating, right?

406
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,598
I can't wait to see
what this one does next.

407
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,727
Zany Wings.

408
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:20,064
♪ You got me dead to rights. ♪

409
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:21,523
It's not right!

410
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,568
I mean, Budget Huts
and Zany Wings?!

411
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,153
I mean,
this malfeasant reprobate

412
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,238
is diluting the Lucifer brand!

413
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,408
Finally, I get my father's beef
with graven images.

414
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:34,745
Sounds like this guy's
really gotten under your skin.

415
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:36,914
Typical in a town
full of charlatans.

416
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,499
Eh, this is a place

417
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,501
built on lies
where nothing is authentic

418
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:41,877
or genuine.

419
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,712
You don't even
have to be famous

420
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,798
to get a star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?

421
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,758
You can just buy one!

422
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,593
Are we still talking
about the impostor?

423
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:52,888
Yes. I'm gonna tear him
limb from limb.

424
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:55,015
Uh... is it possible

425
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:56,809
you might be overreacting a bit?

426
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,688
No! How would you feel
if some off-the-rack impostor

427
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,232
was dragging <i>your</i> name
through the trenches of Encino?

428
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,485
Well, someone stole my identity
a few years back.

429
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,445
And after a
few long calls

430
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,657
to the IRS and the bank,
everything was fine.

431
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,325
No big deal.

432
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,827
"No big deal."

433
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,495
That's because you're you.

434
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,122
I'm me!

435
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,832
And this is a-a travesty!

436
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,792
But your reaction,

437
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:23,877
your anger toward this

438
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,879
minor inconvenience,

439
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,132
feels a little...

440
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,341
disproportionate
to the crime.

441
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,676
Wha...?

442
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,594
There might be
some displacement.

443
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,513
I'll show you displacement
when I displace his bollocks,

444
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:37,349
and throw them on the floor
and stamp on them one at a time!

445
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,476
Uh, um...

446
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,145
Why don't you tell me again

447
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:42,813
about this case
you were working on?

448
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,067
Well...

449
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,402
nothing more to say.

450
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,487
A girl was killed

451
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,781
and Detective Decker
is going after the wrong person.

452
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,117
And that doesn't bother you?
Well, why should it?

453
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,119
Well, because from everything
you've told me,

454
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,372
it sounds like Ty probably had
nothing to do with this murder.

455
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,166
That he got himself into--

456
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:05,044
or someone helped him into--

457
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,545
a bad situation.

458
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:08,005
And that bothers you.

459
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,339
Yes.

460
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:10,674
Why?

461
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:13,552
Because I punish the guilty.

462
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,888
And Ty's not guilty.

463
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,067
♪ Oh, oh, yeah, yeah ♪

464
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,318
♪ Oh, oh... ♪

465
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,111
Detective Chloe
Decker, LAPD.

466
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,489
I'm here to see Ty Huntley's
agent, Joe Hanson.

467
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:34,490
I'm sorry,
without an appointment--

468
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,493
Let me get this
right-- your clients

469
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,203
do all the work, yet you
chaps make all the money?

470
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,330
Really?
And they call me the Devil!

471
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,041
If I ever return to Hell,

472
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,085
you kids will be
my first call.

473
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,961
Especially you.

474
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,755
Oh, one last thing
before I go.

475
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,548
Which of you is into killing
attractive redheads?

476
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,926
Lucifer?

477
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,219
Detective!

478
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,180
A word?

479
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,890
Oh?

480
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:01,517
♪...back to the way I was. ♪

481
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,477
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

482
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,938
Finding, then punishing
Ali Thornton's actual killer.

483
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,731
How did you know
to come to this agency?

484
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,483
I tried to tell you, Detective.

485
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:10,901
On the dead girl's phone.
She called here--

486
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,528
Here and traded calls
with Ty's agency

487
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:13,904
a few hours before
she was killed.

488
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:15,155
I know, I checked
her phone records.

489
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,573
And you're welcome.

490
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:18,117
I also found out
that the call

491
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,827
was transferred
to Ty's agent, Joe Hanson.

492
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,537
Right, so why did the dead girl
even know Ty's agent?

493
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,038
I mean, she was
Ty's one night stand.

494
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,706
It hardly makes sense.

495
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,083
Well, that's what
I'm here to find out.

496
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,417
And that's
why you can go now.

497
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:31,088
What's so funny?

498
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,422
Well, the fact that
you think I'm gonna go.

499
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:33,715
It's hilarious actually.

500
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,219
Lucifer, I don't need your help.

501
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,138
Look, I'm not trying
to solve this for <i>you.</i>

502
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,473
I'm ensuring that the right
person is held responsible.

503
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,435
Look, come on, I've been helpful
before, haven't I, Detective?

504
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,980
You step out of line one time--

505
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,606
You can give me a right-good
spanking, I promise.

506
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,234
Come on, let's go.

507
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,236
<i>Ty wouldn't do
something like this.</i>

508
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,988
He's such a good kid.

509
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,322
I'm actually more curious
about you, Mr. Hanson.

510
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,740
Me?

511
00:19:58,949 --> 00:19:59,825
Why? I didn't even
go to the party.

512
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,743
I had to work.

513
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,787
You spoke to the victim a
few hours before she was killed.

514
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:07,499
Maybe it's best if I don't say
anything without my attorney.

515
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,042
Joey! Joe, Joe.

516
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,460
There's no need for that.

517
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,421
Why don't you

518
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,464
tell me what you
really want, hmm?

519
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:18,302
What desires drive
a man such as yourself?

520
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,808
I want to be
the greatest agent of all time.

521
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,560
Really?

522
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:27,769
And to do that,

523
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,814
I need to protect my clients.

524
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,482
Come on.

525
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:35,986
And, uh...

526
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:38,447
If you want to protect Ty,
tell us what you know.

527
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,038
Let's make a deal.

528
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,540
I'll tell you everything.
You look into something.

529
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:49,958
Here's a deal.

530
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,668
Tell us everything,
and I don't

531
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:52,669
cuff you in front of your
co-workers and take you in.

532
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,254
I know how this goes.

533
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,298
Ali's a young actress
looking for a break.

534
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,800
An agent promises
to help her out, in exchange,

535
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,969
she's treated like a party
favor to your star clients.

536
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,721
Okay, okay.

537
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,349
I did call Ali.

538
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,476
I hired her to have sex with Ty.

539
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,186
Wow, seems I wasn't
the only one

540
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,688
who wanted the young virgin
to loosen up.

541
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,565
No, I loved the virgin angle.

542
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,901
It's a clean hook,
got him a lot of attention.

543
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:20,239
But Ty was a mess.

544
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,698
I needed him

545
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,867
to get over his ex.

546
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:24,993
Why?

547
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,705
Geez.

548
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,500
Popular boy, this Ty--
isn't he?

549
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,378
So what, did this anger
his ex or something?

550
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,839
No, it's <i>from</i> his ex,

551
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,883
Debra Macall.
She left this behind

552
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,426
one of the many
times she came here

553
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,303
trying to find him.

554
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,097
She used to call all the time
trying to get a hold of him.

555
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,515
So, he dated a crazy fan?

556
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,558
He didn't know it
at the beginning.

557
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,894
So when I figured it out,
he had already fallen for her.

558
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,230
Oh, suppose I can
understand why.

559
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,400
See, after a while,
Debra got possessive,

560
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,776
controlling--

561
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,361
she thought
she was managing him.

562
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,238
So I told Ty he needed
to break up with her.

563
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,906
He refused.

564
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,575
I made Ty file
a restraining order

565
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,077
after she broke a girl's nose

566
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:08,453
just for buying him a mojito.

567
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:10,038
Quite a hair trigger
on this Debra,

568
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:12,082
- by the sounds of it.
- Hmm.

569
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,501
If Debra found out

570
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,545
that Ty was with
that poor girl...

571
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,388
Hmm. Finally, some rain.

572
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,390
Maybe someone up there
is looking out for us.

573
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,017
I can assure you,

574
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,269
He's in no way
meteorologically inclined.

575
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:33,603
Apart from
the whole Noah thing,

576
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:35,647
and that was a one-off.

577
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,653
Anyhow, her roommate confirmed

578
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,280
that she took
the 4:00 p.m. class, so...

579
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,490
Ty's ex should be
out any second now.

580
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,534
I told you
you had the wrong man.

581
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:49,202
Wrong gender as well,
apparently.

582
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,038
Finally, we're getting warmer.

583
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,582
Why are you so hell-bent
on proving Ty's not the killer?

584
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,750
Like I've been saying,

585
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,418
I want to punish
the real killer.

586
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,295
But why?

587
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,047
Is it 'cause you pushed him
towards Ali at the party?

588
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:02,257
Well, I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

589
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,759
And I think you're starting
to agree with me.

590
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,427
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, would you?

591
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:06,762
- Bye!
- Bye!

592
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,805
There she is.

593
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:13,643
That was great.
I'll call you at lunch.

594
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,479
- I'm over here.
- Debra Macall?

595
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,147
I'm Detective Decker, LAPD.

596
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,024
We need to ask you a few
questions about Ty Huntley.

597
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,650
I've got nothing to say.

598
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,152
It's either here
or down at the station.

599
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,779
- Leave me alone!
- Debra...

600
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,622
See?

601
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,123
Warmer.

602
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:46,760
Found this on
the undercarriage.

603
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,303
Remote detonator.

604
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:50,931
Whoever set off
this bomb was nearby.

605
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,724
Scour the security cameras
in the area.

606
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,185
Get facial I.D.'s on anyone
in a hundred-block radius.

607
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,772
You couldn't live with yourself
for committing murder,

608
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,190
so you set your car
to explode, didn't you?

609
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,025
Eh? Wanted to go out
in a blaze of glory.

610
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:03,276
Of course not!

611
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,529
Murder? What are
you talking about?

612
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:06,863
Oh, come on...

613
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,615
The bomb was triggered remotely.

614
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,534
Whoever set it off did it
before you got to the car.

615
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:11,952
There's a clear
line of sight.

616
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,537
I don't think the plan
was to kill you.

617
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,497
I think they wanted
to scare you.

618
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,749
So... you know of any reason why
someone would want to do that?

619
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,127
No.

620
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:21,503
Yes, why did you run, Debra?

621
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:22,921
Awfully guilty-looking.

622
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,632
I thought you were
going to bust me

623
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:26,675
for violating
my restraining order.

624
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,428
I went to Ty's party last night.

625
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,888
I-I just...
I just looked.

626
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,181
From outside,
through the window.

627
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,766
I couldn't help it, I miss him.

628
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,935
Yes, breaking up's
so hard, isn't it?

629
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,603
You're like two
pathetic peas in a pod.

630
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,355
Okay, we are made
for each other.

631
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:41,898
As good as he is at football,

632
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,942
that's how good I am
at being his girlfriend.

633
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,569
You mean ex-girlfriend.

634
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,612
We never stay broken up.
It's just a phase.

635
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,532
And no one looks out
for him the way that I do.

636
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,452
And then I saw him
kissing that girl and I...

637
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,578
Squeezed the life out of her?

638
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:55,912
No!

639
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,206
Where were you between

640
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,249
1:00 and 3:00 a.m.
this morning?

641
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,920
The only place that
always makes me feel better.

642
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,718
How long
does this go on?

643
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:10,927
Three hours.

644
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:14,598
That's the saddest thing
I've ever seen.

645
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,184
Yep. All-night froyo shop

646
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,394
puts Debra there well past
the time of the victim's death.

647
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:20,812
Her alibi checks out.

648
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,274
So Debra didn't strangle Ali.

649
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,276
Well, whoever
planted the bomb

650
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,445
went to great lengths
to make us think Debra did it.

651
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:29,863
Why?

652
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:30,906
I don't know.

653
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:38,288
We might actually know
who rigged the car.

654
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:41,917
Ronnie Hillman.

655
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:45,295
The big Hollywood fixer?

656
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:46,379
Yeah.

657
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:47,839
A security cam
caught her

658
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:49,132
walking nearby,
right after the explosion.

659
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:50,550
This can't be a coincidence.

660
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,177
Someone must've
hired her for this.

661
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,262
I've been trying to build a case
on her for years,

662
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:55,597
and every time
we've approached her,

663
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,516
she's lawyered up immediately.

664
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:58,850
Ronnie is a pro.

665
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,185
So how do we approach her?

666
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,311
She's picky about
talking to strangers.

667
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,813
Definitely no cops.

668
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:09,819
What about someone

669
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:12,280
she'd never expect us
to work with?

670
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,282
<i>Do I get a code word?</i>

671
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,159
You know, for when
you take her down.

672
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,036
If so,
might I suggest

673
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,371
"monkey bottoms"?

674
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,747
'Cause trust me, I can work that

675
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:21,873
into any sentence
quite naturally.

676
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,833
You sure this
is a good idea?

677
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,627
Lucifer reached out to her

678
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:27,796
and she agreed to meet him,
so it's our best shot.

679
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,131
And you won't need a code word,
and you won't be miked,

680
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,508
because she'll be
looking for that.

681
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:32,926
This is a simple handoff.

682
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,594
All we need you to do
is vouch for Dan

683
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,012
as someone
that needs her services.

684
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,722
Vouch for Detective Douche?

685
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,684
Oh, gosh, this is gonna
be harder than I thought.

686
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:41,935
Once I engage with her,
I will hire her

687
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,061
to fix a problem
of mine.

688
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,521
Right.

689
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,481
Well, if it's
that stick up your ass,

690
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,774
I'm afraid there's no one
strong enough to pull that out.

691
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:49,276
She goes there
to fix my problem,

692
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:50,944
our people will be waiting
to arrest her.

693
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,487
Ah.
And then we'll
have leverage

694
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:53,947
to find out what she knows
about Ali's murder.

695
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,198
She has information we need,

696
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,866
so let's just stick to the plan.

697
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,410
Assuming, of course,
Ronnie hasn't run off

698
00:26:58,618 --> 00:26:59,828
because our sting
suddenly turned into

699
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,037
a Michael Bublé concert.

700
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:03,915
Lucifer,
this isn't a game.

701
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,167
- Oh.
- Now, are you
up for this or not?

702
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:09,879
Am I up for encouraging someone
to commit a nefarious act?

703
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,548
Mm, let me think.

704
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,508
Put me in, Coach.

Oh...

721
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,559
Mm, you checking for a wire

722
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:05,602
or are you just pleased
to see me?

723
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,105
Little bit of both.

724
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:10,315
Mmm!

725
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,983
Hello, Mr. Morningstar.

726
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,569
Rest assured...

727
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,321
I can help you
with your problem.

728
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,948
Well, actually,
I don't need your help.

729
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,617
I...

730
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,744
Wait, what do you think
my problem is?

731
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,621
Impostor running around
ruining your name.

732
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,832
Your professional reputation
has taken a bit of a dive.

733
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:32,837
As has your sexual one,
I'm afraid.

734
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:34,964
All those
unsatisfied ladies...

735
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:36,841
Word gets around.

736
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,845
That is the reason
you reached out to me, isn't it?

737
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,434
Yes.

738
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,103
Yes, it very much is.

739
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:49,979
I do have a problem
that could use your help.

740
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:51,690
I am all yours.

741
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,775
Oh! Well, I like you,
monkey bottoms.

742
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:55,819
Here's what I need you to do...

743
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,404
♪... doing what I'm told...♪

744
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,155
Lucifer, what are you doing?

745
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:01,825
Hey, Dan, what's going on?

746
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,161
I don't know.

747
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,871
They're still talking.

748
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,876
And now she's leaving.

749
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:15,880
Lovely.

750
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,175
What the hell did you do?

751
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:22,345
I hired the fixer to fix
a problem, like you wanted.

752
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:23,805
You let her go.
What happened to the plan?

753
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,724
- I made a better one.
- How?

754
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,058
Just sit tight

755
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,393
and we'll all get what we want.

756
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:40,655
Finally!

757
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,450
The would-be Prince of Darkness.

758
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:45,201
Payment due
upon delivery.

759
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,997
I'd like to examine
the goods first.

760
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,039
Your dime.

761
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,212
Right.

762
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:58,590
Let's see the face
of my impostor.

763
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,890
The resemblance
is uncanny.

764
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:13,229
It most certainly is not.

765
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,566
How could anyone think
that you were me?

766
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:18,234
You know
who you're messing with?

767
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,237
I'm Lucifer
freaking Morningstar!

768
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,906
Oh...

769
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:24,365
Are you now?

770
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:27,076
Well... you've certainly
been a busy bee,

771
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,078
haven't you, "Lucifer"?

772
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:30,455
Eh?

773
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,415
Apparently, you've started
a modeling agency,

774
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,251
pitched a Web series.

775
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:37,796
And I hear
you've also been

776
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,923
very active with the women.

777
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:41,090
Ladies love me.

778
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,343
What can I say?

779
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,386
It's what <i>they've</i> been saying
that's the trouble.

780
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:48,264
It seems you're a bit
of a two-pump chump.

781
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,350
Also, a crier afterwards.

782
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,810
That happened one time.

783
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:54,395
Right. Well, we can't
have you running around

784
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,940
cheapening the Lucifer brand,
now, can we?

785
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,274
What do you say, Maze?

786
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,276
Impalement?

787
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:01,569
Hmm...

788
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:04,239
Why rush?

789
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,157
- I say the rack.
- Oh.

790
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,659
- Oh!
- Ooh.

791
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,160
That way,

792
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,912
we can really enjoy it.

793
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,831
Better.
Yes, much better.

794
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,124
Every joint of every limb

795
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,126
dislocated before it's torn off.

796
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,963
No, no, no, no, no-- look, look,
look, I just... I just...

797
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:22,340
I just wanted to get chicks
and-and free drinks.

798
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,092
Um, really.

799
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,262
My name is Justin.

800
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,263
I'm from Sherman Oaks.

801
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:31,474
Oh, Justin...

802
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,434
the things I'm gonna do to you.

803
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:34,811
Oh, no, no, no,
I-I'm sorry!

804
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:36,020
I only came here one time

805
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,897
and I just told some girls

806
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:39,357
that I owned the place, and...

807
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,859
and that opened
some doors for me

808
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,193
and so I just
started rolling with it.

809
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,946
How dare you abscond <i>my</i> name!

810
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,656
Please, don't hurt me.

811
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,074
Please.

812
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,450
I'm not gonna hurt you,

813
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,661
Justin,
I'm going to destroy you.

814
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,038
Oh, this is so hot.

815
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:56,666
It's like you're
punishing yourself.

816
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:05,341
Seems I could be just, um,

817
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,885
overreacting a bit.

818
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,141
Go.

819
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:14,392
Go on!

820
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,812
And never sully my name again.

821
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,651
Let's at least take a finger.

822
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,028
We've done enough, Maze.

823
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:33,786
Pleasure doing business
with you, Lucifer.

824
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:35,788
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

825
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,790
Which is why I'm going to have
to apologize for my friends.

826
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,000
What friends?

827
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,752
Ronnie Hillman,

828
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,086
you're under arrest
for kidnapping and assault.

829
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,843
Would you mind
calling my lawyer?

830
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,803
Her number's in
my back pocket.

831
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:52,472
Yeah, sure thing.

832
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,890
I'll tell her
about the kidnapping,

833
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,558
the airtight evidence we have,

834
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,518
the attempted murder
on Debra Macall,

835
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,729
and then when we connect you
to Ali Thornton's murder,

836
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:01,064
maybe you'll get
a nice injection of drugs,

837
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:03,066
and you can go to sleep forever.

838
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:07,362
Hang on-- I had nothing
to do with Ali's murder.

839
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,366
Debra Macall, Ty Huntley's ex,
she's the murderer.

840
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:13,326
I cared about Ali.

841
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,286
Mm-hmm, here's what I think.

842
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,497
I think you tried to scare Debra
into confessing to Ali's murder,

843
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:18,831
but Debra didn't do it.

844
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,500
She's got an ironclad alibi.

845
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,505
This is my fault.

846
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:27,507
Why?

847
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:31,177
I promised Ali
I would protect her.

848
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,846
All she ever wanted
was to be an actress.

849
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,515
She was gonna leave her mark.

850
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:36,849
But you know how that goes.

851
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:40,269
Endless rejection,
she ran out of money.

852
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:43,272
This was her first gig with me.

853
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:45,274
She didn't even know
if she could do it.

854
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:49,612
But I told her... I told her
it was just like acting.

855
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:52,949
Besides, who doesn't want
to sleep with Ty Huntley?

856
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,618
I thought Ty's agent hired
Ali to sleep with him.

857
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:58,913
He hired me for a number
three special: blackmail.

858
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:01,916
Slip him a roofie, get naked,
whip out a selfie stick,

859
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,251
and voilà.

860
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,919
Why would
he have any desire

861
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,587
to blackmail his
own star client,

862
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,131
a client he's all
about protecting?

863
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,092
Ty's agent told you
that Debra killed Ali.

864
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,761
He did, yeah.

865
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:25,148
You think Joe's the killer,

866
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:28,067
that he took things into
his own hands, quite literally.

867
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:29,569
We don't have any proof.

868
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:32,572
Right, well, how do you
propose that we get him?

869
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:35,742
Joe pointed the finger
right at Debra,

870
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,493
painted her as crazy.

871
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,328
It's not that hard a picture
to paint, in her case.

872
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:41,330
Why was he so certain
she'd make a good suspect?

873
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:44,459
Maybe he found out
she went to Ty's party.

874
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,669
Maybe he <i>knew</i> she
went to Ty's party.

875
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:03,561
You are looking
at the future of football.

876
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,730
The American Dream.

877
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:09,984
Honest, resilient, heroic.

878
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:12,320
The police tried to pin

879
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:16,407
the death of that
poor girl on you.

880
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:19,202
But we kept it
out of the press.

881
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,497
We got you out of jail.

882
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:24,582
We will always
protect you...

883
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,543
and make you a bigger
star than ever.

884
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:30,379
This is
Ty Huntley...

885
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:32,799
rebranded.

886
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:39,430
Rebranded, eh?

887
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,099
Does it come
with a new scent?

888
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:42,266
Free toy inside?

889
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:44,185
What do you want?

890
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,687
Ty is free on bail.

891
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,856
We have to talk to Ty
down at the station again,

892
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:50,608
maybe walk him
past a few reporters.

893
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,068
Whoa, hold on, uh,
Joe, what is this?

894
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:53,778
Oh, come on!
This is ridiculous.

895
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:56,072
Ty wouldn't
hurt anybody!

896
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,406
What about Debra?

897
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:58,699
I told you to look into her.

898
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:00,284
She's the crazy one.

899
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:01,953
Yes, well, I thought
it was her all along.

900
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,871
I mean, the woman certainly
redefines "intensity."

901
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,457
But Debra was home with a friend
the night of the murder.

902
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:07,625
What?!

903
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,377
She's lying.

904
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:10,628
There's no evidence
placing her at the party.

905
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:11,963
No one saw her.

906
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,298
So are you ready
to face the cameras?

907
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:15,967
His sponsors will love
the free publicity.

908
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,719
Tell me, what's
ten percent of nothing?

909
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,388
I saw Debra there.

910
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:24,267
I went by the party.

911
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:29,730
But a work call came up,
and I never made it inside.

912
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:31,649
I didn't say anything before

913
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:34,402
because I told my wife
I was working late.

914
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:38,573
When I was driving away,
I saw Debra outside Ty's window.

915
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:41,159
So you admit you were
there that night.

916
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,828
Yeah, and so was Debra.

917
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,163
That's the proof
you need, right?

918
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:46,789
That's
the proof we need.

919
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:48,916
We have a sworn statement
from Ronnie Hillman

920
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,418
saying that you hired the victim

921
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,420
to make a sex tape with
Ty to blackmail him.

922
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:54,088
I just needed to place
you at the scene.

923
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,798
Yeah, see,
that's why I don't lie.

924
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,633
It's so hard to keep track
of who knows what.

925
00:36:57,842 --> 00:36:59,510
It's not true.

926
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,013
I only want what's
best for you, Ty.

927
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,639
You know, I still
don't understand.

928
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:05,516
Why is it my own agent
would want to blackmail me?

929
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,852
Because he thought eventually
you were gonna leave him.

930
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,729
What, because I took one meeting
with another agency?

931
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,190
Joe...

932
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:13,691
I only did that
to make Debra happy.

933
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,026
But even though
you'd broken up,

934
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,527
he knew you'd get
back together,

935
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:19,113
so he decided to strike first,
get some leverage.

936
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:22,533
If he left me,
I would be ruined.

937
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:24,202
I mean,
do you understand?

938
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,037
He is my Brady, my Manning.

939
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,372
But Ali wasn't cut out
for this sort of thing, was she?

940
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:29,790
She didn't want
to give you the video.

941
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,334
Stupid bitch.

942
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:36,005
She said she realized
Ty was a good guy.

943
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:37,632
She didn't want to go
through with it.

944
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,635
Her name was Ali Thornton,
and you killed her.

945
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:41,886
For what?

946
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,055
Greed? Ego?

947
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,389
I didn't want to hurt her.

948
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:47,892
I just wanted her phone. And...

949
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:56,234
But I squeezed too hard.

950
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:59,028
I'm done.

951
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:01,113
Forget this.
I'm out of here.

952
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:09,997
Did I squeeze too hard?

953
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,918
How did you...?

954
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,253
What did...?

955
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:17,255
Lucifer, what are you doing?

956
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,423
Finally focusing my
anger where it belongs.

957
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:20,508
Lucifer...

958
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:29,642
Yes, of course.

959
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,435
Your turn, Detective.

960
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:43,197
I still can't believe
Joe did this.

961
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:46,742
I wasn't ever gonna
leave him, you know that?

962
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:48,411
Definitely gonna leave him now.

963
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,079
But you know what,
you, uh...

964
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:51,914
you stayed good
to your word, Lucifer.

965
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:53,124
Thank you.

966
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:56,002
Yes, well, now you owe me one.

967
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,923
Ty!

968
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:02,591
Ty! Ty!

969
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:05,845
Oh, my baby.

970
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,138
Oh, my God, I'm
so glad to see you.

971
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,432
- Oh.
- You are?

972
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,975
Yes, you are
crazy, baby.

973
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,977
- But you're my crazy,
you hear me?
- Yeah?

974
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:17,148
Warms the cockles,
doesn't it?

975
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,276
So, Detective,

976
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:21,986
looks like you've
solved another case

977
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:22,987
because of me.

978
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,780
I solved this case despite you.

979
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,782
What? What about the
cell phone I found?

980
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:28,117
That was key evidence.

981
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:29,785
Evidence you
almost destroyed.

982
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:32,288
I got you the leverage
you needed to crack Ronnie.

983
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,582
You co-opted a sting operation
for your own gain.

984
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,834
And I solved another crime.

985
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:39,295
Identity theft.

986
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:42,298
Come on, admit it--
we solved this one together.

987
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:44,759
Or are <i>you</i> too egotistical
to acknowledge <i>my</i> help?

988
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:49,347
Okay, yeah, you didn't
completely destroy the case.

989
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,682
So you can stop blaming
yourself, great.

990
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:53,017
Whatever do you mean?

991
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:57,313
The whole reason you tried
to prove Ty's innocence?

992
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,231
Was to catch the true culprit.

993
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:02,860
Yeah, sure.

994
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:09,116
<i>So I decided
not to punish myself.</i>

995
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,785
Yourself?

996
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:13,120
Well, my fake self.

997
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,455
The person
I'd kidnapped.

998
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:16,791
I decided not
to beat him up.

999
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:19,210
You were right,
I was, um...

1000
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:20,878
What's the word?

1001
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:22,546
Displacing?

1002
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:25,549
...displacing my anger
and frustration on Luci-phony,

1003
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:28,636
because the right person wasn't
being punished for Ali's death.

1004
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,638
And who was the right person?

1005
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:33,307
Well, the sleazy
agent, of course.

1006
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:35,643
Ah, yeah.

1007
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:38,896
Of all the cities in
the world, Lucifer,

1008
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:41,524
why did you decide
to come to Los Angeles?

1009
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:43,526
Well, the same reason
as everyone else.

1010
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:45,277
Uh, the weather,
porn stars,

1011
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:47,071
Mexican food-- mm!

1012
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,781
Mmm.

1013
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,574
You know, you say... you
say people are phony here,

1014
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:54,578
but I think people come here
to reinvent themselves.

1015
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:56,580
And I think that's
why you're here.

1016
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,582
To reinvent yourself.

1017
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,085
Why would I mess
with perfection?

1018
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:05,256
You like working with
the detective, don't you?

1019
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:09,927
I told you, I'm good
at punishing people--

1020
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:12,680
nay, I'm the best
at punishing bad people.

1021
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:15,015
I didn't enjoy it when
my father forced me to,

1022
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:17,017
but now that it's
on my own terms,

1023
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:19,019
it's downright delightful.

1024
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:21,021
Yeah, well, I think
you don't just enjoy

1025
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,023
punishing the bad guys.

1026
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:25,025
I think you're starting
to like seeking justice

1027
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:27,069
for the good ones.

1028
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:31,449
Like Ali.

1029
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:36,370
It's another reason
to hate L.A.--

1030
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:38,038
all this self-
indulgent therapy.

1031
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:39,248
You should be ashamed.

1032
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:40,583
You're doing it again.

1033
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:41,709
What?

1034
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,377
Displacing.

1035
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:45,379
No, I'm not.

1036
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:46,881
And that's denial.

1037
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:49,133
That's a river in Africa.

1038
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:02,980

1039
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:06,484
