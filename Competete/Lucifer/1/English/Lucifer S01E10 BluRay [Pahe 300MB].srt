00:00:02,963 --> 00:00:05,632
- So how do you afford
this place?
- It's my mother's.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,342
Your mother's Penelope Decker,

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,552
queen of '80s
cheeseball sci-fi?

5
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,388
You have to introduce me.

6
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:13,098
So you're the doctor.

7
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:15,183
You're just
as Lucifer described.

8
00:00:15,392 --> 00:00:16,935
I like you.

00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,979
<i>Are we gonna talk
about what happened?</i>

10
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:19,980
Our kiss.

11
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:21,231
It's kind of a big deal.

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,774
Chloe, I have a lot
on my mind.

13
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:24,359
<i>What do you want

Are we done?

17
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,155
Not by a long shot.

18
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:32,158
<i>Enjoying the life I gave you?</i>

19
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:35,078

Lucifer Morningstar.

22
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,588
♪ Ah, ah, ah... ♪

23
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,852
You know, there's only one way
to pick the perfect strawberry.

24
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:02,147
Are you talking to me?

25
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:04,983
Yes, of course.
Why not?

26
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,777
Uh, most people think
it's just about the outside.

27
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,363
You know, the, uh,
shape and the color.

28
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:11,990
But they're
just like us.

29
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,827
Sneaky little devils,
hiding tasty secrets inside.

30
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:18,747
It's never the ones you expect.

31
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:20,123
But there's no way
of finding out

32
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,791
what deliciousness
is underneath

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,836
without giving it
a little taste.

34
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:30,300
Mmm.

35
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,594
Mmm.

36
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:33,553
You like that?

37
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:35,889
Oh... God!

38
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,557
Really?

39
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,017
You have to bring him up now?

40
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,019
I mean, we were
having a moment.

41
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,687
- Uh...
- Lucifer.

42
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:45,023
The hell are you doing?

43
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,649
Pardon me.

44
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:49,986
Right,
so what have we got?

45
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,322
Well, this is an
interesting one.

46
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,324
Our victim's
a 60-year-old male.

47
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,326
Collapsed
in broad daylight.

48
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,661
No obvious injuries,
no sign of struggle.

49
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,914
And the interesting part is?

50
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,040
This.

51
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,627
Based on the bloodshot eyes
and the closed throat,

52
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,670
looks like this guy
was poisoned.

53
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,589
No, no, no, no, no,
this is horrific.

54
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:11,424
Dead bodies don't
usually affect you.

55
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,802
You know who this is?
This is Chef Javier.

56
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,178
Javier Arias, yeah.

57
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,639
Owner of Sol De Javier.
Did you know him?

58
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:19,140
Well, only by his work.
I mean, this chap was, uh...

59
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,975
an artist in the kitchen.

60
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:23,937
He made the most exquisite
Mexican cuisine I've ever had.

61
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:24,938
And now...

62
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,524
It's okay.

63
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:29,692
I'll never taste
his perfect tamales again.

64
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,569
So this isn't about the man,
this is about your stomach.

65
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,239
This is about a crime
against good taste, Detective.

66
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:36,199
Well, someone definitely needs
to be punished for this.

67
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,076
According to the grocers,
he came here every morning

68
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,286
after having breakfast
at his restaurant.

69
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:41,955
M.E. says that
the poisoning happened

70
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,498
about 90 minutes
before he fell,

71
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,208
which puts him squarely
at the restaurant.

72
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,876
Well, you can't think
his own staff poisoned him.

73
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:48,962
I mean, the man was a visionary.

74
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,880
With a hell of a temper,
by all accounts.

75
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,298
Everyone at the
restaurant's a suspect.

76
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:53,925
We need to interview
all of his employees

77
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,468
and do a full sweep for toxins.

78
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:58,930
And find out whether
he wrote down his recipes.

79
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,812
You smell that?

80
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,482
It's the last of Chef Javier's
brilliance gone forever.

81
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,819
I wonder if police recovered any
leftovers from his last meal.

82
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,279
Well, it was most
likely poisoned.

83
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,114
Ah, well, it's well
worth the risk.

84
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,575
Hi. So is this everyone
that works here?

85
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,243
Yeah, that's everybody.

86
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,287
You think one of us killed Pops?

87
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:23,705
"Pops"?

88
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,957
What, are you his daughter
or something?

89
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,626
Uh, no, that's what
we all called him.

90
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,753
We were like a family here.

91
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,423
Well, hold on, so everyone here
saw him as a father figure?

92
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,719
Oh, this is much more
interesting now.

93
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,095
Why is that?

94
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:42,432
Well, my dear detective,
this is patricide.

95
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,434
It's a tale
as old as time.

96
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:45,977
You know, Oedipus,
the Menendez brothers,

97
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:47,228
Voldemort.

98
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,730
Okay.

99
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,106
Yes.

100
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:51,441
I know after what happened
to Father Frank,

101
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,151
you're mad at, um...

102
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,319
You can say it.

103
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:55,945
- ...God.
- My dad.

104
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:57,780
Sure.

105
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:00,325
I just don't want you
projecting onto this case.

106
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,243
There are so many reasons
to commit murder.

107
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:06,623
Don't let your, um, daddy issues
cloud your judgment.

108
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,291
No, no, no, I simply
understand what it's like

109
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,084
to want to escape the clutches
of a difficult father.

110
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,711
That's all.

111
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,880
Lucifer, not everything's
about your parents.

112
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,423
Hey, Detective.

113
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:16,382
Yeah.

114
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,051
Your sister's here
to see you.

115
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,178
Oh, no, no. I don't...
I don't have a sister.

116
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,095
So it can't...

117
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,680
Oh, no.

118
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,516
Hi, sweetie,
guess who's back.

119
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:27,810
Oh, what a pleasant surprise.

120
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:31,272
Detective, you never told me
you had such a radiant sister.

121
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,732
It's 'cause I don't.

122
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:35,193
And who is this handsome devil?

123
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,569
No way.

124
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,571
Mom, this is Lucifer.
Lucifer, Mom.

125
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,573
Sorry, I'm a bit
speechless, I...

126
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,825
Penelope Decker?

127
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:43,910
Well...

128
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:44,911
As I live
and breathe?

129
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,079
The Vampire Queen?

130
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:46,996
Yeah.

131
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:48,873
Wow, are you a real vampire?

132
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:50,208
'Cause you certainly
don't look old enough

133
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,377
to have a daughter this age.

134
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,545
How old are you, Detective?

135
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:57,215
Honey, your new friend
is just delicious.

136
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,341
Oh, stop.

137
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,134
Mom, what are you doing here?

138
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:01,386
Oh, well, you know
how exhausting

139
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,137
those convention circuits
can be.

140
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,014
I just wanted to get home.

141
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:07,850
Mom, I mean here,at my job.

142
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:11,145
Oh, well, you weren't
answering your phone...

143
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,773
- Uh, yep.
- so I called someone
at the department.

144
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:15,566
I can be very persuasive.

145
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,527
Oh, you clever little minx.

146
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:20,488
Besides, it's all
over the news.

147
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:21,823
Poor Javier.

148
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,700
Such a wonderful chef.

149
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,702
A woman of refined taste
as well.

150
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,245
I mean...

151
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,122
What happened to you?

152
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,875
So you think one of these people
might have done it?

153
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,544
Yes, uh...
Mom, can we talk
about this later?

154
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:35,878
Well, sure.

155
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,256
What about
a family dinner tonight?

156
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,757
Family dinner?

157
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,050
That's right, it's been ages.

158
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,261
Age...? We never had...

159
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:46,347
And, Lucifer, you have to come.

160
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:47,890
- No, that's really not necessary.
- I'd love to.

161
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:48,933
Oh, great!

162
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:51,185
Well, then I'll see you both

163
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:53,187
tonight.

164
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,856
I love you, pumpkin.

165
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:56,399
- Love you.
- Ooh!

166
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,443
Mama Decker.

167
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,447
- Okay.
- Mmm.

168
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,074
- Hey.
- Hmm?

169
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,409
Crime scene?

170
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,744
Oh. Yes, of course.

171
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,746
Right, well,
where do we begin?

172
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,205
Well, we know
it was poison,

173
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,623
we know it was here,

174
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:13,958
so we have to go through
anyone and everyone

175
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,293
that could have had their hands

176
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,627
on Javier's last meal.

177
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:18,629
That's chefs,
servers, bussers.

178
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,465
Even the dishwasher
could have done it.

179
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,467
Oh, so many people,

180
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,927
so many reasons
to kill Pops.

181
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,066
I loved him.

182
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:40,068
Pops was like a father to me.

183
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,611
He was such a nice man.

184
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,279
Except when you
made a mistake.

185
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:44,697
That's right.

186
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:47,325
Then he got upset,
and he threw things.

187
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,620
He threw things... a lot.

188
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,622
- Where were you
this morning?
- Here.

189
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,457
I'm always here.

190
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:55,792
Pops worked me to the bone.

191
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,460
A taskmaster, was he?

192
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,921
No matter what you gave him,
it wasn't enough?

193
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,589
It wasn't.

194
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,007
And I gave him a lot.

195
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,180
Ah, to the bone, indeed.

196
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:10,973
Did you have
any altercations with Pops?

197
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:12,934
- Sure.
- All the time.

198
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,395
Nothing I did was
ever good enough for Pops.

199
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:17,271
And it never would be, would it?

200
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,899
Which is why he left you with
no choice but to take matters

201
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:21,651
into your own hands.

202
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,194
He was like a father to me.

203
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:25,029
He was like a father to me...

204
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,697
He was like a father to me.

205
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:30,952
And how was he to everyone else?

206
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,205
Tough, but, ultimately,
he was fair.

207
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:36,124
Uh, he cared about his people.

208
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:37,166
He was...

209
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,334
"Like a father to you."

210
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:39,961
Yes, we've heard
that one before.

211
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,046
He <i>was</i> my father.

212
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,966
This is Javier's son, Junior.

213
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,843
I don't work
here anymore.

214
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,137
I-I've been away a while.

215
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,514
I came over as soon
as I got the call.

216
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,601
I still can't believe
he's gone, man.

217
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,687
Wayward son, are you?

218
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,689
Yeah, you could say that.

219
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,024
You and your father
had a strained relationship?

220
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:05,361
It's... it's complicated.

221
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,030
You know, I feel like
the only thing

222
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,032
that made him happy
was this place.

223
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,286
So let me guess, you tried
to follow in his footsteps?

224
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,871
Yeah, I trained as a chef, yeah.

225
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,707
And Dad was domineering,
acted like a god in the kitchen?

226
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,041
Lucifer.

227
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,877
You have no idea.

228
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,128
Oh, you'd be surprised.

229
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:24,881
I was never gonna live up
to him, so I just, I...

230
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:26,466
Rejected everything
he stood for.

231
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:27,800
Yeah.

232
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,887
I gave up cooking,
I hit the road...

233
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:32,638
Which is why I'm curious
about your return.

234
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:36,809
Was there something that you
wanted to do when you came back?

235
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:39,437
Uh, I don't know, like...

236
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,980
Oh, come now.

237
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:43,774
The prodigal son returns
to his overbearing father.

238
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:46,444
What could you possibly desire?

239
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,448
I wanted...

240
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,782
Yes?

241
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:56,120
...to have one more meal
with my dad.

242
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,628
So you just got
into town last night?

243
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,088
Yeah, I-I met Dad here
for breakfast.

244
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:08,508
Did you notice anything strange
about him or the meal?

245
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:09,634
Anything?

246
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,261
Dad had them bring
out our usual.

247
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,639
We were actually
getting along for once.

248
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,516
Uh, after we
finished eating,

249
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,601
Dad left to do his pickup
at the market.

250
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,478
We were supposed to
meet up later tonight.

251
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,271
Said he had something
he wanted to tell me, but...

252
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,940
So now that Dad's gone,

253
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,775
I'm guessing
the restaurant goes to you?

254
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,236
No, I don't...
I don't deserve this place.

255
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,947
Dad knew that.

256
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:33,866
Well, stay in town.

257
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,034
We may have more
questions for you.

258
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,038
Well.

259
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:40,915
Isn't that
a coincidence?

260
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,375
Boy returns home,

261
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,503
and, conveniently,
his pops drops the next day?

262
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,797
Lucky bastard.

263
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,132
Maybe.

264
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,093
Or maybe this is about
something more than anger,

265
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,678
which they all had,

266
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:57,181
but if Junior isn't inheriting
the restaurant, then who is?

267
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:02,812
<i>Well, I'm glad
you decided to come here,</i>

268
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,816
but I'm not sure
<i>this</i> is appropriate.

269
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,025
Why?

270
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:11,404
Well, Lucifer's your boss
and a client of mine.

271
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,698
I can recommend you
to someone else.

272
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,158
No, I like you.

273
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,202
Look, you helped Lucifer,
and I need you to help me.

274
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,831
What seems to be the problem?

275
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,169
I'm stuck in a place
I don't belong,

276
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,338
and I'm not going
anywhere anytime soon.

277
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,632
I need to figure out

278
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:32,717
how to be more...

279
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,220
...normal.

280
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,222
So...

281
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:39,932
"So" what?

282
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:42,560
Tell me what to do.

283
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,937
Well, that's not how this works.

284
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,566
Do I need to sleep with you too?

285
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,942
What?

286
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:51,861
Is that it?

287
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,029
Uh, no.

288
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,071
No, I'm good.

289
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,072
I'm good.

290
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,199
Really, I'm good.

291
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:00,786
What I can give you...

292
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:04,290
is my advice.

293
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,792
So... if we want to feel more
connected to our environment,

294
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,377
sometimes it's helpful

295
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:12,173
if we actively embrace it
and those around you.

296
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,758
That still sounds like sex.

297
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:17,261
Okay. I meant, uh, engage in

298
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,765
caring and meaningful
relationships.

299
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:23,059
Making friends.

300
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,226
Forget it.

301
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,394
This was a mistake.

302
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:26,395
Mazikeen.

303
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:27,438
Wait. If you could...

304
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,567
What just happened?

305
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,073
Something on
your mind, partner?

306
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,159
What's the gun for,
Malcolm?

307
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,912
Oh, you mean that gun
you stole for me?

308
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,580
That gun?

309
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:45,831
I was wondering when you'd ask.

310
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,874
You know what?

311
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,709
I'm done playing
your stupid games.

312
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:50,586
You want to tell everyone
I shot you,

313
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,588
you go right ahead.

314
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,840
But I'm gonna put an end
to whatever you're planning.

315
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,593
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, chill, Dan.

316
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:00,721
God, you went from
zero to 100 so fast.

317
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,014
The way I see it,

318
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:03,683
I'm doing you a favor.

319
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:04,975
A favor?

320
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,561
Another man spends
so much time with <i>my</i> wife,

321
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,605
I sure wouldn't like it.

322
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:12,149
Especially knowing
this guy's so dangerous.

323
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:15,569
You want to kill Lucifer?

324
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,405
Why?

325
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,073
If I told you,

326
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,616
I promise,

327
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:22,159
you wouldn't believe me.

328
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,287
But before you go

329
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:28,290
growing any more balls,
remember this...

330
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,043
You thinking about
taking another shot at me,

331
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,087
try to take me down?

332
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,174
Don't miss.

333
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,930
So you're Anne Martin,
the sous chef.

334
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,098
You're Javier's
number two?

335
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,307
I mean, I guess I was.

336
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:48,144
I mean, I-I can't believe it.

337
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,896
I... I just saw Pops
this morning, he was fine.

338
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:54,024
- And you cooked his last
meal, is that right?
- So?

339
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,527
You know how many people had
their hands on that plate?

340
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:58,279
Well, this is
your kitchen, Anne.

341
00:12:58,446 --> 00:12:59,780
When Pops isn't here,
you run the show.

342
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:01,240
And from what I understand,

343
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,033
you're not someone
to be messed with, so...

344
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,244
you really think someone's
gonna go behind your back?

345
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:06,746
I can't control what they do.

346
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,289
Who knows what kind
of psychos we have?

347
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,790
Well, are any of these psychos

348
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,041
set to inherit the restaurant,
like you are?

349
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,961
I spoke to his estate attorney.

350
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,756
It's no secret Javier
was grooming me to take over.

351
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,424
He was my mentor.

352
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,176
Well, of all the reasons
to kill your father figure,

353
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,802
greed is truly the ugliest.

354
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:24,388
You think I killed Pops
to speed up my inheritance?

355
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,557
I would never do
anything to hurt him.

356
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:27,933
He taught me everything.

357
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:28,893
He meant the world to me.

358
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,979
Well...

359
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:33,647
If you didn't wish
your dear old "Pops" ill,

360
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,108
what did you wish?

361
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,527
To surpass him.

362
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:39,987
Ah! So the student

363
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,489
becomes the master, eh?

364
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,032
What? No! It's not like that.

365
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,533
Preliminary tox
screen came in.

366
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,786
The poison used to kill
Javier was mercury.

367
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,162
Oh.

368
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,330
So you cracked open
a few thermometers

369
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,915
over brunch, did you?

370
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,792
Not the trick I'd use,
but clearly effective.

371
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,960
There was something else
in his system, too.

372
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,212
Can I see the inside
of your arms?

373
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,296
Why?

374
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:58,380
Track marks.

375
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,132
Ah, so there was heroin as well?

376
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,842
Generous killer, aren't you?

377
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,803
Wanted to give him
a little high on the way out?

378
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,387
This is crazy. No.
If you...

379
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,640
if it's heroin,
you should talk to...

380
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,308
I'm sorry.

381
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:10,851
Don't worry.

382
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,520
I tend to have a rather
striking effect on women.

383
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:13,687
Come on.

384
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,147
Just let it all out.

385
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:16,816
Oh!

386
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,693
Okay.

387
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,237
Someone call an ambulance!

388
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,072
Well, I've never had
<i>that</i> effect.

389
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,000
Do you still think
she's a suspect?

390
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,669
We can arrest her now,
if you'd like.

391
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,921
You know, once she's done
getting her stomach pumped.

392
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,756
What I want to know is...

393
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,300
did she ingest the same thing
as Javier by mistake?

394
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,719
Or was she poisoned, too?

395
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,304
Why did she survive?

396
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,723
Well, perhaps the killer simply
ran out of thermometers.

397
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,225
Who would have a bone to pick

398
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,560
with Javier and his number two?

399
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,186
Oh, I don't know.

400
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:55,563
Perhaps someone who was
kicked out of the family biz?

401
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,273
You mean Junior.

402
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,983
Well, he seemed like a very
troubled young man to me.

403
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:00,401
Yeah.

404
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,111
It's almost as if
his dad just died.

405
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,739
Oh, and look who decided
to grace us with his douchedom.

406
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:06,949
Daniel...

407
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,034
Hey. Did you
find something?

408
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,870
A Naomi Austen.

409
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,289
She worked as a hostess here
last year till she was fired.

410
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:14,790
She has two arrests
for heroin possession

411
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,333
over the last
year alone.

412
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,711
Poor girl doesn't learn
her lesson, does she?

413
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,753
Naomi Austen.

414
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:20,963
That name sounds familiar.

415
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,923
Oh, okay.

416
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,092
So one of the cooks said that
she showed up two days ago,

417
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,927
and was yelling
at Javier and Anne, so...

418
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:28,971
I'll see if her P.O.
has an address.

419
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,639
It's already in the file.

420
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,349
Look at you two,
like Cagney and Lacey.

421
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:34,894
You don't care
who you piss off, do you?

422
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,061
Not in the slightest, no.

423
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,646
Oh, my God.

424
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:38,689
Oh, wait!

425
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:40,316
Um, Dan. Um...

426
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,194
So, uh, if you don't
have plans tonight,

427
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:47,364
my mom is having
this family dinner...

428
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,408
And you could really
use a buffer.

429
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:50,951
Yeah.

430
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,870
Sure. Send me the details.

431
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,079
All right.

432
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:55,748
Detective...

433
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,791
do you mind if we make
a stop on the way?

434
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,835
I mean, this shirt's
more of a loaner, really.

435
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,847
Still no answer.

436
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,770
OJ... spoons, foil.

437
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,021
Looks like a junkie...

438
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,445
What do you think you're doing?

439
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,405
Well, I found something
far more interesting.

440
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,823
We don't have a warrant.

441
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,283
We don't have time
for warrants, Detective!

442
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,619
Look. Junior was here.

443
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:34,578
Junior was staying here?

444
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,456
He and Naomi must be close.

445
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:38,874
Yeah, well, they probably
chased the dragon together

446
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,376
after Junior killed his dad

447
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,544
and then sat and looked
at the twinkly lights.

448
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,213
Why have they still got
their Christmas tree up?

449
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,881
We don't know what happened.

450
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,466
Well, maybe something in here
will help clear that up.

451
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:50,052
Right. Uh...

452
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,681
Board shorts.

453
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,724
Don't know what more proof
you need that he's deranged.

454
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,601
We're not supposed
to be in here.

455
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,978
Oh, come on.

456
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:02,940
So let's just
search the place fast.

457
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,566
Oh! Well, well.

458
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,318
Lead the way, Detective.

459
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:07,861
All right.

460
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:13,784
Oh... I... can...

461
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:15,244
can you hear that?

462
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,621
Yeah. And since when
has that bothered you?

463
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,081
Oh, God!

464
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,541
And dear old Dad strikes again.

465
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,626
I mean...

466
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,211
- It's not funny.
- It's kind of funny.

467
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,713
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

468
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,131
You're not the one
being taunted, are you?

469
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,341
"Oh, God" this!
"Oh, God" that!

470
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,011
He's popping up everywhere
and spoiling my favorite things!

471
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,054
I'd really hate
to be in your head.

472
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:35,514
Well, why would
you understand?

473
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,349
Your mother's
absolutely delightful.

474
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,018
Oh, of course <i>you</i> think she is.

475
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,019
Oh...

476
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,770
Do I detect some angst?

477
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,525
She's like a child.

478
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,235
- Oh, and I bet
it drove you crazy.
- Yeah.

479
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:50,988
All she wanted was to doll me up
and take me to auditions.

480
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,781
Would make anyone mad with rage.

481
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,366
She made everything about her.

482
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,036
So you could just murder her!

483
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,078
Sure.

484
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,747
But I didn't.

485
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,665
And you're still not proving
your point about Junior.

486
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:04,460
Fair enough.

487
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,628
So how did you handle it,
anyway?

488
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,338
You know, besides taking
your anger out on criminals?

489
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:09,798
I don't know.

490
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:12,843
I guess I just
always tried to

491
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:16,096
focus on something else.

492
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,431
This is...

493
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:18,807
weird.

494
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,400
Well! That painting

495
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,360
just became far more valuable.

496
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,487
Oh.

497
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,490
Hello, Naomi.

498
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:35,699
Who the hell are you?

499
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:36,700
Heroin inspector.

500
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:37,993
I'm afraid your spoons

501
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:39,703
aren't up to standard, so...

502
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,121
Hold on.

503
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,664
We have some
questions for you.

504
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,502
<i>You think I killed Javier?</i>

505
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,462
Well, I don't.
But she definitely does.

506
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,089
But she thought it was
the sous chef before,

507
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,256
so don't take it personally.

508
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,637
The poison that killed Javier
was laced with heroin.

509
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,680
We know you use and
we know that you had a fight

510
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,433
with Javier and Anne Martin
two days ago.

511
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:02,643
Okay, I admit,

512
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,645
I went to see Pops
a few days ago,

513
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,146
'cause Junior
called me to tell me

514
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,065
he was coming back home.

515
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,359
I just wanted
to make peace with his dad.

516
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,777
Make peace? Why?

517
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,821
Because he didn't
want us together.

518
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,322
- So you're dating Junior.
- We were.

519
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,574
A year ago,
before he left.

520
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:21,537
And I thought, maybe,
when he came back...

521
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,288
But Pops never approved.

522
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,165
Well, I can't see
why they're not fans

523
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,501
of your whole
Kurt and Courtney vibe.

524
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,670
I tried to tell him that Junior
got clean on his travels,

525
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,713
but it didn't matter.

526
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,799
Javier said
he would never support us.

527
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,134
I got upset.

528
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,468
What happened
with you at breakfast?

529
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,679
Nothing.

530
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,180
I wasn't even at breakfast.

531
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,432
Junior wanted
to see his dad alone.

532
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:43,976
I went to see my sponsor.

533
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,727
I've been having
a tough time of it lately.

534
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,354
All right.

535
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:48,605
Until we can confirm that,

536
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,065
we need you to come
down to the station.

537
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:51,692
Why, pray tell,

538
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,777
did Junior want to see
his dad alone?

539
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,737
He just said that he wanted
to make it right.

540
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,447
That all he
needed to do

541
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,075
was confront his father
and settle things.

542
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,286
Hmm.

543
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:03,829
You don't think that...

544
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,581
He killed him?

545
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,250
Junior told us he wanted to have
one more meal with his dad.

546
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,585
It seems he did--

547
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,170
a rather final one.

548
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,423
Do you know
where he is?

549
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,134
I haven't talked to him
since this morning.

550
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,223
APB on Junior's out.

551
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:24,808
We're trying to ping
his cell.

552
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,768
I'm glad we're finally
on the same page.

553
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,478
You know, ever since
we met this kid,

554
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,063
you've had it
in for him. Why?

555
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,691
Guess he's a bird of a feather.

556
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,485
Someone who had a shadow
cast over him his entire life.

557
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:36,904
Whereas I could never
escape from under mine...

558
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,572
he could.

559
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,699
I wonder how that feels.

560
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,452
Decker.

561
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,747
No. No, you did
the right thing.

562
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,832
- I'm on my way.
- Did they find Junior?

563
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,001
- No. I gotta go.
- But we've a killer to catch!

564
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,628
And we will.
This is an emergency.

565
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,130
Detective!

566
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:56,757
Come on!

567
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:57,758
Oh...

568
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:03,347
You've got to stop doing that!

569
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:07,726
Oh, no.

570
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,312
Nana says we're gonna
be in a movie!

571
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,315
No, no, no.

572
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,152
So the babysitter called

573
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,363
and said that
you let her off early.

574
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,822
Yeah, 'cause we didn't
need her anymore.

575
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:22,991
We were just on our way

576
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,660
to our first audition.

577
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,119
Ooh, isn't that a thrill?

578
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,496
You didn't think
to ask me about that?

579
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,289
What do you mean,
"our" audition?

580
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:30,916
I am up for a new role,

581
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,251
and I thought it would be good

582
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,710
to play off
of somebody.

583
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,962
Oh, okay.

584
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,214
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

585
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,632
So you thought
it'd be a good idea

586
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,300
to use Trixie
as a prop?

587
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:41,635
A co-star.

588
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,595
Everyone's gotta
start somewhere.

589
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,722
And isn't she the cutest little
lounge singer you've ever seen?

590
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,516
She looks ridiculous.

591
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,893
How can you exploit your family
for your next acting job?

592
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,311
You know, for someone
who hated acting,

593
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,938
you sure know
how to be dramatic.

594
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,022
You can't do this.

595
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:55,482
You can't push Trixie into this

596
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:56,984
the way that you pushed me.

597
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,610
You can't walk in here--

598
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,654
Like I own the place?

599
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:01,863
The place
you're living in

600
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,157
rent free?

601
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:05,534
You asked me to stay here.

602
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,786
You have no right to take her--

603
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,123
Where is she?

604
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,166
She was just here.

605
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,418
Trixie?

606
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:16,545
Trix?

607
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,173
Trixie?

608
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,675
Trixie!

609
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,303
She's gone.

610
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,018
I've called her friends,
I've called our neighbors.

611
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,228
No one has heard from her. No.

612
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,356
All right, I'll call you
if I hear anything.

613
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,525
Dan hasn't heard from her.

614
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,027
Take a breath, Chloe.

615
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,611
She's a smart girl--
where would she go?

616
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,071
I don't know.

617
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,115
She left and--

618
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:47,909
What?

619
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,453
What is it?

620
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:53,081
She ordered a ride
from my Uber account.

621
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,875
Where'd she go?

622
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,769

I'm Trixie, his friend.

628
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,701
His friends get
worse and worse.

629
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,454
Hate to break it to you,
but he's not here.

630
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:33,997
That's okay.

631
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,999

He cheers me up.

639
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,940
I hate it when people
fight over me.

640
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,942
What people?

641
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,110
My mom and dad

642
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,486
used to a lot.

643
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:05,946
But this time it was Mom

644
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,323
fighting with Nana
about how I look.

645
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:12,285
Which one wants you to look
like an old drag queen?

646
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,038
My grandma, I guess.

647
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:18,375
They're fighting over what they
want me to be when I grow up.

648
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,960
What do you want to be?

649
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:23,004
I want to be
the first president of Mars.

650
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,840
Or a zookeeper.

651
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:27,008
Mm-hmm.

652
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,719
I used to be a zookeeper.

653
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:31,555
In a way.

654
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:34,433

Thank God you're okay.

662
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,738
What were you thinking,
running away like that?

663
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,323
I wanted to see Lucifer.

664
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,200
But he wasn't here.

665
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,494
So I made a new friend.

666
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,123
What's your name?

667
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,666
Mazikeen.

668
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,169
But you can call me Maze.

669
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:04,963
Thank you, Maze.

670
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,549
I didn't say you could.

671
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,343

You know, to finally be free.

676
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:24,232
I mean, you're about
to be arrested.

677
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,735
But, uh, at least
you're free of him.

678
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:27,694
What are you talking about?

679
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,029
Your father!

680
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,822
You killed him.
Tell me all about it.

681
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,991
I mean, is the air
a little sweeter?

682
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,243
Is the sun a little brighter?

683
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,828
I didn't kill my dad, man.

684
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,497
Oh, come on--
why return to dispose

685
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,165
of the murder weapon then?

686
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,208
The heroin.

687
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,584
Sorry, it's all gone.

688
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:43,835
Police took it away for testing.

689
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:45,962
Well, most of it.

690
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:46,796
"Heroin"?

691
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,006
No, I

692
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,299
came for this.

693
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,092
Ah-ah-ah-ah

694
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,929
Careful, Junior, you don't
who you're playing with.

695
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:54,888
What?

696
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,139
No.

697
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,852
My dad gave me this knife.

698
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,729
It's all I have left
from him.

699
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,900
You're not relieved
he's gone at all.

700
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:08,818
Why would I be relieved?

701
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,737
Because he was judgmental
and cruel,

702
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,614
and he tried to force you
into being someone you're not.

703
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,324
And he's gone now.

704
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,284
So you can finally
be your own man.

705
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,036
Oh, dear.

706
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,038
You didn't kill him, did you?

707
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:22,040
Of course not.

708
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,753
So, are you gonna
arrest me or what?

709
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,469
Hi, Trixie!

710
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,555
I'm so glad you're back.

711
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,431
Listen, Nana needs
to explain something--

712
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,517
Mom, let's just
have dinner, okay?

713
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,477
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Dan!

714
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,688
What a pleasant surprise.

715
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:47,399
- And you brought dessert.
- Of course.

716
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,818
So thoughtful as always.

717
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,278
So good to see you, Penny.

718
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,654
Something smells amazing.

719
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,197
- Mmm.
- Yeah, Mom.

720
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,907
Where'd you buy
this nice home-cooked meal?

721
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:57,742
Oh, there's no take-out tonight.

722
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,119
Lucifer

723
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:00,870
has provided the meal.

724
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,247
Wait.

725
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:03,707
Lucifer's here?

726
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:05,834
He and his friend
have been here a while.

727
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:06,960
- His friend?
- Ah!

728
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,254
Detective!
Just in time.

729
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,880
Uh, you remember Junior?

730
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,048
Of course.

731
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,593
Just wait until
you taste his molé.

732
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,636
It is to die for.

733
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,977
Lucifer!
Oh, get back!

734
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,229
Okay, monkey, surprise.

735
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:27,939
You get to eat chocolate cake
in bed tonight.

736
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:28,982
Why?

737
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,317
Does it matter?

738
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:32,277
Nope.

739
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,154
Junior, if you wouldn't mind.

740
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,825
- Yes?
- So you brought

741
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,828
a guy who's suspected
of murder by poisoning

742
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:44,372
to cook for my family?

743
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:45,790
Well, if you arrest him,

744
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,000
he's just going
to lawyer up, isn't he?

745
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,044
So why not have a nice meal

746
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,420
whilst you get
all the answers you need, hmm?

747
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:51,838
I'm certain he'll open up.

748
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,340
Why is that?

749
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:54,382
Because I convinced him
you'd hear him out.

750
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:55,759
After all, he's innocent.

751
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:56,926
Oh, you think he's innocent now?

752
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:58,428
Come on, Detective.

753
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:00,013
If you're not satisfied
with his answers,

754
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,264
you can always
arrest him afterwards.

755
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:02,390
I stopped eating meat

756
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:05,352
while backpacking
through India,

757
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,772
so I had to get creative
with my dishes.

758
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,566
This is my vegetarian take

759
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,361
on Oaxacan molé with a tart,

760
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:15,904
vegan crème fraîche.

761
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,323
- Sounds so exotic.
- Lovely.

762
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,616
I cannot wait to dig in.

763
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,160
- Mom, don't eat that!
- Why not?

764
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,411
She's worried
it might be poisoned.

765
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,497
- You are?
- Oh, that's right.

766
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,582
Let's catch you up, shall we?
Um, I brought

767
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:28,833
Junior here tonight

768
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:29,918
because Detective Decker
believes

769
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,002
that he killed his father.

770
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:32,879
- You do?
- What are you doing, man?

771
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,881
But I believe he was after
something far more foolish.

772
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,549
Reconciliation.

773
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:37,634
That's right.

774
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:38,927
I didn't kill my dad.

775
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:39,928
Do you have proof?

776
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,847
Just my word.

777
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,474
Well, we might need
something more than that.

778
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,309
Oh, come on, Detective,
you said yourself

779
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,061
you may want to kill your
mother, but you don't do it.

780
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:50,063
Oh, so you want to kill me now?
Just because I put makeup

781
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,233
- on your daughter?
- No, because she thinks thinks
you're a child and forced her

782
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:55,193
to grow up too quickly.

783
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,696
Am I wrong?

784
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,197
You're way out line, man.

785
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,741
There he goes leaping
to her defense again.

786
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,992
You know,
perhaps you two are closer

787
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:04,369
to getting back together
than I thought.

788
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,538
- You are?
- No, we haven't decided.

789
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,081
Things are moving
that way.

790
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,290
We just had the one kiss.

791
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:11,543
So you're kissing now?
Right.

792
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,670
Maybe that explains
why you won't have sex with me.

793
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,547
I'm sorry, what?

794
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:16,172
No.

795
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,507
You're juggling

796
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:20,176
both these handsome gentlemen?

797
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,804
I'm not juggling anything.

798
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:25,181
Well, trust me, honey,
you better do something,

799
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,808
'cause you're not
getting any younger.

800
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:29,060
However, what do I know?
Because I'm just a child.

801
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,271
If you don't like it, why don't
you stop acting like one?

802
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,861
You guys sound
just like me and my dad.

803
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:42,073
We used to fight all the time
over the dumbest stuff.

804
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:44,242
That's why I left.

805
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:47,996
But no matter what I did,
I couldn't get away.

806
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:50,248
You know,
'cause every time

807
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:52,792
I cooked a meal
or I looked in the mirror,

808
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:56,546
there he was staring back at me.

809
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:57,881
That's a tad bit creepy.

810
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,717
Because he's a part of me, man.

811
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,761
You know, he may have
pushed too hard,

812
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,305
and-and-and tried to make me
something that I'm not,

813
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:09,893
but in the end,
it made me the man I am.

814
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:12,061
And I'm proud
of who I've become.

815
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,397
Yeah, I came back home

816
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:17,484
so I could tell him
that I was clean.

817
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,861
And I want to be a chef again.

818
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:21,738
And this meal?

819
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:24,199
was what I was gonna make
for him to prove it.

820
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:25,992
Well, it looks

821
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,703
very good.

822
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:33,166
I didn't kill my dad.

823
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:37,045
All right, so either
arrest me or let me go.

824
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
Well, we are gonna
need you to come downtown,

825
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:41,841
and make a statement.

826
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,676
Please.

827
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,845
Let me-- I'm happy to have
an excuse to leave.

828
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,013
Dan...

829
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:48,932
Don't go.

830
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:53,061
I wanted one reason
to stick up for you.

831
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,940
Just one.
Let's go, pal.

832
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:02,070
Well...

833
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,531
I have suddenly
lost my appetite.

834
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,910
Absolutely.

835
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,662
I hope you're happy.

836
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,331
No, actually,
I'm extremely disappointed.

837
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,041
- Because you ruined dinner?
- No.

838
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,710
Because Junior's answer
was spectacularly unhelpful.

839
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:20,547
He didn't escape his father
because he turned into him.

840
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,924
I mean, that doesn't
apply to me at all!

841
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:40,400
So I cleaned up.

842
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,235
The food, I mean.

843
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:43,987
It wasn't quite the same
as Chef Javier's.

844
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:46,614
But I have to admit,
the boy can cook, so...

845
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:50,159
I see you're still
working the case.

846
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:51,786
You were right.

847
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,288
Junior's innocent.

848
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,665
Well, glad <i>you</i> learned
something at dinner.

849
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:57,041
No, the lab called.

850
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,710
The heroin that
we found at Naomi's

851
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,753
doesn't match the kind
that killed Javier.

852
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,338
So if Junior didn't
kill his dad,

853
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,883
why use heroin?

854
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,010
To frame him, maybe?

855
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:08,011
Yeah.

856
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,679
I thought about that, too.

857
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,848
But the only person with motive
got poisoned herself.

858
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,892
Unless she knew exactly
how much to give herself.

859
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,477
Creating all
the gruesome symptoms,

860
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,606
but without the finale,
yeah...

861
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:22,066
But the restaurant
was hers,

862
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,068
so why would she do it?

863
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,530
I don't know, maybe Pops
had a change of heart.

864
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,657
Decided to bring Junior
back into the fold

865
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,201
after he found out he'd changed
and was coming home?

866
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:41,711
Yeah, this is Detective Decker.

867
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,213
I'm calling about a patient,
Anne Martin.

868
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:45,381
Yeah.

869
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:48,384
An hour ago?

870
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:50,428
Yeah, thanks.

871
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,557
Guess who checked out
against orders.

872
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:57,560
Well, I wonder where
our lovely sous-chef's

873
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:59,228
headed in such a hurry.

874
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,698
Bravo.

875
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:12,158
That's a brilliant
hiding place.

876
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,701
No wonder the police
couldn't find it earlier.

877
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,161
What are you doing here?

878
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,829
Well, we'd ask you
the same question,

879
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:17,830
but we already know
you're destroying evidence.

880
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,499
Because you killed Javier.

881
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,834
I told you, I would never do
anything to hurt Javier.

882
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:24,170
You seem genuinely upset.

883
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:26,172
Like you didn't want
Javier to die.

884
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,841
You humans are quite
the paradox, aren't you?

885
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,593
You're always killing
your loved ones and...

886
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:32,679
Unless the poison
wasn't meant for him.

887
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:35,348
You meant to kill Junior,
didn't you?

888
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:36,683
What?

889
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:38,017
Oh.

890
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:39,602
Hence the drugs.

891
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,354
He'd die
a grisly death,

892
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:43,064
and we'd assume
he simply got a bad fix.

893
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,857
Oh, that is very clever.

894
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,401
Except you didn't realize
that Junior changed

895
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,194
while he was away--
he stopped eating meat.

896
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,697
Which is why
his father ate his food,

897
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,699
and you killed the man you love.

898
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:55,034
Ooh, a cruel twist of fate.

899
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:56,869
You don't know what
you're talking about.

900
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,871
So when we test that powder in
your hand, you're telling me

901
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,456
it's not gonna match the
poison that killed Javier?

902
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:03,584
That ungrateful kid did not
deserve this place.

903
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:06,379
He was given everything,
and he threw it all away.

904
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:09,382
But it didn't matter.

905
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,051
'Cause he was still
the favorite.

906
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,054
Because he was worthy
of his father's love.

907
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:17,557
And he had a chance at
redemption until you ruined it.

908
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,028
Are you okay?

909
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,405
This place can't
possibly be up to code.

910
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:33,698
We've got to get out of here.

911
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,534
Damn it,
there's nowhere to go.

912
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:41,539
Oh, no, no, no, no,
this is not how it goes down,

913
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,666
not by a long shot, Dad.

914
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,752
Lucifer,
if you have any ideas...

915
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:48,671
...now's the time.

916
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,388
You can put me down.

917
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:58,890
Right.

918
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,224
Happy now?

919
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,858
The Devil gets burned by fire.

920
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,568
Could this be any more ironic?

921
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,528
Ah.

922
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:14,405
Does my pain amuse you,
Detective?

923
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:16,074
A little bit.

924
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,575
And so does this.

925
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,622
You little rascal.

926
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,214
Nice and tight.

927
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:32,924
Ah. Oh, thank you.

928
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,220
Anne was arrested
a few blocks away,

929
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:40,598
so she'll be eating prison slop
for a long time to come.

930
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,642
Ah, her own personal
hell indeed.

931
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:48,106
Thank you. For getting me out.

932
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:51,734
Well, couldn't exactly rush
out of there alone.

933
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:53,069
How would that look?

934
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,488
That's it?

935
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:58,908
No "thanks for saving me first"?

936
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:01,160
Is that what happened?

937
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,413
It's funny,
it's all so fuzzy now.

938
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,415
Must be the third-degree burns.

939
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:11,754
Can't believe it's gone.

940
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:15,091
We found out what your dad
never got to tell you.

941
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,970
He was gonna leave you
the restaurant all along.

942
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:21,305
If you even want it.

943
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:24,642
I think I do.

944
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:27,645
And maybe I could rebuild it.

945
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,230
You know, make it my own.

946
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:35,486
Uh, hang on, just a second.

947
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:36,988
Maze.

948
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:40,283
I'm surprised you came back.

949
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:41,284
I made a friend today.

950
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:43,828
That's fantastic news.

951
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,454
Who?

952
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:47,874
An eight-year-old girl
who wandered into the bar.

953
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:50,543
Well...

954
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,879
That's a start.

955
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,964
Perhaps the next one can be
of legal drinking age.

956
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:58,551
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

957
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,303
Yeah.

958
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:03,222

Oh, it's, uh...

963
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:18,654
it's been kind of
a rough night.

964
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:21,324
So I could use a drink.

965
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:22,700
Here.

966
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:34,086
What are you...
what are you doing up?

967
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,422
I have an early flight.

968
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:38,758
And I didn't want to leave
without saying good-bye.

969
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:42,178
But you just got home.

970
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:45,181
Look, I know

971
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:48,017
I haven't always been
the easiest mom.

972
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,520
I could be pushy.

973
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:53,689
Overbearing.

974
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,524
I am sorry

975
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,861
that you felt that you
always had to be the adult.

976
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:03,866
All I ever wanted was
for you to be happy.

977
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,952
I know.

978
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,790
And sometimes I think
you could just take a leap.

979
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:13,626
Hmm.

980
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:17,755

981
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:19,465

It's awfully late to be
calling a meet, huh?

988
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:47,410
You were right.

989
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:50,413
Lucifer Morningstar
is insane and dangerous.

990
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:52,290
And he deserves
everything he gets.

991
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:54,292
Well, that works out perfectly.

992
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,758
But I can't let you kill him.

993
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,929
Come on, man.

994
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:09,098
I mean, we talked
about this.

995
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:12,768
You know, I go down,
you go down.

996
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:14,353
Then I go down.

00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:16,022

00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:07,948
There you go.

1003

Don't worry.

This is unexpected.

1011
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:51,033
You said the door's always open,

1012
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:53,035
and I'm walking
through it.

1013
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,912
Mmm.

1014
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:57,373
Right, well, I was just on my
way out to meet the Brittanys,

1015
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:00,709
but... I suppose they
can occupy each other.

1016
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:03,045
Great.

1017
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:04,547
Then have a seat.

1018
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:06,549
Yes. Has something happened--

1019
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:09,552
I'm guessing by the looks
of it-- with Dan perhaps?

1020
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,553
Mmm.

1021
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,430
You mean Detective Douche?

1022
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,265
Yes, well, of course
that's what <i>I</i> mean,

1023
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:15,724
but the bigger question here
is: why do <i>you</i> mean that?

1024
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,727
We weren't even back together,

1025
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:21,063
and he ended it with me tonight.

1026
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:22,731
With a text.

1027
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,775
I mean, what,
are we in high school?

1028
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:27,486
Well, we're certainly
drinking like we are.

1029
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:30,281
Why don't you have
a seat over here

1030
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:32,408
and tell me all about it, hmm?

1031
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,410
I just feel like an idiot.

1032
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:37,746
I can't believe that I would
let myself care for him again.

1033
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:39,415
I mean, why?

1034
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:40,833
So I get hurt?

1035
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,169
Um, no, because
you're a kind person

1036
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:45,504
who puts the needs
of others before your own.

1037
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:48,757
It's a horrible irony
that my father invented.

1038
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:50,426
But you don't do that.

1039
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,178
You just take what you want.

1040
00:41:52,386 --> 00:41:54,847
Since the beginning of time.

1041
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,515
That's nice.

1042
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:03,481
Uh...

1043
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:08,360
What's happening?

1044
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:12,114
It would seem
that I'm saying no.

1045
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:15,451
But you've been trying to
get me into bed since day one.

1046
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:17,119
Why are you saying no?

1047
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,121
Well, frankly, my dear,
I'm as baffled as you are.

1048
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,623
I mean, usually
I'd leap at the chance

1049
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:22,458
to fulfill my carnal desire,
but...

1050
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:26,962
for some reason,
I can't.

1051
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:28,547
What am I doing?

1052
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,633
Why am I here, drunk,
throwing myself at you?

1053
00:42:30,841 --> 00:42:32,301
This is so sad.

1054
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,011
Well, it happens
to the best, I promise.

1055
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,013
But not to me.

1056
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:39,016
I don't do this.

1057
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:43,020
This is something...

1058
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:45,231
my mom would do.

1059
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:51,278
Come here.

1060
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:57,576
We don't all turn
into our parents, Detective.

1061
00:42:57,785 --> 00:42:59,578
I mean, look at me.

1062
00:42:59,787 --> 00:43:02,581

the son that He wants me to be.
