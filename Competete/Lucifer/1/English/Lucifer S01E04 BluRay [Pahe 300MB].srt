1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:05,131
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- You're the Lord of Hell,
for crying out loud.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,592
I'm retired, Maze.
I've got nothing but time.

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:08,635
How could you possibly help me?

4
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,136
I have the ability

5
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:11,972
to draw out
people's forbidden desires.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,307
I got it. The name,
the whole Lucifer thing,

7
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:15,809
and desire's like
your superpower.

8
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,519
It's more like a gift
from God, really.

9
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:19,396
I saw Lucifer do some things
that I can't explain.

10
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:21,231
Is Lucifer a magician?

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,316
That's sort of
what I'm trying to figure out.

12
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:26,861
You were once the brightest
of all of God's angels.

13
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:27,862
And now,

14
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,823
your time here on Earth

15
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,324
is affecting you, dear brother.

16
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:32,325
You're changing.

17
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:33,952
My life is change.

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,245
What are you doing here?

19
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:37,497
Ooh, how's your ex?
Detective Douche?

20
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:40,000
You like working with
the detective, don't you?

21
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,793
I told you,
I'm good at punishing people.

22
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:44,379
Nay, I'm the best
at punishing bad people.

23
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,381
Yeah, well, I think
you don't just enjoy

24
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,174
punishing the bad guys.

25
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:49,509
I think you're
starting to like

26
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:52,971

00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:30,318
Well,

42
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:32,654
good morning, Detective.

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,866
What the hell
are you doing here?

44
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:39,869
- Setting the table.
- You broke into my house?

45
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:40,954
Yes, well,
I hope you don't mind,

46
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,288
but I made a little brekkie.

47
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:43,456
You were taking forever
in the shower.

48
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:44,833
What do you do in there?

49
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,709
You are unbelievable!

50
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:49,462
Oh, thank you, but it's you
who should take the compliment.

51
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:52,048
Really kept things up since <i>Hot
Tub High School</i>, haven't we?

52
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:53,299
Ding-dong.

53
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:54,968
I want to shoot you.

54
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,177
Tease. Do it.

55
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:57,637
I'm immortal, remember?

56
00:02:57,846 --> 00:02:59,055
Uh, do you have any truffle oil?

57
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:01,891
Lucifer,
get out of my house now.

58
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,977
- We haven't eaten yet.
- Out.

59
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,145
Well, don't we need to discuss
the next case?

60
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:06,187
There is no next case.

61
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:07,814
- What?
- Out.

62
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,941
We're already late, so let's go.

63
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,984
Lucifer!

64
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,777
Yeah.

65
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:14,320
What in God's name
are you doing here?

66
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:15,822
Nothing in his name.
Here on my own, actually.

67
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,990
Did you and Mommy

68
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:17,866
have a sleepover?

69
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,076
No. No.

70
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:21,411
Absolutely not, no.

71
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,704
What are you guys
doing here anyway?

72
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:25,123
She left her bird report here.

73
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,499
Want to see?

74
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,002
Um, not really.
Here, have a snack, child.

75
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:32,881
Are you sleeping
with this idiot?

76
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:35,550
She hasn't had the pleasure,
unfortunately, no.

77
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:39,220
Okay, everybody out.
Trixie has to get to school.

78
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,264
I got to get to work.
Come on, out, please.

79
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,600
No, no, no, no, no,
you can't throw me out again.

80
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,101
Again?

81
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,352
So this is a habit.

82
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,146
Yes, shocking, isn't it?

83
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,190
- No.
- Never been thrown out
of anywhere before in my life.

84
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:51,566
Well, except for Heaven,
of course.

85
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:54,903
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

86
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,529
But somebody please flip
the omelet

87
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:57,697
if it's not already ruined.

88
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,199
Hey, Dan, I'm...

89
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,950
Really, Chloe?

90
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,578
I'm disappointed in you.

91
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:10,376
♪ Oh ♪

92
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:13,463
♪ Oh, oh ♪

93
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,716

96
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,389
Good. Right, you're here.
Um, I need to chat.

97
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:24,766
Lucifer, we don't
have an appointment.

98
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,267
Something very disturbing's
just happened.

99
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,727
It's horrific, really.

100
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:29,312
Uh, for the second time,

101
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,813
I've been thrown out
of a woman's house.

102
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:31,940
Okay, sorry, uh, Lu...

103
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:33,691
I mean,
I'm starting to wonder

104
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,610
if the detective has some sort
of biological dysfunction.

105
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,237
- Lucifer.
- 'Cause, I mean, I appeal

106
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,988
to the virile urge in all women.

107
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:40,698
Certainly, well, certainly you
can attest to that, can't you?

108
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,742
Uh, Lucifer, stop.

109
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,327
Yes, of course, sorry.
Payment first.

110
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,955
Uh, no. No, no, no,
no, no, no. No! No!

111
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,331
Hmm?

112
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,668
Lucifer, this
is George.

113
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:54,462
George, Lucifer.

114
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,422
Lucifer, George.

115
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,718
Oops.

116
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,146
- Dan, if you're here
to scold me...
- No.

117
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,941
I just got off the phone
with the lieutenant.

118
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,484
There's a case.

119
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,904
Day four.

120
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:22,490
Down to three meat sticks,
a half a bottle of water,

121
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,201
217 miles to L.A.

122
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,078
I'm not sure
we're gonna make it,

123
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:30,331
'cause my brother drives
like a narcoleptic old lady.

124
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,542
Say hi, Grandma!

125
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,296
No, that's our
only nourishment!

126
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,006
Her name's Lindsay Jolson.

127
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,924
Just turned 22.

128
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,385
She went missing
catering a Players' Club event.

129
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,012
Players' Club?

130
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,596
It's one of those skeezy
pickup artist groups.

131
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:47,598
You know, that teach geeks
how to be sex gods.

132
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,309
Got it.

133
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,311
Lindsay was last seen
talking to the lead scumbag.

134
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:55,481
The founder,
Carver Cruz.

135
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,567
So he was interrogated?

136
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,360
Yep, but his lawyer
did all the talking.

137
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:01,362
And with no proof, we're stuck.

138
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,656
But there's a Players' seminar
and after-party today.

139
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,158
And you need to go undercover.

140
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,076
Why me? I'm homicide.

141
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:08,411
Because you're our best way in.

142
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,163
- I am?
- Apparently these events

143
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,914
are pretty exclusive,
and when I saw the guest list,

144
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,374
I recognized one of the names.

145
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,834
I guess a lot

146
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:16,502
of high-end club owners
are invited.

147
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,379
Oh, come on.

148
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:20,506
No. You're kidding.

149
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,425
I wish I was.

150
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,344
- Lucifer's on the list?
- Yeah.

151
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,179
Yeah, of course he is.

152
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,141
Look...

153
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,353
the last thing I want
is the guy I found

154
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,313
making my half-naked wife
breakfast this morning

155
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,647
spending more time with her,

156
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,399
separated or not.

157
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:39,734
But...

158
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,611
This is the best option.

159
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,238
I wouldn't ask,
but I just keep thinking,

160
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:47,742
what if this was
our daughter?

161
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:53,915
The detective seems like
a very lovely woman.

162
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,125
Well, I suppose,
but still, she's human.

163
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,211
Why is she able
to refuse my charms?

164
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,421
I mean, is this thing on?

165
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,882
Yes, yes.

166
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,385
Definitely on.

167
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,263
It's not that you're afraid

168
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:11,182
that you don't have power
over Chloe.

169
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:13,184
It's that you're afraid
that she has power over you,

170
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:15,019
but neither
one is true.

171
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:16,729
- No?
- No.

172
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,690
People don't have
power over us.

173
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,859
We give it to them.

174
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,736
You have to take
your power back.

175
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,738
Right, go on.

176
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:28,658
You say she's nothing special,
but I think you've put her

177
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,034
on a pedestal.

178
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:33,079
You need to really
get to know her,

179
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,622
warts and all.

180
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,582
I'm sure she has some.

181
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,587
So,
demystify her

182
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,590
by bringing her back
down to your own level.

183
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,429
You're right.

184
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,139
It's not her, it's me.

185
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,433
I need to take back control.

186
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,143
I need to behave
like I always have.

187
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:56,978
Good. So you understand.

188
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,104
Yes.

189
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,605
Yes.

190
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,607
I mean,
it seems obvious now, actually.

191
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,609
I need to have sex with her.

192
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:07,113
Uh... no, uh, that's
not what I said.

193
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,823
No, no, no, you're a genius.

194
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:09,949
I mean, that's the best way
to lose interest, right?

195
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:11,951
Right. Good-o.

196
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,286
Hmm.

197
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,620
Thanks, love.

198
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,080
Oh, sure.

199
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,832
Payment next time, okay?
Uh...

200
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:20,835
Um...

201
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:29,969
Her name's Lindsay Jolson.

202
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:31,345
Mm-hmm.

203
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,347
She's been missing
almost three full days.

204
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,391
Right, so just ask
me one more time.

205
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,268
Lucifer,
there's a girl missing.

206
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:39,479
Yes, it's
just not every day

207
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,481
someone kicks you out of your
house, then three hours later

208
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,149
asks you on a date.

209
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,318
It's not a date.
It's a work thing.

210
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,195
- Oh.
- And are you gonna
help me or not?

211
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,155
All right.

212
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,365
But only 'cause
it coincides perfectly

213
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,783
with my own plan.

214
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:54,535
And what plan is that?

215
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:56,746
Well, to have sex with you,
of course.

216
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,664
Okay.

217
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,292
Wait, you and I...
well, there is no you and I.

218
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,835
There's a professional
situation,

219
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:05,004
- and I just need you...
- See, you need me.

220
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:07,006
The department needs you,
because you're the one...

221
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:08,341
I'm the one?

222
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,928
On the list
for the Player thing.

223
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:13,179
You're quite adorable
when you're flustered.

224
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,431
I... I'm not flustered.

225
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,350
I'm nauseous.

226
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,018
Now you're blushing;
I'd say I'm making headway.

227
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:23,064
Okay, look, let me make myself
perfectly clear.

228
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:25,691
I will never,

229
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,861
ever, ever sleep with you.

230
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,279
Never.

231
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:31,864
Okay? Got it?

232
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:33,574
Playing hard to get,
I like it.

233
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:36,202
When Hell freezes over, Lucifer.

234
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,745
I can arrange that, actually.

235
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:39,205
Get in the car.

236
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,184

Carver, can you hear me?!

It's the missing
girl's brother.

What'd you do
to my sister?!

261

It's okay. I got this.

263
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,617
- I know him.
- No, you don't.

264
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,201
Look, I'm sorry.
He has to leave the premises.

265
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,870
Oh, I don't think
that'll be necessary,

266
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,121

00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:08,711
milling around out there.

270
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,088
Which one do you desire?

271
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:13,341
You.

272
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,009
I'm gay.

273
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,177
Oh!

274
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,304
Right.

275
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,513
Well, my dance
card's full

276
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,307
with this one,
I'm afraid.

277
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,892
But the odds are definitely
in your favor out there.

278
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,976
Probably not batting
for the same team,

279
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,561
but you never know...

280
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,855
So go on, then.
Go forth and conquer.

281
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:29,148
I know you want to.

282
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:30,524
Yeah.

283
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,401
Right.

284
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,195
Off you pop.

285
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,404
You're Lindsay's
brother.

286
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,031
How'd you know that?

287
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,991
- Because she's a cop.
- Great. Say that louder.

288
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,201
I don't think
everyone heard you.

289
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,577
Right.

290
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:42,953
Sorry, yes,
we're here undercover

291
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:45,539
to find out what happened
to your sister.

292
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,208
If you can help me,

293
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,417
I'll tell you what happened.

294
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:49,418
Carver killed her.

295
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,379
Killed her? You sure about that?

296
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:52,546
No, but...

297
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,048
look, I know my sister.

298
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,342
She's a good person.
She's sweet.

299
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,844
She wouldn't just run off.
She's not even from L.A.

300
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:02,223
I'm all she has out here.

301
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,266
She's all I have.

302
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:05,810
Kevin, I promise you,

303
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,937
if anyone here hurt your sister,
I'll find them.

304
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:08,896
And I'll punish them.

305
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,564
Any method you prefer.

306
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,441
Nice solid flogging.

307
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,193
- Get the ol' swamp nuts
in a vice, you know.
- Okay.

308
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:15,236
It's time to go now.

309
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:16,779
Let us handle this,

310
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,572
and if we hear anything,
we'll be in touch.

311
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,074
Okay. Thank you.

312
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,075
Yeah.

313
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,576
We've got this.

314
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:26,163
You have to admit,
we're quite a good team.

315
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:27,832
If you weren't so
pent-up sexually,

316
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,792
we'd be firing on all
cylinders, I'd say.

317
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,591
I'm assuming you learned

318
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,301
most of your moves
at events like these.

319
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,262
I've never been to something
like this before in my life.

320
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,264
I certainly don't need any help
getting women into bed.

321
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:44,640
Till...

322
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:46,392
Were you hit on the head
when you were small?

323
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,522
No?

324
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:21,761
We are biological machines.

325
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,347
We... are warriors.

326
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:29,185
We... are players!

327
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:37,276
Gentlemen, we are animals.

328
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:41,447
Men are the wolves, and women...

329
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,492
...are the fluffy bunnies.

330
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:50,623
So we must prepare ourselves
for the hunt. How?

331
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,124
"Follow the list."

332
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,125
Yes!

334

The Conduct of Kick-ass Cavemen.

335
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,591
One: Be seen.

336
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,842
People pay for this?

337
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,385
Yeah, 5,000 bucks.

338
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,179
Stand out.

339
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,723

the lion with his mane.

340
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:11,685
Two: Be a protector.

341
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,103
Duh.

342
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,731
Women are hardwired
to hook up with someone

343
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,483
who can help them survive.

344
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,027
It is simple biology, man.

345
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:23,197
Three: Be brave.

346
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,198
Take risks.

347
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,658
Oh, maybe you should take notes.

348
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,702
Four: Be a leader of men.

349
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,330
And the most elusive.

350
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:35,584
Five: Be confident.

351
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:38,587
You... are...

352
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:40,214
a player!

353
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,215
Own it!

354
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,218
Excuse-excuse me!
Excuse me, question!

355
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,886
What are you doing?

356
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,388
The Q&A's after
the speech, buddy.

357
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,265
No, but
it's quite pressing.

358
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,517
What if you have all
those manly whatnots

359
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,894
and a woman still
doesn't respond?

360
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:56,564
You may think you have them,
but you don't.

361
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,440
- Yeah.
- That's why
you're here, right?

362
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,442
So, gentlemen,
you follow these rules,

363
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,320
and you will bed any Betty
you desire, guaranteed.

364
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,239
No. No.

365
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,408
No, no, no. I'm certain I've got
everything on your little list,

366
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,909
and more, actually,

367
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:12,538
yet this woman here
won't have sex with me.

368
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,209
Just listen to the speech,
buddy.

369
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,545
The system works.

370
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,130
No, but I doubt that.

371
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,382
Because... because if
I can't "bed a Betty,"

372
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,134
then how do you
possibly expect

373
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,469
any of these poor miscreants
to succeed?

374
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:30,431
Especially when
they're taking advice

375
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,433
from a-a wanker such as you?

376
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,726
All right, just sit down, man.

377
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,603
Yeah, Lucifer, sit down.

378
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,771
I-I just... could we get
the spotlight over here?

379
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,981
Do we have that?

380
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,982
Yeah, yeah.

381
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,400
But on-on her.

382
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:44,278
Good. Right.
Now, you're the expert.

383
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,572
You tell me
what's wrong with this picture.

384
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,948
I mean, I'm me.

385
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:48,949
Right?

386
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,284
And she...

387
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,911
Well, she's a cop,
for starters.

388
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,079
She's a cop?

389
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:55,581
Yes. I mean, talk about

390
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,166
the shallow end of
the dating pool.

391
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,292
This is private property.

392
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,585
Unless you have a warrant,

393
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,003
you need to leave here
immediately.

394
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,004
Security!

395
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,756
Security, her, out.

396
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,174
Okay, we're gonna take
a ten-minute intermission.

397
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,467
All right? Thank you.

398
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,427
I haven't finished.

399
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:09,345
All right.

400
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,305
Oh, it's you again.

401
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,310
Have you two...?

402
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,355
I know.

403
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,981
I'm-I'm sorry,
Lieutenant.

404
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,650
I... No. No.

405
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,234
I've got it
under control.

406
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,569
And Mr. Morningstar,
too, yes.

407
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:26,820
Let me talk to him.

408
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,405
It's a her, and no.

409
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,823
Really? Your boss is a she?

410
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,492
Even better.
Give me the phone, I'll fix it.

411
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,618
No, you can't
fix this!

412
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,953
You've already
said enough.

413
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:34,954
Sorry!

414
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,830
Not you.

415
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,333
Yes, I-I'll figure out
a way into the party.

416
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,501
It's not a problem.

417
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:41,710
And-and again,

418
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,504
I...

419
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:46,215
So we're going
to the Player after-party.

420
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,675
Not you. I am.

421
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,677
Well, I'm not sure
how that's possible,

422
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:50,803
now that you've
blown your cover.

423
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,680
Well, that was 100% your fault.

424
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:55,015
I beg to differ.
None of that would have happened

425
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:56,600
if you'd just complied
with my request.

426
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,060
Do you honestly think
you can just ask people

427
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,645
to have sex with you
and they will?

428
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,021
Well, I usually don't
have to ask, actually.

429
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,315
But trust me,
it'd be a win-win.

430
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:04,483
And probably
another win after that.

431
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:05,859
I mean, I have
tremendous stamina.

432
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,987
There's a girl missing, Lucifer.

433
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,697
She's probably in some
hellhole somewhere,

434
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,241
scared out of her mind,
if she's even still alive.

435
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,410
And I found out the party
is a cash-only event.

436
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,536
That's a first for Carver.

437
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,371
So our only suspect's

438
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,498
probably about to run off
to Mexico,

439
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,667
and you're worried
about boning me?

440
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,168
You're right. Sorry.

441
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,503
- Let's find the girl. Okay?
- Yes.

442
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:25,546
Sex later.

443
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:27,548
Kidding.

444
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:28,549
Sort of.

445
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:30,843
So where's the party?

446
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,095
- Cold Bar.
- Really?

447
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,639
Well, that place is notoriously
overpriced to rent.

448
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,725
If Carver wants cash,
he shouldn't have it there.

449
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,729
No, he shouldn't.

450
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,358
I think I just figured out
how you can fix this.

451
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,818
Oh?

452
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:50,029
Do tell.

453
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,591
Miss me?

454
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,973
I know why you're here.

455
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,808
I won't help you, Amenadiel.

456
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,310
One way or another, Maze,

457
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,771
I am gonna change
your mind, so...

458
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,607
You're gonna help me
get Lucifer back to Hell.

459
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,276
Don't make it painful.

460
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,529
You forget.

461
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:33,781
I love pain.

462
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,289
I'm an angel.

463
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:44,166
You can't beat me, little demon.

464
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,504
Stop and hear me out.

465
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:54,927
Men...

466
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,804
...they always want to talk.

467
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,988
Enough!

468
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,616
We want the same thing!

469
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,660
Oh, do we?

470
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,203
Let's see.

471
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,128
Uh-oh.

472
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,797
Did I hit a nerve?

473
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,218
Mazikeen,
we both know

474
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,388
that something has fundamentally
changed in Lucifer.

475
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,098
Now, aren't you even
the least bit concerned?

476
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,224
No.

477
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,518
It's a phase. It'll pass.

478
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:45,978
You're lying to me.

479
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,522
You're lying to yourself.

480
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,485
Now, we can help each other.

481
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,362
We can get him back
to where he belongs,

482
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,991
if you could just provide me
with a weak spot.

483
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,367
Some insight.

484
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,703
No...

485
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,746
means no.

486
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,059
Uh... hello?

487
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,395
Uh, Lucifer?

488
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,606
Be out in a moment.
Just getting ready.

489
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,107
Okay.

490
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,067
Uh, did you do
what I told you to do

491
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,361
and call Carver
about the Player's Club?

492
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,530
Make yourself
a drink, Detective.

493
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,533
No. No. No more drinks.

494
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,368
No more blurred lines.

495
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,914
No more breaking into my house
or trying to sleep with me.

496
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,958
Look, this is
a professional relationship.

497
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,252
I'm a police officer, and you...

498
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,386
...are naked. Oh...

499
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,430
Speaking of my surprise visit
yesterday,

500
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,098
I decided turnabout's fair play.

501
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,601
You know, tit for tat
sort of thing.

502
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,020
This is beyond inappropriate.

503
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,563
And brave,
wouldn't you say?

504
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,942
Number three on the C.K.C. list:
take risks.

505
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,284
Okay. Just...

506
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,953
Lucifer, put some
freakin' clothes on.

507
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,956
All right.

508
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,250
But seriously, darling,
are you well?

509
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,128
The berries are ripe and
ready to be harvested.

510
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,923
I mean, look at me.

511
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,508
Huh?

512
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:48,976
Now, you can't argue with that,
can you?

513
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,816
What happened to...

514
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,109
My God.

515
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,485
Oh, oh.

516
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:00,153
Well, yes, I suppose
it is his fault.

517
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,196
Whose fault?

518
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:02,322
My father.

519
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:03,991
Your dad did that to you?

520
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,493
No, no, no. That's where
I cut my wings off.

521
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,370
- What?
- Well, I didn't.

522
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,122
Maze did. I told her to.

523
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,498
N-No.

524
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,667
Seriously.

525
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:14,710
What is that?

526
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,799
Don't, please.

527
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,015
Okay.

528
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:29,641
I should get dressed.

529
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,810
Otherwise, we'll miss the party.

530
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,854
So you did make the call?

531
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,355
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

532
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,107
Party's at Lux.

533
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:38,942
Turns out, the words "open bar"
are indeed effective.

534
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,736
So good on you.

535
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,863
- Okay.
- Can't go wearing

536
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,323
that scruffy little getup.

537
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,366
You'll stick out
like a sore cop.

538
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,753
Where did you get
this dress anyhow?

539
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:00,505
Oh, it was left behind by
one of my overnight guests.

540
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,215
What was she wearing
when she left?

541
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,925
- A smile.
- Mm.

542
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,928
If I get an STD from this thing,
I'm gonna kill you.

543
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,930
Oh, there he is.

544
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:12,392
Oh, he doesn't
look suspicious at all.

545
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,227
Hmm, so what's the
plan, Detective?

546
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,188
Avoid him for now.

547
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,857
Mingle, find people who were
at the party last week.

548
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,901
See if anyone saw Carver
with our missing girl.

549
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:21,610
Hey.

550
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:22,861
Hi.

551
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,571
- Are you from Tennessee?
- No.

552
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,614
Because you're

553
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:26,740
the only ten I see.

554
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,033
Oh, you poor soul.

555
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,284
Does that actually work?

556
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:31,244
- No.
- No, I didn't think so.

557
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,746
It's cute.

558
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:33,747
It-it is?

559
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,374
Yeah.

560
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,251
Y-You're cute.
You're really cute.

561
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,962
Hey, were you at that party
last week?

562
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,756
Uh, no, actually,
this is my first.

563
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:44,424
Okay.

564
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:47,928
I love this song!
Okay.

565
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,722
Hey, oh, were you
at the party last week?

566
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:52,974
Uh, I think the dress may
have backfired, actually.

567
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,478
I think we've
been spotted.

568
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,148
Clearly a man with
nothing to hide.

569
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,235
Move!

570
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:04,945
Get out of the way!

571
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,446
Just...

572
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:07,572
get out.

573
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,074
Move!

574
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,826
Just come...

575
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,703
Give me the gun, Carver.

576
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,664
Just-just let me go, okay?
I need to go!

577
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,124
I'm afraid that's
not possible,

578
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,167
but I do have another
option for you.

579
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,460
How about a broken back, hmm?

580
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,424
You don't understand,
I have to go!

581
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,342
They're gonna
kill her now!

582
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,677
You just killed Lindsay!

583
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,011
They? They who?

584
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:32,931
The people who took her.

585
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,814
Where is Lindsay?

586
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,441
I don't know, okay?

587
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,318
I swear to you,
somebody kidnapped her.

588
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:47,279
If that's the case, then why
wouldn't you go to the cops?

589
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,239
Because they said
they'd kill her if I did.

590
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:50,699
Maybe they already have.

591
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,033
Excuse me, dear,
I don't know why we bother

592
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:53,535
with all these pithy
little police questions.

593
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,495
Tell me...

594
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,915
...what game's
the player playing, eh?

595
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,083
What are you after?

596
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,629
I just want Lindsay back.

597
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:05,755
I swear,

598
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,466
I would never hurt her.

599
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,969
I love her.

600
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,097
But she's a fluffy bunny.

601
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:16,099
You're a wolf.

602
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:17,976
You-You've built an empire on
the objectification of women.

603
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,895
Yeah, I know.
I'm a complete hypocrite.

604
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,939
But I-I would give anything
to get her back.

605
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:24,316
You humans.

606
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,776
You never cease to amaze.

607
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,945
Okay, Carver,

608
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,072
say what you're saying is true.

609
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,741
How long have you and Lindsay
been together?

610
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,117
Four months.

611
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:35,827
Next Tuesday.

612
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,704
I tried to keep it quiet,

613
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,999
'cause, you know,
I'm the man and everything.

614
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,375
I guess it got out.

615
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,085
So you're saying
you slept

616
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,545
with Lindsay on
multiple occasions,

617
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,797
but you still want
to be with her?

618
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,424
Yes, and for the rest
of my life.

619
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,384
Well, after
four months,

620
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:54,137
you haven't got her, you know,
out of your system?

621
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:55,472
How's that possible?

622
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,765
Okay.

623
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,936
You have no idea
where they're holding Lindsay?

624
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:04,272
No. But they did
send this to me...

625
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,025
...after the seminar.

626
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,988
Said no more cops or she's dead.

627
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:15,283
So the kidnappers were there
yesterday watching you.

628
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,160
I just hope
they weren't at the party.

629
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:18,370
If they hurt her, I...

630
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,496
It's okay.

631
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,832
Is there anyone
you suspect

632
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,084
that might do this to you?

633
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,502
Enemies?

634
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,671
Uh, I'm kind of
a polarizing guy.

635
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,506
Okay, the hater
list is long.

636
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,841
Hello there,
this is Lucifer Morningstar.

637
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,555
Who are you
talking to?

638
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,181
- Shh.
- Do not shush me.

639
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,516
Who's on the phone?

640
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:40,934
All one word, that's right.

641
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,519
Yes, I'll be speaking
on Carver's behalf

642
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:43,979
from now on.

643
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,814
No, I'm not a cop.

644
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,274
I assure you.

645
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,067
- Is that the...
- Yes, it's the kidnappers.

646
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,485
What are you doing?

647
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,028
Of course we have the money.

648
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:53,905
Just give me a time
and location.

649
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:55,782
Give me the phone.

650
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,117
No, I promise you, no police.

651
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,744
All right?
Okay, then.

652
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:00,996
- See you shortly. Bye-bye.
- Wait, wait.

653
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:02,372
Wait, we need proof of life.

654
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:03,999
Oh.

655
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,625
Um, just a minute.

656
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,460
How do we know
Lindsay's still alive?

657
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:08,878
No, they've hung up.

658
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,423
What are you doing?

659
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,133
Not to worry.
I've handled it.

660
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,510
I'll be making an exchange
on your behalf this evening.

661
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,554
Cash for your lady love,
all right?

662
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,264
Really?

663
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:22,225
Uh, but why would
you do that for me?

664
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,603
Well,
isn't it obvious?

665
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,688
Number two on your list:
be a protector.

666
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:27,856
Is it working?

667
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,566
You're not doing
this alone.

668
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:32,068
Afraid so.
I promised, no police.

669
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:34,362
A deal's a deal, especially one
with the Devil.

670
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,616
Besides, I'm the only one
not risking his life on this.

671
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,868
Immortal, remember?

672
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:46,458
Carver,

673
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,126
I'm all right.

674
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,920
I'm a...

675
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,589
I don't know where I am.

676
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,425
Please come get me.

677
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:56,968
I love you.

678
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,720
Please.

679
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,474
I'm coming with you.

680
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,267
No, I can't let you do that.

681
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:05,769
I'm not gonna call this in,
but you have to stay here.

682
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:07,604
No discussion.
I'm coming with you.

683
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,022
Fine.

684
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,608
You'll have to wait in the car.

685
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,593
Ten more minutes.

686
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:39,803
Patience.

687
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,971
Something doesn't feel right.

688
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,516
Well, of course it doesn't.
It's a kidnapping.

689
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,769
Cool ranch puff?

690
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:48,770
No, thanks.

691
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,772
- No?
- Mm.

692
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,774
It's funny, isn't it?
You'd think the king of hellfire

693
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:56,486
would be more of a flaming hot
guy, but love these bad boys.

694
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:59,989
Okay, let's say
you really are the Devil.

695
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:02,492
All-powerful, immortal,
blah, blah, blah.

696
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,327
Does that mean
you don't feel pain at all?

697
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:05,328
Hmm.

698
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:06,913
I like this line of questioning.

699
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:08,289
Does this mean
you're finally coming around?

700
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,959
No. Just answer
the question.

701
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:14,170
Well, I...
I do feel something,

702
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,548
but it's not pain
so much as, uh,

703
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:18,967
a pressure, a nuisance, really.

704
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:21,386
Okay, so what does it
feel like if you get shot?

705
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:26,141
Ow.

706
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:27,809
Well, you asked.

707
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,103
But that's it? Like, a
bullet just bounces off you?

708
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,356
Well, there's no wound or blood,
if that's what you mean.

709
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,525
Can verify with something sharp
if you like.

710
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:38,069
No, it's not necessary.
It's tempting though.

711
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,487
Huh.

712
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:42,240
So, does this mean
that you believe me?

713
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:43,700
I'm afraid
I can't offer

714
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,161
anything obvious
like a tail as proof.

715
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,079
- And so no horns.
- No, afraid not.

716
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,622
That's the stuff
of movies and TV.

717
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:50,623
Mm-hmm.

718
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,041
They always get it wrong.

719
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,002
Well, look,
I-I have to admit,

720
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,712
I've seen some things
I can't explain,

721
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,715
but I don't believe
in all that Bible stuff.

722
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,884
So you're an atheist.
How ironic.

723
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,719
No, not exactly.

724
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:06,598
I do believe there's good
and evil and right and wrong.

725
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:10,059
But the whole
fiery damnation thing, no.

726
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:11,102
Does it scare you?

727
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:12,729
No, I mean, how could I be

728
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,023
scared of something
that I don't believe in?

729
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:21,070
Do I scare you?

730
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,365
No.

731
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:30,747
Is that Carver?

732
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:31,956
Hmm?

733
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:34,959
How did he get here?

734
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:36,211
Oh, he must have followed us.

735
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,545
Well done, Detective.

736
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:38,963
No, he didn't follow us.

737
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:40,590
He must have gotten
the address somehow.

738
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,091
Or someone told him.
Either way, he's gonna

739
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,135
get someone killed,
probably himself.

740
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,640
This love thing makes you all
quite stupid, doesn't it?

741
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,864
Lucifer!

742
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,329
Lucifer!

743
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:19,838
Sorry, but I gave
my word-- no police.

744
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,130
Seriously?

745
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:22,465
Don't worry, Detective.

746
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:23,800
I'm immortal, remember?

747
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,969
I knew it.

748
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:28,680
Hey, guys, I'm gonna need you
sooner than I thought.

749
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:30,223
Is SWAT ready?

750
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:54,914
Manly as ever.

751
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,165
Why are you here?

752
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,834
We had a perfectly
good plan in place.

753
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,961
Well, after you left, the
kidnappers called back.

754
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:01,462
They said they
changed their minds,

755
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:03,923
and I come or
the deal's off.

756
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:06,301
Oh, that sounds sinister.

757
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,470
Just hand over the cash,

758
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,139
and no one gets hurt.

759
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,600
Yes, right. Got it here.

760
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:15,476
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! Where's Lindsay?!

761
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,103
I want to see her.

762
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:18,980
No. My rules.

763
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,899
Money first.

764
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,151
Now, Mr. Kidnapper, I believe
that's a fair request actually,

765
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,778
so just pop her around
and the money's yours.

766
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,243
Greedy little jackal,
aren't you?

767
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:33,786
Give it to me!

768
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:35,747
Most certainly will not.

769
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,832
Hey, f-forget it!

770
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,667
Just-just give
it to him!

771
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,045
I just want her back.

772
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:44,047
Fine.

773
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:46,466
Now bring us the girl.

774
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,176
I'm sorry.

775
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,385
That's not gonna happen.

776
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:50,803
What?

777
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:51,804
I will kill you!

778
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,056
Oh, it's gonna happen.

779
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:55,808
A deal's a deal.

780
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:58,061
I am not leaving here
without Lindsay.

781
00:32:58,269 --> 00:32:59,646
No way.

782
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,233
Dearie me.

783
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,694
What is it about you
and guns, eh?

784
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,534
Carver?

785
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,578
Oh, no.

786
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:22,377
Lindsay?

787
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,420
Wait. <i>Lindsay</i> Lindsay?

788
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:26,339
Love of your life Lindsay?

789
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,841
Yeah, sorry, but I can't
let you shoot my brother.

790
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,010
What's up, jackass?

791
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:31,928
I don't understand.

792
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,055
Don't you though?

793
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:37,225
This foul woman and her backwood
brother played the player.

794
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,185
Lindsay kidnapped herself.

795
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:42,188
Hell truly hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

796
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:43,398
You did scorn her, didn't you?

797
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,066
No. No.

798
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:48,194
For the first time in my life,
I didn't.

799
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,196
I loved her.

800
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:53,574
I love you.

801
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,326
Love me?

802
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:56,619
Are you kidding?

803
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,121
You didn't even
remember my name!

804
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,248
What are you
talking about?

805
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,250
I met you two years ago, Carver.

806
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,584
We slept together.

807
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,295
And then you never
called again.

808
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:08,715
Guess I was research
for your stupid book.

809
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:10,466
No, no,
that's not possible.

810
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:12,218
No, I-I would've remembered.

811
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:13,511
Nope.

812
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,138
I met you at the library.

813
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:17,390
It's a good
place to score

814
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,142
desperate babes.

815
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,561
That's in Chapter 11, I believe.

816
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,104
Oh, that's bad.

817
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:24,564
I was a virgin, Carver.

818
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:25,857
That's worse.

819
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,275
It was just another
night for you,

820
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:30,611
but it was a big deal for me.

821
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,448
Oh, God, I'm...
I am so sorry, Lindsay.

822
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,908
I-I'm different now.

823
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,910
No, I don't think so.

824
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:39,454
But I am.

825
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,913
Okay, may I speak now?

826
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,623
Because I happen to be
an expert on punishment,

827
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,625
and I'm not sure
it fits the crime here.

828
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,669
I mean, Carver
made a mistake--

829
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:48,296
well, several really--

830
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,131
but...

831
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,340
you're different.

832
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:52,633
He's changed.

833
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:55,303
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

834
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:57,972
Shut up.

835
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:00,224
You shouldn't even
be here.

836
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:01,726
Now you're dead, too.

837
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:02,852
Shoot them, Linds.

838
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,103
Sorry, can't let you

839
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:05,813
do that, darling.

840
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,440
I mean, I'm indestructible,

841
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,816
but he's off limits as well,
I'm afraid.

842
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:11,027
No, she's right. I-I deserve it.

843
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:12,403
No, you don't.

844
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:15,990
Chlamydia, the clap,
raging case of crabs--

845
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,784
that's what you deserve,
not death.

846
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:20,536
And you...

847
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:22,872
...how are you any better?

848
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,165
Why do humans think

849
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,501
they can rectify
one evil with another?

850
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,836
I mean,
it's clearly the first time

851
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:30,171
this reptile has
truly loved a woman,

852
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,297
and this is his reward?

853
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:32,632
Get away from her!

854
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:39,222
Oh, God.

855
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,015
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

856
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:43,059
Please don't hurt me.

857
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,645
Why does everyone say that

858
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:46,896
before they're punished?

859
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,231
Don't kill me!

860
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:50,691
Lucifer.

861
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,235
Don't move.

862
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:53,694
Detective,
you should leave.

863
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,698
Who are you?

864
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:04,247
What are you?

865
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,137
Did you do this?

866
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:21,222
I've been trying to tell you,
I'm the Devil.

867
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,809
That's... that's
not possible.

868
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,394
I assure you, Detective, it is.

869
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:27,770
I mean, you've said yourself,

870
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:29,730
there are things
you can't explain.

871
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:31,983
You need more proof? You've got
the gun. Come on, shoot me.

872
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:35,945
No.
I can't shoot you.

873
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:38,447
Sure you can. Go on, give her
a squeeze, we'll be good to go.

874
00:36:38,656 --> 00:36:40,783
- No.
- Just shoot me, Detective!

875
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:44,036
Please! Because maybe
you'll finally realize...

876
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:47,623
Good for you!

877
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:49,584
See?

878
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,751
Hardly hurts.

879
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:52,670
I can't believe...

880
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:54,964
Gah. Actually,
no, it's hurting a little bit.

881
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:56,299
It's... Gah!
It's hurting a lot.

882
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,634
Son of a bitch,
that really hurts!

883
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,972
I'm bleeding.

884
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:05,099
- You're bleeding.
- I'm bleeding.

885
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:07,185
Oh, crap,
of course you're bleeding.

886
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,062
God, what have I done?

887
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,981
I don't... I don't bleed.
It's...

888
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:15,610
Lucifer,

889
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,153
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

890
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:18,362
What does this mean?

891
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:19,989
Well, it means I shot you.

892
00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:21,782
And I'm an idiot, and I'm sorry.

893
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:23,993
And I'm in so much trouble.

894
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:26,329
Ah! It really hurts!

895
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,212
What's happening to me?

896
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,564
Well, speak of the devil.

897
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:55,316
Mr. Morningstar here
was just telling me

898
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,193
everything you did in there.

899
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,946
Right.
Well, Lieutenant...

900
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:01,989
I was just telling
your boss if you hadn't acted

901
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:03,532
in the way that you did, then,

902
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,534
well, all hell
would've broke loose.

903
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:06,744
Isn't that right?

904
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:09,705
Right.

905
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:10,706
Mm.

906
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,542
Absolutely. And, um...

907
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:16,337
But you caught the bad guys;
that's the main thing.

908
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:17,838
Again, I'm sorry
that you got caught

909
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:19,257
in the crossfire,
Mr. Morningstar.

910
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:21,217
Oh, it's just a graze.
I hardly felt it.

911
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,762
And call me Lucifer.

912
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,432
Lucifer.

913
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:36,274
Thank you again
for all of your help.

914
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:37,775
You are so welcome.

915
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,740
Bye, now.

916
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,580
I thought you
didn't lie.

917
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:52,957
I don't.

918
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:56,961
But I don't always tell
the whole truth.

919
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:59,630
Thank you.

920
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,925
You're welcome.

921
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:05,886
Come on, I'll
drive you home.

922
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:08,264
I should bloody hope so,
now you've crippled me.

923
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:09,807
Wuss.

924
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,064
Thanks, Julia.

925
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:19,108
Have a good night. Drive safe.

926
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:27,616
Mommy!

927
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:28,784
Hey!

928
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:30,161
What are you doing up?

929
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,496
Can't sleep when
you're not home.

930
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:33,831
Come on, I'll tuck you in.

931
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,666
What's that
on your shirt?

932
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:41,672
Oh. Um, that's, uh...
that's ketchup from lunch.

933
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:44,300
Nuh-uh. That's blood, Mom.

934
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,761
Right. You're right.

935
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:50,973
Well, um...
I may have hit someone...

936
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:52,350
with a bullet.

937
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:54,602
You shot someone? Again?

938
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,770
Barely.

939
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:56,687
Who?

940
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:58,105
It was Lucifer.

941
00:39:58,314 --> 00:39:59,482
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

942
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,691
It was nothing.

943
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,651
It was, like, a little graze.

944
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,695
Okay.

945
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,699
What, babe?

946
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:11,702
Remember last week, I
told you that boy Noah

947
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:14,038
kept throwing French
fries at me at lunchtime?

948
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,956
- Mm-hmm.
- And you said

949
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,626
it actually might mean
he likes me?

950
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:19,877
Yes.

951
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:22,880
Well, since you <i>shot</i> Lucifer,

952
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:26,634
it must mean
you <i>really</i> like him.

953
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:32,473
Hmm.

954
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,850
You know, it is bedtime,
you little weasel.

955
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:38,062
You weasel. I'm gonna get you.

956
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,814
Story time! Story time!

957
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:50,533
I know.

958
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:52,201
Tough day at the office.

959
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,202
What happened to you?

960
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:54,745
Oh, you'll never guess.

961
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:56,247
She shot me.

962
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:57,915
And I bled.

963
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:00,376
What?
That's not possible.

964
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:03,045
- I know.
- What's causing this?

965
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:05,339
Is there something
you're not telling me?

966
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:06,841
Don't think about it too much.
It's exciting.

967
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,259
No, it's dangerous.

968
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:13,764
We've had our fun here, Lucifer,
but this can't happen.

969
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,893
Tell me we're going home.

970
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:20,271
On the contrary, Maze.

971
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,024
The fun's just begun.
