00:00:01,252 --> 00:00:02,837
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:05,048
<i>Those wings out there
in the human world,</i>

3
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,384
Luci, they're too powerful.
A piece of divinity.

4
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:09,970
<i>You know exactly what's
causing your vulnerability.</i>

5
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:11,513
<i>Chloe Decker is the one
I should be throwing knives at.</i>

6
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:13,181
<i>Demon daggers</i>

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,892
forged in Hell don't count.
We all know those prick.

8
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,143
What do you want from me,
Malcolm?

9
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:18,228
<i>You're gonna go into Evidence</i>

10
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:19,521
<i>and borrow something for me.</i>

11
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:20,605
What's that?

12
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:22,273
This is my Pentecostal coin.

13
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:24,734
I suppose you could use it
to get out of Hell.

14
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:27,445
<i>It's all yours
if you don't shoot me.</i>

15
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:29,280
<i>You sent your demon to kill me.</i>

16
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:33,284
If only you'd done what was
asked of you, I'd still be home!

17
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:37,580
Enough! You both used me. Here.

18
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,541
Kill each other.

19
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,877
Evil is here. Evil is here.

20
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,713
"Morningstar." Whoa.

21
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:46,381
<i>Somebody could be doing this
on his behalf,</i>

22
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,174
<i>or maybe he's involved
in a different way.</i>

23
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:50,301
<i>You did this.
You killed those people.</i>

24
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,763
- I did this for you.
Aren't you happy?
- Why would I be happy?

25
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:55,265
<i>The last place the preacher
was seen was near LUX.</i>

26
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:59,227
Put your hands up.

27
00:00:59,394 --> 00:01:02,105
Lucifer Morningstar,
you're under arrest.

28
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,237
Come on, Detective.

29
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,990
You can't seriously believe
I killed

30
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,783
that pathetic malcontent.

31
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:15,827
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

32
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:21,249
That's all that matters,
Detective.

33
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,920
Put your hands in the air
and surrender yourself.

34
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,473
This isn't funny, Lucifer.

35
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:37,640
Isn't it?

36
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,601
I think

37
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:42,979
this is the grandest joke
that I've heard in all my time.

38
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:46,024
The best part is it's on me!

39
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,029
Come peacefully.

40
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:52,781
We'll go to the station...

41
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,282
No.

42
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:56,284
We won't.

43
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,036
What are you doing?

44
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:00,914
I'm accepting my role
in all of this.

45
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:04,375
All of humanity's sins
are the Devil's fault, right?

46
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,503
I mean, I thought you knew
different, but I was wrong.

47
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:08,797
You're just like all the others.

48
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,298
So,

49
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:13,218
why not add one more murder
to the pile?

50
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:14,427
That's not what this is,
Lucifer.

51
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:15,845
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

52
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,138
You wanted your bad guy.
Well, here he is,

53
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,057
gift-wrapped just for you!

54
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,016
Don't take another step.

55
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:20,809
You!

56
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,685
Newbie.

57
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:24,979
Come on. Riddle me with bullets,

58
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:27,357
so you can go home,
drink an ice-cold beer,

59
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,567
and feel better
about yourselves!

60
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:31,194
Don't shoot him.
He's unarmed.

61
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:32,821
Oh, you don't know that.
Maybe I have a gun.

62
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:33,863
Hands in the air!

63
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,490
- Do it!
- Don't!

64
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,710
What just happened?

65
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,297
Search the area.

66
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:54,217
He can't have gotten far.

67
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,771
Can we not tell anyone

68
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,648
you just carried me in your arms
like a baby?

69
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:10,400
What were you trying
to accomplish in there?

70
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,403
Uh, a good death?

71
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,405
Or at least
a nice and messy one.

72
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:18,408
But then you had to come and
ruin everything, like always.

73
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:25,373
Why'd you swoop in and stop it?

74
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,126
Wouldn't let someone else
send me to Hell, is that it?

75
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:31,588
Well, guess what, brother,
you don't need to kill me,

76
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:34,924
because I'm done here.

77
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,177
I've had my fun on Earth, and...

78
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:41,598
...there's no reason for me
to stay anymore.

79
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,474
You win.

80
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:45,101
I'll go willingly.

81
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,270
Please, just...

82
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,230
take me back to Hell.

83
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,773
No.

84
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,495
Hey. What happened
to Lucifer?

85
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,497
You didn't hear?

86
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,166
What happened to him?

87
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,084
He disappeared. He's on the run.

88
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,628
Ow.

89
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:16,257
Let me see that.

90
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,259
Have you ever seen
a knife like this?

91
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:21,095
Yeah. Uh, I'll take it
to the station.

92
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,139
Careful. It's crazy sharp.

93
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,233
Great.

94
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,817
Hey.

95
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:35,860
I need to talk to you.

96
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,281
I know this is
gonna sound crazy,

97
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,616
especially after
what just happened,

98
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,826
but I think
Lucifer is innocent.

99
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,412
Chloe, Lucifer got into a fight
with the deceased

100
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:47,997
just a couple hours ago.
We both saw it.

101
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:49,457
I know. Just hear me out.

102
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,918
Okay? Just pretend
you don't know Lucifer.

103
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,920
- I already like it.
- Our suspect

104
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,297
is a club owner who likes
to tell people he's the Devil.

105
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,049
You're not really selling
his innocence.

106
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:01,052
He's a man who embraces desire,
lives by his passion.

107
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:03,846
Now think about the body.
The guy was executed,

108
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,473
single bullet to the head.

109
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:07,850
There's no passion
behind this.

110
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,852
- This isn't him.
- Then it's a frame job.

111
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,229
Who would want to set him up?

112
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,147
- I don't know.
- Detective,

113
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,732
we may have found
the murder weapon.

114
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:17,277
Okay. Test it
for prints and DNA.

115
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,320
Yes, ma'am.
Thanks.

116
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,700
Lucifer's prints
are gonna be on that gun.

117
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,326
- You don't know that.
- I do.

118
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:27,203
And I also know you're right.

119
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:28,705
Lucifer's innocent.

120
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:30,498
What?

121
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:33,001
Chloe, we have to talk.

122
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,044
Somewhere else.

123
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,757
You don't want to take me back
to Hell?

124
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:43,428
The one bloody thing
you've wanted this entire time.

125
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:45,221
Did I punch you

126
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,431
in the head too hard?

127
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,558
Maze was right, Luci.

128
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,642
We used her.

129
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,311
And Malcolm.
People have died

130
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,437
because of us.

131
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:53,896
Because of you, you mean.

132
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:55,898
Yes. Because of me.

133
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:56,816
Right.

134
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:01,696
Brother, somehow I lost sight
of the bigger picture,

135
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,448
of the cost of my actions,

136
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:05,908
and just how truly selfish
they were.

137
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:08,244
But, Luci,
my eyes are wide open now,

138
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:10,246
and I need to make this right.

139
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:11,789
Do you know, I think this side
of you's actually scarier

140
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:12,790
than the angry one.

141
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,417
I need to find Malcolm,

142
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,294
and I need
to send him back to Hell.

143
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,548
Will you help me, brother?

144
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:27,263
One last bit of punishment
on the way out.

145
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:31,768
It sounds like fun to me.

146
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,070
Ah, there's nothing like

147
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,447
a fresh shirt after
a rainy rooftop.

148
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,866
What is that smell?

149
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:49,535
Tropical musk candles.

150
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,872
Gosh, the sacrifices you made
pretending to be a therapist.

151
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:53,998
Yeah, I like that scent.

152
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,583
- Of course you do.
- Okay,

153
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,543
can we please just focus?

154
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:00,004
- Now, what's your plan
to find Malcolm?
- My plan?

155
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,632
- Yeah.
- Well, I thought you were
the expert at plotting murder.

156
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,093
Or not so expert,
considering I'm still alive.

157
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,386
Which is why
I brought us here,

158
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:07,804
so that we could come up
with a plan.

159
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,806
Right. Well,
it sounds more like you want me

160
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,350
to do all the heavy lifting.
So how's this? Step one,

161
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,727
travel back in time and not make
such a mess of things.

162
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,562
You know, I'm suddenly reminded
of why I wanted you dead

163
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:17,855
in the first place.

164
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,816
Luci, what is
your problem?

165
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,692
Oh, good question, Doctor.
Well, you see,

166
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,945
the thing is that my brother
has been trying to kill me

167
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,446
and now he wants
to work with me

168
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,073
but we can't seem to get along,

169
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,616
mainly because
he's an egotistical twit.

170
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:29,659
Hello?

171
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,702
Oh, I'm sorry,
Dr. Canaan.

172
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,371
I didn't realize
that you were in session

173
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,456
with a... Lucifer?

174
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:37,417
Oh.

175
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,085
I can't believe this.

176
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,254
You're stealing my patient.

177
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,923
Uh, not exactly.

178
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:47,176
Actually, you may be just
what we need, my dear doctor.

179
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,392
I deserve that.

180
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,601
You lied to me.

181
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,103
I don't even know you.

182
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,021
You shot a man in cold blood.

183
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,773
I shot Malcolm to protect you.

184
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:04,277
Everything I saw at Palmetto,
it was all true!

185
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,279
You let them think I was crazy.

186
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,281
- I never intended...
- You let me think
I was crazy.

187
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,449
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,659
You don't get to be sorry.

189
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:13,035
If I could take it all back,
I would.

190
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,579
You can't take it back!

191
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,581
I know.

192
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,959
But you can make this right.

193
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:22,962
How?

194
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:24,881
Prove Lucifer is innocent.

195
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,134
Where are
you going?

196
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,136
Lucifer thinks I abandoned him.

197
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,180
I need to find him.

198
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,477
So you're-you're brothers?

199
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:39,479
Unfortunately.

200
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,981
And we're having a
terrible time working together.

201
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,858
But because you've been
so helpful with me, Linda,

202
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,610
hopefully you can help fix
our problems.

203
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:47,487
Listen, I know
this must be a shock...

204
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:48,821
Are you even a real doctor?

205
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,823
No, of course he isn't.

206
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,242
Gosh, if he had any clue
about human nature,

207
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:54,243
we wouldn't be in this mess.

208
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,496
Oh. You dare criticize me?

209
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,039
Luci, you're arrogant,
you're selfish,

210
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,957
- all you do is think
with your penis...
- Oh.

211
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,584
Oh. Which, of course,
you would never do, would you?

212
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,002
How's Maze, by the way?

213
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,629
Dr. Martin, will you
please tell him to shut up

214
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,172
and just listen to reason?

215
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,090
Oh, if by reason,
you mean a deceptive load

216
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,008
- of bull...
- Enough!

217
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:13,346
You lied to me
about being a doctor

218
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,389
so you could
manipulate Lucifer,

219
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:16,682
who is actually

220
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,184
your brother.

221
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,519
Somehow.

222
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,854
Do you realize

223
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,814
the ethical position
you've put me in?

224
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:26,859
And you, let me guess,

225
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:27,902
you were gonna make
a sexual joke

226
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,153
about putting me in a position.

227
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,197
That's true, yeah.

228
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,157
Because everything's
a joke to you.

229
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:36,035
And yet, for some reason,
I take you seriously,

230
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:40,039
even when you insist on clinging
to these ridiculous metaphors--

231
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:42,291
Heaven, Hell, angels, devils.

232
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,668
- Actually, they're not...
- Trust me,

233
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:44,877
you don't want
to pick that fight.

234
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:46,420
You claimed
you came to L.A.

235
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,047
to reinvent yourself,
yet every time

236
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:51,509
I think you come upon
a moment of realization,

237
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,303
you go the exact wrong
direction with it.

238
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,305
I did... Ho-Hold on.
You're right. I did come to L.A.

239
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:57,682
to start a new life, didn't I?

240
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:00,768
And now Malcolm's on the run.

241
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:03,771
He's gonna need
to start a new life, too.

242
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,398
- No, see, you're doing it again.
- New I.D.,

243
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,691
bank account, passport.

244
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,360
I know just the person
to go to.

245
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:11,195
Oh.

246
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:13,322
Damn, you're good.

247
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,740
Yep.

248
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,169
Where's Lucifer?

249
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:30,756
Even if I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

250
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,095
You've never liked me.

251
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:37,430
Why?

252
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,599
Because every day was a party.

253
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:42,435
Every sin,
every desire L.A. offered,

254
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,478
we took part.

255
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,024
And then he met you.

256
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,610
So you think it's my fault
that the party's over?

257
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:54,322
That and the fact that you're
hunting him down like a dog.

258
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:57,950
I don't think he killed
the preacher.

259
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,786
I need you to help me find him
before another cop does.

260
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:02,580
So where would he go?

261
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,457
- You know him better than anyone.
- These days

262
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,250
it seems you know him better
than I do.

263
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:09,045
So where do you think
he's going?

264
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,381
To get punishment.

265
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,718
Which means
he's going after Malcolm.

266
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,137
Then maybe he hasn't changed
that much after all.

267
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:20,556
If he gets to Malcolm first,

268
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:22,600
he really will go down
for murder.

269
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:30,524
You can't come with me.

270
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,818
You said you needed my help
finding him, right?

271
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,071
I don't see anybody else
backing you up.

272
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,999
Byron was a nice guy,
a handy guy.

273
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,001
He fixed my toaster once.

274
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,962
Not a BLT goes by
I don't think of Byron.

275
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,798
Excuse me!

276
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,008
Yeah, sorry to interrupt
the riveting eulogy,

277
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:57,843
but I'm here to see
the funeral director.

278
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:00,012
Hello, Neil.
Remember me?

279
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,180
In a bit of a rush,

280
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,640
unfortunately.

281
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:06,185
Whereas this poor chap, well,
he's not going anywhere, is he?

282
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:09,105
Sir, please wait
until after we're finished.

283
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,690
This is disrespectful.

284
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,109
Uh, no, <i>this</i> is disrespectful.

285
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,611
I mean, this whole show--
who's it for, really?

286
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,113
Eh? Not him.

287
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,281
He's not hearing
any of this.

288
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,033
Would you back me up,
please, bro?

289
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,868
He is right.

290
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,787
See? Trust me,
he should know.

291
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:25,871
No, it's for you,
isn't it?

292
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,790
It's a selfish way

293
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,209
for you to all feel better
about yourselves about how much

294
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:32,670
you ignored
this poor sod in life.

295
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:35,381
Oh, did you choose this suit?

296
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,174
Mr. Morningstar,
this way.

297
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:38,801
Oh, you <i>do</i> remember me?

298
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,219
Feel free to carry on.

299
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,306
You have no right
disrupting this funeral.

300
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:45,808
- This is my business.
- Yes.

301
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,476
Your least profitable one.

302
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,103
Your main source of income is
creating new identities,

303
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,105
which is why I came to you
five years ago to get

304
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,481
my proper papers and all that.

305
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,358
And I did great work for you,
Mr. Morningstar.

306
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,403
- So why are you doing this?
- Well, if I know you're the best,

307
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,321
then Malcolm Graham
does, as well.

308
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,656
The cop.

309
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:03,367
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he needed it
to be done fast,

310
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,745
but said he'd need time
to get his hands on the 100K.

311
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,414
Where would a homicide detective
get that kind of money quickly?

312
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,915
Mm, look at you, Sherlock.

313
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:12,334
He mentioned
an old associate.

314
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:13,753
Tommy, I think.

315
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,005
Great. We'll do a search

316
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,423
for every "Tommy"
in Los Angeles.

317
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:18,799
What's another thousand years?

318
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,926
No, no, no, no. An old associate
of Malcolm's, you say?

319
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:23,888
I think I might know just
the person who can help us.

320
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:25,765
Rhymes with "douche."

321
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,475
Thanks, Neil.

322
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,106
I wish I had my knives.

323
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:35,399
You're not gonna need 'em.

324
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:36,901
I never need them.

325
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,614
LAPD! Malcolm, if...

326
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,078
Oh.

327
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,205
Hello?

328
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,749
Anyone here?

329
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,128
Looks like Malcolm
likes to shop.

330
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,339
You cops must make
a lot of money.

331
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,216
You hiring?

332
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,134
We're not, and we don't.

333
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:04,970
I have no idea how
he can afford all this stuff.

334
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,973
Well, if you don't make good
money, why do you do this job?

335
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,308
'Cause I get to shoot people,

336
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:10,976
which is something
you should keep in mind.

337
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,480
No really. Why?

338
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,650
'Cause I hate it when people get
away with things they shouldn't.

339
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,652
And you like
to shoot people.

340
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,111
Yeah.

341
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,113
Huh.

342
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:26,325
And to think I almost killed you
in your sleep that one time.

343
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:27,493
Wait. What?

344
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,920
Oh, now I know why he
likes working with you.

345
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,182
Malcolm, it's the police!

346
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,184
Stop firing
and put the gun down!

347
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:53,978
He's not with you?

348
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,941
Please tell me
he's not with you.

349
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:07,199
Sorry. I thought
you were my husband.

350
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,285
Mel, why were you shooting
at Malcolm?

351
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:10,911
Ever since
he almost died, he...

352
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,622
he's been different,
he's been strange.

353
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,165
I can't describe it.

354
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,834
He has a newfound appetite.

355
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,669
An insatiable hunger

356
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:20,337
he just can't seem to fill.

357
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:21,589
How do you know?

358
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,173
I've seen it before.

359
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,592
Where?

360
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,677
Right. I forgot
who I was talking to.

361
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,012
It only gets worse.

362
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,179
It can't get worse!

363
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:30,639
He spent all
our money.

364
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,266
And when I saw him today, he...

365
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,767
Wait. When did he come by today?

366
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,644
You just missed him.

367
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,147
He was frantic. He was looking
for money, and he was angry.

368
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,940
He was so angry.

369
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,359
And he had this look in his eye,
and he said things like...

370
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,820
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

371
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,282
He said he was gonna
go get a beer.

372
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,117
Okay.

373
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,953
Thanks. Excuse me.

374
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,872
Malcolm's good, Chloe.

375
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,957
I can't find any evidence
tying him to the murders.

376
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,667
How's it going on your end?

377
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,753
Malcolm's not home.
Mel said he went out for a beer.

378
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,129
Does that make any sense to you?

379
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:03,756
No. When I saw him,
he was scared.

380
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,424
I think he knows
Lucifer's gonna come after him.

381
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,176
He looked like a guy
getting ready to run.

382
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,136
Yeah, well, he doesn't have
the money to get far.

383
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:11,055
Yeah, but he's the kind of guy
who'd know how to find it.

384
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,265
Oh, maybe there's a bar
that owes him money.

385
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,893
Yeah, or one that he could rob
for some extra cash.

386
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,103
I'll look into it.

387
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,072
Don't move,
or wobbly head gets it.

388
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,406
How did you get in here?

389
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,075
There's a manhunt for you.

390
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,576
And this is the last place
you'd look, isn't it?

391
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:33,661
I thought
it was quite clever.

392
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,162
Ooh.

393
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,747
You need to get
the hell out of here.

394
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,540
Oh, we're gonna need
some information first.

395
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,125
- Who are you?
- Not this again.

396
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,503
He's my brother.
I know, shocking, isn't it?

397
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,004
He's much less handsome
than I am.

398
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,006
We're looking
for Malcolm, Detective.

399
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,300
Now, we've been told that he's
seeing an associate named Tommy?

400
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:51,261
There are a lot of Tommys in...

401
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:54,723
A beer. Of course.

402
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,101
We'd very much like to know
what you just realized.

403
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,519
Too bad.
I'm not telling you.

404
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,021
But you want to,
though, don't you?

405
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,232
No, I don't.

406
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,735
Oh, you're a complicated one.
That is a surprise.

407
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:10,072
So, come on, what do you want
to do, Daniel? Hmm?

408
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,116
I...

409
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,035
I want to redeem myself.

410
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:18,288
Oh. And taking down Malcolm
would do that, wouldn't it?

411
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,124
So where is he?

412
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:21,709
Come on, you can tell us.

413
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,252
Like you said,
we're surrounded by police.

414
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,462
There's an old brewery
on Third.

415
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,381
Mm-hmm.

416
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,466
A drug dealer named Tommy
Campolongo works out of there.

417
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:32,136
Ah. Not that complicated
after all.

418
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:35,264
So you two will stay
in a holding cell while I...

419
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,358
Okay. Tommy Campolongo.

420
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,901
That makes sense,
that he'd have cash on him.

421
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,778
But he's not gonna
hand it over nicely.

422
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,321
I'm leaving the precinct now.

423
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,990
Okay, meet me there with backup.
I'm not far.

424
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,034
Chloe, don't go...

425
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,619
Damn it.

426
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,250
You like that?

427
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:09,256
And to think,
after all this time,

428
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,050
I just thought
you were dead.

429
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,218
What can I say?

430
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,345
It's hard to keep
a good man down.

431
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,681
- Mm-hmm.
- And now

432
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,641
I'm ready to get the old band
back together.

433
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,685
You have some product
you can move?

434
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,312
We've got some seizures

435
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,272
just sitting there in evidence.

436
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:29,151
Could actually get you a supply
today if you've got cash.

437
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,111
I always have cash, Malcolm.

438
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,488
You know that.

439
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,448
That I do, Tommy.

440
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,450
That I do.

441
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,202
How much you thinking?

442
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,495
How much you got?

443
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:49,505
What's going on up there?

444
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,135
This ain't me.

445
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,388
What you waiting for?!

446
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,396
But hey.

447
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:09,566
Gift horse and all that--
am I right?

448
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,571
Why don't you go ahead,
open up that safe, my man?

449
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,245
Oh...

450
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,080
hello there.

451
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:24,581
If you miscreants don't mind,

452
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,625
we're looking
for Malcolm Graham.

453
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,753
Hand him over, and we can
all be on our way
without too much fuss.

454
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,922
You two made a huge mistake
walking in here.

455
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,596
What do you say we skip the
time-slowing shenanigans, hmm?

456
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,723
What about
your mortality situation?

457
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,851
Well, it's kind of a non-sitch
when the detective's not around.

458
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,561
I'll explain later,
but for now,

459
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,480
we'll just, you know,
enjoy the moment.

460
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,280
After you.

461
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:57,781
Lovely.

462
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,409
Right, I should warn you--

463
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:05,873

fighting each other, right?

00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,055
We still need
to find Malcolm.

481
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,139
Absolutely.

482
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,516
You know, if we split up,
we'll cover more ground.

483
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,101
Okay, but no hogging all the fun

484
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,479
if you find him first-- deal?

485
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,521
Deal.

486
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:14,858
Oh!

487
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,233
Wow. I mean,

488
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,236
wow. I could tell
it was something special,

489
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,406
but I had no idea
that was gonna work.

490
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,576
But you never know
until you try.

491
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,580
Got to say,

492
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,875
you don't look so scary now,
Amenadude.

493
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,505
Oi!

494
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,258
What part of "no hogging"
don't you understand?

495
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,062
Bloody hell!

496
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,272
There you go, spoiling

497
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,065
my fun again.

498
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:39,735
Leave me, and go get him.

499
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,695
You know how much
I hate being in anyone's debt.

500
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,698
I figure if I save you now,
that makes us even, right?

501
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,783
Besides, it's...

502
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,368
it's just a flesh wound.

503
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:50,412
Hardly can see
what you're whining about.

504
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,792
What happened?

505
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,587
He was struck with a blade
not of this world, Maze.

506
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:02,090
One of mine.

507
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,300
Yes.

508
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,801
I'll handle this.

509
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:05,802
How?

510
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,221
Find him.

511
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,809
With pleasure.

512
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,074
Malcolm, freeze!

513
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,494
Stop!

514
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:58,397
Don't move.

515
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,822
Easy, Detective.

516
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,949
You're a hard man to find.

517
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,493
Look, I know you think
I'm a bad guy,

518
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,995
but I'm simply trying to catch
our dear friend Malcolm

519
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,914
so I can tear
his arms and legs off.

520
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,752
- This has nothing to do with you.
- You know I can't let you do that.

521
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,504
You don't know
what he's done.

522
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:24,506
You'd never believe me anyway.

523
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,842
But all you need to know
is that he's here to get money

524
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,386
and then he's gonna disappear.
For good.

525
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,139
You mean this money?

526
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,809
I'm not here to arrest you,
Lucifer.

527
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,352
I know you're innocent.

528
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:38,979
I always have.

529
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:42,274
So let's catch
this bastard together

530
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,234
and put an end to all this.

531
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:50,615
Ah. Look at us, reunited,
and it feels so good.

532
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:53,285
Malcolm won't get far
without his getaway cash.

533
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,203
Where's Maze?

534
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,997
- She's taking care
of something important.
- Oh, of course

535
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,082
your ninja bartender is off
on a secret mission.

536
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,542
Why, Detective, are you pining

537
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,669
- for some
good cop/demon cop action?
- No.

538
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:05,046
- I just want to clear your name
and find Malcolm.
- No, no, no, no, no.

539
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,590
Who cares
about the Devil's rap sheet?

540
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,258
Why don't we just skip that part

541
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,010
and go straight
to the main course?

542
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:13,180
Because it's incredibly
impulsive and shortsighted.

543
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:14,222
Have you noticed that's my jam?

544
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,807
If we fix your reputation,

545
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,767
we'll preserve
everything we've done.

546
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,561
You want to keep working
with me.

547
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,813
And to do that,
you need to trust me.

548
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,238
- Okay. Well.
- Right. Very well,
Detective.

549
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,574
I'm in your hands.
But how you intend

550
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,326
to prove my innocence
is beyond me.

551
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,536
Put your hands down.

552
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,246
We found the evidence we need.

553
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,581
<i>He</i> did?

554
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,208
Can I rethink my surrender?

555
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,667
What'd you find?

556
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:45,378
It's better if I show you.

557
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,764
Enough,

558
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,057
Mazikeen.

559
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:59,100
I've made my peace with death,

560
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,186
whether I go to Heaven or Hell.

561
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,687
I know exactly
where you're going.

562
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,774
Nowhere.
You're staying right here.

563
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,442
Now shut up and let me help you.

564
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:12,447
There's nothing

565
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:14,491
that you can do.

566
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:17,536

I kept it a secret.

I do.

00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,136
I'm here to turn myself in.

586
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,096
What are you doing?

587
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,933
I removed a firearm
from Evidence lockup,

588
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,810
and I gave it
to Detective Malcolm Graham.

589

I believe
Detective Graham

590
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,522
then used that weapon to shoot
and kill Jacob Williams,

591
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,274
the crime that...

592
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:32,152
Mr. Morningstar is suspected of.

593
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,820
Well,

594
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,822
Detective Espinoza,

595
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,198
I...

596
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,159
didn't know you had the stones.

597
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,287
No more Detective Douche?

598
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,331
Well, not today, at least.

599
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:45,832
Let's go.

00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,792
Dan...

601
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,222
I need to take this.

602
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,225
Hey, honey. Everything okay?

603
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,269
Hello, Decker.

604
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,730
Malcolm?

605
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,065
How's the precinct?

606
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,736
I still have a few buddies
at the stations.

607
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:17,739
Oh, and I made
a new friend today, too.

608
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:21,076
Pulled her out of a boring class
for some bonding time.

609
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:23,119
Here, say hi.

610
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,289
Hi, Mommy.

611
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,589
Hey, Trixie.

612
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:35,757
Are you okay, honey?

613
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:36,591
Mommy's here.

614
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,302
Uh, that's enough of that.

615
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,638
What do you want, Malcolm?

616
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,391
Aw. Poor Chloe Decker.

617
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,934

take something from you,

00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:47,519

619

Hurts, don't it?

620
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,523
You want your money.

622
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,819

talking to the cops. Remember,

623
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,654
- you don't know who's with me.
- Okay.

step away from your vehicle.

649
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,681
Put your hands in the air

650
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,434
and walk towards me peacefully.

651
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,394
If you do not--

652
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,438
I repeat-- if you do not,

653
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,982
we will have no choice
but to shoot you

654
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,318
with our new bazooka.

655
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,488
We've actually been waiting
months and months to use it, so,

656
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,531
on second thought,
please, speed away.

657
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,824
What are you doing?

658
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,075
Well, I could ask you the s...

659
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,746
I could ask you the same thing.

660
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:32,248
You going somewhere
without me, hmm?

661
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:33,833
Right after all this talk
about trusting you,

662
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,627
you're immediately
keeping secrets?

663
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,670
I don't have time to explain
to you. Something came up.

664
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,964
Something that obviously
requires quite a bit of cash.

665
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:41,800
I didn't know
you had it in you, Detective.

666
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:44,010
- It isn't for me.
- Oh, you're gonna make it rain
at the local strip clubs then?

667
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,054
- Lucifer...
- Or perhaps that
phone call earlier

668
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:47,972
wasn't as innocuous
as you made it out to be.

669
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:50,642
Fine. You leave me no choice.

670
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,729
Malcolm has Trixie.

671
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:58,149
Oh.

672
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,944
If I get him his money,
he'll let her go.

673
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,987
Right. Because if Malcolm's
established anything,

674
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:04,280
it's his trustworthiness.

675
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:05,824
What choice do I have?

676
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,492
To ride shotgun with the Devil,
for starters.

677
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,035
If Malcolm sees you,
he'll kill her. I'm sorry,

678
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,246
but I can't risk it--
her life's at stake.

679
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,289
Right. So you're just
gonna get both of you
killed then, are you?

680
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:15,124
He needs this money
to leave town.

681
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,293
I won't give it to him
until she's safe.

682
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:18,378
And what about your safety?

683
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,338
Trixie is all that matters.

684
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,298
- Detective, I...
- I don't have time
to argue with you, Lucifer.

685
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:26,302
I realize how bad this can go,
but I don't have a choice.

686
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:28,346
This is my daughter.

687
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,934
Promise me
you'll let me go alone.

688
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,978
Fine.

689
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,479
You have my word.

690
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,121
Don't look so sad.

691
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,914
Your mommy's coming
to pick you up.

692
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,833
Good. I don't like you.

693
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,710
What's not to like?

694
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:06,301
- Trixie.
- All right, easy, Decker.

695
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,802
Easy.

696
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,013
Mommy, can we
go home now?

697
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:12,307
- Yes, Monkey.
- We can.

698
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:15,018
Glad to see you came alone.

699
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:17,687
Now toss the gun.

700
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:26,905
Now the other one.

701
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,580
There. You happy?

702
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,624
Yeah, once I get
my money, sure.

703
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:39,542
So, where is it?

704
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,628
Not without Trixie.

705
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:44,380
- Oh, come on, Decker...
- Malcolm, that's the deal.

706
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,261
Go on.

707
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:54,891
Hi.

708
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,310
Okay, listen to me.

709
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,187
We're gonna play a game,
all right?

710
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,981
I need you to hide
until I can come find you.

711
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,608
Mommy, I don't
want to play a game.

712
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,360
I know you don't, baby.

713
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,738
But I need you to go hide
really, really well, okay?

714
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,741
Go.

715
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,452
Kids, huh?

716
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,212
It's there.
It's-it's all there.

717
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,421
It's in the bag.

718
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,632
Yeah. I believe you.

719
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,844
You don't need to do this,
Malcolm.

720
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:35,223
I know, but I was gonna
shoot you at Palmetto,

721
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:38,893
and now I feel like I've been
given a second chance here,

722
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,938
so I'm sure as hell
not gonna waste it.

723
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:54,575
Is this really what you did

724
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:57,537
with your second chance?

725
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:58,997
Deary me, Malcolm.
Pathetic.

726
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,289
Hey, Lucifer.

727
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:02,750
Hey, buddy.
Long time no frame.

728
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:05,294
Though that didn't
stick too well, did it?

729
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:07,755
Guess I need to find
a more permanent solution.

730
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,550
Give me the gun, Malcolm.

731
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:13,302
Why? Not afraid of you.

732
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:14,887
All you're doing
is getting yourself killed.

733
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,514
And for what?

734
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,224
To buy your precious
detective some more time?

735
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,226
No.

736
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:21,978
No, I want
to ask you a question.

737
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,938
Oh.

738
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:29,068
What do you desire, Malcolm?

739
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:33,740
Lucifer, what are you doing?

740
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:36,826
What do you yearn for in that...

741
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:38,619
rotten soul of yours?

742
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,664
I...

743
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:43,666
You've been given
a second chance, Malcolm.

744
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,168
Is killing Detective Decker

745
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,711
really what you want
to do with it?

746
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,006
I don't.

747
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,008
No, of course you don't.

748
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:54,052
You want to live,
don't you?

749
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:57,513
I do.

750
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:01,142
More than almost anything.

751
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,102
Almost?

752
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:17,825
There's one more thing.

753
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,300
You feel that?

754
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:38,763
That's what it's like
to die, my man.

755
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,640
I know, 'cause I've done it.

756
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:45,686
And what I want,
more than anything...

757
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:51,400
...is for you to feel that pain.

758
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:52,777
To go through what I did.

759
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:57,573
Because we both know
where you're going to.

760
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,331
Bet you never expected

761
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,707
to miss this thing so soon.

762
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,627
Yeah.

763
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,420
Don't worry.

764
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:13,339
You won't be going alone.

765
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:16,801
I'll be sending Decker along
right behind you.

766
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:20,221
Oh, Chloe...

767
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,684
Oh, Decker...

768
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,031
Here, Chloe, Chloe, Chloe.

769
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,700
<i>I don't know if this is all</i>

770
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:42,743
part of the plan.

771
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,830
Or if You can even hear me.

772
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,211
But if You're up there...

773
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,088
Dad...

774
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:58,634
I need a favor.

775
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:03,723
<i>I'll be the son</i>

776
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:06,017
<i>You always wanted me to be.</i>

777
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,563
I'll do as You ask.

778
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,857
Go where You want me to.

779
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,150
I...

780
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:18,738
In exchange,

781
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:23,409
all I ask is...

782
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:26,537
is that you protect Chloe.

783
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,773
Home, sweet home.

784
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,117
Bloody ash.

785
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,581
That can't be right.

786
00:38:25,263 --> 00:38:26,514
It's open.

787
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:36,023
This isn't possible.

788
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,349
Hello, Malkie.

789
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:30,369
It doesn't matter.

790
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:33,372
I've got your coin.

791
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:34,874
Oh.

792
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,917
I'll be back.

793
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,176
You're looking for this?

794
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:46,886
How...?

795
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:48,929
I know a guy.

796
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:52,933
Apparently,
He wants me back here.

797
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:08,240
Sorry, pal.

798
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,285
One use only.

799
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:27,593
Trixie!

800
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:30,096
Come out, honey!

801
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:31,764
Mommy, is it over?

802
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,849
Yeah, baby, it's over.
Come here.

803
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:37,269
Hi.

804
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:41,023
Oh, I'm so happy
you're okay.

805
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:43,067
Excuse me if I don't join
the group hug.

806
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:49,365
I thought he killed you.

807
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:50,449
Oh, he did.

808
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:51,492
Yes.

809
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,037
I got better.

810
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:57,289
Hmm.

811
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,291
You promised
you'd let me go alone.

812
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,835
True.

813
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,753
But I didn't say anything
about following.

814
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:06,590
What's wrong?

815
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:10,719
Isn't it past her bedtime?

816
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:18,394
Hmm?

817
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:35,828
Ah!

818
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,872
Sleeping on the job?

819
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:40,624
Luci, we still have
to find Malcolm...

820
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,376
Malcolm, yes.

821
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:43,919
That's dealt with.
It's old news, really.

822
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,637
Where's Maze?

823
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:55,514
Well, I was gonna ask you
the same question.

824
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:57,433
Perhaps your snoring
drove her away.

825
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:04,690
I spoke to Dad.

826
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:06,525
Excuse me?

827
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:09,904
Yeah. I offered Him my services
in exchange f...

828
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:12,865
Well, that doesn't
really matter.

829
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,617
He accepted.

830
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:19,163
He replied to you.

831
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,372
Mmm.

832
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,208
Well, not in words.

833
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:23,542
But His message was clear.

834
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:25,294
And what does Father want?

835
00:42:26,921 --> 00:42:28,255
Someone's escaped from Hell.

836
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:32,384
Must've seen
a window of opportunity

837
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:34,386
whilst you were incapacitated.

838
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:35,846
I think He wants
me to bring

839
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:37,223
our jailbird back.

840
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:38,974
That's it?

841
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:40,726
Well, it shouldn't be too hard

842
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:42,811
to track down
a single errant soul.

843
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:51,237
You're afraid.

844
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:55,074
Mmm.

845
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:56,534
Damn right I am.

846
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,869
Right, but you're never afraid.

847
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:00,913
Who could possibly
scare you, brother?

848
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:06,669
Lucifer...

849
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:09,588
Who escaped Hell?

850
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,302
Mum.
