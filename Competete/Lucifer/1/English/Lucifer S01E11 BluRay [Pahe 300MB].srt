We're done.

7
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:15,266
Do you want to go back?

Did we ever.

And I'm pretty sure we made
Rosemary's baby.

38
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:46,900
Oh, Detective,
it was extraordinary.

39
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:49,235
The heat, the gymnastics.

40
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:52,238
I mean, you had moves
that made even the Devil blush.

41
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:54,324
Oh, no, this is bad.

42
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,743

00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,328
don't tell me,

00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,415
We didn't?

46
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,417
Nope, I turned you down cold.

47
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,878
You, the guy who's been trying
to get me into the sack

48
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:10,215
since day one had a chance
to sleep with me,

49
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:11,216
and you did...?

50
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:12,801
Why-why am I naked?

51
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,177
What, you mean you don't
remember the part

52
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,304
where you passed out,
woke up again,

53
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:19,224
shouted at me, "It's too hot
in this five-story hellhole,"

54
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,101
I believe it was,

55
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,103
then tore your clothes off
and proceeded to hog the bed?

56
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,604
I do that. Sometimes.

57
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,356
When I'm upset.

58
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,942
And you'd be upset, too,
if your ex dumped you by text.

59
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,610
No, I'd be relieved
if Dan dumped me.

60
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,445
Even still,

61
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:34,239
it's very out of character
to see you so unhinged.

62
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:36,574
And out of character
for me, too.

63
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,785
The whole "not wanting
to have sex with you" thing.

64
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,453
I mean, here's
the strange part.

65
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:42,789
This gave me quite a rush.

66
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,332
Can't explain it.

67
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:45,959
I've been thinking
about it all night.

68
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,962
Okay, last night was a fluke.

69
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,463
For both of us.

70
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,757
Never happened,
leave it at that.

71
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:53,758
Right.

72
00:02:56,136 --> 00:02:58,304
You snore, by the way.

73
00:02:58,513 --> 00:02:59,639

Did you finally seal the deal
with your little detective?

78
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:13,486
If we were on speaking terms,
perhaps I'd fill you in.

79
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:14,487
Where are you going?

80
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:15,822
Why do you ask?

81
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,824
You still reporting
back to my brother?

82
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,159

83
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,493
No, do me a favor, Maze.

00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:22,495
How about you let me
lead my life,

85
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,831
and I'll let you
lead yours, deal?

86
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,833
You can't be mad
at me forever.

87
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,502
Oh, but I can.

88
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,546

after our sleepover
last night.

92
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,810
What's the hole at the back for?

93
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:46,811
Not mine.

94
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,146
Those are not mine.

95
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:49,814
More of a commando girl.

96
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:51,149
Fair enough.

97
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:52,650
Dearie me.

98
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,153
Someone woke up on the
wrong side of a.38.

99
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,739
Yeah, single
gunshot wound to the chest.

100
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,282
No wallet.

101
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,826
Tan marks where a ring
and a watch were lifted.

102
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:03,578
A staircase
robbery.

103
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,705
Is that a
thing now?

104
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:07,373
This is the Dunlear Foundation.

105
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,542
They help the homeless
and the underprivileged.

106
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,878
So, who's the dashing corpse?

107
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,881
Tim Dunlear himself,
head of the foundation,

108
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,884
former NBA star,
notorious playboy.

109
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,220
He was into drugs,
gambling, women.

110
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,971
My typical Wednesday.

111
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,724
But then he left pro ball
and he turned his life around.

112
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:27,393
He dedicated himself
to philanthropy.

113
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:28,728
He was beloved.

114
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:31,731
Right, bad boy turned good.

115
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,233
It's interesting.

116
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,567
Are you Emmett Toussaint?

117
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,402
You found the body?

118
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,529
I'm Detective Decker. Can
you tell us what happened?

119
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:41,407
I volunteer for the
foundation's outreach program.

120
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:44,202
Came here to meet him,
and he was just lying here.

121
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,120
How did you know Mr. Dunlear?

122
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,790
He sponsored me to come to L.A.
after the earthquake in Haiti.

123
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,041
Tim was my mentor.

124
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,043
Handsome and saintly.

125
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:53,378
Did you see anyone
else at the scene

126
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:54,671
or notice anything strange?

127
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,673
There was a guy outside.

128
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,341
He ran when he saw me.

129
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,926
I gave the cops a description.

130
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,678
Think he was
homeless.

131
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:05,598
Did Mr. Dunlear ever speak
of a certain philanthropic high

132
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,225
after one of his selfless acts?

133
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,018
You know,
for example,

134
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:11,145
say when he chose not to sleep
with a drunken woman?

135
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,232
What?

136
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,275
Did I say
something wrong?

137
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:18,236
We are questioning a minor.

138
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:22,115
I'm sorry about
your mentor.

139
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,325
We'll call you if we
have any more questions.

140
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,330
What? I just feel
quite connected

141
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,332
to our victim.

142
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,626
You are nothing
like Tim Dunlear.

143
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:35,461
Bad boy with
a heart of gold?

144
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,130
I am everything like Tim.

145
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,715
May as well be solving
my own murder.

146
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,717
Only you could turn
a tragic death

147
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,052
into an excuse
to talk about you.

148
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,848
Well, who else would
I talk about?

149
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,311
Got these on sale.

150
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,272
Extra strong, UV resistant,

151
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,482
and still 30% off.

152
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,946
Do you really think you're
gonna get away with this?

153
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:04,115
Probably not.

154
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:05,825
I'll bet the SWAT
team's about

155
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,828
to bust down the
door any minute.

156
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:10,163
Not like there's
much else going on

157
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,374
in a city of four
million people.

158
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:17,378
As much as I hate Lucifer,
I'm not gonna let you kill him.

159
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,881
Oh, I'm not gonna
do anything. No. Oh.

160
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,551
But you know who
would want him dead?

161
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,678
Someone who's jealous.

162
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,347
Someone who hates the fact

163
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,224
that he's clearly got
a thing for his ex-wife.

164
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:34,312
Ooh.

165
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,149
Someone whose fingerprints I put
all over the murder weapon.

166
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:39,692
Sound like anyone you know, Dan?

167
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:41,986
Ooh.

168
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:45,073
Don't go anywhere.

169
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,707
<i>My husband was so generous.</i>

170
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,210
If they had just asked for help,

171
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,836
he would have given
them anything.

172
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:01,464
What kind of person would
do something like this?

173
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,216
Well, how much time
do you have?

174
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,177
Tim would be devastated
to know we've got to cancel

175
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:07,470
the fund-raising gala.

176
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,222
You're right, Kyle.

177
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,099
Well, we wouldn't want
to devastate our fallen hero.

178
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,934
The show must go on.

179
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,268
This is an active
crime scene.

180
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,437
We can't have
an event here.

181
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:17,772
No, that wouldn't be right.

182
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,607
Well, I just happen to own

183
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,275
the preeminent party
venue in Los Angeles.

184
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,903
You can hold your
benefit at my club.

185
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,196
- I don't know.
- No, no, your husband

186
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:26,531
was a kindred spirit,

187
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,866
and I pledge to carry on
his good work

188
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:32,537
and personally find--
and punish-- his killer.

189
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:35,873
Tim always said
"Tragedy brings sorrow

190
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:37,375
but also true good."

191
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,376
Aw.

192
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,044
Thank you.

193
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:41,462
You are so welcome.

194
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,927
If this was a robbery, our
perp's gonna want to cash in

195
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:49,929
before the cops
get wind of this,

196
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:51,639
so I'll call the
local pawn shops...

197
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:54,225
What is with you today?

198
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:55,560
It was rather benevolent of me,

199
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,562
offering up Lux,
don't you think?

200
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,272
Well, one good deed
doesn't make you a saint.

201
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,441
Well, last I counted,
it was two good deeds.

202
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,193
But, uh, I'm not feeling
the same rush as before.

203
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,945
Perhaps I'm gonna
have to up my game.

204
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:08,614
Whatever you say, St. Lucifer.

205
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:10,950
Oh, "St. Lucifer."

206
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:13,995
Suits me, don't you think?

207
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:27,215
It's funny, I've always looked
at do-gooders with pity.

208
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,969
Little did I know
their dirty secret.

209
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,429
And what's that?

210
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,848
- Feels good to do good.
- Yes.

211
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,518
Good deeds do bring an amount
of personal satisfaction

212
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,103
to those who engage in them.

213
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:42,523
No, but I mean it's like
a literal rush, a high.

214
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,901
Have you ever mixed cocaine
and Molly with Pop Rocks?

215
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,446
It's nothing like that.
I'm just curious.

216
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:51,866
So you're feeling good about not
sleeping with Detective Decker.

217
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,452
Well, yes, and offering Lux
to the Dunlear Foundation,

218
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,996
not to mention vowing
to find Tim's killer.

219
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:59,665
You've identified quite
strongly with this man.

220
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:02,001
Yes. Yes, a man
of honor, principle.

221
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,879
Hmm. You like the way
being good makes you feel.

222
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,631
- Mm.
- But true good needs

223
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,051
to come from a place
of selflessness, authenticity.

224
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,761
Well, of course.

225
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,013
I authentically want people
to applaud the real me.

226
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,681
The Devil gets
a terrible rap.

227
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,560
So you care about image,
how you look to others.

228
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,395
And you're welcome.

229
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:25,566
Okay, my point is, it's
wonderful that you're evolving.

230
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:26,692
Right.

231
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:29,487
But goodness isn't a toy.

232
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,031
Well, the way I'm going
to play with it, it is.

233
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,122
<i>I'm in between gigs.</i>

234
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:43,417
I'm no thief, I'm an actor,
Louie Delgado.

235
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:47,255
I had an arc on <i>Party of Five,</i> look me up.

236
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,924
I love L.A. Even the homeless
have an IMDb page.

237
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,592
You care to explain
why you were

238
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:53,511
caught pawning
Tim Dunlear's championship ring?

239
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,555
Listen, more importantly, why
did you take it to a pawnshop?

240
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,890
The Dark Web has
much better margins.

241
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,017
- I swear I didn't do nothing.
Witnesses put
you at the scene.

242
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:01,936
You're telling me this wasn't
a robbery gone wrong?

243
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,522
He was already dead,
been like that for a bit.

244
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,232
Rigor mortis
had set in.

245
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,776
I also did a guest spot on CSI.

246
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:09,777
Ah.

247
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:11,779
Tim was my buddy,

248
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:14,865
one of the few people who
treated me like a human being.

249
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,867
Would your buddy have approved
of you stealing valuables

250
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,869
from his cold dead corpse?

251
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:20,538
Tim didn't care about stuff.

252
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:23,124
Would have wanted me
to have that ring.

253
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,458
Give you the shirt
off his back.

254
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:25,459
What about his wallet?

255
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,629
Uh, I was gonna return that.

256
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,632
Some kind of key card.

257
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:32,925
I have an alibi.

258
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,135
I was at a shelter on 7th.

259
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,886
Uh-huh.
Keep an eye on Louie.

260
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:38,264
I'm gonna see if
his story checks out.

261
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:45,438
I also know what it's like
to be without a home.

262
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:46,939
My father
kicked me out.

263
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:48,941
It's very traumatic.

264
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,987
But, much like Tim Dunlear,
I'd like to do whatever it takes

265
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,823
to help you, so, here,
the shirt off my back.

266
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:58,284
Yeah.

267
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,910
And, uh, as you can see,

268
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,496
the Devil does
indeed wear Prada.

269
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,790
Wow, thanks, brother.

270
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,334
Yes, disastrous

271
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,336
with those trousers, though.

272
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:09,337
Oh, what the hell?

273
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:10,963
As gratitude for telling us

274
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:14,467
everything you know.

275
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,721
And he's naked.

276
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,014
Another act

277
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,349
of selfless benevolence.

278
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:22,391
It's quite liberating,
actually.

279
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,726
Oh, don't forget.

280
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,061
Dry-clean only.

281
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,479
His story checks out.

282
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:27,688
We need to get a full
written statement.

283
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:28,814
And get our guy
some lunch, okay?

284
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,107
No-no gluten

285
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:32,109
or-or dairy, okay?

286
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,154
Another good deed

287
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:36,989
but still no rush like before.

288
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,366
Am I doing this wrong?

289
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:40,076
In so many ways.

290
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,577
Oh?

291
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,871
You're not getting
in my car like that.

292
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,584
Meet you at mine?

293
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:55,883
So, who do we suspect
of this grisly murder?

294
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,386
Maybe Mr. Dunlear wasn't
as saintly as he appeared.

295
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:01,514
Who knows who or what
he was involved with?

296
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,058
He wasn't always
such a good man.

297
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,351
It's hard to shake
your true nature.

298
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,560
Well, not really.
Look at me.

299
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,145
Oh, no, I saw plenty.

300
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:09,730
- Thank you.
- Cheeky.

301
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:12,274
Oh, Lucifer, Detective.

302
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:13,609
I wasn't expecting you.

303
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,236
Yes, we have a few more
questions for you.

304
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,905
Yes, how are you holding up?

305
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:19,573
Doing my best.

306
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:20,449
One moment at a time.

307
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:21,742
Mrs. Dunlear,

308
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:23,160
can you think
of any personal reason

309
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:24,787
why someone would want
to kill your husband?

310
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,539
I thought this was a robbery.

311
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,165
No, turns out

312
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:29,792
your husband was dead
before our homeless thespian

313
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,711
pilfered his valuables.

314
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,962
Did Tim have any enemies?

315
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,338
Anyone that would
want to hurt him?

316
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:35,423
No, absolutely not.

317
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:36,632
Everybody loved Tim.

318
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,259
Will Fleming--

319
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,261
counsel for the foundation
and the Dunlears.

320
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:41,387
This won't take long,
Mr. Fleming.

321
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,097
Well, you're absolutely correct,

322
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,265
because my client is done here.

323
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,433
- Wha...?
- Oh.

324
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,559
Actually I'm

325
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,561
just here to talk to Vanessa

326
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,104
about the gala--
is that, uh,

327
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,605
is that all right?
Are you up to that?

328
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:52,732
Yes, of course.

329
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,983
Lovely.

330
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,486
So I know it's not a
good time, Vanessa.

331
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:58,988
But I want
to discuss...

332
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,698
My client is grieving.

333
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,116
You have any questions,
you talk to me.

334
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,784
All right, can you establish

335
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:05,828
Vanessa's whereabouts at
the time of Tim's death?

336
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,705
Are you accusing
my client of murder?

337
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,458
No, but one quarter of murders
are committed by family members.

338
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,585
Yes, and half by acquaintances.

339
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,128
Which gets to my next question.

340
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,671
Where were you the
night of Tim's death?

341
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,506
Listen, you can look
at me all you want.

342
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:20,426
But Tim came into contact with a
lot of people around this place.

343
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,303
Desperate people.

344
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,598
Why do I get the feeling you
have someone specific in mind?

345
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,641
Did you ever
fight with Tim?

346
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,605
Last night.

347
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,774
You didn't tell me that earlier.

348
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,358
I was ashamed.

349
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,277
Tim told me
I might not be receiving

350
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:40,780
the scholarship money
he promised.

351
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,198
I got angry.

352
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,993
Said some things.

353
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:49,663
I was going
to go apologize, but...

354
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,166
when I got there...

355
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,460
I'm gonna need to test you
for gunshot residue.

356
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,545
And get a full
written statement.

357
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:58,881
Whatever you need.

358
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,511
First, I want you
to tell me more about

359
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,845
Tim and his relationship

360
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,847
with Vanessa--
what was it like?

361
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:08,974
Great...

362
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,684
when the cameras were on.

363
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,728
And when they were off?

364
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,857
<i>Ah, Detective, you made it.</i>

365
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,776
A little underdressed,
but okay.

366
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,694
What happened with
the orphan child?

367
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,863
We're holding him,
waiting on ballistics.

368
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:25,699
But he had a lot to say about
the Dunlears' perfect marriage.

369
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,202
Apparently Tim hadn't
slept at home in months.

370
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,620
Well, it's probably
all those good deeds.

371
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:31,163
So time-consuming.

372
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,165
Or... I was right.

373
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,750
And Tim was back
to his old ways.

374
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,544
You know, that key card
we found in his wallet

375
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,420
was from a hotel, so maybe
he was cheating on Vanessa,

376
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:39,880
she found out,

377
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:41,423
- then decided to...
- Punish the cheating bastard

378
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,883
by pumping him full of lead.

379
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,885
Well, that's option "A."

380
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:46,011
Option "B" is the lawyer isn't
telling us everything he knows.

381
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,680
Option "C" is

382
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,557
an emotionally distraught
mistress did him in.

383
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,851
Ah, that old chestnut--
if I can't have him, no one can.

384
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,227
What did you get from Vanessa?

385
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,311
- Is that why we're here?
- Yes, yes.

386
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,729
She asked me to have lunch

387
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,273
with the golden donors
of the foundation

388
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,774
on her behalf.

389
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,025
It's the least I could do.

390
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:01,735
Oh, the very least.

391
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,863
What better way to get intel
on a murder than a gaggle

392
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,072
of high-society frenemies?

393
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,615
- Oh.
- Ah!

394
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,242
<i>Tim Dunlear</i>

395
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,910
was a true humanitarian.

396
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,954
Oh, there's
so few of us around.

397
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,747
And I have no one
to help me process my grief.

398
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,541
Can you believe
my therapist had the nerve

399
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,917
to go on maternity leave?

400
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,794
Oh, well,
I'm here for you, Gayle.

401
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:20,796
You can tell me anything.

402
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:22,590
Oh.

403
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:23,757
Oh, ooh...

404
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:27,636
You are a good man.

405
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,388
Yeah, not quite the reaction

406
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:32,266
I was looking for,
but, uh, when in Rome.

407
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,434
To Tim Dunlear.

408
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:35,185
We all loved him.

409
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,938
Mm-hmm, some more than others.

410
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:39,607
So you heard about Donna Gray?

411
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,650
- Oh, yeah.
- So sad.

412
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,944
Throwing yourself
at a married man like that.

413
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:45,696
Mm, and when they started
sleeping together,

414
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,740
poor Vanessa.

415
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,825
Tim turned Donna down cold.

416
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:51,619
Not that it's any

417
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:52,953
of your business.

418
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,496
Oh.

419
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,584
Tight-lipped and angry.

420
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,336
Yes, well,
with all that Botox,

421
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,838
I'm surprised
she can chew at all.

422
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:05,132
This is taking too long-- maybe
we should do your hypnotism,

423
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,968
- eye-voodoo thing
to get them talking.
- Yes.

424
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,137
You would expect that sort of
behavior from me, wouldn't you?

425
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,306
Yeah, you making a spectacle
to help out a case.

426
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,974
Yeah, it's what you do.

427
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,559
Don't worry, Detective.
There'll be a spectacle.

428
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,353
These women

429
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,813
are lonely and unappreciated.

430
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,982
If I give them what they want,
they'll give us what we want.

431
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,485
Hello, ladies.

432
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,988
Thank you all so much
for coming today.

433
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,823
Uh, you've all given so
generously over the years

434
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:32,034
to the Dunlear Foundation.

435
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,161
In honor of our fallen hero,

436
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,704
I now give you a gift

437
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:36,830
in return.

438
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,457
Me.

439
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,670

Why-why are you

456
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,339
Tim is dead!

457
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,341
Shame on you.

458
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,302
And shame on all of you.

459
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:38,017
And I give you option "D."

460
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,560
Let's go.

461
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,020
- I love you.
- Thank you.

462
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,359
It's true.

463
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,487
I loved him.

464
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,072
Kyle, Tim Dunlear
was a hero to all of us.

465
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,115
No, no.

466
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,159
You don't understand.

467
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:59,455
Tim and I were in love.

468
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,081
- Oh.
- Oh.

469
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,791
Right,

470
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,210
so Tim <i>was</i> cheating
on his wife with a man.

471
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,962
I did not see that coming.

472
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,922
The Devil usually has
impeccable gaydar.

473
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,633
Tim was, uh, in denial

474
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,635
about his sexuality for years.

475
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:16,930
And then, um...

476
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,807
we met.

477
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,684
Hmm, that explains why
he was never at home

478
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,311
and all the secrecy.

479
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,146
Did you two ever
meet at a hotel?

480
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,689
No.

481
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,316
No, that-that
would've been too public.

482
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,486
Uh, we only ever met
at my apartment.

483
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:31,779
Huh.
What about Vanessa?

484
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:32,988
Did she know?

485
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,823
They, um,

486
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,116
you know,
they-they had an arrangement.

487
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,744
Tim wanted it kept secret.

488
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,996
And Vanessa agreed.

489
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:44,541
She needed
the Tim Dunlear brand.

490
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,543
Monogamy fails again.

491
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,337
So, if Tim didn't
want out of the closet,

492
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,881
were you aware of anyone that
would want to blackmail him?

493
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,508
Or threaten to
go to the press?

494
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,717
No.

495
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:54,802
Um...

496
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:58,722
But Tim texted me this photo

497
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,015
for safekeeping.

498
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,351
I... I have no idea

499
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,812
what it means.

500
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,231
- Hmm.
- It's actually
the last I ever

501
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,191
heard from him before...

502
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,571
Do you want another song?

503
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:20,202
If there's one thing I know
about kimchi fried rice,

504
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,498
it's that heat really
kicks things up a notch.

505
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,917
You almost died.
You came back,

506
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:28,544
and this is what you do
with your second chance?

507
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:35,300
You know what happens
when you die?

508
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,553
I can't say I do.

509
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,139
Well, if you've lived a life

510
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,058
like I did, you go to Hell.

511
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,560
Oh, yeah.

512
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,563
In my case, it was for
a couple of seconds.

513
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:50,899
Down there, though,
it was years...

514
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:52,734
and years.

515
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,403
And there's a door
just for you.

516
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,738
And inside, Hell

517
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,324
uses what you
love against you.

518
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:02,661
For me, I love life.

519
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,539
Everything about it.
Got a hunger for it.

520
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,958
So...

521
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,169
they starved me.

522
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,962
No food.

523
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,755
No other people.

524
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,132
No nothing.

525
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,925
No TV.

526
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,427
Malcolm?

527
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,928
Hmm?

528
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:21,263
You need help.

529
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,939
You always were a scrappy one.

530
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,775
Ah.

531
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,403
Yeah.

532
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:39,072
I do need help.

533
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,116
Never to go back.

534
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,659
So I made a deal.

535
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,453
And all I got to do

536
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,955
is put a bullet in Lucifer.

537
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,458
I pull the trigger.

538
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,503
You take the fall.

539
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:56,757
Huh?

540
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,177
Huh? Huh?

541
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:11,230
Five-second rule.

542
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,865
Teaching,

543
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,617
building,

544
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,327
creating.

545
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,870
I'm Tim Dunlear.

546
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,330
Together we can
educate Haiti today

547
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,540
for their better tomorrow.

548
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,011
Mr. Fleming?

549
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,513
What are you doing here?

550
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,139
I understand
you've been asking

551
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,975
some pretty invasive
questions at a luncheon.

552
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,143
I have reason to believe
that your client

553
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,854
knows more than she's letting on
about her husband's death.

554
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,856
Vanessa Dunlear's entire world
has fallen apart.

555
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,359
I mean, what kind of a person
targets a-a grieving woman?

556
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,319
A very rich grieving woman

557
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,029
who stands to inherit
her husband's estate.

558
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:04,199
Every cent that Tim had
goes back into that foundation.

559
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,661
Which you would know,

560
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,663
because now that Tim's gone,
you took control.

561
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,415
That's an interesting
turn of events.

562
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,375
You are messing with
the wrong people, Detective.

563
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,210
Good people.

564
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,253
Back off.

565
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:21,049
♪ I want you... ♪

566
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,347
You'd never know that Lux was
a den of iniquity, would you?

567
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:30,183
Well, as long as you don't
look too closely at the floors.

568
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,102
Will Fleming wants
to scare me off?

569
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:33,937
Bring it on.

570
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:36,273
Question is, whether he's
protecting himself or Vanessa.

571
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,859
Or maybe
they're just good people.

572
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,235
Because you're
suddenly the authority?

573
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:41,695
Give me a break.

574
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,865
Detective,
even if Vanessa is guilty,

575
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,451
this is a woman who's denied
herself carbs since the '90s

576
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,077
and stayed married
to a gay man.

577
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,954
If she doesn't want
to talk, she won't.

578
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:52,748
And as for their attorney,

579
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,249
well, he certainly
doesn't strike me

580
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,751
- as the confessional type.
- Okay.

581
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,253
Maybe I can't get them to talk,
but you can.

582
00:22:58,462 --> 00:22:59,588
Come on.

583
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:00,714
I've seen you do it
dozens of times.

584
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:01,715
No.

585
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,133
Not here. Not tonight.

586
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:04,801
Am I missing something?

587
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,762
I feel like you're protecting
our main suspects.

588
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,722
No, I'm just thinking
about the children.

589
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,017
You want to push pause
on a murder investigation

590
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,769
so you can have a party?

591
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,270
Detective, I made a promise.

592
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,272
The ladies,
the-the foundation,

593
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,608
the proud nation of Haiti...

594
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,068
they're all depending on me

595
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,319
tonight.

596
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,112
Now, Tim Dunlear may be dead,

597
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:25,781
but his legacy lives on,

598
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,075
and right now he needs to go
change into his tux.

599
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,994
It's about the greater good,
Detective.

600
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,872
The greater good would be
parking your ego

601
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,415
and helping catch the bad guy.

602
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:37,834
The old Lucifer
would have known that.

603
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:38,960
Wh...

604
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,004
I miss him, by the way.

605
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,633
At least he had my back.

606
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,845
Detective!

607
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,275
Oh...

608
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,319
Glad someone's
having a good night.

609
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,490
What are you doing here?

610
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,742
You've ruined my life.

611
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:13,495
The least I could do
is ruin your night.

612
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,539
Enjoy your evening.

613
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,166
How'd you even
find me, Maze?

614
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,293
Followed the sweet stench
of failure.

615
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,964
Look, don't blame me
for your problems, all right?

616
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,132
It's not my fault

617
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,591
that you betrayed your boss.

618
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,262
My problems are your problems.

619
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,848
Which would be the only thing
that you and I have in common.

620
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,182
And so you came here because...

621
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,436
...because you have

622
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,687
nowhere else to go?

623
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,856
Yes, I do.

624
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,607
I have lots of places to go.

625
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,277
Lots of places.

626
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,696
And because you have
no one else to talk to, either.

627
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,532
Says the angel sitting here

628
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,868
eating a medium rare steak

629
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,369
by himself.

630
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,006
What?

631
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,008
It's not like you were
going to drink it.

632
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,009
You're so boring.

633
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:10,719
I'm actually not boring.

634
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,762
I'm pretty exciting.

635
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:19,853
My definition of "excitement"

636
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,605
is fun.

637
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,315
Danger.

638
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:24,649
Sex.

639
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,152
Spontaneity.

640
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,029
You are none of those things.

641
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:33,533
Yes, I am.

642
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,076
Give me one example.

643
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,458
You know that story
about Lucifer and the goat?

644
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,919
Yeah?

645
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:47,255
No.

646
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:49,674
That was you?

647
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,051
That was me.

648
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,219
A whisper here,

649
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:55,347
a divine
appearance there...

650
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,224
Word got around.

651
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,725
He hates the goat thing.

652
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,060
I know!

653
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:01,228
He could never figure out

654
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,063
where it came from.

655
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,690
You know, I've waited a thousand
years to tell someone that.

656
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,115
Leave the bottle.

657
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,122
Thank you for this, Kyle. I know
it's your job on the line.

658
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,290
Whatever it takes.

659
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:25,585
I want to find who did this.

660
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,129
Thank you.

661
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,968
So this here, this
last text from Tim--

662
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,427
looks like it was
from Port-au-Prince.

663
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:35,595
Tim didn't tell me

664
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,097
he was going there.

665
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:38,473
It wasn't on his calendar.

666
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,477
Could he have traveled
under the radar?

667
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,481
Sometimes he booked
his own travel.

668
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,816
He-he had some buddies

669
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,317
who own private jets.

670
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,694
Sometimes they would travel
as a group.

671
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,279
So if Tim stayed
in a hotel there,

672
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:53,613
maybe that's why
he had the key card.

673
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:54,739
Third-world
technology.

674
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,157
Maybe that's why

675
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,951
we couldn't read
the magnetic strip.

676
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,161
We do charity work
in Port-au-Prince.

677
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,622
We raised money to buy land
to build a school.

678
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:04,791
Maybe that's what the text
of the barren field was.

679
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,293
That photo was from
a few days ago.

680
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,670
The school would be
almost finished by now.

681
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,173
Unless it was never built.

682
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,802
Unless the money
the foundation raised

683
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,138
went somewhere else.

684
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,183
Or to someone else.

685
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,325
Really?

686
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,619
That's your move?

687
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,996
You were planning to seduce me?

688
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,998
That is...
truly desperate.

689
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,666
I'm not here
to seduce you, Will.

690
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,377
But I do know what you desire.

691
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,505
What is it you think I desire,

692
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,132
Detective?

693
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:55,300
To do good.

694
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,177
To help people.

695
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,179
I did some research
into you, Will,

696
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,680
and apparently, you don't charge

697
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:02,849
for your services
here at the foundation.

698
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:04,017
I make a nice living,

699
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,560
thanks to my corporate work.

700
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,437
Yeah, you protect your clients
like a bulldog,

701
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:09,397
but underneath it all,
you're a big softie, aren't you?

702
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:12,651
I don't need to take money
away from those kids.

703
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,402
No.

704
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:15,820
But Vanessa does.

705
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:16,738
What the hell does that mean?

706
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,073
I looked into a school

707
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,783
that was supposed to be built

708
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:21,034
with the foundation's money
in Port-au-Prince.

709
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,746
It doesn't exist.

710
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,374
What?

711
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,084
I think the money
went elsewhere.

712
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,252
After all, Vanessa had
a hell of an expensive lifestyle

713
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,338
to keep up after her husband
left the NBA.

714
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,173
That is ridiculous.

715
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:38,051
Besides, non-profit financials
are a matter of public record.

716
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,803
They are.

717
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,471
But they're so complicated,
it would be pretty easy

718
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,848
to hide a few
outgoing wire transfers.

719
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:46,017
Here. I think Tim Dunlear

720
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,727
looked into these financials
and figured it out.

721
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,021
So he flew to Pout Au Prince
to see for himself,

722
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,189
and when he realized

723
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:52,691
where the money went,

724
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,401
he confronted Vanessa

725
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:55,944
and she killed him.

726
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,738
That is pure speculation.

727
00:28:58,947 --> 00:28:59,739
It is.

728
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:01,366
So help me get proof.

729
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,576
If Vanessa transferred
money to herself,

730
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,412
it'll show up in her
personal financial records,

731
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,247
which you have access to.

732
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,040
You want me to violate
my client's trust

733
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:10,542
based on a hunch?

734
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,544
You took this job
to make a difference.

735
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,963
This foundation
can still do good

736
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,798
the way Tim
wanted it to.

737
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:18,299
If you help me.

Is that you?

743
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,474
Hope you've come to your senses.

744
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,851
Well, that depends on who
you ask, Mr. Morningstar.

745
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:12,479
I'm here to murder you.

746
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,816
Well... that is a buzzkill.

747
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,448
I'm sorry, strange,
disheveled gunman,

748
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:24,657
have we met?

749
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:26,618
Briefly.

750
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:28,244
Detective
Malcolm Graham.

751
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,038
Ah, yes, of course!

752
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,206
The infamous Malcolm.

753
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:33,708
Tough times?

754
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:34,918
You here to steal my watch?

755
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:36,419
Well, there's no need.

756
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,922
You've caught me
in a charitable mood.

757
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,381
You could also use
a decent suit.

758
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,382
The closet's that way.

759
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:42,634
Thanks.

760
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,052
I'm still going to kill you.

761
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,804
Ah...

762
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,806
I should also mention that
if you pull that trigger,

763
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:50,058
it's a one-way ticket
to eternal damnation.

764
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:51,100
Hell?

765
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,229
Oh, I'm not going to Hell.

766
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:55,271
Now or ever again.

767
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,606
No?

768
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:58,858
See, I made a deal
with an angel.

769
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,402
And I've got orders
to take you out.

770
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,404
Your ass for mine.

771
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,284
Sorry, it's...

772
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:11,079
My holier-than-thou brother
has hired someone to kill me?

773
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,122
Well, this really is
Opposite Day, isn't it?

774
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,251
You know what, Malcolm?

775
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:20,380
It's nighttime now.

776
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:23,550
It's funny how things seem
so much clearer in the dark.

777
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:29,222
Is that all you got?

778
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,767
Interesting.

779
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:35,770
Most people wet themselves
when they see my nastier side.

780
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,438
Huh.

781
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:38,982
Well, most people haven't
been to Hell and back.

782
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,402
Rumor says

783
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,903
you're not
immortal anymore.

784
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:46,281
That if I pull
this trigger,

785
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:47,907
it's bye-bye, Devil.

786
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,284
Of course.

787
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,119
Right. And what do you
get in return,

788
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:52,412
Malcolm?

789
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,038
Your brother
doesn't kill me.

790
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:57,000
I stay out of Hell,
live out my life.

791
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,459
I love life.

792
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,133
You've been duped, Malcolm.

793
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:06,426
Huh?

794
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:07,927
Angels can't take a mortal life.

795
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:09,137
It's Dad's rules.

796
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:11,014
Sorry.

797
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:14,434
And even if you do kill me...

798
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,269
what happens when you do die?

799
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:19,355
Because you will...
eventually.

800
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:21,107
You'll still go
back to Hell, Malcolm.

801
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:22,609
There's nothing

802
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,944
that my brother can
do to prevent that.

803
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,991
What's that?

804
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,576
This?

805
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,912
This is my Pentecostal coin.

806
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,249
It's a subway token for
the damned, if you will.

807
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:42,253
I was going to use it to get
back to Hell eventually.

808
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,715
I suppose you could use it
to get out of Hell, too.

809
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,177
Could come in handy
for someone like you,

810
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:50,553
don't you think, Malcolm?

811
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,226
It's all yours
if you don't shoot me.

812
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,606
One-time offer.

00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,352

814
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,855

There you are.

825
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,759
Can't very well start our party
without our guest of honor.

826
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:12,885
Mrs. Dunlear.

827
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,555
Are you okay?

828
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:18,224
Yes, yes, I just needed
a little pick-me-up.

829
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,726
It's been an exhausting day.

830
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:22,729
Facing one's mortality
will do that.

831
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:25,440
I think we'll all deserve
a vacation after tonight,

832
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:27,400
a chance to mourn
Tim properly.

833
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,444
I fly out tomorrow.

834
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:32,363
One of those Swiss med spas
that masquerades as a resort?

835
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:33,865
No.

836
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:36,367
No, I own a small ranch
outside of Buenos Aires.

837
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,202
Lovely.

838
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,204
I knew some folks who moved
to Buenos Aires back in the day.

839
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:41,748
Oh. Good people?

840
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:45,293
Nazis. No extradition treaty
in Argentina.

841
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:48,880
Just a nasty bunch of miscreants
hiding in plain sight.

842
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,256
Gosh, they got away with murder.

843
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,765
You did kill your husband,
didn't you?

844
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:00,808
No, that's absurd.

845
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:02,477
I have to admit,
I'm not entirely sure why,

846
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:03,895
but Detective Decker
will figure it out.

847
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:04,896
She always does.

848
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,230
I loved him.

849
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,024
And Tim loved me.

850
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:09,692
Well, no, technically,
he loved your assistant, Kyle.

851
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:13,196
Yes, but I...
I would never...

852
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:15,573
Tim was a good man.

853
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:16,991
He was selfless...

854
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,993
Yes.

855
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:20,828
Yes, he was.

856
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,498
Everybody loved Tim, and he
asked for nothing in return,

857
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:26,125
not even his own happiness.

858
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:29,462
Well, as the old saying goes,
you can't keep a good man down,

859
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,130
not even in death.

860
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:34,801
So how about we go downstairs,

861
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:37,345
see this night through,
and then...

862
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,014
Oh, bloody hell.

863
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:50,525
Lucifer! Where's Lucifer?

864
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:53,736
Lucifer Morningstar,
where is he?

865
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:55,071
Out of the way.

866
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,781
Hey!

867
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:11,462
You're alive.

868
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:15,675
Yes.

869
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:17,677
Yes, it would appear
that way, wouldn't it?

870
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:21,013
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

871
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,891
I came to stop Malcolm;
he's planning to shoot you.

872
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,226
Malcolm?

873
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,228
No, no, this wasn't him.

874
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:29,105
He's taken care of.

875
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,399
He is?

876
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:33,276
How?

877
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,611
Well, I made him an offer
that he couldn't...

878
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,613
You know the line.

879
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:39,615
You look terrible, by the way.

880
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:40,908
Rough day at the office?

881
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:42,785
Uh, yeah.

882
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:44,745
Yeah, you could say that.

883
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:47,456
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a charity to attend

884
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:49,292
and a killer to punish.

885
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:51,586
How do I look?

886
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:54,797
Pretty good, actually.

887
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:57,133
Yes, I thought as much.

888
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:01,137
Oh, have a drink.

889
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,805
Two, if you like.

890
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:05,183
Who says the Devil
can't be charitable?

891
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:10,396
Thank you all
so much for your generosity.

892
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:13,733
I would also like to thank
our host, Mr. Morningstar.

893
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:17,069
He was going to say a few words,
but unfortunately he's been...

894
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:19,113
Right on time.

895
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:21,741
How are we all
this evening, eh?

896
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:23,492
Such a well-preserved crowd.

897
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,494
Love your work,
Dr. Broffman.

898
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,330
Tucking marvelous.

899
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:31,667
Right, we're all here to honor
Tim Dunlear's legacy,

900
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:35,588
and what better way to do that
than to reveal his killer?

901
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:39,508
Wouldn't you agree,
Mrs. Dunlear?

902
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:42,511
Time to show your friends
your true colors.

903
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,389
Tell them all your
nasty desires.

904
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,018
No need.

905
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:51,020
We already have everything,

906
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:53,814
how she embezzled money
from the foundation,

907
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:56,525
and when Tim found out about it,
you killed him.

908
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:57,693
Ah, see?

909
00:37:57,902 --> 00:37:58,861
Told you she'd
figure it out.

910
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,821
You have no proof.

911
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,323
Actually, we do.

912
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:03,824
We have proof
of the embezzlement,

913
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,451
and that's enough
for probable cause.

914
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,828
Vanessa...

915
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,832
I earned that money.

916
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,502
I supported him
when he left pro ball.

917
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,379
I let him sleep
with my assistant.

918
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:18,047
- Oh.
- That money should
go to me,

919
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:19,715
not those kids.

920
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:21,342
Tim was going
to ruin everything.

921
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,678
I had to.

922
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,639
Now, doesn't that feel better?

923
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,224
Huh?

924
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:29,642
Vanessa Dunlear,
you're under arrest

925
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,018
for the murder
of Tim Dunlear.

926
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:35,356
Thank you.

927
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,024

Kyle saying that someone gave

money to Emmett Toussaint's
scholarship fund,

981
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:29,738
enough for a full ride.

982
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:31,907
An anonymous donor.

983
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:34,243

00:41:34,452 --> 00:41:35,828

Mm-hmm.

00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:38,914
- Listen, Detective, I...
- I want...

987
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:39,915
- Oh.
- Sorry.

988
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:41,333
No, you.

989
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:48,549
Um, I've been thinking a lot
about the other night,

990
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:52,553
why I showed up drunk
to your place,

991
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:57,016
why you wouldn't sleep with me,

992
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:59,685
and I think us,

993
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:02,688
our thing,

994
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:06,025
maybe it goes beyond just work.

995
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,360
- Or sex.
- What sex?

996
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:11,530
Congratulations, the first woman
to give the Devil blue balls.

997
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:14,200
Anyhow,

998
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:17,536
I, uh, I just...

999
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:24,793
...I can let my guard
down with you.

1000
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:26,921
I don't do that
with anyone else.

1001
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:29,924
You make me vulnerable.

1002
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:34,011
And... maybe that's okay.

1003
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:39,642
Detective...

1004
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:46,148
...if it's any consolation
to your pride...

1005
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:49,818
it appears you make me
vulnerable, too.
