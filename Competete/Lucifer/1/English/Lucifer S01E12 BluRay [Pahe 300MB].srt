Bye-bye, Devil.

my Pentecostal coin.

That puts you

14
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:27,404
Well, I was his inside woman,

00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:56,761
Chloe Decker is the one

Who knows
what she's hiding.

55
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:00,765
Yes, she seems to be
the one thing that can hurt me,

56
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:03,226
but there may be
other things as well.

57
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,728
The detective may simply be
a cog in a bigger machine.

58
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:06,980
This is called being thorough.

59
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,022
More like denial.

60
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,482
Because if you really thought

61
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:10,817
that I could hurt you
with these,

62
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,235
you wouldn't let me

63
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,528
throw them at you.

64
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:17,323
Very funny.

65
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:19,159

00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,791
how's my brother?

69
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:30,628
Three weeks
of a whole lot of this?

70
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:33,047
How do you think he's doing?

71
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:34,382
You're not going
steady, Maze.

72
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:36,050
You're getting close
to him for a reason.

73
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,051
Don't forget it.

74
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,261
I haven't.

75
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,679
And I don't think Amenadiel

76
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:41,181

77
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:42,557
You don't <i>think?</i>

78
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,517
Game's too dangerous
to be guessing.

79
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:46,519
I <i>think</i> it's time to send

80
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,730
my brother back to high Heaven.

81
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,568
Forcibly, if necessary.

82
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,536
See, there is something else.

83
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:06,080
It seems Italian marble
is also a threat, so...

84
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,626
Oh.

85
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:10,877
Detective?

86
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,212
What a surprise.

87
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,713
Where have you been?

88
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,048
Ah, you know me--
busy, busy.

89
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:16,925
- No rest for the wicked.
- Right.

90
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,886

is so time-consuming.

91
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,137
Want to watch?

92
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:22,222

00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,683
Why are you avoiding me?

95
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:27,268
Well, I do have a business
to run, Detective.

96
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:29,229
I can't play

98
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:32,982

100
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,612
What's so special about it?

101
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:41,532
You just have
to see for yourself.

102
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,868

Yeah, excuse me, Detective,
I'm not hearing

120
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,316
any reasons to why
you need me on this case.

121
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:16,776
I don't know
how you can hear anything--

122
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:17,860
you're standing

00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:18,861

I don't want to get sick.

126
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:22,573
Really? Let's go.

127
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:24,784
Satan is here, but God is near!

128
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:26,869
Satan is here, but God is near!
Satan is here...

129
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,038
You.

130
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:30,707
Evil is here.

131
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,917

Friend of yours?

134
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,756
- Satan is here, but God is near!
- I meet a lot of people.

135
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:39,882
Satan is here, but God...

136
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,926
Take the sheet off.

137
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,810
Oh, well.

138
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,770
That is unfortunate.

139
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,316
But I still don't understand
why you need me on this case.

140
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,026
Roll her over.

141
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,114

I know.

145
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:23,926
It's horrific.

146
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,845
No, I mean, to
blame it on me.

147
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:27,430
It's an atrocity.

148
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,140
These Satanists.

149
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:31,059
Misguided cult nobheads

150
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,560
with Frisbees in
their earlobes.

151
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,103
This poor girl's death

152
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,730
has nothing to do
with me, Detective.

153
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,398
This is your doing!
This is your fault!

154
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:38,733
You, what are you
doing in here?

155
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:39,859
You're the Devil!

156
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:41,611
You're the King of All Evil!

157
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,738
You're the King
of All Lies!

158
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,031
You must be destroyed!

159
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,657
I'm gonna give you what for

160
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:47,867
if you don't get out
of my crime scene, pal.

161
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:48,951
Who let this guy through?

162
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,203
He's the Devil!

163
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,454
I'll rise again
against you!

164
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,624
No thanks necessary.

165
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,794
Just wanted to do my part
for the man of the hour.

166
00:06:58,044 --> 00:06:59,253
It's the wink
with the porn stache

167
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,797
sending the wrong message,
I think.

168
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,341
Do you two know
each other?

169
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,093
Nope, just heard
a lot about this guy.

170
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,219
All bad, of course.

171
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,471
Detective Malcolm Graham.

172
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:12,767
I wasn't gonna tell her
we're already buddies.

173
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:15,019
You know,
me trying to kill you,

174
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:16,938
the whole magic coin thing.

175
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,356
TMI-- am I right?

176
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,441
I'd like you to stop
touching me now.

177
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,778
Ah, you're hilarious.

178
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,780
We should get a drink sometime.

179
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,824
Yeah, maybe play some pool, huh?

180
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:35,873
Hey, Chloe?

181
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:38,126
If, uh, if we could talk soon,

182
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,669
some stuff went down
with Malcolm.

183
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,170
I mean, I know now's
a bad time...

184
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,422
Yeah, it is.

185
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,967
This bruising here
around the stab wounds.

186
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,135
Hilt marks maybe.

187
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:48,511
And these.

188
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,346
There's subdermal implants.

189
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:51,889
They don't look fresh.

190
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,141
I don't know what they are.

191
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:54,892
Symbols?
Designs maybe?

192
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,228
Well, not a lot of places do
that kind of body modification.

193
00:07:57,437 --> 00:07:59,814
Malcolm and I will try
to find who put them in.

194
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,524
All right.

195
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,693
He and I have to meet
Rose's father at her apartment.

196
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,361
Right, where
is that exactly?

197
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,364
Uh, 1625 Lynrose.

198
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:09,866
Right, I'll see you there.

199
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,451
What? What-what
are you doing?

200
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:12,743
I'm gonna take my own ride.

201
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:14,120
You're a wretched driver.

202
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,830
Since when?

203
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,126
♪ It's colder now than it was ♪

204
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,837
♪ Yesterday ♪

205
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,173
♪ Warm down south ♪

206
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,466
♪ So I'm on my way... ♪

207
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,009
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

208
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:30,011
- Were you close
with your daughter?
- Yes.

209
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,847
Well, we were
when she was little, but

210
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,016
you know, single father
with a teenage daughter...

211
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,935
Yes, I'm quite familiar
with the absentee father

212
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,353
excuses.

213
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,314
Can you tell us why Rose
marred herself recently

214
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,357
- with subdermal implants?
- What?

215
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,234
That doesn't sound like Rosie.

216
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:48,571
This bookshelf's
been moved a lot.

217
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,958
Oh, lovely.

218
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:04,086
Very mid-century rapist.

219
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,465
Hello, bad guys?

220
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,106
What is this place?

221
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,236
It's a creepy,
secret evil room.

222
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:29,612
You didn't know about this?

223
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,697
No.

224
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:37,620
What's this?

225
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,830
It's a chicken.

226
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,415
Or what's left of it.

227
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,334
If that's supposed to be
an offering for me,

228
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:45,962
then I decline on grounds
of salmonella.

229
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,091
This picture, th--

230
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,385
this isn't Rose.

231
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,055
Mr. Davis, I'm so sorry.

232
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:58,307
But maybe this wasn't
a random attack.

233
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:00,643
Maybe your daughter was involved
with whoever killed her.

234
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,478
It's a large man
by the looks of it,

235
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:06,107
who's, uh,
not a fan of bathing.

236
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,858
This is crazy.

237
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,278
I mean, even if she was
into this stupid Devil thing,

238
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:12,321
she wouldn't have
sacrificed herself.

239
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,615
Yes, but sometimes the people
closest to you can turn on you.

240
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:16,492
Wouldn't you agree, Detective?

241
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,953
Maybe.

242
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,332
"For my Corazon.

243
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,333
Love, Rose."

244
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:25,418
"Corazon" is Spanish for heart.

245
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,920
Could be a term of endearment.

246
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,964
Could be a name.

247
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:33,676
I should've
reached out.

248
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,137
Called more.

249
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,306
I thought I knew her.

250
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:42,268
Oh, yes, I know
exactly how you feel.

251
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,691
Decker.

252
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,444
We called around, found the girl
that gave Rose her subdermals.

253
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,238
Said she, uh, came in a
couple weeks ago with a guy.

254
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,240
Weird guy, apparently,
with a weird name, too,

255
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:57,700
but she can't remember it.

256
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,493
Ask if the name's Corazon.

257
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,622
Hey.
Was the guy's name Corazon?

258
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,165
Yeah, that's it.

259
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,208
Uh, jet black hair,
lots of piercings and tattoos.

260
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,337
Did you hear that?

261
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,047
Yeah, generic Satanist.

262
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,007
What about the, uh, subdermals--
she know what they mean?

263
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,383
No.

264
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:15,801
Says Rose brought them
in herself.

265
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,845
She was super secretive
about 'em.

266
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,013
Uh-huh.

267
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,890
We'll talk soon.

268
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,892
Ah, look at you two.

269
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,310
Marriage falling apart,

270
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,645
trying to work together...

271
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,355
So cute.

272
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,981
Yeah, well, maybe if you hadn't
sent her a break-up text

273
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,858
- while I was unconscious...
- Oh.

274
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:32,693
Hey, speaking of

275
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:35,112
kicking your ass, I'm proud
of you for bouncing back.

276
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,822
Friends fight, right?

277
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,199
Yeah.

278
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,201
Dick.

279
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,548
Why is Lucifer still alive?

280
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:55,549
Oh, it's you.

281
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:57,093
You scared me, dude.

282
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,469
Have you forgotten
what will happen to you

283
00:11:58,678 --> 00:11:59,637
if you don't comply
with our deal?

284
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,556
No, but I forgot to tell you!

285
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,517
Lucifer spilled the beans.

286
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,146
What are you talking about?

287
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:10,564
All that jazz about

288
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,274
condemning me
to eternal damnation?

289
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:13,859
Poppycock, apparently.

290
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:15,861
You're an angel

291
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,280
and Lucifer said that
you're not allowed to kill me.

292
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,408
Plus...

293
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,243
I got this beauty right here.

294
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,620
It's my
get-out-of-Hell-free card.

295
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,420
So...

296
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,631
unless you got
a better offer...

297
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,593
#TeamLucifer.

298
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,971
It's not half bad, this.

299
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,723
I mean, the writing's atrocious,

300
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,433
but it's not complete drivel.

301
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,892
Listen to this:

302
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:49,270
"Satan represents
a beacon of honesty

303
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,606
in a sea of mass
self-deceit."

304
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:53,607
Mmm.

305
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:54,775
And... oh. Hello.

306
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,026
There's a whole chapter on sex.

307
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,153
I like this book.

308
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:00,823
Rose's subdermal implants--

309
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,117
I'm pretty sure they're letters.

310
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,995
But I've arranged them
100 different ways

311
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,456
and I can't come up
with anything significant.

312
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:12,001
"Chili furis"?

313
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,838
"I hurl ficis"?

314
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:19,550
No.

315
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:22,011
But could... could you
come over here, please?

316
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:32,021
Oh, bloody hell.

317
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,192
<i>Filii hircus.</i>
It's Latin.

318
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,693
Means "children of the goat."

319
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:39,236
Why do they always
associate me with goats?

320
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:40,780
I mean, I don't even
like their cheese.

321
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,324
Here we go.

322
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,700
"Church of the Dark Prince."

323
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:49,789
Location is secret.

324
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,166
Looks like you have
to be a member.

325
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,503
Geez, look at
this questionnaire.

326
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,296
Oh, and of course,

327
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:58,672
there's a fee.

328
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,382
$200? Sinful.

329
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:01,884
There's got to be a faster way.

330
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:05,137
"What is your gift
to the Devil?"

331
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,183
How about... <i>filii hircus?</i>

332
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,810
Yes!

333
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:15,523
All right.
Okay... what...

334
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,525
Yeah, I'll see you there!

335
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:20,528
What...?

336
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,003
Okay.

337
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,047
That's it.

338
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,465
You're being a freak.

339
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:43,551
You've been avoiding
me for weeks,

340
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,885
you won't get
in my car.

341
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:46,178
What's your problem?

342
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:47,596
There's no problem.

343
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:48,639
Just maybe
you're not as charming

344
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:51,559
as you think you are.

345
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:54,353
Wait, is this about
that vulnerability thing?

346
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:56,272
Actually, yes.

347
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,526
I mean... I get the teensiest
bit touchy-feely with you

348
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,194
and you freak out.

349
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:03,779
Ugh. All I meant
that night

350
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:05,406
is that I can trust you.

351
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:07,950
That's all.

352
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:08,951
Okay?

353
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:09,910
Okay.

354
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,203
Okay.

355
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:11,954
Okay.

356
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,258
<i>Filii hircus.</i>

357
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,721
Habeas corpus?

358
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,097
Bababooey?

359
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,266
You had it right the first time.

360
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,435
But today is private.

361
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,064
Too private
for Lucifer himself?

362
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,316
You're supposed to be blond.

363
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,068
Yes, I get that a lot.

364
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,237
- You have ID?
- Absolutely.

365
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:46,822
Let me just, uh...

366
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,157
Oh. Dearie me.

367
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,825
I seem to have
left it in the car.

368
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:51,327
Detective, would you mind
going to fetch it, please?

369
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,661
What am I, your dog?

370
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,795
Detective...

371
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,839
After you.

372
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,641
It's very <i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

373
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,935
Too bad I forgot
my sexy mask.

374
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,145
Does anything scare you?

375
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,813
Should it?

376
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,316
Rose is gone.

377
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,859
But it is not her death
that was important,

378
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,235
it was her life.

379
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,279
The imprint she left behind.

380
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:29,990
See, Rose will be remembered.

381
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:32,117
She will live on forever.

382
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,453
This isn't a sacrifice.

383
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:35,621
It's a memorial.

384
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,206
Quite civilized,
actually.

385
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,584
- Yeah, they don't
seem like killers.
- Mmm.

386
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:41,919
And so now

387
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,672
it is time to invoke

388
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,799
the Four Crowned Princes
of Hell.

389
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,425
Oh. Scratch that.

390
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,636
Visualize the blue light

391
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,638
filling your entire being.

392
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,140
Satan to the east.

393
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,017
Beelzebub to the north...

394
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,477
This is preposterous.

395
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,646
I thought
you'd love this.

396
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,523
First of all,
there's only one me.

397
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,441
And secondly, the whole worship
thing is more my father's bag.

398
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,777
And now...

399
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:09,697
Lucifer will speak!

400
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:10,739
What?

401
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:15,369
Ooh.

402
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,454
Oh. No. No, no,
no, no, no.

403
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:19,331
- This is where
I draw the line.
- Ow.

404
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,709
- Ow.
- Excuse me, excuse me! Sorry.

405
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:22,918
Sorry.

406
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,003
Hey, man.

407
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,504
If you would just butt out.

408
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:26,505
Right!

409
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,173
I'm the real Lucifer

410
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:31,510
and I insist that you stop
this nonsense immediately.

411
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,512
I mean, have you
heard yourselves?
It's embarrassing.

412
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,389
Blue light coming out your ass

413
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,057
or whatever it was.

414
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,517
I mean, you preach rebellion,

415
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:39,935
but you're-you're
misguided sheep.

416
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,645
And goat.

417
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,230
Where's the real defiance?

418
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:44,732
- The free will?
- Yeah!

419
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,733
Free will!

420
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:46,900
Free will rules!

421
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,320
No, no!
You're doing it again.

422
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:51,697
Don't applaud.

423
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,198
This whole thing's a sham!

424
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:55,534
Anarchy!

425
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:57,828
I mean, just-just look at this.

426
00:17:58,037 --> 00:17:59,413
What is this
supposed to be?

427
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:02,708
Alien fetus?

428
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,501
Pickled demon?

429
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,587
He's the best Lucifer
we've had in years.

430
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,715
Lucifer! Lucifer!

431
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,508
Lucifer...
Stop!

432
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,095
Someone killed this girl!

433
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:16,597
She didn't deserve that.

434
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,932
This is not
what I stand for.

435
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,769
Is that what
you all wanted? Eh?

436
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,609
Should be ashamed of yourselves.

437
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,239
LAPD.

438
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,908
Put the knife down.

439
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,580
Why were
you running?

440
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,916
I wasn't.

441
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:44,917
I was upset.

442
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,376
Feeling guilty, are you?

443
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,961
Tell me... why?

444
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,297
What, our new Devil's
a cop, now, is he?

445
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,757
Oh, worse than that,
I'm afraid.

446
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:52,966
So come on.

447
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:54,676
Tell me, what nasty little urge

448
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,929
are you hiding
in your hoodie, hmm?

449
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:00,641
I want to kill...

450
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,142
Yeah?

451
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:05,145
I want to kill the sick bastard
who killed Rose.

452
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:06,438
And then, after that,

453
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,775
I want the hell
out of this racket.

454
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,069
Oh.

455
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,862
What's your name?

456
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:14,988
Onyx.

457
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,073
Hmm?

458
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,618
Mitch Watson.

459
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,537
Yeah, I changed it
when I joined the church.

460
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,915
12 years later,
I'm the frickin' high priest.

461
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:26,250
I'd love to bail.

462
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,001
Kind of late for
a career change, though.

463
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,629
I mean,
the whole thing's a joke.

464
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,256
So, hold on...

465
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,424
Are you saying
you don't believe in Lucifer?

466
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,969
Look, mate, the Devil ain't
gonna buy me an Aston Martin.

467
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,470
Well, not with that attitude,
he won't.

468
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,514
I mean,
I like the philosophy.

469
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,141
But it attracts
a lot of weirdoes

470
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,851
who take it way too seriously.

471
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,185
And, of course,

472
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,271
now Rosie's dead.

473
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,815
Yeah, and I see you
have the same subdermal
implants as she did.

474
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:50,983
All the hard core members...

475
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,151
they all get this.

476
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,318
I was trying to tell Rosie

477
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,862
that she would
regret it later,

478
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,239
but she became obsessed.

479
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,116
She was an impressionable girl.

480
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,118
Well, her father was absentee.

481
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,203
I suppose that's why she got
involved in all this nonsense,

482
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:04,705
to piss her dad off.

483
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,665
Actually, it was, uh...
it was her boyfriend,

484
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,458
Corazon, he's the one
who brought her in.

485
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,669
Man, the guy's a creeper.

486
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,213
He kept talking about doing
real sacrifices on animals.

487
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,508
Did Corazon have
access to this knife?

488
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,635
Yeah, probably.

489
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,181
This here is just for show.

490
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:25,184
The blade springs
inside the handle.

491
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,935
Hmm. Strange.

492
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,021
'Cause if it was real...
it could definitely match

493
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,355
the marks found
on Rose's body.

494
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,024
We do have an actual version.

495
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,066
Hold on.

496
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,864
Knife's gone.

497
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,199
Okay, we need
to find Corazon now.

498
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,366
- Yeah.
- Do you have, um,

499
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,701
his real name,

500
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,369
uh, where he lives,
his address?

501
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,662
Give me a sec.

502
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,667
Ugh.

503
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,005
Looks just like you.

504
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,506
I manscape.

505
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,386
I'm starting to understand
why you chose this persona.

506
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,388
All-powerful...

507
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:04,598
Invincible...

508
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:05,891
Not exactly.

509
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,438
Ah. Or it's because you think
that everybody's out to get you.

510
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:12,898
That's because they are.

511
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,441
But trust me,
I didn't choose it.

512
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,568
Why would anyone
choose to be vilified?

513
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,570
Thought the Devil
was supposed to be immortal.

514
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,614
Well, one angel
can hurt another, so...

515
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,372
Oh, what...?

516
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,250
What are you doing?

517
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,462
No address, no last name,

518
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,214
nothing.

519
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,507
Hmm.

520
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,634
He used PayPal to pay
for the fee.

521
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:42,803
All right,
I'll call in a warrant.

522
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:51,353
Well, if you can't bring
Muhammad to the dim sum...

523
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,445
Hey.

524
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,114
Why'd you stand me up?

525
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,449
I had one task...

526
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:07,119
one...

527
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,329
to get my brother
back to Hell.

528
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,253
I've not only failed,

529
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:19,047
but I've actually
made things worse.

530
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,425
I'm even sleeping with a demon.

531
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,888
Yeah, you lucky
son of a bitch.

532
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:30,976
Come on, you can't say

533
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:35,314
that this isn't the best
sex you've ever had.

534
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,649
Well, it is the only sex
you've ever had, but still.

535
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,405
Look, I've had
a lot of sex,

536
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,742
with men and women.

537
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,327
- I mean a lot.
- Okay.

538
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,995
Point made.

539
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,415
But this, with you,

540
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't know, it's...

541
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,461
it's different.

542
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,973
But if you're
not happy here,

543
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,975
then you should go home.

544
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:15,354
I can't.

545
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:19,524
I can't face my father
as a failure.

546
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,526
Look, I have a job to do.

547
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,820
There's no choice.

548
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,740
I understand.

549
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,542
<i>Okay. Great.</i>

550
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:38,877
Yeah, I'll be here.

551
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,212
All right.

552
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,297
So we got a real
name for Corazon--

553
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,341
Mike Carey-- but it could
take us a while to find him,

554
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,551
- so you should
probably head home.
- Oh, no, no, no.

555
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,470
Not till this human stain's
brought to justice.

556
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,889
I can't get near you,

557
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,557
now I can't get rid of you.

558
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:53,725
Whatever.

559
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:54,976
I'm gonna go up and shower.

560
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,520
Stay put. Do not wake up Trixie.

561
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,501
Did you just throw a toy at me?

562
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,086
Oh, you're awake.

563
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:22,754
But since you're up,
I have some questions for you.

564
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,256
Right.

565
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,591
Are you adopted?

566
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,594
In other words, are you sure
the detective is your mother?

567
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,388
Could she be
from somewhere else?

568
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,265
Does she have
any special powers?

569
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,725
- Uh-uh.
- What about any markings?

570
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,727
Scars, on her back perhaps?

571
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:40,897
There's some chocolate cake
in it for you.

572
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,607
I want cash.

573
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:44,276
Oh.

574
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:47,279
I like your style.

575
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,156
All right.

576
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,116
Mommy does have a scar.

577
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,118
- Oh?
- On her butt.

578
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:54,744
From when she got bit.

579
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,079
By the Kraken.

580
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:57,414
Right.

581
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,250
Not the direction
I was going for,

582
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,085
but what's this Kraken
that you talk of?

583
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:04,796
My mom's evil Chihuahua.

584
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,339
Why aren't you
showering?

585
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:07,466
'Cause I left
my phone down here.

586
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,800
Why is Trixie awake?

587
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,428
Get back in bed, young lady.

588
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:12,471
Night, Lucifer.

589
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,432
All right, seriously.

590
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,726
No more freaky behavior.

591
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,728
If this is about the other
night, I'm sorry, okay?

592
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,980
What do you want me to do,
take it all back?

593
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,273
No, can you take
your shirt off, please?

594
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:24,274
What?

595
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:26,776
Are you serious?

596
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:27,986
I need to see your back.

597
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,905
Why?

598
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,908
Because I want to know if you're
an angel sent to destroy me.

599
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,920
Nothing.

600
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,005
Yeah.

601
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,007
Is this about the scars
on your back?

602
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:53,428
Look, I have no idea
what happened to you

603
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:54,846
or what's going on with you now,

604
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,891
but... not everyone's
out to get you.

605
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,064
They found him-- Corazon.

606
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,034
We found his car like this.

607
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,078
It's registered
to Mike Carey.

608
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:31,341
Just like old times, huh?

609
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,551
Don't shoot me though.

610
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,552
Funny.

611
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,970
Come on,
I'm just joking.

612
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:42,394
Ah, Detective Douche,
Detective Stache.

613
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:43,395
What a pleasant surprise.

614
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:44,563
Did you find anything?

615
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,439
Place seems empty.

616
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,827
My God.

617
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,676
It's definitely Mike Carey.

618
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:17,637
Detectives,
can I show you something?

619
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:24,728
So what do you really
make of all this, huh?

620
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:26,938
The "Hail, Lucifer,"
the pentagram?

621
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:31,401
I think it's a long time since
I encountered genuine evil.

622
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,819
Wow.

623
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,951
It's not blood;
it's paint.

624
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,831
So the killer
strapped Mike up

625
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,500
then decided to go
all Jackson Pollock?

626
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,836
I guess.

627
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:53,506
Yeah, looks like an "A."

628
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:54,841
That can't be random.

629
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,551
I think it's a word.

630
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:09,648
Giant anamorphic print.

631
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,650
"Morningstar."

632
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:14,110
Whoa.

633
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,945
Another Satanic message.

634
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,739
Or a fan letter.

635
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,991
Morningstar is not exactly the
most common name for the Devil.

636
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,410
You think someone did
this for our Lucifer?

637
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,329
That's kind of
a leap, Dan.

638
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,748
Yeah, but if I'm right, it's
also a conflict of interest.

639
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,917
Somebody could be doing
this on his behalf,

640
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,585
or maybe he's involved
in a different way.

641
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,337
- What does that mean?
- Yes.

642
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,923
What are you insinuating?

643
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,341
That some psycho might
be killing people

644
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,009
because of your whole
Devil shtick.

645
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,969
You're blaming
this nonsense on me?

646
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:41,763
You do take the whole Satan
thing pretty seriously.

647
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,807
You really think
I'd do these vile things?

648
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:46,434
These kids were
pretending to be bad,

649
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,103
but they weren't,
they were innocent,

650
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:49,771
so I would never hurt them,
I'm not a monster.

651
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:50,814
Okay, guys.

652
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:52,357
That's enough.

653
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,195
Lucifer, maybe you
should go home.

654
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:00,532
Oh, no, allow me to stay in this
rusty tin can a little longer.

655
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,243
You came to me,
you insisted I work this case.

656
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,578
Okay, this sounds crazy,

657
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,539
but this case
might involve you.

658
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:08,707
What do you mean, involve me?

659
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,250
You know what I mean.

660
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,918
I'm trying to
protect you.

661
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:16,381
Oh, protect me from the evil
or the world from evil me?

662
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,515
Can you believe
Detective von Douche

663
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:27,225
boots <i>me</i> off the case?

664
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:28,893
And Chloe agreed to this?

665
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,395
She didn't disagree.

666
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,231
How could she even
think I'm capable?

667
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,399
Here?

668
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,651
That's why I left.

669
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,986
I thought she knew me.

670
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:39,529
I thought I knew her.

671
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,156
And now you don't
trust her anymore?

672
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:44,492
Oh, it's just this whole
immortality thing.

673
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,703
Uh, for some reason,

674
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,247
Detective Decker
makes me vulnerable.

675
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:52,250
Also known as "intimacy."

676
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:55,545
No. No, she literally
makes me exsanguinate.

677
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:58,548
Being vulnerable can be scary.

678
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:01,926
But there are benefits when you
open yourself up to someone.

679
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,428
I just wish I knew
who was behind this.

680
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:04,596
My dad?

681
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:05,597
My brother?

682
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,265
Someone else?

683
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,100
I mean, the detective
doesn't seem to know,

684
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,518
but she could
be lying.

685
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:11,936
Is she part of the plan
to kill me,

686
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:13,897
or is she just a-a pawn?

687
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,899
Maybe we should explore
the possibility

688
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:19,068
that being vulnerable
can be a good thing.

689
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:21,404
No, it can't.

690
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,698
It means you're at
someone else's mercy.

691
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,367
Then maybe you should just
stay away from everybody.

692
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,077
Stay away from Chloe.

693
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:31,080
But...

694
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:33,208
I don't want to.

695
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,627

716
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,180
I know you're behind this.

717
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,266
Because I have seen you.

718
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:32,267
I know what you
really are.

719
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:33,685
What I am is annoyed.

720
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,353
Just let me go
to my club

721
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:36,604
and move along, please.

722
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,274
I know these murders
are your doing!

723
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,150
I have no skeletons
in my closet,

724
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,486
which is more than can be said
for you nasty little humans.

725
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,531
So come on, preacher man,
enough about me,

726
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,867
let's talk about your dark
and nasties, shall we?

727
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:52,161
I must throw you into a
lake of sulfur and fire.

728
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,163
Oh, so you want to destroy me.

729
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:56,040
Well, get in line.

730
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:58,376
Yes, I wish...

731
00:31:58,585 --> 00:31:59,210
Yes.

732
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,212
...I never met you.

733
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,006
It's like some kind
of collective amnesia.

734
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,549
I mean, I walk around
this city of yours,

735
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,551
solving its filthy
little crimes,

736
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,969
and this is the thanks I get?

737
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:08,845
You're a murderer.

738
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:09,888
A murderer!

739
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,641
Stop blaming me!

740
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,062
I should destroy you.

741
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:19,814
- Hey, put him down!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

742
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:21,482
Easy, easy.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

743
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:23,693
This scumbag isn't
worth it, all right?

744
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:24,986
This isn't over.

745
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:29,991
You come to have a
go at me as well?

746
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,326
Nah.

747
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:32,327
Chloe thought you might
need protection

748
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:33,703
from freaks like that.

749
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:35,747
What I want is a drink.

750
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,628
Hey, I'm sorry
about earlier.

751
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:43,296
Earlier today,
or three weeks ago,

752
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,256
when you broke up
with me in a text?

753
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,425
Chloe, I know.

754
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,344
I've been looking for
a way to explain things,

755
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:50,553
but nothing makes sense.

756
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,598
I will fix this,
though, I promise.

757
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,725
No more promises.
I just want to do our jobs.

758
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:58,311
What's that?

759
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,662
This definitely
doesn't belong here.

760
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,830
A monogrammed "M."

761
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,458
Doesn't Lucifer
wear cuff links?

762
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:35,682
Really? No prints,
no skin cells?

763
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:37,475
Nope. Dead end.

764
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:38,977
Unless you want to check
Lucifer's closet for the match.

765
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,436
Very funny.

766
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:42,105
Yo, Decker,
your partner's on TV.

767
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,023
A video went viral today

768
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:46,442
after a fight erupted
on Hollywood Boulevard.

769
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,987
Local club owner
Lucifer Morningstar

770
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:52,824
attacked Reverend Jacob Williams
when Williams claimed

771
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,826
the businessman
with the devilish name

772
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:56,494
was actually involved

773
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:59,497
in the Satanic murders
making recent headlines.

774
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:00,957
Apparently,
I'm not the only one.

775
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,083
This is ridiculous.

776
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,292
He didn't attack the guy.

777
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,211
He was defending himself.

778
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,297
Still hot.

779
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,592
Sorry.

780
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,100
The preacher.

781
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,309
Preacher's wearing
a cuff link.

782
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:21,519
So what?

783
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:22,687
A lot of guys do.

784
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:23,688
One?

785
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,148
With an "M"?

786
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,357
No way.

787
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:27,859
Oh...

788
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,027
It's not an "M."

789
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,529
It's a "W," for Williams.

790
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,031
Come on, Dan,
it makes sense.

791
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,323
Who's gonna want
to kill Satanists

792
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:35,742
more than a religious zealot?

793
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:38,870
We gotta find him.

794
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,830
Freakin' street preacher

795
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,415
and his little minions, man.

796
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,542
Who do they think they are?

797
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,545
Bunch of posers.

798
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:48,546
Ah...

799
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:50,131
Don't even sweat it, huh?

800
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,924
What do you say we get
some ladies up in here, huh?

801
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,385
Blow off some steam!

802
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:56,054
Emphasis on the "blow," huh?

803
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,227
Why are you in my house?

804
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:06,439
Because I got your back, man.

805
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:09,734
I saw the way they treated
you at the crime scene.

806
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:12,236
Anyways, I know you didn't
kill those people.

807
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:13,613
Did you?

808
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:19,702
I'm just joking! God...

809
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:22,246
You need to relax,
get yourself a little shiatsu.

810
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:23,414
Mmm.

811
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,249
Ah...

812
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,709
This feels good.

813
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,961
Feels good,
hanging out here with you.

814
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,048
I mean, ever since I, you know,
went to Hell, it's just...

815
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:34,634
there's been things in my head

816
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,136
that no one would understand.

817
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:39,972
Except you, of course.

818
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,266
You know?

819
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:43,935
I just want
you to know...

820
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,729
I respect the hell out of you.

821
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,023
Get it?

822
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:50,775
Hell?

823
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,110
Up top.

824
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,491
What, you just gonna
leave me hanging?

825
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,827
You've got red paint
on your hand.

826
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:02,453
Huh?

827
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:04,163
Just like the paint
we found at the warehouse.

828
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:05,540
I must've gotten it on me
at the scene.

829
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:06,791
Oh, I doubt that.

830
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,960
Everyone was wearing gloves.

831
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:17,635
Aw, man!

832
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:19,095
You caught me!

833
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:20,847
Literally red-handed.

834
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:22,849
Oh, I was,
I was wondering

835
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,642
when you'd figure it out.

836
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:27,687
You know, when I asked
if you did it?

837
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:29,981
Totally thought
you were gonna ask me.

838
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:31,983
Been dying all day to tell you.

839
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,152
You?

840
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,319
Uh-huh.

841
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:36,237
You did this?

842
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:37,864
You killed those people?

843
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:38,865
Oh, you mean
those frauds?

844
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:40,408
Duh!

845
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:41,784
So, what do you...
what do you think?

846
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:43,369
Impressed? Hmm?

847
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:44,537
You're insane.

848
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:45,955
I know! It's...

849
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:47,165
Don't you love it?

850
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,332
I mean, of course you do.

851
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:49,500
I mean, we're the same.

852
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,170
Oh, we are not the same.

853
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,671
Wait, wait, wait.

854
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,215
I-If you're worried,

855
00:36:56,424 --> 00:37:00,136
I've got the perfect person
to pin it on:

856
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:01,554
that street preacher.

857
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:02,889
Genius, right?

858
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:04,640
Guy's crazy. Yeah.

859
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,058
And I already dropped
some evidence, so it's...

860
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,186
Whoa!

861
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,188
But I did this for you.

862
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:11,189
Aren't you happy?

863
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,274
Why would I be happy?

864
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,484
I'm not evil.
I punish evil.

865
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:17,195
- Yeah, but, but you're,
you know...
- The Devil, yes.

866
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:18,446
And you think you know
who that is, don't you?

867
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:19,864
The whole world does.

868
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,366
A torturer, maybe.

869
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:25,036
An inflictor of
just desserts, sure.

870
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,705
But a senseless murderer
I am not.

871
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:30,374
Perhaps I need to clarify
my position.

872
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:31,626
Hey, hold on, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

873
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,211
I've got this, remember?

874
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:35,671
Don't worry, Malcolm.

875
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,506
I'm not gonna send you to Hell.

876
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:40,092
I'm going to bring it
right to you.

877
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,679
And after I'm finished with you,

878
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:45,223
Detective Decker
can put you

879
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:47,099
in a cold, dark room

880
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:48,392
so you can think about
what you've done, young man.

881
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,187
Oh...

882
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:57,235
Ah!

883
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,820
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

884
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,710
After the monumentally
dreadful day I've had,

885
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:16,462
you decide to drop in now?

886
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:17,588
I'm clearing up your mess,
by the way,

887
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:18,756
so if you don't mind.

888
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:20,758
You sent your demon to seduce me

889
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,260
and then kill me.

890
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,262
Yeah.

891
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,389
I definitely mind.

892
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,433
Right.

893
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:30,518
Wonderful.

894
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:31,727
Now look what you've done.

895
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,604
The man you just freed--

896
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:34,939
you know, the one
you raised from the dead--

897
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,607
he's murdering humans.

898
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:39,819
And that... that is on
your hands, brother.

899
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:41,279
You're wrong.

900
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:42,571
It's your fault.

901
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,823
Oh...

902
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:45,658
It always has been.

903
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:48,911
Hate to break it to you, bro...

904
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,498
...but this time,
I'm fighting back.

905
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,002
If only you'd done
what was asked of you,

906
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,295
none of this
would've happened,

907
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:58,963
and I'd still be home...

908
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,465
...where I belong!

909
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:04,468
Heaven? Really?

910
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:05,970
You're sure that's
still home, eh?

911
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,763
After everything you've done?

912
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:11,642
Sleeping with
a demon.

913
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:15,021
Think Dad might have
another assignment for you.

914
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,481
Somewhere, I don't know,
slightly warmer.

915
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,158
Why?

916
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,035
Why did you have to use her?

917
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:34,457
Now I get what this little
tantrum's really about.

918
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:36,459
It's about Maze.

919
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,169
You like her.

920
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,421
Well, I mean,
I don't blame you, brother.

921
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,882
She is a wild woman in the sack.

922
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,222
Listen, if you
wanted me dead,

923
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:52,016
you should've had the balls
to do it yourself!

924
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:56,062
Oh, please.

925
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,439
You're the one who's been
using pawns from the start.

926
00:39:58,647 --> 00:39:59,857
Linda, Malcolm, huh?

927
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:01,817
Now the detective.

928
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:05,404
- You're a coward!
- Chloe?

929
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:08,032
I don't even know what
you're talking about!

930
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,909
You always were
a lousy liar.

931
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,291
You justify it all,
don't you?

932
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,501
Claim it's all done

933
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,628
in the name of our father,

934
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,713
but...

935
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,174
it's for your sake, brother.

936
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:26,759
And they call me
the prideful one.

937
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:29,303
Enough!

938
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:31,555
I'm the pawn.

939
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,266
You <i>both</i> used me.

940
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,770
You know what?

941
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:38,813
Here.

942
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,817
Kill each other.

943
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:02,795
Now where do I get a drink?

944
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,297
The last place the preacher
was seen was near LUX.

945
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:08,217
Remember, he's to be considered
armed and dangerous.

946
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:09,885
Malcolm took Lucifer
into the club.

947
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:11,387
You guys see anything,
you get on the radio.

948
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:12,430
All right, I'll check the club.

949
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:13,556
You guys search the area.

Hello, Detective.

953
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:30,448
If you've come to have a shot
at me, now's the time.

954
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:32,491
Everyone's doing it.

955
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:36,120
Yeah, your scuffle
with the preacher

956
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,580
made the local news.

957
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:40,082
Oh, that.

958
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,251
That was about
five disasters ago.

959
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,336
God, your face...

960
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:45,880
Yeah, well, what can I say?

961
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,298
You should've seen
the other chap.

962
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:48,591
Thought I did.

963
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:49,758
What happened?

964
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:52,136
Well...

965
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,929
where do I begin?

966
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:57,725
With the grandest fall
in the history of time?

967
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,727
Or perhaps
the far more agonizing

968
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:01,437
punishment that followed?

969
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:04,398
To be blamed for every

970
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:07,651
morsel of evil
humanity's endured,

971
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,362

All I ever wanted

975
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,957
was to be my own man here.

976
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,668
To be judged for my own doing.

977
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:26,086
And for that?

978
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:29,423
I've been shown
how truly powerless I am.

979
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,511
That even the people I trusted--

980
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,513
the one person, you--

981
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:40,059
could be used to hurt me.

Lucifer...

983
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:44,146
Yes?

984
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,530
What?

985
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:54,240
Put your hands up
and move away from the bar.

986
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:02,039
Detective,
there's an explanation...

987
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:03,040
Stop!

988
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:04,124
Don't say another word.

989
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,167
Put your hands up.

990
00:43:08,045 --> 00:43:09,338
Or you'll leave
us no choice.

991
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:13,926
Lucifer Morningstar,
you're under arrest.
