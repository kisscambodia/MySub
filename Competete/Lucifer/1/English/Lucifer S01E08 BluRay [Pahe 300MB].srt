4
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:09,427
You stuck your neck
out on Palmetto.

5

- Look where
that got you.
- Okay.

6
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,390

12
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:22,524

00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,277

135
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,531
Lucifer, our last session
was a breakthrough.

136
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:22,865
It was?

137
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,661
You're finally getting
in touch with your emotions.

138
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,162
Letting your barriers down.

139
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:29,664
You see, that's part
of the problem.

140
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,708
I'd like them back up,
thank you.

141
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:32,709
Why?

142
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,210
Well, because
these emotions

143
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,505
are... bloody inconvenient,
that's why.

144
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,466
What's bothering you right now?

145
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,094
Well...

146
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:44,679
right now I'm experiencing
a very odd feeling.

147
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,431
It's-it's like a...

148
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,391
it's like a fat man
sitting on my chest.

149
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,352
But not in a fun way.

150
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,521
And when is that happening?

151
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:55,565
Well, um...

152
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:56,649
When you're with Chloe?

153
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,318
Yes.

154
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,528
Well, actually, lately,
when she's been with Dan.

155
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:01,821
Her ex.

156
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,906
Well, sort of. Uh...

157
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:05,783
I don't know what
she sees in that oaf.

158
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:06,868
Lucifer...

159
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,412
...you're jealous.

160
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,623
The Devil doesn't get jealous.

161
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,542
I'm the one who inspires
passion in others.

162
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:15,585
I mean...

163
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:16,878
you know that.

164
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,504
Mm, don't I ever.

165
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:19,714
Thank you.

166
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,424
That's the
appropriate response.

167
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,012
Hold on, maybe it's not me.

168
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,890
Maybe it's her.

169
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,558
You could fix the detective.

170
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,894
How would I do that?

171
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:35,396
Well, heal her douche
fixation, obviously.

172
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,231
Then she stays
away from her ex.

173
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,858
Then I get my partner back.

174
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,651
That's not how therapy works.

175
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,238
We deal with <i>your</i> issues.

176
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,907
Not someone else's.

177
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:08,262
Oh, dear! Someone's
session went poorly.

178
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,098
Mm. Thanks for gracing us

179
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,682

Dr. Bernie Shaw.
Killed last night.

182
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:17,688
No forced entry.

183
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:19,065
Killer most likely
knew the vic.

184
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,817
The weapon was improvised.

185
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,151
Seems like a crime of passion.

186
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,278
Right. Yeah.

187
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,281
Have you ever
seen a therapist?

188
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,451
You know, for your pent-up
anger and your trust issues.

189
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,120
And your attraction
to very dull men.

190
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,622
Let's just focus
on the case, shall we?

191
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,165
Well, I will,
once it's interesting.

192
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,584
Oh! Hello.

193
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,962
It's interesting--
"The Cheater Therapist."

194
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,964
Yeah, he encouraged couples to
cheat to save their marriages.

195
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,133
You can imagine how many
people want to kill him.

196
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:47,135
I can't, actually.
Sounds like a great idea.

197
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:49,303
You don't save a marriage
by sleeping with other people.

198
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:50,680
It can't hurt to try.

199
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:53,015
Pretty sure it can.

200
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,982
That's the wife Alexandra.

201
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,650
She was out of town
and just got back

202
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:03,818
to find her husband dead.

203
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,194
Poor woman.

204
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:07,238
Excuse me!

205
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:08,781
Your husband was
the Cheater Therapist.

206
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,658
Hey, I'm not sure
who you are,

207
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:12,577
but this is not the time
for judgment.

208
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,162
What? No judgment here,
Tissue Lad.

209
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,664
I think her husband's
work was bang on!

210
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:17,957
I'm Detective Decker.

211
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,542
This is my associate,
Mr. Morningstar.

212
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,334
Yeah, yeah.

213
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,711
Jonathan Medina.

214
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,337
Colleague of Dr. Shaw's.

215
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,673
Desire shouldn't be
contained-- it's unnatural.

216
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:27,508
Your husband
recognized that.

217
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:30,803
Bernie, he-he just
wanted to help people.

218
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,680
He dedicated his
life to others.

219
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,099
Who would do this?

220
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:36,809
We'll find out, Mrs. Shaw.

221
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:38,895
Hmm?

222
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,568
Every one of her husband's
patients is a suspect.

223
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,695
Oh! Does that mean we get
to dive into patient files?

224
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,864
Read the deepest,
darkest secrets

225
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,365
of L.A.'s most unfaithful?

226
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,075
No, we can't look at them
without a psychologist

227
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:54,994
to protect patient
confidentiality.

228
00:08:55,203 --> 00:08:56,871
Perfect!
I have just the psychologist!

229
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,416
Dr. Linda Martin, from our
first investigation together.

230
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,584
The one that wanted
to jump your bones?

231
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:02,960
- Yeah.
- No. Not happening.

232
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,253
No, I really think
she'd bring some

233
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:05,421
impressive insight
into the issues

234
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,547
that you're dealing with.

235
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:08,174
Uh, in the case.

236
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,717
I really don't.
Plus, it's out of our hands.

237
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:12,094
Court-appointed.
A judge needs to sign off.

238
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,860
Wonderful! Now...

239
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,779
I see you brought
your gavel, like I asked.

240
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:35,910
Oh!

241
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,954
Oh, objection, Your Honor.

242
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,415
♪ Oh! ♪

243
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,382
Ah! Now, now...

244
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,299
Oh, come on!

245
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,717
I won't tell if you won't.

246
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,886
I swore an oath...
to a judge.

247
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,304
Oh, did you now?

248
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:56,514
You only get to read the files

249
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,765
I deem necessary
for investigation.

250
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,310
Now, remember our deal:

251
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,563
You have to fix the
detective's broken douche meter

252
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:04,855
whilst we investigate
this crime.

253
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:07,233
- Mm-hmm. I never agreed to that.
- Oh, come now.

254
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,776
Don't you want to help me?

255
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:12,613
Hmm? Linda?

256
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,575
Lucifer...

257
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,410
Ah! Speak of the me.

258
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,662
Out here. Now.

259
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,210
What did you do?

260
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:27,587
Not what, but who,
if you must know.

261
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,255
But I try not to kiss and tell.

262
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,799
I told you I didn't want
to go with Dr. Martin.

263
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:34,260
We need someone
impartial, which means

264
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,762
not trying to get
in your pants. What...?

265
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,264
Are you
even listening to me?

266
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,640
Not really. Look.

267
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:41,934
A new doctor's moved in.

268
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:44,020
Dr. Canaan.

269
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,938
How Biblical.

270
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:48,274
Sure, let's add another
random doctor to the case.

271
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,775
Great idea.

272
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:53,112
Now, look, I assure you,
Dr. Martin is excellent.

273
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:55,239
She trained at Stanford,
she lectures at USC,

274
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:56,741
she's got stacks of awards...

275
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,784
Since when are you her fanboy?

276
00:10:58,993 --> 00:10:59,827
Since I became a client.

277
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:01,245
You.

278
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:02,413
You're really in therapy?

279
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:04,290
Why is that so surprising?

280
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,625
You're the least
reflective person I know.

281
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,709
I have layers.

282
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,294
I'm like an onion.

283
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,795
An irresistible one.

284
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,464
Dr. Linda

285
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,466
said we recently made
a breakthrough, in fact.

286
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,176
Why do I think
that's code for sex?

287
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,011
In that particular context, no.

288
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,429
Do you still think
you're the Devil?

289
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:19,764
I <i>am</i> the Devil.

290
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,183
Then excuse me
if I doubt her skills.

291
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,517
Look, she's helped me,
all right?

292
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:24,810
And I think she can be
of help here.

293
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,479
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.
- Excuse me.

294
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,606
- Everything okay?
- Yes, Linda,

295
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:29,857
- everything's absolutely fine...
- No offense, Dr. Martin...

296
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:31,108
I found something.

297
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:32,610
- Hello.
- What is it?

298
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,362
A patient named
Richard Kester.

299
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,656
His wife convinced him
to try Dr. Shaw's therapy.

300
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,157
Hmm, let me guess--
didn't end well?

301
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:39,617
She had an affair.

302
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,077
They got divorced.

303
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,663
And then Richard sent
Dr. Shaw a death threat.

304
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,332
It's been more than a year,
but that kind of anger

305
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,708
can bubble up
when you least expect it.

306
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,044
Add him to the list
of angry patients.

307
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,170
That's just it.

308
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,172
Richard's the only one so far.

309
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,591
Dr. Shaw's patients
seem remarkably happy with him.

310
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,717
Oh, do they now?

311
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:58,844
See, cheater therapy works.

312
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:02,640
Maybe you should've tried it
with Detective Douche.

313
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,893
Or was that
what broke you apart?

314
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,479
What is wrong
with you lately?

315
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:12,024
I'll look into him.

316
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,901
Thank you.

317
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:15,236
Yeah.

318
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:16,404
Top work, Sherlock.

319
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,244
<i>So I don't understand</i>

320
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,620
all this jealousy talk.

321
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,414
I mean, why covet something
someone else has?

322
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,998
Why not just take it?

323
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,917
'Cause it's
never that easy.

324
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,044
Well, it is for me.

325
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,088
Usually.

326
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:37,883
I, uh, I may have
overstepped

327
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,052
earlier in regards
to Detective Douche.

328
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:41,262
Yeah.

329
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,055
You definitely may have.

330
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:46,642
So why did you two
separate anyway?

331
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,358
The job was more important
to him than me and Trixie.

332
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,444
But lately something's changed.

333
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,904
He... he makes time for me.

334
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,073
He makes time for us.

335
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:03,409
He's really putting
in an effort.

336
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,828
Yes, if ever anyone
deserved

337
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,997
a participation trophy,
it's Dan.

338
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:19,842
Decker.

339
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,968
Uh, hello, Detective.

340
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:22,011
It's about Richard.

341
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,053
I wanted to warn you.

342
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,430
He may be unstable.

343
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,056
Possibly dangerous.

344
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,516
I'll handle it,
but thanks.

345
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:28,809
I don't mean to you.

346
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,144
I mean to himself.

347
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:35,065
Yeah, you may be right.

348
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,609
Lucifer?

349
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,152
Oh, my God.

350
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,278
There's another one.

351
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:40,488
Hey, Detective!

352
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:43,282
You need your roots done!

353
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,083
What is he doing?

354
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:54,460
I've made up my mind.

355
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,629
You can't stop me.

356
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,464
What? Oh, no.
I'm not here to stop you.

357
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,007
If you want to jump,
go for it.

358
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,345
Is this some kind
of reverse psychology?

359
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:05,596
No, quite serious.

360
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:06,639
Go for it.

361
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,433
Okay, here goes.

362
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,435
I do have one question
before you pop off.

363
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,479
You see, I'm trying
to understand jealousy.

364
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,731
It's a new concept to me.

365
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,901
And you, dear Ricky, are the
perfect person to explain it.

366
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,820
- What are you talking about--?
- Manners, Ricky.

367
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:21,987
Manners!

368
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,280
We're not done talking yet!

369
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:24,532
Okay, I'll talk!!

370
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,534
Pull me back up, please!

371
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,661
Are you sure? Yeah?
'Cause I could just--

372
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,163
Pull me back up!

373
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,374
Pull me up, please!

374
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:37,920
Oh, God.

375
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,755
I'd save your breath
if I were you.

376
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:42,007
When it comes to this sort
of thing, he's quite judgy.

377
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,802
Right, back to the matter
in hand.

378
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,680
Now, you were so jealous
that you murdered Dr. Shaw.

379
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,098
Can you help me
understand why?

380
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,391
How could you say that?

381
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,561
I was about to jump,
because he's dead.

382
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,104
Don't fib, Rickster.

383
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,355
I know about
your death threats.

384
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:59,191
I was in a bad place.

385
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,693
Kara had just dumped me.

386
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,111
I made my threats.

387
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,529
Then I went to his office...

388
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,030
And killed him.

389
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,657
And he talked me down.

390
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:09,076
And afterwards,
he kept seeing me,

391
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,620
even though he knew
I couldn't afford to pay him.

392
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:14,039
I mean, he'd got me
through my divorce, bankruptcy,

393
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,583
the death of my parrot.

394
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,710
Oh, I've just realized

395
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,336
you're not jealous,
are you?

396
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,046
You're just sad.

397
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,965
Pathetic, really.

398
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,050
Well, if you can't
tell me what I need to know,

399
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,052
what good are you?

400
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,430
Aren't you supposed to tell me
that I have a lot to live for?

401
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:30,764
Well, I wish
I could, Ricky,

402
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,892
but your life sounds
incredibly bleak.

403
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,561
Ironically, it seems there's
nowhere to go but up.

404
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,567
You know what? You're right.

405
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,110
Hmm?

406
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,738
Maybe the worst is behind me.

407
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,489
Hmm.

408
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,325
I think I'm ready
to go in now.

409
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,910
Well, I wasn't asking,
but, uh,

410
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,162
all right, go on,
quick as you can.

411
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,122
Come on, chop, chop.

412
00:15:58,459 --> 00:15:59,960
I can't believe you, Lucifer.

413
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,921
What? You should be thanking me.

414
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,424
All right, Richard, we confirmed
your alibi with your neighbor.

415
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,926
You're free to go.

416
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,677
How did this happen?

417
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,180
- Poor Sandy.
- Who's Sandy?

418
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,390
Dr. Shaw's wife, Alexandra.

419
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,768
Her friends all call her Sandy.

420
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,979
Okay, and you're friends
with your therapist's wife?

421
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,941
Yes, how open was
his relationship therapy, hmm?

422
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,276
No, it's nothing like that.

423
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,861
That's just
how the Shaws are.

424
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,739
They go above and beyond.

425
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:30,783
I just ran into her
two days ago.

426
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,743
Sandy was planning a surprise

427
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:35,120
for Dr. Shaw and everything.

428
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,039
You ran into her two days ago--
are you sure about that?

429
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,415
Yeah.

430
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,542
Alexandra told us
she was in Phoenix.

431
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,752
We checked her alibi.

432
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:42,836
She had plane tickets
to prove it.

433
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,129
What was the surprise?

434
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,923
I don't know.

435
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,716
She just asked me not to tell
Dr. Shaw she was in town.

436
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,969
Uh-huh.

437
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,471
You can't think she did this?

438
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,024

So, you're the doctor.

00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:23,794
Oh, call me Linda.

What won't?

451
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:38,851
Sleeping with my boss.

You'll end up

453
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,439
Trash left by the side
of the road.

454
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,065
Interesting.

455
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,358
What?

456
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,818
Well, I find people
who are rude

457
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:50,029
usually feel powerless
in their own lives.

458
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,865
Terrified of not
being in control.

459
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,533
But that's not you, I'm sure.

460
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:57,161

What a surprise.

464
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,461
What are you doing here?

465
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,879
I thought you asked me
to meet you here.

466
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,756
That-that was me.
I felt like

467
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,467
it would be good
to get your input on the case.

468
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,469
That's a good idea,
actually, especially

469
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,804
since our last suspect
almost ended up sidewalk art.

470
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,432
Turns out Mrs. Shaw
flew to Phoenix

471
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,976
but rented a car and drove
back a couple days early.

472
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,895
So, dear,
sweet Sandy was here

473
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,730
just in time for the murder.

474
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,940
Wait, Alexandra Shaw
goes by "Sandy"?

475
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,360
The doctor had a female patient
who was stalked

476
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,072
by someone
with the initials S.S.

477
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,740
He used initials in his notes?

478
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,241
I found it odd as well.

479
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,994
Why conceal someone's identity
in private notes?

480
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,413
But I thought
it wasn't related, so I--

481
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:45,125
Unless S.S.
stands for Sandy Shaw.

482
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,668
If she was stalking

483
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,378
one of her husband's
female patients...

484
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:49,713
Then maybe Dr. Shaw

485
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,757
was engaged in his own

486
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:52,758
open-relationship therapy.

487
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:53,926
Sandy found out.

488
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,135
So maybe she wasn't

489
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:56,261
okay with it as she claimed.

490
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,888
Excuse me.

491
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,349
Decker.

492
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,768
Yeah, this is 831.

493
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,021
Oh, yeah, tell him
I'll be there as soon as I can.

494
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,439
Okay, thank you.

495
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,775
That was dispatch.

496
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,193
Dan's phone died,

497
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,528
and he wants me to meet him
at my place.

498
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:13,695
Apparently it's urgent.

499
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,280
Oh, how convenient.

500
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:16,532
What's next-- he spills
something on his shirt

501
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,699
and he has to take it off?

502
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,327
Oh, no, the trousers, too.

503
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,037
- What?
- What, so that's it?

504
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:23,872
You just go running
as soon as Dan calls?

505
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,082
What about the case?

506
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,875
This could relate
to another case I'm working on.

507
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,669
There's units
looking for Sandy now.

508
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,254
And once they find her,
they'll call me.

509
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:31,630
Bye.

510
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,673
Bye.

511
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,299
Unbelievable.

512
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,717
You see what I'm dealing
with now, don't you?

513
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:39,346
I think I do, actually.

514
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,640
It's worse than I realized.

515
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,059
Thank you.

516
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,485
Hey, Dan.

517
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,320
What did you find out?

518
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,655
Surprise.

519
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:09,793
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
I just wanted to talk.

520
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,211
You act all chummy in public,

521
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,421
then you break into my home,

522
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,423
trick me into meeting you
in private?

523
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,176
Excuse me if I'm not trusting.

524
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,553
Hey, I'm not armed.

525
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,763
All right? Hey.

526
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,684
Huh? It's nothing like that.

527
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,062
All right.

528
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,232
Then talk.

529
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,193
I had to meet you where
no one else could hear.

530
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,777
Hear what-- my screams?

531
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,032
Decker, we're on the same side.

532
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,700
And I know you're still
looking into Palmetto.

533
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,744
Well, guess what? So am I.

534
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,537
I put that to bed
a long time ago.

535
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,331
That the best you got?

536
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:50,292
God, you're a decent cop,
but you are a terrible liar.

537
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,544
Come on!

538
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:53,879
Palmetto stinks.

539
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,214
I should know. I was there.

540
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,049
Mm-hmm.

541
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,259
Go ahead, say it.

542
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:01,053
I look dirty.

543
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,388
I saw you meet
with Nikolas Aoudi.

544
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,098
You were laughing.

545
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,892
I saw you hand him cash.

546
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,810
I've used him as a CI before.

547
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,938
I was buying information.

548
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:14,233
Then we both got shot.

549
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,985
And I think it was
a cop who shot me.

550
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,656
But you knew that already,
didn't you?

551
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,074
Why do you think it was a cop?

552
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,700
That's what I was
paying Aoudi for.

553
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,786
Intel on someone crooked
at our station.

554
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,829
But I think he or she
got to me first.

555
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,498
That's...

556
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:30,958
that's a great story.

557
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,417
I love the ending.

558
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,253
It-it ties up
all the loose ends.

559
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,671
Not really.

560
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,256
I can't explain

561
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,509
how the crooked cop
knew I was there.

562
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,679
How'd you find me?

563
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,430
I followed the smell.

564
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,807
You followed the...

565
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,141
You know what?

566
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,643
Screw this.

567
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,103
I only called you
to try and help.

568
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,020
Really?

569
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:53,855
Yeah, really.

570
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,358
Listen, Decker,
they pulled the plug on me.

571
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:59,611
Malcolm...

572
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,154
I was dead.

573
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,615
I-I know.

574
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:07,577
Made me appreciate
the time I've got here.

575
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,663
So, personally, I don't think

576
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,292
I'm gonna dig
any deeper on this one.

577
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,294
And I wouldn't
if I were you either.

578
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,963
Not sure if that's a warning
or a threat.

579
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,590
I'm not the enemy, Chloe.

580
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,801
But whoever
we were investigating,

581
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,137
they're still out there.

582
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:28,348
And they clearly don't have
a problem shooting cops.

583
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,150
Decker.

584
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,819
<i>Unis found Sandy Shaw</i>

585
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,279
in her car in a
parking structure.

586
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,822
Oh, well, I hope our case

587
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,199
didn't ruin
your kissy-time with Dan.

588
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,410
What is with your recent
obsession with my love life?

589
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:49,828
Obsession?

590
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,496
That's awfully defensive.

591
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,498
Probably indicates
deeper issues, wouldn't you say?

592
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,666
I agree.

593
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,919
Why are you
so defensive, Lucifer?

594
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,504
Good question.

595
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,007
Et tu, Doctor?

596
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,217
Lucifer, you asked me to
analyze the situation.

597
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,720
No, I asked you to help figure
out what's wrong with her.

598
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,014
Did you now?

599
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,307
But...

600
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,184
Nothing's
wrong with her.

601
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,770
She's a woman
balancing a lot on her plate,

602
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,689
and, as far as I can tell,
doing a fantastic job.

603
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,441
Why, thank you.

604
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,526
You're right, Lucifer,
she's amazing.

605
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:22,819
No, she's verbal Ebola.

606
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,571
Where's the button
to put the glass up?

607
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,615
This isn't a limo, Lucifer.

608
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:27,824
And, Dr. Linda,

609
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,701
you should really
join us more often.

610
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,705
Getting double-teamed is
usually much more fun than this.

611
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:34,956
Mm.

612
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,124
Gross.

613
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,337
So you lied to us.

614
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,005
You were in town
the day your husband died.

615
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:44,716
Yes. But it's not
what you think.

616
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:46,259
Okay, then help
me understand.

617
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,970
Sandy, I'm on your side.

618
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,806
Not everything
stems from jealousy,

619
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,058
- no matter what
these women tell you.
- Hey, Lucifer...

620
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,977
You came here driven by
some kind of desire, didn't you?

621
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,229
No.

622
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:58,271
Come on.

623
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,273
You can tell me. What was it?

624
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,276
It's disgusting.

625
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:04,986
Ooh, you naughty girl.

626
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,780
Come on,
now you have to tell me.

627
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:10,117
It's... in my car.

628
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,453
What is, Sandy?

629
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:14,246
Poop.

630
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,248
Oh.

631
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:17,874
Bags and bags of it.

632
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,960
Oh, my God.

633
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,049
I'm not sure whether to be
horrified or impressed.

634
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,592
My friend owns a horse.

635
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,679
That's oddly comforting to know.

636
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,597
What were you gonna do with it?

637
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,391
I was going to throw it
at Tiffany.

638
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,600
That's the patient

639
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,645
- you were accused of...
- Stalking.

640
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,272
Yeah.

641
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,190
She's in a group therapy session
right now

642
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,650
for my husband's clients.

643
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:44,818
Group cheater therapy.

644
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,653
Oh, the imagination runs wild.

645
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,155
So Tiffany was
sleeping with your husband.

646
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,322
She was.

647
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:50,866
How'd you find out?

648
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,535
My husband's colleague,
Dr. Medina, called me.

649
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,454
Okay, so he told you
that your husband was cheating?

650
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,247
No, he had no idea.

651
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:58,623
He just called to see

652
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,792
if Bernie wanted to grab
a last-minute drink.

653
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,587
But Bernie was supposed to
already be with Dr. Medina.

654
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,714
That's when I knew
my husband lied to me.

655
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,424
But he was
the cheater therapist.

656
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,009
I don't quite see
the problem here.

657
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:10,427
I mean,
you said yourself...

658
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,095
The problem is
he fell in love with her.

659
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,892
I lied to him about my trip,

660
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,854
then I drove back from Phoenix
to see what he was doing.

661
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,022
I was...

662
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,064
Don't say it.

663
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:23,940
...jealous.

664
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:25,400
Yes, yes, we all get it!

665
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:26,651
Jealousy makes the world go...

666
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,403
I mean, what are
you, a girl band?

667
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:29,613
I loved him.

668
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:30,739
Oh...

669
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:31,907
I didn't kill him.

670
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:33,950
I just wanted him back.

671
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,037
Oh, great.

672
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:39,080
The douche-mobile.
Give me a second.

673
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,085
Hey, I got your text. You okay?

674
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,587
Did Malcolm hurt you?

675
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,255
No. I told you, it's-it's fine.

676
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:48,715
Everything's fine.

677
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,636
I'm gonna punch that son of
a bitch right back into a coma.

678
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:53,678
Oh, come on.

679
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,639
No. No.

680
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:57,182
Anything back on the 999 key?

681
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,434
I'm sorry, Chloe.

682
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,436
They couldn't get
any prints off of it.

683
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,524
Thanks.

684
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,275
So that's Dan, huh?

685
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:08,652
Yes.

686
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,363
Numbingly average,
isn't he?

687
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,156
I wouldn't say that.

688
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,409
What... You're supposed to be
on my side, you know.

689
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:19,746
No. I'm supposed to help you
process your emotions

690
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:21,665
so you can deal with them
constructively.

691
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:25,335
Yes, by being on my side
and realizing that I'm right.

692
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:26,711
Lucifer...

693
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,214
Is over this conversation.

694
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,007
I'm gonna go and talk

695
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:34,928
to some people who are a little
more open-minded, Doctor.

696
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,436
Hi. I'm Dr. Medina.
Thank you for coming.

697
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,356
All right, looks like
we have everyone,

698
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:47,732
so let's start.

699
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,025
Yes! That's a great idea.

700
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,860
There's so very much
to discuss.

701
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,530
So let's start with the most
important thing, shall we?

702
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:55,740
Me.

703
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:03,873
Thanks.

704
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,253
And once again,

705
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:10,422
Lucifer disappears.

706
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,009
I think the case may have hit
a little too close to home.

707
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:15,218
Maybe things got
a little too boring

708
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,928
for Mr. Short Attention Span.

709
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:18,555
I don't know.

710
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,432
He's grown quite a bit
since working with you.

711
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,976
I'm not sure I'm the reason.

712
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,811
I think
you've really helped him.

713
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,938
I underestimated you before.
I'm sorry.

714
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,857
Not needed. But thank you.

715
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,567
And I thought...

716
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,193
I thought you were
sleeping with him.

717
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,612
Oh, I am.

718
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,405
Oh. Oh.

719
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,366
Is, um... is that...?

720
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:39,367
Ethical?

721
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,702
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

722
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,038
No, it is not.

723
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,791
But there's
something about him.

724
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,627
I can't stop myself.

725
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:53,465
But I think it's time I did.

726
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:57,385
- Okay.
- I mean, even I'm
starting to feel...

727
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:03,516
So do you think
she did it?

728
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:07,103
Sandy claims she was
sitting outside Tiffany's house,

729
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,022
waiting for Dr. Shaw to show up.

730
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,566
Problem is, no one can
corroborate her alibi.

731
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,902
But, no,
I don't think it was her.

732
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,863
So there's no one in Dr. Shaw's
files that looked like

733
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,448
a potential suspect?

734
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:20,283
Not that I can tell,
but maybe I missed something.

735
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,077
What?

736
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:24,871
The cheater therapist turned
out to be terrible at cheating.

737
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,041
Why didn't he tell Dr. Medina he
was using him as a cover story?

738
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,417
Maybe he did.

739
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,419
Maybe he confided in Dr. Medina.

740
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,088
But Mrs. Shaw said
that Dr. Medina

741
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:34,798
had no idea about the affair.

742
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,466
Yeah, so he conveniently
told her

743
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:37,842
everything she needed to know
to figure it out.

744
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:40,720
We need to talk to Dr. Medina.

745
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:43,223
<i>Which brings us to today,</i>

746
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,725
where we find Mrs. Shaw

747
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,519
with a bag of excrement
in her boot.

748
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:48,770
Sorry, trunk.

749
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,022
And somehow, out of all that,

750
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,024
they've decided
that I'm jealous.

751
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,361
So... what do you think?

752
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:57,404
Huh?

753
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:58,488
Yes.

754
00:28:58,697 --> 00:28:59,698
So, wait, you're the Devil?

755
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:00,949
Yes, yes.

756
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,992
Please keep up.
Anyone. You.

757
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:04,661
When you say you, uh,
burned your wings,

758
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:05,954
was that a metaphor...?

759
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:07,622
Not focusing
on the right details!

760
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,541
Uh, yeah.

761
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,959
She was gonna throw poop at me?

762
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,502
God, this isn't
about you, Tiffany.

763
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:13,920
All right?

764
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,839
Huh, no wonder
you're all in therapy.

765
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,633
All right, this is supposed
to be a grief therapy session

766
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,301
for the patients
of Dr. Shaw.

767
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,638
And everyone here has
a terrible loss to deal with.

768
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:25,056
What, and I don't?

769
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,100
I've lost both my therapist
and my partner.

770
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,810
I'm s...

771
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:29,853
Th-They died?

772
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:31,229
No. No, they turned on me.

773
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,355
Some would argue that's worse.

774
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:33,898
All right, you need to leave.

775
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,151
No, I'm close to something.
I can feel it.

776
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,777
This is not about you!

777
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,237
Gah.

778
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,614
You're right.

779
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:42,991
Yes.

780
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,993
I should use one of you
as a case study.

781
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,202
Thank you for volunteering.

782
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,288
So what...

783
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,957
what makes you jealous? Hmm?

784
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,627
What do you desire
that you can't have?

785
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:55,712
Come on.

786
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,964
I...

787
00:29:58,173 --> 00:29:59,132
Yeah?

788
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,134
I want Sandy.

789
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,471
What?

790
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,639
Oh.

791
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:09,267
I remember you now.

792
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,978
Tissue Lad!

793
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:14,939
Wanted some open relationship
therapy of your own, is that it?

794
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,566
That's not what it is like.

795
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:18,276
But she didn't want you,
did she?

796
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:20,195
Sandy loved her husband,

797
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,822
so you killed him, didn't you?

798
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:23,948
Shut up!

799
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:24,949
Solved it, haven't I?

800
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,618
Eh?! Haven't I?

801
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:29,162
So that's a yes.

802
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,705
He's got a knife!

803
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,916
Do you realize what you've done?

804
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:34,918
I had to kill him, all right?

805
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,337
He lied to her.
He cheated on her.

806
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:40,131
And I tried to tip her off,
but no matter what he did,

807
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,299
she still loved him.

808
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:42,467
No, no, not that.

809
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,344
This. Right here.

810
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:47,472
You've just given me the perfect
example of unbridled jealousy.

811
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,891
I'm not jealous. I'm not.

812
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,477
The woman that you loved
was with someone else,

813
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,771
someone you thought
wasn't worthy of her.

814
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,899
But no matter what you did...

815
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,401
she never saw you
the way you wanted her to.

816
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,987
That's...

817
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:04,489
That's pretty accurate.

818
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,407
Yeah.

819
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,117
You've just made me
realize something.

820
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:13,081
That my situation
and yours are...

821
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:15,708
absolutely nothing alike.

822
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,544
I was right! Not jealous!

823
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,087
Drop your weapon!

824
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,633
- Ow!
- Ooh.

825
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,222
Did you seriously

826
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,723
just bite me?

827
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,393
He's the killer.

828
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:37,188
Yeah, you think?

829
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:59,127
So you were right
about Linda.

830
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,795
She helped me figure
out the motive.

831
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:04,465
And then I realized Jonathan
and Dr. Shaw's offices

832
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,092
shared the same
security system.

833
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:07,427
So I checked and...

834
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:09,679
You're not listening
to me, are you?

835
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:14,100
Afraid not.

836
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:16,644
You didn't see any similarity

837
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:18,396
between yourself and Jonathan?

838
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:21,107
So you heard some of that,
did you?

839
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:22,692
Tail end.

840
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,156
I don't know.

841
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:29,240
Did you?

842
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:33,036
Mm-mm. No.

843
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:34,662
Completely different.

844
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,540
That's what I thought.

845
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,712
So... how's your secret case
with Dan going?

846
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,047
Secretly terrible.

847
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:45,214
Do you remember Malcolm?

848
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,258
Coma boy?

849
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:49,510
He woke up.

850
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:50,887
He claims he's innocent.

851
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,516
Something he said bothers me.

852
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:57,226
Whoever shot him
knew about Palmetto,

853
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,604
but he says that no one
should have known he was there.

854
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,814
Well, you found him there.

855
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:04,192
Yeah, I...
He pointed that out, too.

856
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,861
So, whoever followed him
could have done what I did.

857
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,613
So how did you track him?

858
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,199
Partners on the force
share GPS locators in their gear

859
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:13,284
so that they can find each other
in emergencies.

860
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:16,579
You hacked
his partner's locator.

861
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,623
Which means...

862
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:21,084
Malcolm's partner knew
he was there, too.

863
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,587
Tony Paolucci knew.

864
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:48,027
That's Paolucci's car,
just like his GPS said.

865
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:49,278
But the bar's closed.

866
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:52,323
Maybe he decided
to keep the party going.

867
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,333
You have to stop doing that.

868
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,002
It was unlocked.

869
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,681
Paolucci, you in here?

870
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:47,086
At least you can see
what he was thinking.

871
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:01,642
Dan.

872
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,441
I found a suicide note.

873
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:10,693
In his handwriting?

874
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,196
Sure looks like it.

875
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:15,156
Apparently, he was on the take.

876
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,450
Malcolm was onto him,
so Paolucci shot him.

877
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:18,951
When Malcolm woke up,

878
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,703
Paolucci couldn't take
the guilt anymore.

879
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,711
You okay?

880
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,130
Paolucci was an ass,

881
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:34,258
but this... I can't
imagine this.

882
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,094
I know.

883
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:37,887
I know.

884
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:58,032
Uh, come in.

885
00:35:58,241 --> 00:35:59,617
Hello, Doctor.

886
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:04,664
Thank you for coming.

887
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,750
Uh, I know we're not due
for a session for a few days.

888
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:09,585
No, my bad.

889
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:12,255
I realize I'm not up to date
on my payments, so...

890
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:15,258
Uh...

891
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:16,425
don't.

892
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,680
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

893
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,515
I realized a few things.

894
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:25,143
As I said,

895
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:28,771
we made a breakthrough.

896
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,276
And I think, with that in mind,

897
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,611
we should keep our relationship
professional from now on.

898
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,779
Oh.

899
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:37,947
Are you sure?

900
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:39,782
Very much so.

901
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:42,618
Very well.

902
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:45,204
If, uh...
if you think it's best.

903
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:46,205
I do.

904
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:47,957
Right.

905
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:52,003
Well, I'll, um... see you
at my next session, then.

906
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:03,514
- One last thing before I go.
- Yes?

907
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:06,225
Dr. Canaan down the hall--
what's he like?

908
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:09,437
Uh, thoughtful.

909
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,522
Spiritual. Why?

910
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,441
Little sanctimonious?

911
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,443
I don't know. I suppose.

912
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,904
Six-foot-two, black,
voice like an angel?

913
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:19,155
Oh, you know him.

914
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:23,993
All too well.

915
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:29,957
Trixie's finally down.

916
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:32,335
She conned you
into reading the book

917
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,337
about the sneezing panda,
didn't she?

918
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:35,963
Five times.

919
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,305
Hey. Um...

920
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:46,098
thank you.

921
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:48,684
For what?

922
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:52,939
You know,
for having my back and...

923
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:54,190
for everything.

924
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,116
You're welcome.

925
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:06,702
For everything.

926
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:22,969
You should go.

927
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:26,013
Yeah, I should.

928
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:28,182
I'm sorry.

929
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:30,893
No. Don't be sorry.

930
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:58,462
All right.

931
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:00,172
Okay.

932
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:01,590
Bye.

933
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,237
Evening, Dan.

934
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,408
I got your text.

935
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,285
What do you want?

936
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,707
Just wanted to congratulate you
on closing Palmetto.

937
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:37,293
You and that smart,
sexy lady of yours

938
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:39,045
caught the guy who shot me.

939
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,467
That's what
the confession said, right?

940
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:49,096
How long did it
take you to write it?

941
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:52,808
Forever.
I mean, I'm so not a word guy.

942
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:55,144
You know?

943
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:57,813
What? You should be thanking me.

944
00:39:58,022 --> 00:39:59,732
Why is that?

945
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,943
Well, I could have told
everyone the truth--

946
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:05,237
that you shot me.

947
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:07,490
Why didn't you?

948
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:16,874
'Cause I like you.

949
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,378
And I can't imagine what
would happen to your life

950
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,755
if people found out the truth.

951
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:24,632
Your colleagues, your ex...

952
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,176
- I swear to God, I will...
- What? Shoot me?

953
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:28,969
Ah, been there, done that.

954
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:31,097
Big fail.

955
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:34,058
Besides, you wouldn't
want anything

956
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,976
to mess
with your pretty little family

957
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:38,187
now that you're working
to fix things, right?

958
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,940
Whatever you want to do to me,

959
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:42,525
- you keep them out of it.
- Dan.

960
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,778
Come on.

961
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,530
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

962
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,157
No.

963
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:51,909
No, no, no, no, no.

964
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:54,203
You... you and I...

965
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,039
...we're gonna be best friends.

966
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:58,457
Yeah.

967
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:01,085
Because I got big plans for you.

968
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:02,545
Big plans.

969
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,882
Fun, right?

970
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:09,218

00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:51,135
Spoiler alert:
Amenadiel found Dr. Linda.

977
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:54,263
He was an angel on her shoulder,
trying to control me.

978
00:41:54,472 --> 00:41:56,765
I wonder how my dear,
angelic brother

979
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:59,310
got such a wickedly clever idea.

980
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:03,397
I did it to protect you.

00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:05,149

990
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:27,129
