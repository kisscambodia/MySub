the Devil's actually
interested in your soul.

144
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:47,200

was introduce you

made you do it, did he?

148

the topless selfies.

149

153
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,969
You introduced me to him.

154
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,721
I suggested you work with him,
not sleep with him.

155
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,348
Well, I got confused.

156
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,432
And then you left him
at the altar.

157
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:12,934
Yeah, that was rude of me.

158
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:13,976
No, actually, I quite
enjoyed that bit.

159
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,647
You know, he trapped me
in the bathroom at the Grammys,

160
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:18,898
said he wanted
to get back together.

161
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:19,982

162
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,567

this weekend.

163
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,194

You do owe me a favor.

169
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,083
I'm scared.

170
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,584
You should be.

171
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:39,919
Because what
I'm about to ask you

172
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,295
is gonna be
quite difficult for you.

00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,770
You're human, darling.

178
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,022
I'm gonna do
as you asked.

179
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,358
I'm gonna get
it together.

180
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,652
Promise, Lucifer.

181
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,654
Look, it's not about me.

182
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:10,116
What happens now,
that's up to you.

183
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,410
- Okay?
- Yeah.

184
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,786
Come here, you.

185
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:56,829
Oh, no, no, no, not yet.

186
00:08:58,956 --> 00:08:59,999
What did you do?

187
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,459
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,544
"Sorry."

189
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,671
Why did you end her life?

190
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,673
Why else?

191
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,091
Money.

192
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,093
"Money."

193
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:14,514
Oh, it's times like this
I wish I was still in Hell.

194
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:17,850
All the fun activities
I'd have planned for you.

195
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,228
Hey, man, I just
pulled the trigger.

196
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,239
Want to hear
what I've got so far?

197
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,702
Lieutenant said
this is my case.

198
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,580
Yeah, Chloe,
it is your case,

199
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,206
but try not to take
too much time.

200
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:23,416
It's an easy one.

201
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,917
That's our bad guy.

202
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:27,837
Eddie Deacon, he's
a low-level drug dealer.

203
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,338
I found these in his pocket,

204
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,299
and I found this
in Delilah's purse,

205
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,883
so obviously drug-related.

206
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,927
She probably owed him
a bunch of cash or something.

207
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:37,263
She's not exactly selling out
stadiums these days.

208
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,431
How do you know
he's low-level?

209
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,558
Look at his car.

210
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,226
Did you look at his watch?

211
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:43,477
That thing ain't cheap.

212
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,271
It's probably fake.

213
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,273
Look...

214
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,276
there's gonna be a lot of
attention on this one, Chloe.

215
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,278
I wouldn't pick at it too hard.

216
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,946
Not after Palmetto Street.

217
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:56,949
I asked for this case
because of Palmetto Street, Dan.

218
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,287
So, anyway, any witnesses?

219
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,040
Lucifer Morningstar.

220
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:06,709
"Lucifer
Morningstar"?

221
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,795
Is that, uh,
a stage name or something?

222
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,631
God-given, I'm afraid.

223
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,840
You know,

224
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:13,924
you look familiar.

225
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,134
Have we met before?

226
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:17,887
Yeah, five minutes ago.

227
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,680
And I'm asking the questions.

228
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,974
Talk to me about your
relationship with the victim.

229
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,393
Well, she used to work here
a few years back.

230
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,812
I would occasionally
accompany her while she sang.

231
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:30,274
Then she became a big star and
someone decided to end her life.

232
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:31,901
Do you know the shooter?

233
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,611
No, but we did have
an interesting little chat

234
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,780
just before he kicked off.

235
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,865
I asked him why he did it.

236
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,492
Huh, like to play cop, do you?

237
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,828
No, I just like to play
in general, Detective.

238
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,288
What about you?

239
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:47,708
So, you had a conversation
with a dead guy?

240
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,168
Oh, no, he wasn't quite dead.

241
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:50,294
His soul hadn't
crossed the threshold.

242
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,964
I see.
Did he tell you why he did it?

243
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,883
Why, money, of course.

244
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,135
You humans, you love your money,
don't you?

245
00:11:58,344 --> 00:11:59,720
Yes.

246
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:01,180
Yes, we do.

247
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,265
And, uh, what planet
are you from-- London?

248
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:07,103
Yes, he also said,
"I just pulled the trigger."

249
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,522
Now, don't you think
that's interesting?

250
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,565
Delilah was shot to death
by a drug dealer.

251
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,527
And looks like Delilah herself
kept the guy pretty busy.

252
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,113
You know, it's sad, it's ugly,
but it's not rocket science.

253
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,656
Something probably
went south between them.

254
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,199
She gets riddled with bullets,

255
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,326
and a nice little act of God
takes him out.

256
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:24,370
You know, it doesn't work
like that, Detective.

257
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,205
It's quite a neatly wrapped
little present

258
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:27,707
for the LAPD, don't you think?

259
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,542
Why don't you tell me something?

260
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,001
How does she end up

261
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,378
dying in a hailstorm of bullets,

262
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,130
and you get away
without a scratch?

263
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,840
I think that's interesting.
Don't you?

264
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,091
The benefits of immortality.

265
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,217
"Immortality."

266
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:39,552
Mm, of course, uh,

267
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,220
you spell that
with one or two M's?

268
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,013
I always forget.

269
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,141
What will your corrupt little
organization do about this?

270
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,393
Excuse me?

271
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,811
Will you find
the person responsible?

272
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:49,895
Will they be punished?

273
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,522
Will this be a priority for you?

274
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,190
Because it is for me.

275
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,151
You got some balls
on you, pal.

276
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,111
Oh, thank you very much, but
they're really quite average.

277
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,654
I bet.

278
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:00,364
Now, are you sure
that we haven't met?

279
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:02,283
I could swear
I've seen you naked.

280
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,367
Have we had sex?

281
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,370
We're done here.

282
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:07,830
Uh, Detective, wait!

283
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,206
Someone out there
needs to be punished.

284
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,584
- We're not done.
- Yeah. Yeah, we are.

285
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:26,056
♪ Once in the evening ♪

286
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,768
♪ There was harmony... ♪

287
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,437
If there is anyone here that
would oppose this holy union,

288
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,189
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

289
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,232
Excuse me. Yeah,
I have a problem.

290
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:37,568
Has-has anyone else noticed

291
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:39,153
how incredibly, jaw-droppingly,

292
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,447
loin-stirringly beautiful
this young woman is

293
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,240
and how short, sweaty

294
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,576
and altogether fugly
this homunculus is?

295
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,620
I mean, what is this--
a wedding or a kidnapping?

296
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:48,829
Do you know what I mean?

297
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,458
Yeah, good luck
with that, Padre.

298
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,001
Ooh, while you're at it,
say hey for me.

299
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,253
It's been a while.

300
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:57,797
Jimmy Barnes!

301
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,131
Remember me?

302
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,341
Hey, man,
this is a private event.

303
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:01,634
How did you get in here?

304
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,010
Yeah, and quite a lavish one

305
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:05,304
for a record producer
on the outs.

306
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:06,931
You do remember me, don't you?

307
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,474
Yeah, yeah, I remember you.

308
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,976
Now, what do you want?
I'm a little busy.

309
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,229
Well, I can't believe
that you're getting married

310
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,856
the day after your ex-fiancée
and once brightest star

311
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:17,691
was murdered in cold blood.

312
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,318
Yeah,
that's very sad.

313
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,320
But you know what,
she ruined my wedding once.

314
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,988
I'm not about to let
that happen again.

315
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,657
It's hard to be rejected,
isn't it, Jimmy?

316
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:25,866
Twice.

317
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,243
What?

318
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,786
Well, you tried
to get her back recently.

319
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,496
I mean, I'd kill someone
if they denied me once.

320
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,997
Not that that's possible.

321
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,542
So, come on,
what do you say, Jimbo, huh?

322
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,210
Did you want her dead?

323
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,004
Look, stop looking at me
that way, you freak.

324
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,048
I am not playing that
mind game with you.

325
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,299
No, of course not!

326
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:43,843
I was furious and
I was humiliated

327
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,886
when she dumped me,
but I think, I-I think

328
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,680
I've rebounded pretty well.

329
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,807
Yes, clearly.
Respect.

330
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,684
Should go
play your mind games

331
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:52,852
with 2Vile.

332
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,562
- The rapper?
- Come on.

333
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,313
Delilah dumped me
for that lunatic.

334
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:57,690
They were always fighting.

335
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,316
He slapped her
around a bunch.

336
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,485
He surrounds himself with
gun-toting morons 24-7.

337
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:03,404
He is the real deal.

338
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:05,197
Right.

339
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,533
Sorry, how rude.

340
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,368
Allow me to introduce myself.

341
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:12,371
Lucifer Morningstar.

342
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,374
I really don't want to
have sex with him tonight.

343
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,169
Oh, my...

344
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:20,629
I'm sorry, I...

345
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,172
I can't believe
I just said that.

346
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,841
Oh, no, no, no.
Let's be honest here.

347
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,676
I mean, you're not
marrying this human stain

348
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:27,720
'cause you're actually
in love with him, right?

349
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,013
- God no.
- No.

350
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,180
Right.

351
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,599
Well, I should get going.

352
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,017
Ooh!

353
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,394

Good afternoon, sir.

359
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,582
Yes, I'm here to see the man

360
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,292
sadly known as 2Vile--
is he in?

361
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,294
I'm sorry, sir.
He's unavailable.

362
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,879
He's in mourning, I'm afraid.

363
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,089
Right.
I have narcotics for him.

364
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,259

00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,274
Can someone please turn down
this god-awful music!

370
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:23,484
Hello, disc jockey!

371
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,444
Thank you.

372
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,071
Who's this clown?

373
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,073
He has narcotics
for you, sir.

374
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,242
My name is Lucifer Morningstar.

375
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,328
"Lucifer Morningstar"?

376
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,665
Now, that's a good hip-hop name.

377
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:38,958
Well, that offends me.

378
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,169
What, you don't like hip-hop?

379
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:43,629
No, I most certainly do not.

380
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,340
Well, that offends me.

381
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:50,928
You have a problem
with black people?

382
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,096
No, not in the slightest.

383
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:53,263
I just hate your music.

384
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,099
And when I say

385
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,600
"your music,"
I mean <i>your</i> music.

386
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,644
Not the music made
by other black people.

387
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,313
Without the blues, there'd be
no devil's music whatsoever.

388
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,273
There are, of course,
many giants in the field.

389
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,817
Just not you--
am I being clear?

390
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,443
Yeah, you're
being clear all right.

391
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,445
- Good.
- If you're looking

392
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:09,863
to get yourself killed.

393
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,452
Yes, well, don't waste
your munitions-- I'm immortal.

394
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,955
Tell me about Delilah.

395
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,748
You ain't seen the news?

396
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,458
Bitch is dead.

397
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:29,967
Don't shoot, you idiot!

398
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,303
- I didn't kill her.
- Why should I believe you?

399
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,264
Because I loved the girl.

400
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,016
People sometimes kill people
with whom they're in love.

401
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,976
The heart's mysterious.

402
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,686
- So I'm told.
- Ain't like that.

403
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,063
Girl made me crazy!

404
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,690
Women can do that.

405
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,025
Doesn't mean you should
beat them up, does it?

406
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,027
We worked that out
a long time ago.

407
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,237
I hit her once 'cause I found
out she was cheating on me.

408
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:58,620
All right.

409
00:17:58,829 --> 00:17:59,997
With whom?

410
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,206
I don't know.
I don't know.

411
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,583
She wouldn't tell me,
all right?

412
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,876
Said it was a big secret,

413
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,378
some-some, uh, rich married guy.

414
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,255
Well, does she have a friend
that she might've confided in?

415
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:09,548
She didn't trust no one, man.

416
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,175
Uh, uh, her therapist.

417
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,010
Her therapist is probably
the only one who knows.

418
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,012
She-she's some, uh, uh,
Dr. Linda

419
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,555
in-in Beverly Hills.

420
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:18,432
Saw her, like,
five times a week on the DL.

421
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,350
Used a fake name, everything.

422
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,519
Oh, did she now?

423
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,272
Well, thank you for your time.

424
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,775
LAPD! Guns down.

425
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:28,942
On the floor, down!

426
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,402
You two against the wall.

427
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,946
Detective, welcome to the party.

428
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,448
Grab the bucket,
collect the guns.

429
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,450
Now!

430
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,160
You sly dog,
you did listen to me.

431
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,578
I ran the dead guy's cell phone.

432
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:40,579
2Vile was the last person
he called.

433
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,581
Come on, man.

434
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,750
What I find
highly interesting

435
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,627
is how you made the
connection on your own.

436
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,253
Well, I've been busy, my dear.

437
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:50,798
Talk to me about Delilah.

438
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,591
We've been over that one,
Detective.

439
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,093
And why you called
the shooter

440
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,844
two days before
she was murdered.

441
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,263
Fine. Yeah, I called Eddie
'cause he hooks me up sometimes.

442
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,765
He met Delilah through me.

443
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,975
Whatever.
Don't make me a killer, do it?

444
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,603
No, but it does
make you a suspect.

445
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,897
What, so everyone on Eddie's
phone's a suspect?

446
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:08,273
Are you joking?

447
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,609
You gonna drag
half of Hollywood downtown.

448
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,444
Be like the Oscars or something.

449
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,822
Wait, aren't you
that chick from that film?

450
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,657
Hmm, what's this?
What film?

451
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,117
- You used to be an actress
or something, right?
- Yeah.

452
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,285
That teen movie--
I forget what it's called.

453
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,871
Of course.
<i>Hot Tub High School.</i>

454
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,623
That's where
I know you from.

455
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:25,791
Let's just stick to my
questions, shall we? So...

456
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:26,959
The one with
the famous nude scene,

457
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,502
coming out of the hot tub!

458
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,129
It was, like, a complete
<i>Fast Times</i> rip-off.

459
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,672
She was, like,
the new Phoebe Cates!

460
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,132
Thanks, I appreciate that.

461
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,174
That was quite a nude scene.

462
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,717
I have far too many bullets

463
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,386
in this thing
for you to still be talking.

464
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,971
You, we need to have a
conversation right now.

465
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,848
That's a waste
of time, Detective.

466
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,057
I've just threatened his life--
he's not our guy.

467
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,350
He would've said, trust me.

468
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,477
You did what?

469
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,646
Yeah, isn't that illegal?

470
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,439
Uh, little bit, yeah.

471
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:50,816
You stay put.

472
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:51,984
You, you're coming with me.

473
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,569
What? Ooh.

474
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,320
With pleasure.

475
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,197
At least, perhaps now,
you'll listen to me.

476
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,616
Although, I'm not quite sure
why I'm being arrested.

477
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,035
Because you're interfering
with a police investigation.

478
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,413
You've broken I can't
even count how many laws.

479
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:05,664
And you pissed me off.

480
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,124
Right, I can get
out of these, you know?

481
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,292
Funny.

482
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,004
How'd you do that?

483
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,547
Come on, we're wasting time.

484
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,007
We should be out there
solving a homicide

485
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,009
and punishing those responsible.

486
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,385
"We"?
You're insane.

487
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,345
I'm taking you in.
Get in the car.

488
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:21,513
No, that's boring.

489
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,015
Not to mention pointless.

490
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,850
Come on, I'll help you.
It'll be fun.

491
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,476
How could you possibly help me?

492
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:27,769
I have a certain skill set.

493
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,855
I can be very persuasive
with people

494
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,232
and tend to see things
that others cannot.

495
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,026
So, you're psychic or something?

496
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,570
No, I can't read people's minds.
I'm not a Jedi.

497
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,030
People just like
to tell me things.

498
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,865
Hmm, just-just tell you things?

499
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,533
Just confess their sins,
just like that?

500
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:42,951
No, not their sins.

501
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,244
I have no power
over people's sins.

502
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:45,746
I actually get
a bad rap for that.

503
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,331
I have the ability

504
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,499
to draw out people's
forbidden desires.

505
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,834
The more simple the human,

506
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,294
the easier it is.

507
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:53,420
The more complex,
the more challenging

508
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,922
and exciting, really.

509
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,382
But no, the actual sins,
the sins are on you people.

510
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:58,759
"You people"?

511
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,886
I got it.

512
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,554
I got it! The name?

513
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:03,972
The whole Lucifer thing?

514
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,724
And desire's, like,
your superpower.

515
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,185
Mm, it's more like
a gift from God really.

516
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,395
Okay, look.

517
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,898
Tell me, Detective,

518
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:16,068
what do you desire more than
anything else in this life?

519
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,779
This is it?
This is your big trick?

520
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,747
I guess,
when I was a little girl,

521
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:32,584
I... always wanted to be a cop
like my daddy,

522
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:36,755
so that... that one day
I could help people and...

523
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,298
and be taken seriously...

524
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:42,719
...when I say to shut up
and get in the damn car.

525
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,226
You're not, like, a Jedi
or something, are you?

526
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,436
Get in the car.

527
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:52,646
No, no, no, no, no.
Look.

528
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:53,855
I know something you don't know.

529
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,607
Really? What's that?

530
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,234
Won't say unless you
take me with you on this.

531
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,779
Please, come on.
I got to 2Vile, didn't I?

532
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,447
Why do you care
about this so much?

533
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:03,573
About Delilah?

534
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,870
Look, I just... I just do.

535
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,539
Look, if I hadn't meddled
with her career,

536
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,874
maybe she wouldn't
have died.

537
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:13,917
Okay.

538
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:15,460
Okay, fine--
but if this

539
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,462
little clue thing of yours
doesn't pan out,

540
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,798
these are going back on,
and they're gonna stay on.

541
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,008
Is that a promise?

542
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,183
<i>Yeah, therapist
in Beverly Hills</i>

543
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,393
<i>with the first name Linda.</i>

544
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,769
See if Delilah
was a client.

545
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:34,104
Ah-ah, actually,
she had a pseudonym,

546
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:35,439
which I also
happen to know.

547
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:36,773
I'm quite good
at this, aren't I?

548
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:39,609
Uh, Penny Lane.
Okay.

549
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,653
Delilah may have gone
by Penny Lane. Thanks.

550
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,283
Don't look so smug.

551
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,451
Nothing's
panned out yet.

552
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,077
No, no, no, it's not that.

553
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,412
It's just that I knew
that I recognized you.

554
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,872
Right.

555
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,540
Right, you've seen my boobies.

556
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:54,541
It's exciting.

557
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,625
What, are you 12?

558
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,252
So is the, uh... is the movie

559
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:58,420
why you've got such
a chip on your shoulder?

560
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,340
Uh, it's low on the list

561
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,966
- of things I have
to live down, I guess.
- Right.

562
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:05,302
Attractive female cop
struggling to be taken seriously

563
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,928
in a man's man's world--
that it?

564
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,598
Yeah, something like that.

565
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,350
Well, they're
threatened.

566
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,810
You're clearly smart
and have notable instincts.

567
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,395
Ignore them. Trust yourself.

568
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,650
Detective Decker.

569
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:21,902
All right,
text it to me.

570
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,403
Thanks.

571
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:24,988
What's that?

572
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:27,991
What you were
saying stands up.

573
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,326
There's a Penny
Lane who sees

574
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,994
a Dr. Linda Martin
in Beverly Hills.

575
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,246
Excellent.
I'll clear my schedule.

576
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,582
Ooh, someone's popular.

577
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:36,583
Please stop talking.

578
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,502
Hello.

579
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,045
What? You're kidding me.
Is she okay?

580
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,465
Oh, of course he's not there.

581
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:44,841
Thanks.

582
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,843
We got to make
a pit stop.

583
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:48,387
What?
No, absolutely not.

584
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,514
My kid got into a fight.
I got to pick her up.

585
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,140
What, can't she get
herself home?

586
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,600
She's seven.

587
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:54,976
Look, I'm not here
to help you run errands.

588
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,436
I'm here to help you
solve a homicide.

589
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,146
Really?

590
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:10,617
<i>All right.</i>

591
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,160
Wait here.

592
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,495
With pleasure.

593
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,122

Oh, dear, what will
become of me?

603
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:58,498
My mother is
a police officer.

604
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,250
She could arrest you.

605
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,087
Oh, I think I might
know your mother.

606
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,547
What's your name?

607
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,257
Lucifer.

608
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:09,050
Like the Devil?

609
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,844
Exactly.

610
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:14,723
My name's Beatrice, but
everybody calls me Trixie.

611
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,766
That's a hooker's name.

612
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,059
What's a hooker?

613
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:20,061
Ask your mother.

614
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,106
So... why are you
in trouble?

615
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,108
See that girl
over there?

616
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:27,903
She was bullying me.

617
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,571
She created a fake
Snapchat account

618
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,323
and used it to
make fun of me.

619
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:35,660
So... I kicked her in the
no-no-touch-touch square.

620
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,206
Oh. Oh, I see.

621
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:42,125
Well played.

622
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:43,502
Well played, indeed.

623
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,173
Hello, mean girl.

624
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,052
Did you know there's a
special section of Hell

625
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,178
reserved for bullies?

626
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,430
So have fun.

627
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,104
What did you do?

628
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,106
Oh...

629
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,526
I just think someone's feeling
a little guilty.

630
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:17,786
Hi, Daddy.

631
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,120
Hi, munchkin.

632
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,330
Wow, shocker,
you're late.

633
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:21,456
Come on, give
me a break.

634
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:22,874
I'm putting
a case to bed.

635
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,251
Right, like I'm not
working a case, too.

636
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,836
Oh, yeah, the one
you tried to steal from me.

637
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,296
You mean the open and shut one.

638
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,341
You did open and shut it, right?

639
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,301
I'm being diligent, Dan.
It's a high-profile case.

640
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,136
Exactly, which is why you
need to be smart about it.

641
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,013
She is smart.
You're the dimwit.

642
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:40,058
Perhaps you should refrain from
arguing in front of the child.

643
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:41,101
It's unbecoming.

644
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,604
I don't know whether to laugh
or to shoot you.

645
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:46,523
Surprise me.

646
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:49,109
Isn't he funny, Daddy?

647
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,610
Hey, can you, uh,
drop Trix at my mom's?

648
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:52,195
We got to go. Thank you.

649
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,197
Trixella, give
Mommy a kiss.

650
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,199
I love you so much.

651
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:57,867
Good job standing up
to the mean girl.

652
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,202
Thanks, Mommy.

653
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,079
What's a hooker?

654
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,875
Daddy will tell you.

655
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:11,881
Bye, Lucifer.

656
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,258
It was nice meeting you.

657
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:15,969
Hmm.

658
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:17,387
Think she likes you.

659
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:19,097
Of course she does--
what's not to like?

660
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:32,193
Was your offspring
planned or a mistake?

661
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,322
Planned, sort of.

662
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,240
Really?

663
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,658
'Cause I've never understood
the human desire to procreate.

664
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,243
That's probably
a good thing.

665
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:41,911
I mean, children are
hideous little creatures,

666
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,413
terrible, taxing burdens.

667
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:45,415
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

668
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:47,167
Oh, um, yours is fine.

669
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,586
I mean, you know,
nothing to crow about,

670
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,087
but nothing to be too
embarrassed about, either,

671
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:52,714
so that's quite good, isn't it?

672
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,216
Are you at all aware
of how dickish you sound?

673
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:56,259
No.

674
00:27:57,594 --> 00:28:00,513
Speaking of dicks...

675
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,057
why was that ex-husband of yours

676
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,558
pressuring you
to close the case?

677
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:07,312
No reason.

678
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,481
Strange.

679
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,024
Yes, you are.

680
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,319
Did my father send you?

681
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,531
Okay, Detectives,
I'll see you now.

682
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,908
Thank you.

683
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,326
Oh. "Detectives."

684
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,454
Dr. Martin,
I'd like to ask you

685
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:26,164
a few questions
about Delilah.

686
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,380
You're thinking
about it, aren't you?

687
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:34,547
What?

688
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:35,715
Yes, I wouldn't
recommend it.

689
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:37,050
I'm like walking heroin.

690
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,052
Very habit-forming.
It never ends well.

691
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:42,722
I'm sorry, do... do you two
know each other?

692
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,557
No, no, but I know that look.

693
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:47,268
I don't know
what you're talking about.

694
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:49,896
That is interesting

695
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,399
'cause... you don't
look at me that way.

696
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,442
- What way?
- With carnal fascination.

697
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,403
That's 'cause
it doesn't exist.

698
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,071
No, you see, that's just it--
with most women, it does.

699
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,906
I tend to appeal to the
dark, mischievous hearts

700
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,159
in all of you, but
you, Detective,

701
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,245
you seem oddly
immune to my charms.

702
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:08,248
Referring to them as "charms,"
I think, is a bit of a stretch.

703
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:09,916
Truth be told,
I find you repulsive.

704
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,584
Like, on a
chemical level.

705
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:12,711
That's fascinating.

706
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,588
Now, tell me, Linda...

707
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,424
You say it's fascinating,

708
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:20,260
and yet I can see that it
disturbs you, doesn't it?

709
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,762
Deeply.

710
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:24,597
Dr. Martin,

711
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,725
we know that, um, Delilah was
having a clandestine affair

712
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,560
with a wealthy married man,
so if you just

713
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:30,603
tell us his name,
we will be on our way.

714
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,605
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

715
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,274
Oh, she's one of
the complex ones.

716
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,734
Linda,

717
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:38,111
darling, why don't
you tell me? Hmm?

718
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,112
Well, I can't.

719
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,782
I want to, but I can't.

720
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,202
Oh, you're the devil.

721
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,455
Correct.

722
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:50,123
Now, come on, Dr. Martin.

723
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,791
I know you want to.

724
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,794
Oh, man, and it's really,
really juicy, too.

725
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:55,962
Ooh, I bet it is.

726
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,255
No, I can't.

727
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:58,590
What did you do to her?

728
00:29:58,798 --> 00:29:59,841
Did you roofie her?

729
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,134
Oh, no, it's
not her fault.

730
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:02,260
She's just
reacting to me.

731
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,304
Just watch
and learn, okay?

732
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:05,638
Right, the answer is yes,

733
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,974
we can take a trip
to pound town if we must,

734
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:11,978
but first, you're gonna have
to tell us, Linda, okay?

735
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:13,646
Um...

736
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:20,069
Okay...
it's Grey Cooper.

737
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:21,738
Grey Cooper?

738
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:22,906
Seriously?

739
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:24,365
That is juicy.

740
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:26,117
Grey Cooper, the actor?

741
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:27,285
The one who's married
to Amanda what's-her-chops?

742
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,620
Yeah, yeah.

743
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,413
Oh, no,
he's horrible.

744
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:34,083
So square-jawed,
so handsome, so vanilla.

745
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:35,668
Oh, I'm really quite
disappointed in Delilah.

746
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:39,297
That's truly terrible taste
in the opposite sex.

747
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:40,590
Thank you very
much, Dr. Martin.

748
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,674
We'll be in touch.

749
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,092
All right,
we got to go.

750
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,178
Yes, of course,
but I... I made a deal,

751
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,180
so I'm gonna have to hold up
my end of the bargain.

752
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:48,598
You wouldn't mind
waiting outside?

753
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:50,183
Are you seriously talking

754
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,976
about having sex
with her right now?

755
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,937
Well, it won't take long.
I do yoga.

756
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:58,858
Hot... yoga.

757
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,528
I'm freakishly flexible.

758
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:02,862
Want to see?

759
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:06,950
Wow!

760
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:13,540
I really tried
to keep that one in.

761
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:16,209
Well, you tried--
that's what matters.

762
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,669
Uh, look,
I'm really sorry,

763
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:19,629
but I'm gonna have
to take a rain check.

764
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:20,755
I will be back, okay?

765
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:21,923
I certainly hope so.

766
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,093
My word is my bond.

Ah, excuse me. Thank you.

772
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,401
Hey, hey, sir.

773
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,410
Who the
is this guy?

774
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,829
What the hell are you doing?

775
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:54,038
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

776
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:55,415
Sorry. Excuse me.

777
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,625
Sorry, he's with me.

778
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:01,045
That's not Grey Cooper.

779
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:02,380
No, of course not.

780
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:03,673
What the hell is this?

781
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:05,508
We need to speak
with Mr. Cooper.

782
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,264
God, Delilah, yeah,
heard about that this morning.

783
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:12,515
I can't believe it.

784
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,684
We did a movie
together last year.

785
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:15,768
Got pretty close.

786
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:17,896
- Lovers?
- Friends.

787
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,439
Friends who were lovers?

788
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:20,565
Settle down.

789
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,275
I'll handle
the questions.

790
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:23,902
Mr. Cooper, when did you last
have contact with Delilah?

791
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,445
Well, actually, I just
have one more question

792
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:26,946
before you proceed
with the boring ones.

793
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,616
Tell me, Mr. Cooper,

794
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:31,868
what do you want more
than anything in this world?

795
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,870
What's your deepest,
darkest desire?

796
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:37,206
You close your eyes,
what do you see?

797
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:41,669
I'm the president of the
United States of America.

798
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:42,795
Ha!

799
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,090
Well, who's the Devil now, eh?

800
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:48,134
Those are some pretty big
aspirations there,

801
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,511
- Mr. Cooper.
Well, after the acting

802
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,430
- and stuff.
- No need

803
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,807
to be embarrassed. Hell,
if Arnold can do it, right?

804
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,768
Now, you wouldn't
want any nasty secrets

805
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,269
screwing that up for you,
though, would you?

806
00:32:58,478 --> 00:32:59,854
Is there a point to this?

807
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,315
Mr. Cooper, were you having
an affair with Delilah?

808
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:03,608
Honey!

809
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,151
Have you been
getting my texts?

810
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,402
I thought they were
breaking you for lunch

811
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:07,654
like a half hour ago.

812
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:09,656
What's going on?

813
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:12,158
These people are detectives.

814
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,409
Real ones?

815
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,286
We have some questions
about Delilah.

816
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,372
Oh. Oh. Yes, it's so sad.

817
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,623
Yeah. Very sad.

818
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,084
Your watch,
where'd you get that?

819
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,503
Oh, it's a prop.

820
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:24,671
No, that's the one

821
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:25,755
Delilah gave you, isn't it?

822
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:26,965
For <i>Time Will Tell?</i>

823
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:29,342
Right.
That's the movie

824
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,678
that we did.
It was a wrap gift.

825
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,013
Yeah. She buy a $10,000 watch

826
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:35,515
for the whole crew?
Uh, no.

827
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,725
Just me, as far as I know.

828
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:40,019
'Cause we were,
you know,

829
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:41,980
costars and everything.

830
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,982
You know, you're gonna have
to get much better at lying

831
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,316
if you want to be president.

832
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:47,652
I know, right?

833
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,529
So you were sleeping
with her, then, yeah?

834
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:52,865
Oh, yeah.

835
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,373
Crap. I just said that
in front of people.

836
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,000
Whatever.
It's not like I didn't know.

837
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,668
God, you are a
terrible liar.

838
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,044
And actor, by the way.

839
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:06,838
You knew?
Of course.

840
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:09,882
Why else do you think I've been
sleeping with Bobby?

841
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:11,050
Are you serious?

842
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:13,052
Oh, yeah. And it is good.

843
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:15,555
Mmm. I climb that man
like a tree.

844
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:16,556
Right, Bobby?

845
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,224
My bodyguard?

846
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,184
What a cliché.

847
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:22,228
Oh, I'm a cliché?
Well, you're a dick.

848
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:23,271
Oh, boy.

849
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,399
- Hey, guys...
- Come on!

850
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,068
Hey, guys. Arrest them.

851
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,237
Seriously?

852
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:33,364
One of them's got
to be guilty.

853
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:45,334
♪ Hit me point-blank,
hit me point-blank ♪

854
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,170
♪ Hit me point-blank... ♪

855
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:49,672
Thanks.

856
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:54,052
So, Grey and Amanda have
zero connection to the shooter.

857
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,888
But the shooter had
the same watch as Grey.

858
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:58,765
That can't be a coincidence.

859
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:03,352
Maybe Delilah gave him one, too,
like kind of a go-to gift. I...

860
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:04,771
Well, that would imply
she was actually

861
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:05,855
sleeping with that maggot.

862
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,690
Really?

863
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:10,693
Jimmy, 2Vile,
Grey Cooper.

864
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:12,653
That's three other maggots
she's sleeping with.

865
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,405
I don't think there's a lot
of discretion going on with her.

866
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:15,573
Yeah. I suppose you got a point.

867
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,203
God, what am I doing here?

868
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:22,830
Wrong deity, but, yes,
that is the eternal question.

869
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,625
No. I mean here, in a bar,

870
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:26,876
- with you.
- Well, I don't know.

871
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:28,711
You tell me, Detective.

872
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,047
I mean, despite
your proclaimed revulsion,

873
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,716
you can't deny that
there's a connection between us.

874
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:36,636
Tell me, what do
you actually want?

875
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:39,722
You mean what do I desire
more than anything else

876
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:41,682
- in this life?
- Yes.

877
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,559
- Mm-hmm.
- No tricks. Not that they work
on you, you freak.

878
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:48,439
Seriously. I'm curious.

879
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:49,982
I don't know.

880
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,734
What-what I told you's true.

881
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:54,695
I-I really do want
to help people.

882
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,365
My father was a cop.

883
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:58,908
He was a great cop.

884
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,743
My mother was an actress.

885
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:02,245
Really cheesy one.

886
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:05,414
I tried the acting thing.
I took off my top.

887
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:07,875
Wasn't really contributing
to the betterment of society.

888
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,044
I disagree. I love that movie.

889
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:12,588
So I quit.

890
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,674
Decided to become a cop
like my dad

891
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:16,717
and, uh, dealt with the whole
<i>Hot Tub High School</i> thing,

892
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,469
until, um,

893
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:20,680
I became a detective
and found a whole new way

894
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:23,057
- to ostracize myself.
- Ah, the...

895
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:25,476
reason your ex-maggot
was pressuring you

896
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:27,103
to close this?

897
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:28,688
Yeah. Yeah.

898
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:30,898
Exactly. There was a case,

899
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:33,776
a shooting on Palmetto Street
where a cop was shot,

900
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:36,070
and I saw it differently
than pretty much everyone

901
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,114
in my department,
including my ex.

902
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:39,824
And I stuck
my neck out,

903
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,909
and it backfired.

904
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:44,078
And, uh, now...

905
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:46,747
no one wants to work with me.

906
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:48,624
Well, I'm available.

907
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,253
Too bad your little protégé

908
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,462
isn't around
to collect the check.

909
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:54,630
The soundtrack album

910
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,174
for the movie <i>Time Will Tell</i>

911
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,634
has reached number 15
on the Billboard charts

912
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:00,386
and is still climbing.
Song and record sales...

913
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:01,637
Oh, wow.

914
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:04,098
What?

915
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:08,144
Delilah didn't give that watch
to the drug dealer.

916
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,818
♪ - Got a heavy load,
sometimes I wonder... ♪
- Stop, stop, stop!

917
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:19,071
What is it? You got a gerbil in
your throat? What's going on?

918
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:22,658
Hello, Jimmy.

919
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,327
Really?

920
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:25,995
How's the album sales doing?

921
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:27,914
What album?

922
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:29,790
Soundtrack to <i>Time Will Tell,</i>
which you produced.

923
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:33,169
Whitney Houston hit the top ten
for album sales after her death.

924
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,171
Michael Jackson hit
the stratosphere.

925
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:38,174
Not sure you'll achieve such
heights having Delilah killed,

926
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:41,385
but that sure is a boatload of
royalty checks headed your way.

927
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:44,847
Guess you really
needed the cash, huh?

928
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:48,142
Which is why you had to pay
the shooter with your watch.

929
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:50,353
The watch Delilah gave you.
Now, that's just sick.

930
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,063
But then you are, so...

931
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:56,359
Hey, Jimmy?

932
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:57,860
I made her,
and she ruined me.

933
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,863
She humiliated me.
She owes me.

934
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:02,740
You're not God, Jimmy.
You didn't make her.

935
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,034
But you did destroy her.

936
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:06,911
So I'm gonna punish you.

937
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,580
You back off,
you freak. I mean it.

938
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,916
I am not going to jail
for that bitch. No chance.

939
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,376
Listen to him,
Lucifer. Back off.

940
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:15,169
I told you, it's fine.
I'm immortal.

941
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:20,216
Why did you do that?

942
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:22,260
- He was gonna kill you.
- No, no, no,

943
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:25,263
no, no, no. You just...
you just let him off too easy.

944
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,265
He needs to pay!
He needs to suffer!

945
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:28,933
He needs to feel the pain,

946
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:31,435
- not escape it!
- Don't worry.

947
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:33,771
I'm sure where he's going,
the pain's coming.

948
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,606
No. No, it's not, actually.

949
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,775
And you know why?
Because I'm here and he's...

950
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:49,120
Chloe.

951
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:53,124
I don't want to die.

952
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:55,793
I won't let you.

953
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,547
Your father will just have
to wait for you.

954
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:07,888
Just... give me one second.

955
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:16,105
No, please! No, no,

956
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:18,274
please! Please.

957
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:20,735
Please don't kill me.

958
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:21,986
Oh, Jimmy.

959
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,823
You're gonna wish
that's all

960
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:28,409
I did to you.

961
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:44,425
Well,

962
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,094
look who's back.

963
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,978
How long have I been out?

964
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:58,814
Three years.

965
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:01,150
What?

966
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:05,946
You're such an ass.

967
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:07,948
- Thank you.
- Oh, God.

968
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:12,536
He was firing at you.

969
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,664
Why aren't you...

970
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:17,500
more dead?

971
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:19,877
You're having a very hard time
with the immortal thing,

972
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:22,046
aren't you?

973
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,009
- What happened with Jimmy?
- Jimmy?

974
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:29,512
Jimmy got what he deserved.

975
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,305
Hmm?

976
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:35,184
Well, I'm pretty sure
I'd be dead

977
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:36,644
if you hadn't helped me,
so...

978
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,896
thank you.

979
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:40,856
Sorry, what was that?
That last bit.

980
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:42,733
I didn't quite
get that.

981
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,569
Thank you.

982
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,697
You're welcome.

983
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:50,574
And, besides, you know,

984
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,701
you're far too interesting
to let die.

985
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:56,372
You saved my life
because I'm interesting?

986
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,416
Wildly irritating as well,
but yes.

987
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:03,587
So what now?

988
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:05,047
Well, I mean,
I've obviously proven myself

989
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:06,424
to be an invaluable
crime-fighting tool.

990
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,509
You're a pariah
in the department.

991
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:10,010
I think this could be the start

992
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:11,011
of a beautiful friendship.
Don't you?

993
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,013
Who the hell are you?

994
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:15,266
I told you, I'm...

995
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:16,851
Lucifer!

996
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:20,062
Uh, yes. Hello, child.

997
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,189
Um, just... Why don't you save

998
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:24,024
some of this unpleasantness
for your mother, yeah?

999
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,276
Ooh.

1000
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:27,278
- Sorry.
- Oh.

1001
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,405
- God.
- Are you hurt?

1002
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:30,906
I'm okay.

1003
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:32,700
Right.
Well, I'd stay for

1004
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,577
the family reunion,
but it's giving me terrible IBS.

1005
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:36,996
So, look forward
to seeing you soon, Chloe.

1006
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,081
- I don't.
- Bye, now.

1007
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,458

I've been watching you, Lucifer.

1014
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,941
- You perv.
- And I'm not sure

1015
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,568
I like what I see.

1016
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:10,279
You're showing restraint, mercy.

You scared I'm turning my back

1018

Lucifer, there is a balance here
that we must maintain.

1019
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:19,830
I strongly suggest you do
what I told you to do

1020
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,290
and go back to Hell.

1021
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:24,293
Don't threaten me, Amenadiel.

1022
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:26,921
I mean, you don't want
to start a war.

1023
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:30,174
I would love a war.

1024
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,179
Oh, Luci.

1025
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:38,766
My hatred for you grows stronger
with every visit.

1026
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:42,019
Well, I wouldn't have it
any other way, pal.

1027
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:45,105
I look forward
to eating your heart one day.

1028
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:46,690
Peace.

1029
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:56,867
Ugh.

1030
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:07,378
I sense your
disapproval, Maze.

1031
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,380
What is it?

1032
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:14,885
I just can't understand
why you would save a human life.

1033
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:17,346
Well, there's...
something different about her

1034
00:43:17,555 --> 00:43:19,974
that I don't quite understand,
and it vexes me.

1035
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:22,518
Maybe it's not her
that's different.

1036
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:25,062
Is this
where I'm supposed to ask,

1037
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:26,855
"Whatever do you mean?"

1038
00:43:27,064 --> 00:43:29,525
I'm worried the humans
are rubbing off on you.

1039
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:31,860
Stop caring.

1040
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,947
You're the Devil.

1041
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:39,243
Yes, I am.

1042
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,883
Okay. Right.
Uh...

1043
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:57,052
Here's the deal.
We can have as much naked

you're gonna have
to listen to me, too.

1046
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,685
There's a few things that
I'd like to discuss with you.

1047
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:08,022
You know, just a...
an existential dilemma or two.

1048
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,231

1049
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,400
