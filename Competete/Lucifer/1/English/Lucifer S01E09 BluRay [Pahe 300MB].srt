<i>I could have told
everyone the truth.</i>

4
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:11,221
You shot me.

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,305
Why didn't you?

6
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:14,182
'Cause I got big plans for you.

7
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:15,558
You betrayed me, Maze.

8
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,143
- Lucifer, I...
- I don't want to hear it.

9
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:18,520
We're done.

12
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,400
I'm bleeding.

13
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:25,151
I'm just realizing the gravity
of what you're saying.

14
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,404
That I'm allergic
to lead projectiles?

15
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:28,488
All I have to do

16
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:30,323
is wait for some pitiful thug

17
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:31,825
to end you.

18
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,494
And right back to Hell you go.

19
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:36,204
People come to me to ask for
favors, and more often than not,

20
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:37,831
- I'm happy to oblige.
- What do you get?

21
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,082
A devilish I.O.U., if you will.

I don't know, Doctor.
That's what I pay you

to figure out, isn't it?

71
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,773
Have you ever considered that
all of this excessive partying

72
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:30,318
may be your attempt
to fill a void?

73
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:31,361
"Attempt"?

74
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,113
I filled five voids last night.

75
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:35,949
That's not what I mean.

00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,283

in your emotional life.

78
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,995
You sound...

79
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:43,957
...lonely.

80
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,667
"Lonely"?

81
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,002
Have... have you been listening
to a word I've said?

82
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:49,587
I am never alone.

83
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,006
I'm constantly
surrounded by people.

84
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,967
You know?
I party whenever I desire.

85
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:55,135
My bed never cold.

00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,011
Lucifer, being alone

87
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,389
and being lonely
are two entirely

88
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:00,431
different things.

89
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,808
- Are they?
- Yes!

90
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,476
You may be surrounded by others,

91
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,937
but do you truly consider
any of those people

92
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:07,647
your friend?

93
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:10,483

to spend time with.

Someone with whom you share
a meaningful connection.

97
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,491
Well, you and I
connect quite well.

98
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,160

No.

105
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,175
Do you consider her your friend?

106
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,429
Well, quite honestly, I...

137
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,546
it's being used as a front
for an illegal drug operation.

00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:56,798
The center's director,

139
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,091
Lenny Arietta,
is recruiting kids

140
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,842
from my church
to move his product.

00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,428
Ah, so this is about young boys,
of course it is.

142
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,264
One in particular.

143
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:07,141
A kid named Connor.

144
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,103
He's had it rough.

145
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,604
Lost both
his parents at six.

146
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:13,356
Bounced from home to home,
some juvie.

147
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,150
But deep down, a good kid.

148
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,610
So, diddling this one, are you?

149
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,155
How about I not dignify that
with an answer,

150
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,615
and instead ask my favor?

151
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:23,741
I was wondering
when you'd get to it.

152
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,784
I want you
to talk to Arietta

153
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:26,786
before Connor gets involved.

154
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:29,455
And why not go to the police?

155
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:30,873
Got something to hide, do you?

156
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,250
They were useless.

157
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,710
Couldn't find
anything on Arietta.

158
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,169

On the contrary,

163
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:43,303
I believe he led me to you.

164
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,138
I highly doubt that.

165
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,475
So that's it, is it?

166
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:52,186
Stop a drug ring to help
some kid get out of trouble.

167
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:53,771
What's in it for you?

168
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:57,025
What is it you really want?

169
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:59,861
That dirty dark
desire I can

170
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,572

to hold in.

171
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,867
What I really want...

172
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,660
Yeah?

173
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:11,205
...is to put my fist
through Arietta's face.

174
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,498
Ha!

175
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:13,958
And there it is.

else are you hiding?

181
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,222
Hypocrites like you

182
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:29,766

- Oh, I know plenty.

184
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,855

00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:38,524
My answer to you, Father,

186
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:41,736
is a big fat no.

187
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,364
Handle it yourself.

188
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:51,746
<i>You're lucky I don't have
any active cases,</i>

189
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,581
or else I'd send
this to Narcotics.

190
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,957
"Narcotics"?
No, no, no, no.

191
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,292
I don't give a damn
about the drug dealer.

192
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:57,418
We're here
to investigate the priest.

193
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:59,295
Priest?

194
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:00,546
I thought we were here to
talk to the youth director.

195
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,382
We are.
To get dirt on the priest.

196
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,050
He must be hiding something.

197
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,718
And what better to way
to stick it to dear old Dad

198
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:07,595
than prove that those
who speak on His behalf

199
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:10,139
aren't as virtuous
as they pretend to be.

200
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,474
You thought it'd be a good idea

201
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,850
to rope me into your
imaginary family feud?

202
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:14,435
Great.

203
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:16,854
Look, am I mistaken or
do you catch bad guys?

204
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,731
Now, this priest
is up to something.

205
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,983
Something nefarious--
I can feel it.

206
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:23,778
Last I checked, your feelings
don't count as probable cause.

207
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,863
Well, isn't the fact
that he came to me

208
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,156
probable cause enough?

209
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,241
Or I could just interrogate

210
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,742
this youth director by myself.

211
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,911
No, just let me do the talking.

212
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,913
Mr. Arietta?

213
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,998
Hmm.

214
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:37,583
Well, if I were trapped in here
with these vile children,

215
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:38,876
I'd lock my door as well.

216
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,140
Detective.

217
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:01,107
He's dead.

218
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,775
Wow.

219
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:04,819
Told you the priest
was up to something.

220
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,502
M.E. puts the time
of Arietta's death

221
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,379
between 11:30
and 12:00 this morning.

222
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,423
Cause was multiple hits
with a baseball bat.

223
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,924
There are some abrasions
on his face.

224
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,427
So it looks like he struggled
before he died.

225
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:30,678
And I found this.

226
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,305
Ooh, what's that?

227
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,973
It's a voice modulator.
Hey, can you not do that?

228
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:35,475
Detective, I am your father.

229
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,143
It's not a toy, Lucifer.

230
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,311
It could be evidence.

231
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,353
Well, I'm impressed.

232
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:40,646
Looks like the priest

233
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,690
handled it himself after all.

234
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,066
- We don't know
the priest did this.
- Well, maybe you don't.

235
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,067
Detective Decker?

236
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,277
Hold on.

237
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:47,820
Oh, can you take that?

238
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:48,988
Yeah.
Thank you.

239
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,870
Hey, you're
the head counselor, right?

240
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,330
Uh, yeah.

241
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,831
Um, Eric Doyle.

242
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,832
Any idea who might've done this?

243
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,042
No.

244
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,835
I mean, everyone liked Lenny.

245
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,837
He was a good boss.

246
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,506
So, he had no enemies
whatsoever, no?

247
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:10,176
Especially any who wear
clerical collars?

248
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,178
- So you know about the priest.
- Oh, yes.

249
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,096
Yeah, that guy's always
coming around here

250
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:15,389
and getting
into arguments with Lenny.

251
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:16,849
Hmm.

252
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,101
But he's a priest.

253
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,436
Right.

254
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:21,854
Mr. Doyle, where were you

255
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,231
between 11:30
and 12:00 this morning?

256
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,359
Uh... here.

257
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,986
In counseling sessions
with, uh, Nikki and Connor.

258
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,279
Connor?

259
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:31,364
Well, that's the altar boy

260
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,366
from the priest's photo.

261
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,951
So, is it, is it true

262
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,202
Mr. Arietta's dead?

263
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,538
Well, duh, dumb-ass.

264
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:39,747
It is.

265
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:40,873
Yeah.

266
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:41,916
Did you know him well?

267
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,042
A little, I guess.

268
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:44,919
He, he,
I mean, he ran the place.

269
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,755
Do you know if Mr. Arietta was
involved in any drug activity?

270
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,048
Drugs?

271
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:50,591
I mean, I wish he was.

272
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,884
That would've made him
more interesting.

273
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,636
Okay.

274
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,263
Enough about the dead guy.

275
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,390
Tell me everything you know
about Padre Pederast.

276
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,599
Who?

277
00:09:58,808 --> 00:09:59,934
Father Frank.

278
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,143
Did you see him do this?

279
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:02,853
Do you think
he's capable?

280
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,231
Father Frank
kill Mr. Arietta?

281
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,274
Yes.

282
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:07,567
No.
No way.

283
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,318
What do you mean "no way"?

284
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:10,778
The guy's a creeper and
totally obsessed with you.

285
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:12,405
He's just overprotective.

286
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,157
Ever since my parents died,

287
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:17,660
he feels like he's got to watch
out for me or something.

288
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,203
But he's a good guy.

289
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:20,746
He's just a little...

290
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,748
just a little annoying.

291
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:23,749
- See?
- Hmm?

292
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,918
- Annoying.
- Mm-hmm.

293
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,420
When was the last
time you saw him?

294
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,422
Uh, he-here this morning.

295
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,716
Yeah, preacher seemed
pretty pissed.

296
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:32,883
Oh.

297
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,135
Uh, wait, you don't
really think

298
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,553
that, like, Father Frank
did this, right?

299
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,221
- 100%.
- Thank you.

300
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,557
You've been
very helpful.

301
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:40,558
Right.

302
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,560
See? Told you.

303
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,521
No, I hate to admit it, but
you might be on to something.

304
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,564
Sorry,
what was that?

305
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:47,815
You might be on to something.

306
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,571
That's him.

307
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,531
Frank Lawrence.

308
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,617
The most evil of people
have the most normal names,

309
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,285
I've experienced.

310
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,828
Beware anyone
named Keith.

311
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,083
Well, his criminal
record's pretty extensive.

312
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,960
Assault and battery,
disorderly conduct,

313
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,629
- drug charges.
- See?

314
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:10,963
Not very
priest-like.

315
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:13,132
But nothing
in the past ten years.

316
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:16,469
Ah, restraining order

317
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,804
filed by Lenny
Arietta last week.

318
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,765
Ah, well,
it's funny how Padre Punchy

319
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,099
failed to mention
a restraining order.

320
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:23,434
Please tell me
now we have enough

321
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:24,769
to bring this priest down.

322
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:25,936
We have enough
to bring him in.

323
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,688
You ready
to go to church?

324
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:29,607
Bringing down a priest is
the only reason I ever would.

325
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,275
<i>In</i>. Bring him <i>in.</i>

326
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:32,943
Yes, bring him <i>in</i> so
we can bring him down.

327
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,781
Hey, um,
you go ahead.

328
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,783
I'll... I'll meet
you downstairs.

329
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:41,035
Just something
I got to do first.

330
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,797
Hey, so I'm in the middle
of something,

331
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,465
but I haven't seen
you all week.

332
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:55,966
Are we gonna talk
about what happened?

333
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,680
What?

334
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,264
Our kiss, Dan.

335
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:03,891
It's kind of
a big deal.

336
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,643
Right, I'm sorry, Chloe.

337
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:06,894
I've had a lot
on my mind.

338
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:08,854
Yeah. You okay?

339
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:09,855
Yeah, I'm fine.

340
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,899
But we should talk.

341
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,568
About everything.
Just not here.

342
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,029
Okay, do you want to do dinner
at my place, get takeout?

343
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:19,323
Yeah.
Zhang Chow's?

344
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,701
Zhang Chow...
I was just gonna say that.

345
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:22,827
Yeah, all right.

346
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,495
Sounds good.

347
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:26,288
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah.

348
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,341
Oh, how's it going, buddy?

349
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,720
Malcolm, what are
you doing here?

350
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,934
Oh, you didn't hear
the good news?

351
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:49,270
Back on duty.

352
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:50,604
So soon after, um...?

353
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,940
What, my partner's suicide?

354
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,570
Yeah, can't let that keep
me down, am I right?

355
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,156
But don't worry.
I already got
a new partner.

356
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,825
Yeah, convinced the higher-ups
to give me my first choice.

357
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,243
You.

358
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,413
Oh, my God.

359
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,541
Seriously, Dan, you
got to try this.

360
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:15,963
What's your game, Malcolm?

361
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,424
Partners? Are you kidding me?

362
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,427
Oh, well, what better way to
keep an eye on you, am I right?

363
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,762
I saw you talking
to Decker.

364
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,888
You want to tell
her, don't you?

365
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,517
What, that I'm the one
who shot you?

366
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:29,518
Why would I do that?

367
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,520
Your conscience.

368
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,522
I know you, Danny Boy.

369
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,524
You forget, this ain't the
first time we've been partners.

370
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,193
I looked the other way
a few times.

371
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,944
- That didn't make us partners.
- Sure, it did.

372
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,946
Yeah, and it ate away at you

373
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:42,573
until you finally had
enough at Palmetto.

374
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,325
<i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

375
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,826
<i>No, I-I understand.
No, I get it, I get it.</i>

376
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:47,036
No, you were just protecting
that wife of yours.

377
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,913
<i>She saw me, I went for my gun.</i>

378
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,040
<i>Boom. No, you took me out
before I could take her out.</i>

379
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,917
No, no hard feelings.

380
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,585
I understand.

381
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:59,256
But... the minute you
want to come clean,

382
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:02,927
you and I-- we
both go to jail.

383
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,929
Hmm?

384
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:08,265
I mean, you... you really want
to throw away your marriage?

385
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:11,101
Watch little Trixie grow
up from behind bars?

386
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,561
Think this through, Dan.

387
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,232
With you gone, uh, who's
gonna protect Chloe?

388
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,109
What do you want
from me, Malcolm?

389
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,945
Nothing much.

390
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,114
You're gonna go into evidence
and borrow something for me.

391
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:25,950
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

392
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,712
♪ Ghost town on a dirt track ♪

393
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,589
♪ I got a yellow moon
and a voodoo hack... ♪

394
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,347
Knock, knock.

395
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,059
Stay here while I look
for Father Frank,

396
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:53,602
- and don't get into any trouble.
- It's a church!

397
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,313
What am I gonna do,
pray too hard?

398
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,280
Hello.

399
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,615
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

400
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,285
It's been three hours
since my last confession.

401
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:10,619
Three hours?

402
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,288
Speedy sinner,
I like it.

403
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,291
No, I just need
more guidance.

404
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:19,962
I'm still having lustful
thoughts about another man.

405
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,338
Splendid.

406
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,299
Who's the lucky fellow?

407
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:27,052
Um, my husband's limo driver.

408
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,388
What should
I do, Father?

409
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:33,100
Well, my dear, uh, you should
embrace your desires.

410
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:35,102
Really?

411
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,147
Uh, when I was here earlier,
Father Frank told me

412
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,149
I should be faithful
to my husband.

413
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,151
Well, I don't know why you're
listening to that fool.

414
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,320
I mean, let's be honest,
if you wanted to be faithful,

415
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,323
then you wouldn't be fantasizing
about your limo driver,

416
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,158
- now, would you, eh?
- You're right.

417
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,576
No, no, no, no, no,
don't feel bad.

418
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,244
You have those desires
for a reason.

419
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:53,913
You should act on them.

420
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,165
I mean, you can always come
back here, confess,

421
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,625
and all will be forgiven.

422
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,335
Isn't that how this system
of yours works?

423
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,129
When you put
it that way...

424
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,173
Lucifer, what do you
think you're doing?

425
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:09,386
For your penance, ten Bloody
Marys and a good shag.

426
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:21,982
I know you're there.

427
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,027
What, are you watching over me?

428
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,822
Like my own guardian angel.

429
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,368
Yeah.

430
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,703
Grumpy guardian angel.

431
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,622
Forgotten about
our deal, Malcolm?

432
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,042
Because I brought you back from
the dead for a single purpose.

433
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,671
Yeah, about that, I've...
been meaning to ask.

434
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,714
Why me?

435
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,216
- Why you?
- Yeah.

436
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,885
I mean, uh, I must be
something special

437
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:51,470
for you to go
to all that trouble.

438
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,473
Come on, don't flatter yourself.

439
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:57,476
You're simply in a unique
position to do what I need done.

440
00:16:57,685 --> 00:17:00,479
'Cause I'm a cop.

441
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,148
That, yeah.

442
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,818
Yeah, and because I
know you'll do anything

443
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,778
to avoid going back to Hell.

444
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:13,409
Now, stop bothering me
with these questions

445
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,244
and just get to the task
I've given you.

446
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,579
Don't you worry
your shiny little head.

447
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,581
I'm already on it, all right?

448
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,583
Everything's going
according to plan.

449
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,544
Don't keep me waiting.

450
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:29,800
Patience is not
one of my virtues.

451
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,972
I promise you, I... I got this.

452
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,229
Mr. Morningstar,
surprised to see you again.

453
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:44,565
Oh, I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

454
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,692
Father Frank, when was the
last time you saw Lenny Arietta?

455
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,485
This morning.

456
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,029
Despite the restraining order.

457
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,405
I answer to a higher authority.

458
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,781
Not today you don't.

459
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,284
What happened when you saw him?

460
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,952
We exchanged words.

461
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:58,746
Things got a little heated.

462
00:17:58,954 --> 00:17:59,955
What were you fighting about?

463
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:02,124
That altar boy
of his, of course.

464
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,126
Why were you fighting
over Connor?

465
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,128
Because I'm worried that
Arietta's gonna pull Connor

466
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,421
into his drug ring.

467
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:08,589
So, what, you give
him a right hook?

468
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,800
Sadly, I did.

469
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,969
And then what?
And then I left.

470
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,888
Ooh, no, no, no, I think you
skipped a part, didn't you?

471
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,931
You know, the part where
you beat him to death

472
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,932
with a baseball bat?

473
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,602
He's dead?

474
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,896
Oh, Heavenly Father.

475
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,147
Oh, come on.

476
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,107
How gullible
do you think we are?

477
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:31,236
I had troubles with the man,
but he didn't deserve to die.

478
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,113
And I certainly didn't kill him.

479
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,448
Can you account
for your whereabouts

480
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,325
between 11:30 and 12:00
this morning?

481
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,660
Uh, I was here.

482
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:40,329
Taking confessions.

483
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,831
Mrs. Madison had a lot to say,
took up the whole hour.

484
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,918
By chance, does Mrs. Madison
have a limo driver?

485
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,170
She does.

486
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,671
Damn.

487
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,673
Just spoke to his alibi.

488
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,008
What?

489
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,009
The MILF in confession.

490
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,636
Oh, great.

491
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,346
Yeah, as much as I'm sure
that followed protocol,

492
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,973
I'm still gonna have
to question her myself.

493
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:02,976
Father, I'm gonna need you

494
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,312
to come into the station
for a statement.

495
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,358
Well, maybe the padre has
a twin brother

496
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,443
who also takes confession; that
way he could still be guilty.

497
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,196
Lucifer, seriously,
will you just...

498
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,281
Get down!

499
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,925
And you wonder why
I don't go to church.

500
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,517
<i>I caught a partial
from the shooter's plate.</i>

501
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,185
Can you run this for me?

502
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:46,603
- You got it.
- Thank you.

503
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,897
So I spoke to
Father Frank's alibi.

504
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,357
Checks out.

505
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:51,692
He was in confession
with Mrs. Madison

506
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,860
from 11:00 to 12:00.

507
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,194
He's not our guy.

508
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,737
Well, maybe she's lying.

509
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,406
I mean, you know the sort
of people that go to church.

510
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,116
Sinners.

511
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:02,327
Lab results from the voice
modulator came back empty.

512
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,997
No prints, no DNA.

513
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,665
What, so you think
this shooting

514
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,001
and the youth director's
death are connected?

515
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,336
We know they have at least
one thing in common.

516
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,091
Father, you will be relieved
to know that no one was injured.

517
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,093
- Oh, thank God.
- Please don't.

518
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,095
You care to tell us
what that was about?

519
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,430
The shooting?

520
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,015
I don't know.

521
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,684
This wasn't
a random attack.

522
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,020
They were
shooting at you.

523
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,354
But you don't
seem surprised.

524
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,772
What aren't you
telling us?

525
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,280
Keep your nose
out of our business or else.

526
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,283
The voice modulator
from Arietta's office.

527
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,243
You should have gone
to the police with this.

528
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:46,622
I assumed it was Arietta,
and I'm not afraid of him.

529
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,790
But if it's The Spider...

530
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,584
Spider?

531
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,085
I've heard whispers
of another dealer

532
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,295
trying to take over
Arietta's business.

533
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:55,339
People call him "The Spider."

534
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:56,965
Scary, violent reputation.

535
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,508
Do you know who this Spider is?

536
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,136
I don't.

537
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,180
You're holding something back,
Father. I can tell.

538
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,558
Hmm?

539
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:07,851
I have a confession to make.

540
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,728
Finally!
Well, the truth

541
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,563
will set you free-- isn't that
what your beloved book says?

542
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,149
I lied when I said Connor was
in danger of becoming involved.

543
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,151
He already is.
Dealing for Arietta.

544
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,110
What, that's it?

545
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,987
Oh, please don't tell me

546
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,280
that's what you've been
holding back all this time.

547
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:21,990
Wait. If Connor's
already in deep,

548
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,325
why go to all this trouble
to protect him?

549
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,702
He's had it rough.

550
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,329
Thinks he can only
rely on himself.

551
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,665
He's a good kid,
Detective.

552
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,541
There's still hope for him.

553
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,336
Father, you were today's target.

554
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:35,796
We need to worry
about your safety first.

555
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,340
Do you have
a place to stay?

556
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,341
We can offer
police protection.

557
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,884
I'm fine right here.

558
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,930
This... is my sanctuary.

559
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,807
Well, your sanctuary
just got shot

560
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,350

561
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,978
But if you're looking
to lay low,

562
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,313

Hey.

569
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,548
So, partial plates
from the shooter's SUV

570
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:20,757
came back with
a couple matches.

571
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,384
But this is interesting:
one of them

572
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,553
was recently reported stolen
outside the youth center.

573
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,555
Oh, you think someone
inside's responsible.

574
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,223
I think it's too much of
a coincidence not to be,

575
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,475
but I ordered
traffic cam footage,

576
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,060
so hopefully it'll show us
who was driving.

577

Well, the man deserves some fun.

Or you still want
to prove he's a hypocrite.

Well, what can I say?

00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,281

Car accident.

613
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:49,930
Ten years ago.

614
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,140
I was traveling with
Connor and his family.

615
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,102
Uh, Connor's dad was a drummer,

616
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,104
we used to play together.

617
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,981

into our lane and, uh...

Connor lost both
his parents that night.

She didn't make it, either.

621
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,917
Thought I'd seen some dark days.

622
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:22,003
Nothing compared
to losing my little girl.

623
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,338

awfully angry
at your beloved God.

627
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,389
I was so... untethered.

628
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:33,890
Lost.

629
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,725
Turning to Him is what saved me.

and then you decided
to worship Him?

I can't really
explain it,

633
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,734
but somehow it made me feel
that she was safe.

634
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,363
That's when
I discovered my faith.

635
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:51,908
The church gave me purpose.

636
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,536
It was there that I crossed
paths with Connor again.

637
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,539

00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:25,914
Or because Connor's The Spider.

718
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:27,957
Traffic cam footage.

719
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,670
Ah, from the church shooting.

720
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,546
So the boy the priest
was trying to protect

721
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,090
is the one
who tried to kill him?

722
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,634
Well, isn't that
an ironic kick in the cassock.

723
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:52,399
This doesn't prove
Connor's The Spider.

724
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,567
It's pretty damning, Father.

725
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:55,902
And it's enough for the APB

726
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,737
- that just went out.
- Ah.

727
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:58,905
Connor's been declared
armed and dangerous.

728
00:28:59,114 --> 00:28:59,906
Armed and dangerous?

729
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,408
The boy needs to be helped,

730
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:02,492
convinced to turn himself in.

731
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:03,702
Father, he shot at you.

732
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,371
He fired into a room
full of kids.

733
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,373
Yes, but he shot up, didn't he?

734
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,417
We'll do everything we can
to bring him in peacefully.

735
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,254
If you'll excuse me, I...

736
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,422
need some air.

737
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,424
Uh...

738
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,175
I have some
digging to do.

739
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:20,760
- Will you watch over him
until I get back?
- What...?

740
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,595
You want me
to babysit the priest?

741
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,973
I babysit you all the time.

742
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,155
Need a light?

743
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:43,908
No, thanks.

744
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:45,118
Quit years ago.

745
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,703
Still enjoy the ritual, though.

746
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,621
Always keep one on me.

747
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,083
Please tell me you didn't
come out here to talk to Him.

748
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,294
God?

749
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:55,628
This is as good a spot as any.

750
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,424
Right.

751
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:01,926
Does He, uh...

752
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,261
does He ever talk back?

753
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,972
I don't need to hear Him
to... hear Him.

754
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,390
If you know
what I mean.

755
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,768
Well, yes,
He never talks to me, either.

756
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,478
Listen, um...

757
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,813
sorry about the altar boy.

758
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,482
Surely you know
you're not to blame.

759
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,026
I mean, some people are
just... beyond saving.

760
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,402
That's where you're wrong.

761
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:20,779
There's still hope for him.

762
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,949
He shot up your church,

763
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,951
he's most likely running
a drug ring behind your back,

764
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,661
and, oh, yes, killed a man.

765
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,788
I don't believe that.

766
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:30,997
Look, what if it's true?

767
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,373
Then he needs me even more.

768
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:34,167
How can you still
have faith in this boy?

769
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,419
God has faith in him.

770
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:37,712
In all of us.

771
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,047
Even in our darkest moments.

772
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:40,173
Oh, you really believe that.

773
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:41,674
I do.

774
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,134
Why don't you?

775
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:48,681
Because He didn't
have faith in me.

776
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,352
I felt that way once, too.

777
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,021
But now I know,
deep in my heart,

778
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,065
God has a plan for me.

779
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,025
Oh, His <i>plan</i> for me
was quite clear.

780
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:01,653
How do you know it's finished?

781
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:13,164
Mm.

782
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,086
What?

783
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:20,588
One of my parishioners, uh,

784
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,382
a lot of them are still
upset about the shooting.

785
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,758
Excuse me.

786
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:26,594
Yeah.

787
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:36,813
There.

788
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,023
I got what you wanted
from evidence.

789
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,363
Are we done?

790
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:48,616
Not by a long shot.

791
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,201

No, he took a call.

So you're talking to me now?

00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,730
Have you seen him?!

804
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,274
He was down here on his phone.

805
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,817
Heard him talking
to someone named Connor.

806
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:24,068
- He left to go meet him.
- He left?

807
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:25,111
Where to?

808
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:30,825
Maybe he's trying to convince
Connor to turn himself in.

809
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,119
No. He's probably trying
to hide the little miscreant.

810
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:35,079
Put his faith in God,
not the police.

811
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:37,457
Why do you care about a priest?

812
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,125
I don't.

813
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:40,501
Where would he
hide him?

814
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,463
Somewhere he considers
safe, I assume.

815
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,173
Sanctuary.

816
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:01,105
You don't want to do this.

817
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:03,316
- I know you. This isn't you.
- Sorry,

818
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:05,860
I don't have a choice, okay?
I have to do this.
I get it.

819
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:07,278
You don't think
you can rely on anyone else

820
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:08,780
to survive--
but you're not alone.

821
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:11,157
I'm here for you,
whenever you need me.

822
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,660
I don't need you! Okay?

823
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,787
I don't need anybody!

824
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,664
Go on, then,
shoot the altar boy.

825
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,707
- Shh.
- In the leg or
something, obviously.

826
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,501
Just do it, Connor.

827
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:23,336
Pull the damn
trigger already.

828
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:24,545
That's Eric Doyle.

829
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:25,797
The counselor.

830
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,632
That's our Spider.

831
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,428
You know, Nikki... I trust.

832
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,973
But you?

833
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,849
I think you're too attached
to this preacher.

834
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,810
You're gonna
have to show me

835
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,186
that you're not.

836
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:41,479
No shot from here.

837
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:42,480
I know you, Connor.

838
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:43,815
That drive-by,

839
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,483
you intentionally
missed me, didn't you?

840
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:46,651
Stop talking. Please.

841
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,361
Make him stop talking.

842
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:49,737
- It's really easy.
- You couldn't
do it then,

843
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,364
and you don't want
to do it now.

844
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:52,490
God's giving you

845
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,534
a second chance right here.

846
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,202
E-Enough with the
sermon, preacher!

847
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,454
Connor, just shoot
this son of a bitch already.

848
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,415
Just follow
your heart, son.

849
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:01,833
I have faith in you.

850
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:12,385
- I can't do it, Doyle.
- I'm sorry.

851
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:13,636
I'm sorry, too, kid.

852
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:15,638
I can't allow weakness,

853
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:17,724
not when I've just
taken control.

854
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:18,558
No!

855
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:23,563
Father!

856
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:28,776
Hands up.
Get down on the ground.

857
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:31,571
No, no, no, you idiot!

858
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,620
What the bloody hell
were you thinking?!

859
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,456
Unit 831 at St. Morgan's Church.

860
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:45,168
- We need two ambos, code 4.
- Don't go anywhere, you moron!

861
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,920
It's okay. I'm not
afraid of dying.

862
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,048
Well, you should be. It's really
boring where you're headed.

863
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:52,467
I hope so. I've had enough
excitement for one life.

864
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:54,427
Stop talking like that.

865
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:57,096
You've got more to do here.
You've got more people to annoy.

866
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:58,181
Pressure on the wound.

867
00:34:58,389 --> 00:34:59,599
I am!

868
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,768
Just come on, Frank,
stay with me, stay with me.

869
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:06,105
Oh, uh... at first...

870
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:09,734
I didn't understand why
God put you in my path.

871
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:12,445
But then it hit me.

872
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:15,698
Maybe... He put me in <i>yours.</i>

873
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,408
I... highly doubt it.

874
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:19,243
He gave up on me
a long time ago.

875
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:22,371
You're wrong, Lucifer.

876
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,874
Remember...

877
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,501
<i>your</i> Father...

878
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:29,045
has-has a plan.

879
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,630
My Father?

880
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,298
Yeah.

881
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,258
You know?

882
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,427
Frank?

883
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,597
Frank!

884
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,142
Frank.

885
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,401
Time to pull the legs

886
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,861
off The Spider.

887
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:56,989

888
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:58,741
Lucifer,
stop!

889
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,161
Why did you do this?

890
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,412
- I don't know, man.
- Why?!

891
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:04,622
He was bringing
too much heat!

892
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,624
Why?! Why...?!

893
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:10,628
Lucifer, stop. Father Frank

894
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:12,797
wouldn't want this.

895
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:17,802
Stop.

896
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,457
Connor gave us
everything.

897
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:49,792
The drug front.

898
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:51,794
How Doyle took on
"The Spider" name

899
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:53,796
and killed Arietta to
take over the business.

900
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:55,131
With Connor's
cooperation,

901
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:56,966
he won't do much juvie,
if any at all.

902
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:59,343
Maybe Father Frank
was right.

903
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,637
Maybe there's hope
for him yet.

904
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:05,683
You okay?

905
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:09,645
I'm fine.

906
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:11,397
Good night, Detective.

907
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:39,008
You...

908
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:42,053
you cruel,
manipulative bastard!

909
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:45,014
Was this all part of Your plan?

910
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:48,517
It's all just a game to You,
isn't it?

911
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:50,728
Eh?

912
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:53,731
Well, I know punishment,

913
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,108
and he did not deserve that.

914
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:59,862
He followed Your stupid rules

915
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:02,073
and it still wasn't good enough!

916
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,533
So what does it take
to please You?

917
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:06,035
Break Your rules and you fall!

918
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:08,246
Follow them and you still lose?!

919
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,581
Doesn't matter
whether you're a sinner!

920
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,292
Doesn't matter
whether you're a saint!

921
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:16,462
Nobody can win,
so what's the point?

922
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:19,215
What's the bloody point?

923
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,559
Dan, I know I wanted
to talk, but, um...

924
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:32,144
my mind, it's just...

925
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:33,271
Somewhere else?

926
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:35,773
Yeah.

927
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:37,817
Yeah, mine, too.

928
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:42,780
Can we do this another time?

929
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:44,782
Yeah.

930
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,659
No problem.

931
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:16,188
Hi.

932
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:23,696
Bit late for a new
case, isn't it?

933
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,157
I'm not here for a case.

934
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,326
I'm here for you.

935
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:29,618
Oh.

936
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:31,954
Really?

937
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:33,372
Yeah.

938
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,541
Thought you could use a friend.

939
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:47,511
Do you play?

940
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,846
Mm.

941
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:51,182
- No. No, I don't.
- Come on,

942
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,516
- you must know
something.
- No.

943
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:54,268
Uh...

944
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:57,146
All right, well...

945
00:39:57,355 --> 00:39:58,898
let me see.

946
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:02,026
- I had three years of lessons...
- Mm.

947
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:05,196
and this is all I remember.

948
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:10,701
Surely,
you must be joking.

949
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,708
All right.

950
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:42,358
Mm.

951
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:44,402
Ah...

952
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:46,862
Mmm.

953
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:52,076
Enjoying the life
I gave you?

954
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,246
Hey...

955
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,415
did food taste this good
before I died?

956
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,583
'Cause I don't remember it
being this friggin' delicious.

957
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:02,837
I don't care what
you're doing with your
new life, Malcolm...

958
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,089
except for what
I've asked of you.

959
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,091
What's taking so long?

960
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,093
What, what,
chill out, Amenadude.

961
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,137
Here, have some
waffles.

962
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,724
Do you want to go back?

963
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,269
Do you...
want...

964
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:19,562
to go back?

965
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,771
Because I can

966
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,981
make that happen.

967
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:23,607
Yeah.

968
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:25,776
You're remembering it now,
aren't you?

969
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,278
I bet

970
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:31,157
your 30 seconds in Hell
felt like 30 years.

971
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:32,950
Imagine
what eternity

972
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,827
- would feel like.
- I'm sorry.

973
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:37,288
Okay?

974
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,664
I'm sorry.

975
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:43,169
Look...

976
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:45,546
I got it.

977
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:47,798
An untraceable gun.

978
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:50,092
It won't come back to me.

979
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,850
I'm ready now.

980
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,478
So...

981
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:02,563
tell me...

982
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,191
who do you want me to kill?

983
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:08,194
His name...

984
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:12,072
...is Lucifer Morningstar.
