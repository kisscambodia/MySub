<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:05,048
Make yourself
a drink, Detective.

3
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:06,091
No more drinks.

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,634
No more blurred lines.

5
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:08,927
No more trying to sleep with me.

6
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:11,429
And you... are naked.

7
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:13,306
This is beyond
inappropriate.

8
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:14,849
What do you think
I'm insecure about?

9
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:16,935
That you are changing.

10
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,521
But that you don't know what's
causing the change. Or who.

11
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:22,107
Something has fundamentally
changed in Lucifer.

12
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:24,442
We can get him back
to where he belongs

13
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:26,820
if you could just provide me
with a weak spot.

14
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,571
Are you sleeping
with this idiot?

15
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,323
She hasn't had the pleasure,
unfortunately, no.

16
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:32,200
- Hey, Dan, I...
- Really, Chloe?

17
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,326
I'm disappointed in you.

18
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:34,661
How could you possibly help me?

19
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,246
I have the ability

20
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:37,998
to draw out people's
forbidden desires.

21
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,624
And desire is, like,
your superpower.

22
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,625
It's more like a gift
from God, really.

23
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:42,252
What are you?

24
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,503
I've been trying to tell you.
I'm the Devil.

25
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:45,505
Just shoot me,
Detective, please.

26
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:47,882
Because maybe you'll
finally realize...

27
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,801
Son of a bitch,
that really hurts.

28
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,220
<i>She shot me, and I bled.</i>

29
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,514
- That's not possible.
- Well, don't think about it
too much; it's exciting.

30
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:55,849
The fun's just begun.

32
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:38,683
I very much approve of Benny's
avant-garde approach

33
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:40,351
to clothing.

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,021
The models don't appear
to be wearing any.

35
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,023
The Benny Choi brand
isn't about clothes.

36
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,566
It's the shoes.

37
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:49,694
These guys kill for
limited-edition kicks.

38
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:51,404

39
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,908
Oh, even the Mistress
of Excess is impressed.

40
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,701
Go, Benny.

41
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,744
Oh, hello.

42
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:00,997
Mmm, dangerous.

43
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:03,583
Lucifer likes.

44
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,085
You were shot
and you bled.

45
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:07,420
No sharp objects
until we find out why.

46
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:09,089
Oh, quite the opposite.

47
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:11,800
The danger of getting hurt's
positively thrilling.

48
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:16,262
Fun with mortality.

49
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,972
Bring it.

50
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,599
Excuse me.

51
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:23,228
Since when does the Devil
care about mortality?

52
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:24,562
Great show, Benny.

53
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,442
Ladies and gentlemen,
Benny Choi!

54
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:39,119
Now, come on, gorgeous, you tell
me your most dangerous desire.

55
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,122
Cheeseburger.

56
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,790
Cheeseburger? Really?

57
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,631
Benny, get down!

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,007
What was that?

59
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:00,723
It's a bit early for last call.

60
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,433
Never mind.

61
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:05,145
You need to leave.

62
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:06,146
Now.

63
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,147
What's the rush?

64
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:08,356
It's just getting exciting.

65
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:09,732
Humans are playing
with their guns,

66
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,484
and now they're
running for cover.

67
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:12,861
No reason to find out
if your bones will break too.

68
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,737
Well, what about
my broken... heart?

69
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:15,864
Move!

70
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,410
Get down! Get down!

71
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:31,212
Move, move!
Y'all got to move!

72
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,422
Come on! Let's go!

73
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,510
People really do kill
for Benny's shoes.

74
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,845
We need to get
out of here now.

75
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:39,846
Why?

76
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,347
I just found
my danger.

77
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,523
She snuck out of the house.

78
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,526
I thought
she was asleep.

79
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:57,030
Mrs. Cortez, I'll find who
caused your daughter's death.

80
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,740
I promise you.

81
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,411
You okay?

82
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,163
Her only child
was trampled to death,

83
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:06,706
after some thug fired
into a crowd.

84
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:07,874
I've been better.

85
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,002
Gang Unit's
piggybacking Homicide

86
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,004
till we can figure out
who wanted Benny Choi dead.

87
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:14,672
Is he talking?

88
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:16,549
Clammed up as soon as
we got to the crime scene.

89
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:17,759
Okay.

90
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,970
It could get bloody.

91
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,722
You should probably stay as
safe as possible on this one.

92
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,475
Oh, yeah? Stick to
the nice girly murders?

93
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,477
It just seems that every
time I turn around,

94
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,688
you're in another shootout with
your buddy Lucifer by your side.

95
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:32,815
Not an issue.

96
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,984
He was just, I don't know,

97
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,070
uh, some mystery
that I wanted solved.

98
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,113
I could think of a few
other choice names.

99
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,115
Yeah, how about
complete wack job?

100
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,034
Don't worry, Lucifer Morningstar
is completely out of my life.

101
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,702
Right.

102
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,455
Get this one tighter.

103
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:48,456
Tighter?

104
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:49,457
Yeah.

105
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,042
Really, Officer?

106
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,504
And he's sitting on my desk.

107
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,256
Get out of that one.

108
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,715
Please tell me
I'm hallucinating.

109
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,218
Well, I am dreamy,
but try to contain yourself.

110
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,386
What are you doing here?

111
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:02,804
I'm not actually
here to see you.

112
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,597
I've come to talk
to your boss.

113
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,057
About a shooting.

114
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,767
Okay, I thought you
had my back on this.

115
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:09,102
If the department finds
out what really happened,

116
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,687
I could lose my badge.

117
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,272
What, you mean the fact
that you shot me on purpose?

118
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,944
I told you I was
sorry about that.

119
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,612
And I feel badly, I do.

120
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:20,613
But it was a graze.

121
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:21,906
I doubt it even left a scar.

122
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:23,950
Didn't it?

123
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,494
Mr. Morningstar?

124
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:28,413
- I can see you now.
- Splendid!

125
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,707
Splendid.
We've so much to discuss.

126
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,333
Ooh.

127
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,967
So what can I do for you?

128
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,052
Well, Lieutenant,

129
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:46,014
as you know, I was witness to
that grizzly death at Benny's.

130
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:47,598
I mean, only a matter of time

131
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,434
before those gentlemen
start pointing fingers

132
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:52,103
and the whole...
the whole thing explodes.

133
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,646
- And?
- I want in.

134
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:54,981
- In?
- On the action.

135
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,108
I got a taste of danger,
and I want more.

136
00:05:57,317 --> 00:06:00,445
This case is the perfect method
for me to explore my mortality

137
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,488
in an exciting
and dangerous way.

138
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:05,992
And... help find out
who's responsible

139
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,036
for that poor girl's death,
of course.

140
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,997
I realize you've been very
helpful to Detective Decker

141
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,832
on her last couple
of cases, but...

142
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,169
exploring mortality
is not really what I do here.

143
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,338
- No?
- Uh-uh.

144
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:19,339
It's funny, 'cause you're
an ambitious one, aren't you?

145
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,381
I can tell.

146
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,177
Brimming with desire.

147
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,017
If I'm gonna be the first
female chief of police,

148
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,019
I need a big close.

149
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,521
Of course you do.
Of course you do.

150
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,565
And how do you plan on
achieving this grand goal?

151
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:39,275
I will never be appointed

152
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:41,319
without the support
of the minority communities.

153
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:42,528
Right, yes.

154
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:43,780
Well, I tell you what.

155
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,783
If you allow me
to assist on this case,

156
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,785
and... possibly others,

157
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:52,789
I'll deliver you
all the support you need, eh?

158
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,709
Just consider it a favor.

159
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,878
From a friend.

160
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:00,213
After you.

161
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,340
Thank you so much.

162
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,342
Olivia, I can explain.

163
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,803
Oh, you better explain
why you have been keeping

164
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:10,056
such a valuable resource
all to yourself.

165
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,599
Excuse me?

166
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:13,393
We have someone who can
make Benny Choi talk.

167
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,019
Someone with charm,

168
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:16,979
- likability...
- And has real ties
to the community.

169
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,648
Here it comes.

170
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,566
Lucifer Morningstar
has volunteered

171
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,611
to act as liaison
in the Paola Cortez case.

172
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:26,781
You're welcome, Decker.

173
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,285
Steady on.

174
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:38,126
That wack job's gonna
totally get me killed.

175
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,183
<i>What could you
have possibly said</i>

176
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:55,685
to con your way
onto another case?

177
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,520
Well, I simply offered
the lieutenant a favor.

178
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,522
She gets what she wants,
and I get what I want--

179
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,399
a nice juicy gang war.

180
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,526
You mean you offered to help
<i>prevent</i> a gang war, right?

181
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,403
Tomato, tom-ah-to.

182
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:06,654
But, see, that's why we
make such great partners.

183
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:07,780
The "he said, she said"
of it all.

184
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:09,782
The yin-yang, the fireworks.

185
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:10,783
Partners?

186
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,535
More like glorified ride-along.

187
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,704
Just think, you and me,
close proximity at all times.

188
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,205
Yeah, in L.A.,
we call that "stalking."

189
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:17,457
It's wonderful, isn't it?

190
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,333
Uh, when do I get my own gun?

191
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,960
I wouldn't trust you
with my kid's lightsaber.

192
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,753
- And when do I get...
- I'll never let you drive.

193
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:23,754
If I'm gonna be forced
to work with you again,

194
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:24,755
I call the shots.

195
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,048
You most certainly do.

196
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:27,550
Right in the leg.

197
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,051
I only shot you
because you told me to.

198
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,386
In a moment of weakness,

199
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,388
I somehow fell for
your hocus-pocus

200
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:35,391
and believed that you
actually might be the Devil.

201
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,059
I <i>am</i> the Devil.

202
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:39,061
Historically invincible,
until now,

203
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,730
and that's what makes
this case so exciting--

204
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,064
real danger.

205
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,733
It's the perfect
opportunity to see

206
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,735
what other mortal
qualities I have.

207
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,780
Okay, I get it-- you want
to feel new things.

208
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:50,823
Exactly.

209
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,493
- How's that?
- Bloody hell!

210
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,410
That hurt!

211
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,078
Do it again.

212
00:08:58,206 --> 00:08:59,373
So where to, eh?

213
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,042
Stakeout, ambush?

214
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,418
You know, I'm quite
skilled at restraints.

215
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:03,586
No, I'm taking you home.

216
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,213
Ooh, how did you know?

217
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:06,839
That I'd last about
ten minutes with you?

218
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,132
I don't know,
call it a gut feeling.

219
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,258
Well, it's a
successful one.

220
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:10,259
We'll be right on time.

221
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:11,469
Time? For what?

222
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,096
Lucifer, my man!

223
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:15,223
Benny!

224
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:16,766
Nice to see you.

225
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,392
So you're friends
with Benny Choi

226
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,269
and his blinged-out
pet pig.

227
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,479
- Of course you are.
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:22,647
His name is
Pig Diddy.

229
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,774
This is my
assistant Hector.

230
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:25,775
Ooh.

231
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,151
Someone love his mommy?

232
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,612
Ex-Marine, bitch.

233
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,613
Right.

234
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:31,906
Yes, Benny and I go back

235
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,574
to the start of his very
impressive career.

236
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:35,660
Huh, let me guess,
you did him a favor.

237
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,286
Lucifer helped me
get my first show.

238
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,955
He was a real
inspiration.

239
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:40,957
I try to reflect that in my art.

240
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,625
Any idea who took
a shot at you?

241
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,418
Nope.

242
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:45,962
No recent
threats, nothing?

243
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,881
Look, I'm no snitch.

244
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,550
Even if I did know,
I can't talk.

245
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:51,884
I'm an artist.

246
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,970
I process tragedy
through my work.

247
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,430
Would you prefer to process
tragedy back at the precinct?

248
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,015
'Cause I have a holding cell

249
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,350
that could really use
an artist's touch.

250
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,768
Yes, Benny,
that favor you owe me,

251
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:03,104
I'm calling in my IOU.

252
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,856
Answer the detective's
questions.

253
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:09,485
Hector clashed with some punks

254
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:11,153
in Latin Kings colors
that night.

255
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,155
We were at capacity,
they wanted in.

256
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,241
They were making threats,
they were upset.

257
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,663
And you didn't mention this
at the crime scene because...?

258
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,081
My fans aren't
just buying shoes.

259
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,083
They're buying Benny Choi.

260
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,752
Artist, activist,
man of the people.

261
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,296
You know, I wore colors
back in the day.

262
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,755
Asian Boyz.
I was low level.

263
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,257
You know, a punk.

264
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,467
Got out before the cops
even knew my name.

265
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:34,468
Ah, protecting your rep.

266
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:35,928
Wouldn't want to risk

267
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,638
that seven-figure
endorsement deal, would we?

268
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,390
I didn't talk because
if a Latin King hears

269
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,350
an ex-Asian Boy done
dry-snitched him to the cops?

270
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,687
Those thugs will
retaliate on principal.

271
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,647
I was trying
to prevent more death.

272
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,190
Well, aren't we
the little saint?

273
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,859
Latin Kings
versus Asian Boyz.

274
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,027
That really
narrows it down.

275
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,236
Did you get names?

276
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:57,783
Diego, Dani, I don't know.

277
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:58,826
A couple, I think.

278
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:00,202
Joined at the hip.

279
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,495
Mm-hmm.

280
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,539
Diego and Dani. Right.

281
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:06,250
You need to call me if you
remember anything else.

282
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,213
Uh, yeah, I'll call.

283
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:12,506
But be careful.

284
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:14,425
Them Latin Kings
about to raise hell.

285
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:15,968
My "speciality."

286
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,222
Did it ever occur to you

287
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,891
to tell me that
you're tight with Benny?

288
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,893
That you gave one of your
favors to a former gang felon?

289
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,978
Well, I've been giving
favors for thousands of years.

290
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,480
Would you like
a peek at my ledger?

291
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,190
No, I'd like you to
follow basic protocol.

292
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,566
And I'd love
to continue the debate

293
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:31,817
on our opposing views
of police work,

294
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,444
so how about we hit
the cop bar,

295
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:35,279
and get dangerous with
some bottom shelf, huh?

296
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:36,906
A girl's dead and you want
to go on a pub crawl.

297
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:37,907
Oh, liquid courage.

298
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,367
I hear the Paddock Lounge

299
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:40,743
is every new detective's
rite of passage.

300
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,286
Forget it.

301
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:43,663
We need to wait for
an I.D. on those kids.

302
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,248
150,000 active gang
members in L.A.,

303
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:47,917
it could take awhile.

304
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,335
Oh, you're right.
No time for a quick drink, then.

305
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,379
We're on duty.

306
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,589
You are the oldest young
person I've ever met!

307
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:56,467
And coming from an immortal,
that's saying something.

308
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,971
Look, I'm not gonna drink at
a bar where everyone hates me.

309
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,933
Did you ever consider they
hate you for that very reason?

310
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,394
Yeah, they hate me for
several reasons.

311
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,938
Well, don't let those
Philistines inhibit your right

312
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,232
to toast our first break
in the case-- come on!

313
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,608
It's the least you could do.

314
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,318
Besides, you know, I...

315
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:15,611
need something
to dull the pain.

316
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:17,780
Ugh! If I say yes,

317
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,115
will you shut up
about the leg?

318
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:20,658
No promises.

319
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:24,203
Ooh! Aah!

320
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,791
♪ Me and my big friends ♪

321
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,584
♪ We been travelin'
far from... ♪

322
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,504
Here comes
that bitch Decker.

323
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:34,588
Who's the
hell's that guy?

324
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,090
Want me to lose this guy?

325
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,096
It's Italian wool.

326
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,472
Touch it.
I know you want to.

327
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,016
Go on.

328
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:49,770
Yeah. That'll do.

329
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:52,606
Well, somebody's not

330
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,316
being crowned homecoming
queen, are they?

331
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,152
Yeah. Order. Please.

332
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,695
Right.

333
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,655
Uh, two shots of your
finest swill, please, love.

334
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:01,490
You got it.
I'll have a water.

335
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:05,119
So, about this whole
favor thing.

336
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,246
What... what is it?

337
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,206
What are you, some kind
of loan shark?

338
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,083
Con man? Godfather
with a twist?

339
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:14,003
But surely you've
heard the expression...

340
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,671
"Deal with the Devil"?

341
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,465
Mm!
Come on, give me a break.

342
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,049
No, people come to me
to ask for favors,

343
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,968
and more often than not,
I'm happy to oblige.

344
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:22,344
What do <i>you</i> get?

345
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,180
Well, sometimes,
I have something in mind,

346
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,639
but, usually,
like with Benny,

347
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,017
it's simply to be
repaid at a later date.

348
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,186
A devilish IOU,
if you will.

349
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,896
Who would take
a deal like that?

350
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:34,523
They <i>all</i> do.

351
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,526
Palmetto Bitch.

352
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,742
Ooh! Juicy! Do tell.

353
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:49,205
That's Anthony Paolucci.

354
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:50,831
He's partners with the guy

355
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,249
who took a bullet
in the Palmetto case--

356
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,501
Malcolm Graham.

357
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,503
Ah, yes, the infamous Palmetto.

358
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,214
Malcolm got shot
meeting with some gangsters,

359
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,050
and... Paolucci thinks
he took the bullet

360
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,093
like a hero;
I think he was on the take.

361
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,347
Aha! So you're a snitch.

362
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,974
A narc. No wonder
nobody likes you.

363
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,935
Yeah, you'd think I was
guilty of a crime.

364
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,603
Yeah, you know what they say:
"Snitches end up in ditches."

365
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:14,230
Oh, thanks, man.

366
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,856
I feel so much better.

367
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:17,024
Hm!

368
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,400
No, I don't know, I just...

369
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,236
was following
my gut, I guess.

370
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,404
Caught in the crosshairs
of another man's crime.

371
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,073
I don't need your sympathy,
but thank you.

372
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,533
Fair enough.

373
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,409
Still, no excuse
for that man's rudeness.

374
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:28,953
No, no, no, no--
I can handle Paolucci.

375
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,371
I don't need you
to stand up for me.

376
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,789
Understood.

377
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,417
Excuse me.

378
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,086
Hello.

379
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,587
- What do you want?
- Well, firstly,

380
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:40,297
let me state that I'm in no way

381
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,091
standing up for my associate,
Detective Decker.

382
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,760
But on behalf of myself,
and only myself,

383
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:46,929
I think you're
a complete sack of ass.

384
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,059
Are you crazy?
Let's get out of here.

385
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:00,776
And your name?

386
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:02,444
Mazikeen.

387
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,780
How do you spell that?

388
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,824
Surprise me.

389
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,620
Interesting choice
of venue.

390
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:14,290
What, are you trying to
throw me off-balance?

391
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,624
Because I'm much more
comfortable among humans

392
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,959
than you might think.

393
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,336
So I see.

394
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,510
This is my favorite
place in the city.

395
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,678
Really?

396
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:29,471
Look at them on their laptops,

397
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,473
writing the next great
screenplay,

398
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,976
torturing themselves
with dreams they know,

399
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,313
deep down,
they will never achieve.

400
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,274
Reminds me of home.

401
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,317
Get to the point.

402
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:44,862
I want to go back.

403
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,449
Then give me something, Maze.

404
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,451
Give me something that I
can use against Lucifer,

405
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,328
and I'll make sure you're
both back where you belong.

406
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,871
That's the problem.

407
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:54,914
He doesn't confide
in me anymore.

408
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:57,917
But...

409
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,794
there is someone
he does talk to-- a doctor.

410
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,632
And I bet she would love
that ridiculous suit.

411
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:09,053
And here I thought you were
the loyal soldier.

412
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,888
I want what's best for Lucifer.

413
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,390
Same thing you want.

414
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,477
Then tell me about
this doctor...

415
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,356
..."Mike."

416
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,082
Hello?

417
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,626
Is anybody there?

418
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,801
I know Krav Maga!

419
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:09,863
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

420
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,323
How did you get in here?

421
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:12,908
I have a key.

422
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,079
Yeah, let me start over.

423
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,456
Uh, I actually just moved
into the office next-door.

424
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:21,959
I'm Dr. Canaan.

425
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:22,960
Oh, okay.

426
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,212
Hi. Uh, I'm Linda.

427
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,630
Uh, Dr. Martin.

428
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,807
It's fantastic, actually.

429
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:38,684
The thrill of fighting humans

430
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,644
has taken on a whole new spin,
now that I might get hurt.

431
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,146
Although, sadly,
the only thing broken

432
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,023
was that incontinent
troll's nose.

433
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,275
Your behavior is foolish.

434
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,651
Oh, come on!

435
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,570
You used to love danger.

436
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,531
Since when did Hell's favorite
torturer become my mother?

437
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,366
You're changing.

438
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,659
Becoming vulnerable.

439
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,287
- Maybe even...
- mortal.

440
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,621
Mm!

441
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,710
If I'm not going to look out
for you, who will? Hmm?

442
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:05,961
Your pet cop?

443
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,087
That's what partners are for.

444
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,630
She is not your partner.

445
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,966
Have you two been talking?

446
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,848
You know, I actually don't
think it's my mortality

447
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:18,849
that you're worried about.

448
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:20,684
You're just jealous

449
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,145
that I'm exploring it
with Detective Decker.

450
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,025
Jealous of a mortal woman?

451
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,526
Mm-hmm.

452
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,237
I don't think so.

453
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,531
But if you insist on
continuing this exploration,

454
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,825
maybe next time, I won't be
around to save your ass.

455
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,827
Mm! Well, that <i>is</i> a shame.

456
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,370
'Cause you and my backside
used to get on very well.

457
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,206
My front side,
as well, actually.

458
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:43,916
Things change, Lucifer.

459
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,834
Yes, but you don't, Maze.

460
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,213
You exist to protect me.

461
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,674
To know where I am
and who I'm with at all times,

462
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,051
whether you
want to, or not.

463
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,397
Pretty sure your name's
not on the list.

464
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,691
It should be.

465
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,568
Considering I've just spent
the last couple of hours

466
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,363
convincing Anthony Paolucci
not to press charges.

467
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,074
Well, what if I want
to press charges?

468
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,784
- For what?
- Stupidity.

469
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,662
A drunk, on-duty cop--
surely that's a no-no.

470
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,330
But don't worry,
I'm feeling charitable.

471
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:24,748
I'll let it slide this time.

472
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,253
Is it my thanks
you want, or a kiss?

473
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,171
I don't want your thanks.

474
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,423
Because I don't do favors
for guys like you.

475
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,092
I did this for Chloe.

476
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,428
Oh, stop raining on the
poor woman's parade.

477
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,223
It's about time she got
some spark in her life.

478
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,559
Spark?

479
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:46,228
How about real danger?

480
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,938
Do you have any idea how easy

481
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:49,606
a gang vendetta can spiral
out of control?

482
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,275
Well, I'm trying
my best to find out.

483
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,568
Yeah.

484
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,111
That's exactly
why I'm here.

485
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,906
Chloe is the mother
of my child, you imbecile.

486
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,325
You want to work this case?

487
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,661
Take care of her.

488
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,664
Sir, yes, sir.

489
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,761
<i>Okay, Latin Kings turf.</i>

490
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,096
<i>You need to have
my back on this.</i>

491
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,682
<i>You can count on me, Detective.</i>

492
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,642
All right,
Dani and Diego Ramirez.

493
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,187
Married straight out of juvie;
real hotheads.

494
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,396
Ooh! Do we get
to kick in the door?

495
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:30,939
As your
self-sacrificing partner,

496
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,482
I volunteer to go first.

497
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:33,942
No, there'll be
no kicking in of anything,

498
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,152
unless we have a warrant,

499
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,695
or people are in
immediate danger.

500
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,489
You better start taking
this case seriously.

501
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,074
If this escalates
to a gang war...

502
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,285
Yes, yes, it could spiral
out of control--

503
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,162
blood could run in the streets,
fire could rain down.

504
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,538
You sound just like your ex.

505
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,374
What do you mean--
you spoke to Dan?

506
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,584
Mm!

507
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:51,835
He dropped by Lux.

508
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,129
Kept rambling on
about keeping you safe.

509
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,547
Quite condescending,
if you ask me.

510
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,342
What is it with
the men in my life?

511
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,885
I'm a man in your life?

512
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,853
Uh, Detective, you seem to have
left on the central locking!

513
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:11,855
Act like a child,
get treated like a child.

514
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,232
Wha...? Isn't it illegal

515
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,359
to leave your child
locked in a car?

516
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,623
Diego and Dani Ramirez, LAPD.

517
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,583
Need to ask you
a few questions.

518
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,756
LAPD! Open up!

519
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,466
Come on, baby.

520
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,468
Let me make you
feel better.

521
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,648
Who the hell are you?!

522
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,024
What are you doing here?!

523
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,735
What are you doing
in my house, man?!

524
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,781
How the hell did you
get out of the car?

525
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,741
Child's play,
and good thing I did.

526
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,326
There was immediate danger.

527
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,870
He was about to leave this woman
completely unsatisfied.

528
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,414
- What the--?!
- Hey! Hey!

529
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,082
- Down.
- He's your partner?

530
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,583
Yeah, don't get me started.

531
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,919
Cops harass us
no matter what we do!

532
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:17,587
And now they're breaking
into our house?!

533
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,047
I should sue that pervert!

534
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:20,424
You have my blessing.

535
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:21,758
But first,
let's talk Benny Choi.

536
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,010
Yes, did you
attempt to use him

537
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,886
as target practice
the other night?

538
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,596
- That wasn't us!
- No.

539
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:27,973
Okay, well, witnesses said

540
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,224
they heard you
making threats at the door.

541
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,642
No, we-we
just wanted in.

542
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,394
We wanted a pair
of Benny's sweet kicks.

543
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,021
Enough to pay for them
with Paola Cortez's blood?

544
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,064
Paola was Diego's
cousin, okay?

545
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,357
It's wack what happened to her.

546
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,401
Why do you think he's so upset?

547
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,655
I promised I'd
get her in the show.

548
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,574
There wasn't
enough room for three,

549
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,160
so... we gave her our spot.

550
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,455
She wanted to be a designer.

551
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,665
Sorry, is that,
is that flop sweat

552
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:54,958
or is that a tear?

553
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,918
That's... Oh...

554
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,378
Oh, bloody hell.

555
00:22:58,587 --> 00:22:59,755
This is our bad guy?

556
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,298
No wonder he can't get it up.

557
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,885
Look, uh...

558
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:06,511
if you didn't
take a shot at Benny,

559
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,847
then help us get
justice for Paola.

560
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,017
Tell us what you know,
all right?

561
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:17,981
If anyone had beef
with Benny Choi,

562
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,982
it's Yellow Viper.

563
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,817
"Yellow Viper"?

564
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,778
Sounds like a venereal disease.

565
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,072
He got out of jail a few
nights before Benny's show.

566
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,490
He was a big-deal
graffiti artist,

567
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:27,824
ran with Benny
back in the day,

568
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,117
then took the fall
on some B&E.

569
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,119
He got five and change,

570
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,038
while Benny got
rich and famous.

571
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,581
Well, it does sound like
this Viper fellow

572
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,124
has every reason
to punish Benny.

573
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,085
We need to present
a unified front.

574
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,669
Speculate later,
not in front of them.

575
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,254
Got it.

576
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,131
So, Viper's beef
killed your cousin then, eh?

577
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,009
What?
That wasn't speculation.

578
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,636
That was a statement
of potential fact.

579
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,179
And if we ever run into him,

580
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:51,098
he won't have to worry
about no cops.

581
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,349
So you're just gonna
sit around and wait for revenge?

582
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:53,725
That's rather lazy.

583
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,018
Okay, this is
the opposite of helping.

584
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,770
What?
I was promised a gang war.

585
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,688
Instead I get a cry baby.
This is boring.

586
00:23:58,897 --> 00:23:59,856
All right, tough.

587
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:01,191
Right now,
we need to warn Benny

588
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,651
that his buddy Viper's
back in town.

589
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,653
My apologies for him.

590
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,908
Thanks ever so.

591
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:12,119
Ooh, let me guess.

592
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,704
Anemic sext from Sir Douche?

593
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,706
No, from Benny.

594
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,042
Someone else is dead.

595
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:21,086
Ooh, less boring!

596
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:29,719
Benny?

597
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:31,721
Some street artist.

598
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,056
Oh, dear.

599
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,269
Crazy guess:
That's not paint.

600
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,020
Mm.

601
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,730
Definitely blood, though.

602
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:43,567
But curiously,
not human.

603
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,779
Benny?

604
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:51,283
Poor Diddy.

605
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,536
This is the murder?

606
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,080
I'm sorry.
I didn't know who else to call.

607
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:58,915
Ain't no 911 for pets.

608
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,584
Bacon for dinner, I guess.

609
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,629
And my deepest condolences,
Benny.

610
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,882
What happened?

611
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,217
Hector and I went to an opening.

612
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:11,636
Came back to find...

613
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,430
it's Pig Diddy.

614
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:14,973
Were you aware that
your old friend Yellow Viper

615
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,434
was released
from prison last week?

616
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:19,102
No, I had no idea he was out.

617
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,563
No phone calls?
No contact?

618
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,773
I sent him letters
when he was inside San Quentin.

619
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,609
Money for lawyers, too.

620
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,068
But he sent the letters
back all torn up.

621
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:28,528
Didn't take a dime.

622
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,156
I always felt bad
for how things turned out.

623
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,532
How I got lucky.

624
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,242
Viper went down.

625
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:36,036
He was my best friend--

626
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,787
Well, with friends like that,
I'd hide the knives.

627
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,581
Yeah, Viper must've
snuck into my show.

628
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,124
He fired those shots.

629
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,293
Killing Pig Diddy was a message.

630
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:46,505
All right, we'll get a squad car
to watch your house tonight.

631
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,298
Viper comes by,
you'll be safe.

632
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:49,966
Aw, y'all don't know him
like I do.

633
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:51,718
He's fierce.

634
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,470
He won't stop till it's
my blood on the floor.

635
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:57,098
Thanks, Benny.

636
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,561
You know, they really don't
make bad guys like they used to.

637
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,563
We need to get word
to Viper's parole officer.

638
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,565
Track him down
before he can get to Benny.

639
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,108
Finally, some real action.

640
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:08,360
I'm more than ready
to face the danger

641
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,695
of the notorious Yellow Viper.

642
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,659
♪ Yeah. ♪

643
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,702
Oh!

644
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,206
Hello there, neighbor.

645
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:23,667
Is everything okay?

646
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,960
I was just wondering

647
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,086
if you would care
to grab a drink?

648
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:28,213
- Oh?
- Yes.

649
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,674
I actually need someone
to confide in.

650
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:32,551
"Confide in"?

651
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,470
About a patient;
a troubling one.

652
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,846
Oh, oh.

653
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,473
So, a-a doctor,

654
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:39,849
a doctor-to-doctor thing.

655
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,309
Exactly.

656
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:42,686
And, hey, listen,
if you have any patients

657
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:43,979
you need to talk about...

658
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:46,898
You have no idea.

659
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,942
Good, so it's settled then.

660
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,194
You share with me,
I share with you.

661
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:52,404
A fluid exchange.

662
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,702
Maybe one drink.

663
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,706
<i>I mean, seriously,</i>

664
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,332
a community center?

665
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,293
This is where we'll find
the deadly Yellow Viper?

666
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:07,711
According to his
parole officer.

667
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,212
Oh, after five years
behind bars,

668
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,298
a brothel would be my go-to.

669
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:13,675
You know,
I've been thinking

670
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:16,094
about that favor
that you gave Benny.

671
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,346
Did it also involve getting him
off on the felony B&E charge

672
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,056
that put Viper
in prison instead?

673
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,892
Well, I may have pulled
a few strings-- why?

674
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,811
Well, if Viper hadn't
have gone to prison,

675
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,479
he wouldn't have targeted
Benny and shot up his show,

676
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,231
which means Paola Cortez
would still be alive.

677
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,482
Wait, you're not
seriously blaming me

678
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:30,567
for that girl's death?

679
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,027
Just stating fact.

680
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:33,570
Cause and effect;
intended or not.

681
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,196
No, no.
I-I can't be held responsible

682
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:36,865
for what happens
after I give someone a favor.

683
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,242
I mean, if there's
one thing the Devil knows,

684
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,744
it's that people
need to take responsibility

685
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:42,245
for their own bad behavior.

686
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,039
Yes, people do need
to take responsibility

687
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:45,957
for their own bad behavior.

688
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,127
I just said that.

689
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:51,171
Are you hearing impaired?

690
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,057
Remember...

691
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,725
tagging means nothing

692
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,310
if it doesn't
come from right here.

693
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,270
Hmm.

694
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,356
Yellow Viper,
I presume.

695
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:12,233
He's teaching art
to youngsters.

696
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,361
I mean, this bad guy thing's
gonna be all the joke now.

697
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:15,779
What next--
cuddles and ice cream?

698
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,083
Private class.

699
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,085
I'm Detective Decker.

700
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:31,419
This is... Never mind.

701
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,171
I need to ask you
a few questions

702
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,631
about the shooting
at Benny's fashion show.

703
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,091
You got a warrant?

704
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,842
If not...

705
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,344
beat it.

706
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,012
I'm not talking to cops.

707
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,931
Ooh, do you have something
to hide, Mr. Viper?

708
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,599
Or do you go by Yellow?

709
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,476
Oh, you think I'm gonna
let you bust my balls

710
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:47,811
in front of these kids?

711
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:49,813
Arrest me

712
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:51,981
or step off.

713
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:56,903
Ooh, charming.

714
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:58,530
- Is everything okay?
- Well, he's right.

715
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,156
He doesn't have
to talk to us.

716
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,450
He really seems to care
about those kids.

717
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:03,827
It's odd for a criminal.

718
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,286
Or anyone, really.

719
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:06,955
You know,
if you spent as much time

720
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,832
appealing to suspects
as you do annoying me,

721
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,959
things might go...

722
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,669
go a lot faster.

723
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,562
Our lucky day.

724
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,522
Viper and the perv.

725
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,023
Bravo, crybaby.

726
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:35,525
This is a bold move, isn't it?

727
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,318
Come on, turn around.

728
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,320
If you walk away now,
no one has to get arrested.

729
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:40,780
No one has to get hurt--

730
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,407
Yeah, they do.
Viper killed my cousin.

731
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,658
I'm here to get justice!

732
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:44,701
As you should.

733
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,161
Are you insane?
Shut up.

734
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,829
What?

735
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,165
Please, I promise
we're dealing with this.

736
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:51,875
You and your perv partner
want to get caught

737
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,002
in the crossfire, cop,
be my guest.

738
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,379
Smoke this piece!

739
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,553
Enough danger for you yet?

740
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:04,679
Just stay there.
Stay there.

741
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:05,722
I'm curious.

742
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,268
Right.

743
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:18,151
This ain't about you,
it's about Viper!

744
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,279
Hey, now if you'd just give
me that gun I'd asked for--

745
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:22,405
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

746
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,491
Diego?

747
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,202
Diego, put down your weapon.

748
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,995
Don't listen to her.

749
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:30,622
This isn't
what you want.

750
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,458
Taking down Viper
is exactly what he wants.

751
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,460
We're doing it for Paola!
Step off!

752
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:38,296
I said step off!

753
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,006
You know,
as the Master of Punishment,

754
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,883
I completely understand
your desire to make Viper pay

755
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,510
for the tragic death
of your cousin...

756
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:45,094
Lucifer, you do remember
that bullets hurt, right?

757
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:47,639
And furthermore,
you do seem to have

758
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,098
this danger thing down pat,

759
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:50,517
don't you?

760
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:51,726
I mean the Devil
could learn a thing or two.

761
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:52,769
The Devil?

762
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:53,978
The hell you
talking about?

763
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:55,980
So, answer me this:

764
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:57,357
So, you engage in turf wars,

765
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:58,358
yet nobody actually
owns any turf?

766
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,609
Get back, freak!

767
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:00,610
All right, let's finish this.

768
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:02,028
And-and those trousers.

769
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:03,530
I mean, you wear them
so low that,

770
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,824
well, your ass is exposed
to other naughty men,

771
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,534
and we all know what kind
of danger that can bring,

772
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:08,993
don't we? I mean, you can
park your bike in there.

773
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,162
You making fun of his pants, yo?

774
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,580
Well, are we talking
pants or trousers?

775
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:13,790
Because it's very confusing.

776
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,459
Where'd he go?

777
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,671
- Oh, dear.
- Don't matter.

778
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,673
I'll kill you first.

779
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,344
Hey, what's happening?

780
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:28,513
Where's Viper?

781
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,181
You had your hero moment--
stay down,

782
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,349
or you're gonna get shot!

783
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:32,976
Indeed!

784
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:37,897
- What's that?
- What happened?

785
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,861
What the hell
is happening?

786
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:48,700
Maze is happening.

787
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:49,784
Your bartender's a ninja?

788
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,536
- Of course she is.
- Yeah.

789
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,162
What's that?

790
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,249
Shattered tibia.

791
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,003
Ooh, ouch-- orbital fracture.

792
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,090
It was first perfected
in the hellfires of Tyre.

793
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,846
Oh, the humerus crush!

794
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:11,931
Love that Maze!

795
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,621
Oh, bravo, Detective.

796
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,084
Ass saved.

797
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:41,085
You're welcome.

798
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:43,296
His ass, not yours.

799
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,147
Let's go.

800
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,280
Care to tell me
what happened?

801
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,158
You wouldn't believe me
if I did.

802
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:16,913
They found a gun
in Viper's bag.

803
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:18,289
It's a.38.

804
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,457
Same caliber fired
at Benny's show.

805
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:22,460
Um...

806
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:23,670
What?

807
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:24,796
You should
know something.

808
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,297
Okay.

809
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:27,966
I talked to Lucifer
about you the other day.

810
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,300
Yeah, I heard.

811
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,427
I mean, not that
it got me anywhere.

812
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:33,680
If anyone can handle themselves
around that wack job, it's you.

813
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,433
And, hey, it looks like, uh...

814
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:38,685
you got the bad guy.

815
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:42,605
Yeah.

816
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:43,856
Looks like.

817
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,332
What, no "thank you"?

818
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,584
I don't know why you're upset.

819
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:05,169
I helped save kids.

820
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:06,379
And we arrested our shooter.

821
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,505
One might say I did you a favor.

822
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,340
Hmm.

823
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:10,717
Yeah, I think
I just figured it out,

824
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:11,843
why you do these favors.

825
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:14,012
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

826
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,346
It's about power.

827
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:16,848
It makes you feel superior.

828
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,224
In control.

829
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,392
You're addicted
to creating chaos

830
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,685
and seeing where the chips fall,

831
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,520
to hell with
the consequences.

832
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,397
It's like you have
some kind of god complex.

833
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:27,358
I most certainly do not.

834
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:28,359
You do a favor
for one person,

835
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:29,736
someone else suffers.

836
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:31,195
When you gave Benny that favor,

837
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:32,864
you damned Viper
to prison.

838
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:33,948
Twice.

839
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:35,074
Whether he's guilty or not.

840
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:55,887
What?

841
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:57,513
Stop staring.

842
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:58,890
You're having another one
of those "gut feelings,"

843
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,266
aren't you?

844
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:01,642
Like you had
on the Palmetto case.

845
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:02,935
This has nothing
to do with Palmetto.

846
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,437
Au contraire.

847
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:05,688
I think it has everything
to do with it.

848
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:07,190
See? Addicted to creating chaos,

849
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:08,566
- talking out of your ass...
- Like I said:

850
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,276
you were trusting
your instincts

851
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,153
on that case, just like
you're trusting them now.

852
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:15,114
I mean, why would
a seasoned parolee

853
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,617
bring a gun to
a children's art class?

854
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:19,410
For all we know,
Mr. Viper is innocent.

855
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,871
I am innocent, man!

856
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,372
See?

857
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:24,749
What do you know?
Our suspect has ears.

858
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:25,917
Let's see if
he has a conscience,

859
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,919
as well, shall we?

860
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:28,920
Mr. Viper.

861
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,421
Mr. Viper...

862
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:33,549
Hello.

863
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,218
You've already wasted
so much of your life.

864
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:37,678
What do you desire to do

865
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:39,305
with the rest of
your time on Earth?

866
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:42,558
All I want to do is my art.

867
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:45,561
I swear I didn't
shoot up Benny's show.

868
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,647
If I hated him so much,

869
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,649
why would I bother
to go after him and miss?

870
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:52,443
Oh.

871
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,362
Yes, he's got a point, actually.

872
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,406
I mean, to pop off in a crowd
like that and not hit anyone,

873
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,117
he'd have to be
the worst shot in the world.

874
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:01,327
Or the best.

875
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:07,125
Steady on, Detective.

876
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,048
It's my Pig Diddy piece.

877
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:16,592
Collector in Dubai
offered me 150 G's for it.

878
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:17,969
I want you to have it.

879
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,345
As thanks for saving my life.

880
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:20,555
Again.

881
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,184
Yes, my favor really did pay
off for you, didn't it, Benny?

882
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:26,602
You're a huge star.

883
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,648
But if there's one thing
the Devil abhors, it's a fake.

884
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,400
What are you talking about?

885
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,402
I'm all about authenticity.

886
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,237
Sure.
Except for the lying.

887
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:37,905
You failed
to inform me

888
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:39,407
that in getting you
off the B&E charge,

889
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,117
suspicion would immediately fall

890
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:42,285
on your best friend.

891
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,245
I had no control over that.

892
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:45,246
Didn't you?

893
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,956
Oh...

894
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,376
Hey, it's good to see you, man.

895
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:51,878
I missed you, bro.

896
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,921
That why you never came
to visit me in prison?

897
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,464
I wish I could've
done more.

898
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:56,549
Framing him for shooting up
your fashion show

899
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:57,967
surely didn't help.

900
00:36:58,176 --> 00:36:59,302
Viper was always
the real talent.

901
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,678
When you heard
he was getting released,

902
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:01,846
you tried to take down
the competition

903
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,347
before he could take down you.

904
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:05,183
Planned a simple frame job.

905
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,310
Parole violation that would
send Viper back to prison.

906
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:08,853
But when Paola
Cortez died,

907
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,438
you had to improvise,
didn't you?

908
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,106
You knew pointing
the fingers at Latin Kings

909
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:13,774
would eventually
get back to me.

910
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,651
How the hell could I have
staged that frame job?

911
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,528
How could I have pointed
a gun at myself?

912
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:19,113
Because you didn't
pull the trigger.

913
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:21,699
So many bullets fired
into that crowd.

914
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,367
How did no one get hit?

915
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:25,203
That takes precision.

916
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:27,955
I saw your Marine tattoo
when I met you, Hector.

917
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:28,956
A heart in crosshairs.

918
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:30,499
Sniper unit.

919
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,001
Best marksmen
in the world.

920
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,296
Did you know firing a gun
into a crowd

921
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:36,964
is a felony?

922
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:38,841
You're responsible
for Paola's murder.

923
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,635
Unless, of course, you were just

924
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:41,969
doing someone a favor.

925
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:43,638
No, man. Hey...

926
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:46,015
Benny made me do it!
I'll testify, man.

927
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:48,059
He told me
he'd make me a partner.

928
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,353
But then he made me
plant the gun

929
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,271
on Viper.

930
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,315
And kill Pig Diddy.

931
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,194
I loved that pig, man.

932
00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,528
Oh...

933
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:00,821
Well, the good
news is

934
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,282
that whilst all dogs
go to Heaven,

935
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:05,201
you'd be surprised how many pigs
are waiting for you in Hell.

936
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:06,994
Okay, let's go.

937
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:09,288
You were never good as me, man.

938
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:10,289
You were never
good as me, man!

939
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:11,666
- Never!
- What?

940
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,376
I don't think so,
Sonny G.

941
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:14,460
Not my...

942
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,884
Mm.

943
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:24,345
I'm no expert
on L.A. street art,

944
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,055
but it's funny...

945
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:28,015
this piece seems a lot more
authentic to me now.

946
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:37,024
I think I'll keep it.

947
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,157
We're here live

948
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,535
at the location of
the impromptu shrine

949
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,870
for Paola Cortez,
the young art school student

950
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,497
killed at the fashion show

951
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:53,457
for artist/designer Benny Choi,

952
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,960
who has been arrested
for the killing.

953
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,837
Can we
start, please? Excuse me.
Yes, ma'am.

954
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,672
Thank you.

955
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,257
The mother...

956
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:04,218
of Paola Cortez can rest
a little easier tonight,

957
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:05,636
knowing that
her daughter's killer

958
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:07,805
is behind bars.

959
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:09,557
The arrest of Benny Choi

960
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,100
and several of
the Latin Kings membership

961
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:12,435
is a reminder

962
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:14,770
that my LAPD

963
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:16,689
means justice for all.

964
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,528
You know, I'd love to make
that woman cry for real.

965
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:24,780
She's gonna be chief of police
because of you.

966
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,073
Mm.

967
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:27,408
I don't know how you do it.

968
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,577
I simply made good on a favor.

969
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,579
- Aren't you the little saint?
- Oh, no, no.

970
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,581
This time, I called in my IOU.

971
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,624
Olivia got what she wanted,

972
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,585
and I got what I wanted.

973
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:39,920
Oh, don't say it.
Come on, don't say it.

974
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:42,256
I am now an official
civilian consultant

975
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:43,841
for the LAPD.

976
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,885
- Oh.
- Not that there's
anything civil

977
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:46,886
about the Devil.

978
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:47,970
What fun would that be?

979
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:51,599
Okay, then.

980
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:52,600
You win.

981
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:53,976
We're partners.

982
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:55,644
What, you're not
going to protest?

983
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:57,063
Actually, no.

984
00:39:57,271 --> 00:40:00,316
I may have no idea
what your angle is, but...

985
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:01,984
at least now
I can keep my eye on you.

986
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,819
Keep your enemies close, right?

987
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:05,529
Close?

988
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:07,698
So does this mean
you're gonna take me home

989
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:09,241
and consummate our new
arrangement, then, Detective?

990
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,542
Oh.

991
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:19,919
I'll take that as a yes.

992
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,969
Seriously?

993
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:30,429
What, you're just gonna
leave me here?

994
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:31,555
In this part of town?

995
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:32,932
You said you wanted danger.

996
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,933
What...?

997
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:36,852
Detective! Detective!

998
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:40,689
I don't even have a phone!

999
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,026
Ah, well.

00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,945
