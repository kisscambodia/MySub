00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:04,547
Container went missing.

3
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:06,174
<i>Security cameras were disabled.</i>

4
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:08,134
What container?

5
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:09,636
<i>The</i> container.

6
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:10,804
Your return to the Underworld

7
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,055
has been requested.

8
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:13,723
Remind Dad

00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:15,266
<i>that I quit Hell

<i>of playing a part in His play.</i>

11
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:18,770
<i>There was a case,
a shooting on Palmetto Street.</i>

12
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:19,980
<i>Malcom got shot</i>

13
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:21,564
meeting up
with some gang members.

14
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,316
Paolucci thinks he took
the bullet like a hero.

15
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:24,567
I think he was on the take.

16
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:27,028
Now, no one wants
to work with me.

17
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:31,324
You give me what is mine!

18
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:32,575
Oh, God.

19
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:33,827
Who stole them?

20
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,036
They were yours.

21
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:36,371
No, don't!

22
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:38,999

Hello, Sergei.

55
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:24,938
Waters a bit rough, are they?

56
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,689
What-what the hell
are you doing?

57
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:28,066
Isn't it obvious?

58
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:29,651
I'm going to brutally
torture you

59
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:30,652
until you give me
what I want.

60
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,612
My wings-- where are they?

61
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,948
What wings? I don't even know
what you're talking about!

62
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:36,950
Why do they always

63
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,452
insist on being so difficult?

64
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:40,995
All right.

65
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:43,289
As you can see,

66
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:44,290
I'm not playing,

67
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:45,291
so let's try again,

68
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,709
shall we?

69
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,545
My wings, please.

70
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,630
Look, man, why would I take
your wings?

71
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,298
I don't even know
who you are!

72
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,175
I'm Lucifer Morningstar.

73
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:56,136
And you,
you small-peckered fool,

74
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,638
are Sergei Bok,
a known smuggler.

75
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,014
You move just about anything

76
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,349
you can get
your trashy Euro hands on.

77
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:02,642
Please, man!

78
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,019
I don't have 'em!
I swear.

79
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,521
Okay? I don't know what
I'd do with a pair...

80
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,566
Maybe if I hit him a few times?

81
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,818
Though I hate to say it,

82
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,987
I'm not sure violence is
the trick here.

83
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,822
I'm beginning to wonder

84
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,866
if this human stain is actually
telling the truth.

85
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:19,450
No! He's scum.

86
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:20,994
He'll say anything.

87
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,453
Maybe it's not him, it's us.

88
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:23,997
Us?

89
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,207
He's the fifth man
we've accosted this week.

90
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,168
Perhaps we're-- dare I say it--

91
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,128
going about this wrong?

92
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,424
It may be time to seek the help
of a professional.

93
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:37,510
Oh!

94
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,554
Maze!

95
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,314
Hey.

96
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:50,440
I don't know that you want
to be here right now.

97
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:51,900
There she is.

98
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:54,235
Yeah. What, do I have
a "hate me" sign on my face?

99
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:56,029
If only it were that simple.

100
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,739
It's about Malcolm.

101
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,073
What about him?

102
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:00,909
That guy's been
in a coma for months.

103
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:02,994
His wife decided
to pull the plug.

104
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,538
Malcolm's dying today,

105
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:08,082
and you're still investigating
him for corruption.

106
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,834
So, what,
they hate me even more

107
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:11,127
now that I won't put a halo
on his head?

108
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:12,128
Maybe stay away

109
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:14,005
from the precinct tonight.

110
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:15,798
Cops are staging
a living wake here.

111
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,091
Anything else?

112
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:24,390
It would make
everyone's life easier

113
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,559
if you would close
your investigation.

114
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:27,894
You know, Dan,
I thought we were actually

115
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,604
making progress there
for a second,

116
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,940
but once again, look who's
on Team Everyone Else.

117
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,485
- I'm trying to protect you.
- From what?

118
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,237
Catching a criminal
or hurting your rep?

119
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,324
It's not about any of that.
It's about Malcolm's family.

120
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,451
If there's an open investigation
calling for his dismissal,

121
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,744
it can cost them his benefits,

122
00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:46,246
his pension, all of it.

123
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,414
So, what,
you want me to just drop it?

124
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:50,833
Just turn my back
on everything I stand for?

125
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,502
No.

126
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,962
I'm saying if you want
to do something about it,

127
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,963
then do it now.

128
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,256
You have 24 hours.

129
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,634
Or let it go and let
his family move on.

130
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,990
Is this really what you do
in your spare time?

131
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,118
How fascinatingly morose.

132
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:26,536
Do you ever think
of taking up knitting?

133
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:29,163
What are you doing here?

134
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:32,542
I'm here because I could really
use your expertise.

135
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,627
You're not busy, are you?

136
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,170
Actually, shocker, I am busy.

137
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,006
And it's really not a good day

138
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,966
for... your... Luciferness.

139
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,134
Hmm?

140
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,510
Here's an idea.

141
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:43,636
- Call next time.
- No, no, no.

142
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:46,055
Hold on.

143
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:49,017
Now, I'm not one to get
into the feels, usually, but...

144
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:51,060
you seem genuinely distressed.

145
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,021
You okay?

146
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,314
Do you want to--
I don't know--

147
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,649
chat about it or something?

148
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:57,525
Sex is always

149
00:05:57,734 --> 00:05:58,776
on the table.

150
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,029
You never quit, do you?

151
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,864
No.

152
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,657
I'm simply offering an ear.

153
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:07,577
Come on.

154
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,497
Remember the Palmetto case
I was telling you about?

155
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,167
The case that's been
consuming you,

156
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,251
causing people to despise you,

157
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,836
call you names--
I even quarreled

158
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,254
upon occasion because of it?

159
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:19,922
No, doesn't ring a bell.

160
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:23,009
Well, they're pressuring me
to drop the case,

161
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,010
assume the party line,

162
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,303
and say the guy died a hero.

163
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,679
My spidey sense tells me

164
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:29,015
dropping it's not what you want,
is it?

165
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,391
I want the truth.

166
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,434
Well, then seek it out.

167
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,935
You're a police officer.

168
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:34,187
You don't need
anyone's permission.

169
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,563
Hmm.

170
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,398
That's decent-ish advice.

171
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,525
I know. I'm quite good.

172
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,027
Anyway, now we've helped you,
my turn.

173
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,404
See, I'm working a sort of case
of my own.

174
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:44,864
And it seems that I've...

175
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:46,824
Well, hit a bit of a snag.

176
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,077
A case?

177
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,286
Um...

178
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:51,537
What kind of case is it?

179
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:52,830
Well, the nature
of the investigation

180
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,207
isn't important.

181
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,334
I'm strictly here
for professional advice.

182
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,379
What do you do
when your case hits a wall?

183
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:00,713
Mmm.

184
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:03,383
- What do I do when
I get stuck?
- Yes.

185
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,676
Well, I grab a pair
of fresh eyes--

186
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:08,054
someone who's not gonna be
afraid to be honest with me,

187
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,765
even if it's not
what I want to hear.

188
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:11,849
Hello.

189
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,851
That's a brilliant idea.

190
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,061
Yeah.

191
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,938
It kinda is.

192
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,481
So...

193
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,608
maybe if you help me,

194
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:21,984
I could help you.

195
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:24,946
Could...

196
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,531
And Bob's your uncle.

197
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:27,573
Right.

198
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,212
What are we doing here, Lucifer?

199
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:43,423
I like to come here
from time to time.

200
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,091
Dip my toes in the sand,

201
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,759
breathe the ocean air,

202
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,761
walk down memory lane.

203
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:51,848
You see,

204
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,057
five years ago,

205
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:54,434
when Maze
and I abandoned Hell,

206
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:57,145
I landed right here
on this beach.

207
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,648
This is where I flipped
dear old Dad

208
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,400
the grandest of birds.

209
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,486
And had Maze sever my wings.

210
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,947
And why are you
telling me this?

211
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:09,449
Honestly,
why summon me here at all?

212
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,909
Surely it's not just
to reminisce.

213
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,789
I've asked you here
because those same wings

214
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:18,499
have been stolen.

215
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:23,004
And I need your help
to get them back.

216
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:30,344
♪ Oh! ♪

217
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,060
Your wings are missing?

218
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,229
Sorry, is there an echo?
Isn't that what I just said?

219
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,231
What exactly am I supposed
to do with that news?

220
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,983
Use your angelic powers

221
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:45,902
to soar around the city
and find them.

222
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,111
I mean, really,

223
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,321
what good's an angel

224
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,906
if he can't help a brother out?

225
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,449
Am I right?

226
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,494
Lucy,

227
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,287
since your grand departure
from Hell,

228
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:58,664
I've been the one
that's had to patrol the gates,

229
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,458
I've been the one
keeping damned souls

230
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,961
from slipping loose-- a job,
by the way, that I loathe.

231
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,463
- I didn't ask for that.
- But those wings

232
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,590
out there in the human world?

233
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:08,925
Lucy, they're too powerful.

234
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,426
A piece of divinity.

235
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:12,762
Humanity can't
handle them.

236
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,597
And if they fall
into the wrong hands...

237
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,432
Then people might die?
Yeah, I get that.

238
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,434
Just saw a chap toss himself
off a building

239
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:21,103
after a mere peek at them, so if
you're done telling me things

240
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,147
I already know...

241
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,401
...will you help me or not?

242
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,111
You tell me something.

243
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,530
If you truly hated the wings,

244
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,281
why'd you hold onto them
all this time?

245
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,328
- That is none of your business.
- It's a sentimental
move, Lucy.

246
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:38,788
Especially for someone
that was trying

247
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:39,830
to leave their
life behind.

248
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,707
Please. Here we go.

249
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,502
Maybe deep down you realize you
never should've cut them off.

250
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,962
And maybe that's why

251
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,630
you left yourself an out.

252
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,257
Yeah.

253
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:50,633
So are you done?

254
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,718
Pretty words, but no.

255
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,720
They're my property.
I want them back.

256
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,222
Simple as that.
If I can avoid

257
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,016
an earth-shattering tragedy
as well-- bonus.

258
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,060
You wanted free will.

259
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,689
You wanted accountability.

260
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,816
Well...

261
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,527
fix your own damn mess,
for once.

262
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:20,121
I've been thinking.

263
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,872
Your problem, my problem--

264
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:24,792
why not be each other's
fresh eyes and all that?

265
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,544
Hey, what do you say,
quid pro quo?

266
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,671
Oh, so now you need my help.

267
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,673
Sorry, am I not
enunciating today?

268
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,551
Yes, I've come seeking
your very generous aid.

269
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,720
First you have to tell me
what it is you're working on.

270
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,472
I'm not sure you can handle it.

271
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:39,515
Try me.

272
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:41,517
Okay.

273
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,019
Uh, remember that container

274
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:44,395
that was so inelegantly
taken from me?

275
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:45,980
The one I was convinced

276
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,565
- was hiding something?
- Yes, well, it wasn't just

277
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,191
nesting dolls
that I was looking for.

278
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,486
There was something else,
something... personal

279
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,030
that was missing
when we got there.

280
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,364
I knew it.

281
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:57,700
Lucifer, what was in there?

282
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,286
My angel wings.

283
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,538
Yeah, go on.

284
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:03,706
Get it all out.

285
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:04,749
Okay, seriously,

286
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:06,083
what was in there?

287
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,796
Oh, you are serious?

288
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,466
Oh... okay, sorry.

289
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,134
Did someone make them for you?

290
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:18,054
Or are you big into cosplay?

291
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:19,055
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

292
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,222
Sorry, I'll admit

293
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,224
I don't always get you.

294
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,393
But if this is
really that important--

295
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,020
It is.

296
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,938
Okay, I will do what I can.

297
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:30,608
I will put out an APB on...

298
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,903
...angel wings.

299
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,529
Thank you,
and in return,

300
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,907
I shall donate my services
on Palmetto, all right?

301
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,116
Sure, we could use the help.

302
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:40,618
"We"?

303
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,079
- Hey.
- Ready to go?

304
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,914
Yeah, you weren't
around to help,

305
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,374
so I recruited someone else.

306
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:47,375
The more, the merrier.

307
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,459
You're helping her?

308
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:50,711
I knew she wouldn't give it up.

309
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,921
And I couldn't let
her go it alone,

310
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,256
so I'm here for the ride.

311
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:55,633
Hmm.

312
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:56,926
Cool.

313
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,552
The three of us
working together.

314
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,096
Yes, cool.

315
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:01,764
What could be better?

316
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:07,019
♪ Bursting inside ♪

317
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:08,771
♪ It's getting harder
to hide... ♪

318
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,649
So, this is Palmetto Street.

319
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,444
I'm sorry,
why is he here again?

320
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,614
Uh, he helps me
see things differently.

321
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:22,118
Yes, I've proved myself
quite useful, Dan.

322
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,495
So, how can we help you?

323
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:26,038
All right, I want
to reenact the shooting.

324
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,289
I want to figure out
what I missed.

325
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,624
How's that gonna prove anything?

326
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,460
Just humor me, thanks.

327
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:33,671
- Lucifer?
- Yes?

328
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,880
You will represent the seedy

329
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,632
criminal element.

330
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,634
Oh, I believe you mean
<i>handsome</i> criminal element.

331
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,344
And, Dan,

332
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:42,471
you will stand for Malcolm.

333
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,597
The tough as nails cop,

334
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:44,765
who wishes I would

335
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,142
leave this stupid case alone.

336
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,685
Ah, cute.

337
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,228
And I will play myself.

338
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:51,772
A chick who cannot figure out
what the hell I saw.

339
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:53,274
So in the months
leading up to the shooting,

340
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:54,984
we were following
a French drug trafficker

341
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,360
Nikolas Aoudi.

342
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:57,945
Ooh, can I have a gun?

343
00:12:58,154 --> 00:12:59,488
I feel like Nikolas
would definitely have a gun.

344
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:00,823
No...

345
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,158
Actually he was
more of a hammer guy.

346
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:03,492
Liked to break
fingers and arms.

347
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,161
- Okay--
- Some legs and teeth.

348
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,455
Right.
Can I have a hammer, then?

349
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,124
Somehow Aoudi
kept evading the LAPD.

350
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,293
I arrested one of his guys,
thought he was gonna flip.

351
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,044
Then suddenly
he changed his tune.

352
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,046
The only cop
who spoke to him was Malcolm.

353
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:17,298
So...

354
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:20,009
one night, I tracked him here,

355
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,219
sneaking in
through the side door.

356
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:25,014
And I hid behind this glass.

357
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,141
I could see them.

358
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,518
<i>It was Malcolm and Aoudi
and his bodyguard.</i>

359
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,021
<i>They looked like
they were making a deal.</i>

360
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,023
<i>Malcolm was holding cash.</i>

361
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,399
Hold on.

362
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:37,485
Ooh, is that enough?

363
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,695
A bribe, maybe.

364
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,864
I'm not sure.

365
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,158
<i>But I leaned forward to hear
what they were saying.</i>

366
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,910
<i>And accidentally,</i>

367
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:46,952
<i>I made a sound.</i>

368
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,120
<i>I could feel it.</i>

369
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:49,872
<i>He saw me, but he didn't react.</i>

370
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,249
<i>He just went back
to his conversation.</i>

371
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,292
<i>And that's
when the shot went off.</i>

372
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,879
<i>It didn't take long before
bullets were flying everywhere.</i>

373
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,340
<i>I braced behind the door,</i>

374
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,550
<i>and that's when I ran in.</i>

375
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,928
<i>Aoudi and his man were dead.</i>

376
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,555
<i>Malcolm was on the floor,
bleeding out.</i>

377
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:11,602
There was nothing you could do.

378
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,818
It doesn't make sense.

379
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,194
Excuse me?

380
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,987
Aoudi would have
no desire to kill Malcolm.

381
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,406
Trust me, if there's one
thing I know, it's desire.

382
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,576
I mean, if Malcolm
were indeed corrupt,

383
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,078
he'd be Aoudi's golden goose.

384
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,621
It'd be quite dumb to shoot him.

385
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,414
What if someone else was here?

386
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,959
The cops searched
the place up and down, Chloe.

387
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,460
There was no one else.

388
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,547
Look, you may not
want to believe it,

389
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,423
but what if--?

390
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,424
I was wrong.

391
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:47,304
Espinoza.

392
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,931
Uh, yeah.

393
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,892
Okay, I will let her know.

394
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,227
Did you really put out

395
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,438
an APB for... angel wings?

396
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,109
Maybe.

397
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,570
Well, it looks
like they got a hit.

398
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:03,988
Excellent!

399
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,823
Right, my turn.

400
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,371
I still can't believe it
that the wings are--

401
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,999
Real? Exquisite? Divine?

402
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,208
It's okay to say it.

403
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,918
I was gonna say,
"For sale."

404
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,087
So, anything else the FBI
can tell us, Agent Pitts?

405
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,797
The wings-- along
with a bunch of other crap

406
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,799
people think is real--
are being pawned off

407
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:25,342
at a black-market
antiquities auction.

408
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,969
An auction?

409
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,596
Held under the veil of
a charity event at Crimson Hall.

410
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:29,805
Saints' teeth?

411
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:31,181
Holy napkins?

412
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,892
Oh, a piece of the cross?

413
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,685
They've got my wings
in absurdly fraudulent company.

414
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:37,271
Yeah, unlike the wings,
there's no way those are real.

415
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,106
Exactly, it's insulting!

416
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:40,774
Putting my wings on the block
like some chintzy accoutrement.

417
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,443
All right.

418
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,028
Well, you can take comfort
knowing the auction's

419
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,322
already set
to be raided tonight.

420
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,240
So the FBI are gonna
snatch my wings?

421
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:49,992
When we get a chance to pounce
on the bad guys, we take it.

422
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,660
The FBI is taking lead.

423
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,037
Figured you might be
after the same guys.

424
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,788
And we have jurisdiction.

425
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,166
Okay, so how do we get
the wings back?

426
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,709
After the raid?

427
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:00,002
As long as you can prove
the wings' provenance,

428
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,211
you'll get it back in 30 days.

429
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,339
- No problem.
- 30 days.

430
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,341
Yes, no problem,
no problem at all.

431
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,467
Right?

432
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,510
Mm-hmm.

433
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,827
Come on out, Amenadiel.

434
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:39,041
So what happened
to going it alone,

435
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,668
lying in my own mess
and such?

436
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,419
Or did you just want
a front row seat to the action?

437
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:43,921
I assure you, Lucifer,

438
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,631
I take no pleasure in
following you around.

439
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,467
But this is far too important
to let you screw up.

440
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:51,428
Ah, so you just
came to help?

441
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:54,056
I came to ensure the wings
get back where they belong.

442
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,683
Which is where exactly?

443
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,142
You mean besides
on your back?

444
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,602
Oh, surely,
my fine-feathered friend,

445
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,187
you don't expect
that to happen.

446
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,399
They belong in the Heavens
where they were created.

447
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,026
If you don't want them,
that's where they'll be.

448
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:09,029
Fair enough.

449
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,614
Considering
we're on a clock now,

450
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:11,615
I could use a wingman.

451
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:13,492
What do you mean?

452
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,536
The FBI's raiding the place.

453
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,455
So if we don't get the wings,
humanity finds divinity,

454
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,457
so on and so forth--
you know the rest.

455
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,084
Well, we can't
let that happen.

456
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,294
Right, so you can join.

457
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:25,546
Provided, of course,
you can keep

458
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,715
that angelic ego
of yours in check.

459
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,258
I don't have an ego.

460
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,427
Sure you do, but I'm
encouraging you to get off

461
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,762
that high horse and learn
a thing or two about humanity.

462
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,640
Though it appears that you've
picked up a fashion sense.

463
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:38,017
So that's, uh...

464
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,227
I miss the dress.

465
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,317
Hello.

466
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:48,736
Private party.

467
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,113
Honey, not vinegar.

468
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:54,074
Yes, excuse me, I understand

469
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,492
this event is very exclusive.

470
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:59,079
But, uh, surely
you've got room for just

471
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,622
two more?

472
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,127
Unless you got business here,
scram.

473
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,010
It's funny you should
say that, actually.

474
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,387
Perhaps I do have something
that might interest

475
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,265
those keen on religious relics.

476
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,023
Right this way, gentlemen.

477
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,691
Thank you.

478
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,735
Did you catch all that?

479
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,409
I can't believe
I agreed to this.

480
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:38,952
I thought you
were helping me.

481
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,204
I am helping.

482
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:41,497
We went to Palmetto,
right?

483
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,706
We went over
everything that happened.

484
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,584
And found nothing.
Exactly.

485
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:48,337
Now I want to show you
who your case is about.

486
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,508
This is who's on
the other end of this case.

487
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,884
Not a monster.

488
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:55,385
Not a villain.

489
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:58,180
But a grieving family
trying to say goodbye.

490
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,433
She saw us.

491
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,356
What is she doing here?

492
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,982
I'm sorry, Mel.

493
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,526
She's not, she's not
looking for a fight.

494
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,319
Are you kidding?

495
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,695
A fight?

496
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,531
She...

497
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,534
You have no right.

498
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,202
What do you want from us?

499
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,998
I'm-I'm so sorry for your loss.

500
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,087
Just go.

501
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,131
Please, just...

502
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,514
Carmen?

503
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,558
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

504
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,485
Congratulations,
Mr. Morningstar.

505
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:57,531
The Catholics and the Satanists
will be clawing for this coin.

506
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,534
With any luck, we may even have
a bidding war on our hands.

507
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,244
Wouldn't that be fun?

508
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,121
Who would've thought, eh,
the devil's coin,

509
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,623
- worthy of so much love?
- Put a bunch of
believers in a room

510
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:10,335
and-- pardon the pun--
but sky's the limit.

511
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,670
That's very good.

512
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,338
If I didn't know
any better, I would say

513
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,049
that you don't respect
your buyers' faith.

514
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,593
Oh, quite
the contrary.

515
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,928
I respect my customers'
faith very much.

516
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:21,430
But I don't have to share
in their beliefs

517
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,307
to profit from them.

518
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,310
So I take it
you're not a believer then?

519
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:29,646
I'm a man that believes
in one simple divinity,

520
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,773
the almighty dollar.

521
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,946
Humans.

522
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,781
Am I right?

523
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,117
I have to admit,

524
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:45,287
I love being the bearer
of bad news.

525
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,456
Oh? Do tell.

526
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,166
The coin's not for sale.

527
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:52,085
I simply used it
to gain entrée to you.

528
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,171
Then why are you here?

529
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,797
Someone stole my wings.

530
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,300
About six feet,
glow with the light of God.

531
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:02,179
So if you'd be so kind as
to deliver them, then we can be

532
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,805
on our way
without any...

533
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,849
unpleasantries.

534
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,517
Funny.

535
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,312
That's not how this works.

536
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,650
Oh, you men don't know
who you're dealing with.

537
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,152
Those guns
don't frighten us.

538
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:18,862
In fact,

539
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,031
I dare you to shoot.

540
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:22,658
Brother...

541
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:23,992
Go ahead.

542
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,869
See what happens.

543
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,791
And there's that angelic ego
I was talking about.

544
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,592
I'm sorry, uh...
You were saying?

545
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:42,886
Gentlemen, please...

546
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:44,471
Don't mind my brother.

547
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,056
He's just a bit... simple.

548
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:48,976
We meant no disrespect, truly.

549
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,811
- I thought you told me you
wanted your wings back.
- I do.

550
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,105
But this is hardly
the way to go about it.

551
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,606
Give me one good reason

552
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,441
not to finish
this right now.

553
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,277
Because
you misunderstood me.

554
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,779
I'm more than happy
to buy the wings,

555
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:03,615
like everyone else,
with cash.

556
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,367
A whole
boatload of money.

557
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,077
If you truly worship the dollar,

558
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,288
then I'm your ticket
to divinity.

559
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,837
Happy bidding.

560
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:20,382
Thank you.

561
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,016
♪ Everybody knows when,
ah, tell me again ♪

562
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:32,185
♪ Fatten up the pig
and, baby, let's pretend ♪

563
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,646

564
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,106
It's funny, isn't it,
how all it takes

565
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,025
to unite the faiths
of the world is a bit

566
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,860
of illegal consumerism.

567
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:40,944
Mmm.

568
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:42,279
What I'd like to know

569
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,198
is since when
is the Prince of Darkness

570
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,701
scared of some
insufferable human gun?

571
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,703
Well, since I, uh...

572
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,038
I bled.

573
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,582
- What do you mean, bled?
- Yep.

574
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,209
Don't know how it's possible,
but on top of everything else,

575
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,503
seems I'm dealing
with a bit of a mortality sitch.

576
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,547
Hence: ixnay on the unsgay.

577
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,383
What are you
grinning about?

578
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:06,219
I'm just realizing the gravity
of what you're saying.

579
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,013
That I'm allergic
to lead projectiles?

580
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,681
That even if you
don't choose Hell,

581
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:15,354
all I have do is wait for
some pitiful thug to end you

582
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:18,774
and right back
to Hell you go.

583
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:23,278
You hadn't put that one
together yet, had you, Lucy?

584
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,573
You just made my millennium.

585
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,952
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

586
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,579
I'm Carmen Grant

587
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:35,874
and I humbly welcome you
to our Evening of Faith.

588
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,504
Tonight we shall behold items

589
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,423
that prove
the miraculous is real.

590
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,634
There is a power we can't see,

591
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,261
but its light burns bright
in the priceless artifacts

592
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,473
that have traveled
from around the world

593
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,726
and, dare I say,
Heaven and Hell,

594
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,728
to find their way to you!

595
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,277
Without further ado,

596
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,656
I would like to introduce you
to the first item up for bid...

597
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:10,784
the Lost Chains of St. Paul!

598
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,995
According to tradition,

599
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:16,331
St. Paul was imprisoned

600
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,417
between 61 and 63 AD.

601
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:22,129
While some pieces are on display
at the Papal Basilica--

602
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,964
or so they say--

603
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,758
these are the missing links.

604
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,261
Paul's wrists were too thick
to fit in those chains.

605
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,471
I know. That man never
could pass on dessert, could he?

606
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,722
He should have been
the Saint of...

607
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,015
Honey cakes?

608
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,438
Those are clearly fake!

609
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:40,605
- What?
- Shh!

610
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:41,690
Shh.

611
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,276
Ooh. Tough crowd.

612
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:47,195
You don't know
the half of it.

613
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:48,697
How did I know
you'd come here?

614
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,574
Because I'm admirably
consistent?

615
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,159
How did you
even get in here?

616
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,660
Oh, I've got news for you, pal.

617
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:54,953
You're not the only one
with a little mojo.

618
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,663
Mmm. Touché.

619
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:57,664
And you're welcome, by the way.

620
00:24:57,873 --> 00:24:59,374
I came here to warn you.

621
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,001
In about five minutes, the FBI's
gonna storm this place,

622
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:02,294
so we have to go now.

623
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:03,837
But we were just
getting started.

624
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:06,131
"We"?

625
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,716
Oh, that's right.
You haven't met, have you?

626
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,176
Allow me to introduce

627
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,510
Amenadiel.

628
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,511
My brother.

629
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,054
Well, come on,

630
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:14,389
don't look so shocked.

631
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:15,807
Um...

632
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,727
I just didn't

633
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,604
expect your brother to be...

634
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,356
so... handsome.

635
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,192
We're all full
of surprises, it seems.

636
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,528
I never expected my brother
to change careers as he did.

637
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,573
But I'm definitely beginning
to see why.

638
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,659
Lucifer, your brother got

639
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:36,077
all the charm in the family.

640
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:37,621
Okay, that's
enough of that.

641
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:38,914
It's unsettling to see
you two get along.

642
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,166
Next up.

643
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,588
The wings of an angel.

644
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,014
They're gorgeous.

645
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,310
Freeze! FBI!

646
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,062
What's going on?

647
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,104
Everyone, stay
where you are!

648
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,356
Don't move!

649
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:08,944
Stay where you are.

650
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,071
Mr. Grant.

651
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,072
Nobody move.

652
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,198
Come on.

653
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,450
Stop! Freeze!

654
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,418
Where'd he go?

655
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,296
A little help.

656
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,966
Please.

657
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,060
Thank you.

658
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,922
They're fake.

659
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,391
I'm telling you,
I saw him come in here.

660
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,773
There was a secret door.

661
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,235
I see you got your wings.

662
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:33,945
Thought you'd be happier.

663
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,614
These aren't my wings.

664
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,699
Whose wings are they?

665
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,743
Someone with
a warped sense of humor.

666
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:41,036
- I don't...
- They're a knockoff,

667
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:42,662
a sham.

668
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,623
I mean, it's good work,
I'll give them that.

669
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:46,875
Probably would've fooled
just about anyone,

670
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,210
save perhaps
the actual owner of the wings.

671
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,713
The actual owner-- being you?

672
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,340
Yeah, they must've been
switched out.

673
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,383
It's no coincidence that
my wings are stolen one day,

674
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,928
and then Carmen's selling
an exact replica a week later.

675
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,722
No, this is
some serious foul play.

676
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,474
I-I'm sorry to hear that,
sincerely.

677
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:03,767
But there's something
at Palmetto

678
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,393
that I need to
take care of, so...

679
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,438
Are you coming?

680
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:09,939
Didn't you hear me?

681
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,274
My wings are still out there.

682
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:12,734
I need to find them.

683
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,778
If you want to run off
to Palmetto, be my guest,

684
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,155
but no more role-playing
for me, thanks.

685
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,282
So I came to save your ass,
but just because these wings

686
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:20,492
aren't the ones
you wanted,

687
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,077
that's it? We're done?

688
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:26,164
So much for quid pro quo.

689
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:27,791
Ah.

690
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,294
You sure you don't want
to chase after her?

691
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:34,673
Maybe I can ask Father for some
rain and make it a moment.

692
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,471
All right.

693
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,306
So what's our next move?

694
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:46,184
Well, I'm afraid this is
where I leave you, brother.

695
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,477
What I'm about to do

696
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,854
is the Devil's work.

697
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:59,698
I thought we were finally
done with all this.

698
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,366
I was done.

699
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,660
I even started believing
I was crazy like everybody said.

700
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,662
I never said
you were crazy.

701
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,539
Yeah. It's okay.

702
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,541
I would've thought I was, too.

703
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,418
But, you know,
I got to thinking.

704
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:13,545
Lucifer pointed out
that it made no sense

705
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,422
for Aoudi to shoot
his inside man, right?

706
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,048
Right.

707
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,135
But no one else was there.

708
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:23,346
No one could've shot Malcolm
and fled without me seeing them.

709
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:24,305
- Now you're making my point.
- Because

710
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:27,016
there was no obvious exit.

711
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:28,143
But maybe,

712
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:30,145
just maybe-- hear me out--

713
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,147
there was a secret one.

714
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:35,024
Chloe, you are stabbing hard
at something

715
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,026
- that's just not there.
- There's got to be an explanation

716
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:38,653
for what I saw, Dan!
There has to be.

717
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,864
What do you need me to do?

718
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:41,573
I don't...

719
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,703
What was that?

720
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,863
Looks like it leads
up to the street.

721
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:26,910
Hey.

722
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:30,914
What is it?

723
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:32,749
A 999 key.

724
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,459
LAPD-issued.

725
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,754
Malcolm had his on him.

726
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:40,548
- Wait. Are-are you saying...
- Yes.

727
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,425
Another cop was here.

728
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,260
- I was right.
- Chloe,

729
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:45,386
- this could mean a lot
of things...
- It means

730
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,055
a cop knew

731
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,599
this secret passageway existed,
Dan.

732
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,226
And chances are,

733
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:52,894
whoever it was
shot Malcolm, so...

734
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,020
Yeah. But why?

735
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,939
That's what I got to figure out.

736
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:57,357
No.

737
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,401
That's what we need
to figure out.

738
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,303
It's...

739
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:28,596
you.

740
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,265
That's right, me,

741
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:33,142
Lucifer bloody Morningstar.

742
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,061
Do you mind
if I come in?

743
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,896
You, Carmen,

744
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,690
slightly more difficult
to identify, aren't you?

745
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,984
No phone, no bank account,

746
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:43,319
home registered under
one of your many aliases.

747
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:46,155
Seems wings aren't the
only thing you falsify, eh?

748
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,157
- I can explain...
- I'm still moved by your words.

749
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:51,160
"I'm a man that believes
in one simple divinity,

750
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:53,705
- the almighty dollar."
- You don't understand...

751
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,374
No, I understand. Perfectly.

752
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,126
A lifelong atheist,

753
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,378
you took one peek at the wings

754
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:02,881
and something changed in you.

755
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,883
The great white light
was revealed

756
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,885
and a believer was born,

757
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:11,180
one who couldn't part
with real divinity!

758
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:22,567
Oh, no.

759
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,863
Mounting my wings,

760
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:30,074
like some decorative stag head.

761
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,373
Shame on you.

762
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:40,376
It wasn't my fault.

763
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,378
Someone tipped me off.

764
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:44,047
Excuses, excuses.

765
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:46,049
"It wasn't me, it was
the biker that did it."

766
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:48,051
I thought he was
bringing me a sculpture.

767
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:49,344
Were you disappointed?

768
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:50,845
I didn't know
what they were.

769
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:53,139
I never would have done it
if I had any idea

770
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:54,807
what I was actually
dealing with.

771
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:57,226
Please, please.

772
00:32:57,435 --> 00:33:00,563
You can't take them away.

773
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,192
I can't live without them.

774
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,527
Perhaps you don't understand.

775
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,657
They're mine.

776
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:14,243
Now, before I
deal with you,

777
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:18,289
I have just one burning
question on my mind.

778
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,293
Who tipped you off?

779
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,603
I knew you'd come.

780
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,021
Of course I'd come.

781
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:47,276
It's my duty to return
the wings where they belong.

782
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:49,278
Is that all?

783
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:56,911
After everything
that you've been through--

784
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,580
bleeding, searching, reaching
to the high heavens for help--

785
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,874
now that you finally
have your wings,

786
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,711
doesn't part of you long
to assume your form?

787
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,798
Get back to where you belong?

788
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,931
Not exactly.

789
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,479
What are you doing?!

790
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,356
Well, ruining your plan,
it seems.

791
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,484
It was you, brother.

792
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:31,779
You tipped Carmen off,
and you orchestrated the theft.

793
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:33,489
Because you left me no choice.

794
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:37,076
Well, clearly
you were desperate.

795
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:39,328
I mean, you were willing
to let a human die

796
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:41,664
and unleash the wings
upon the world

797
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:43,624
just to remind me who I was.

798
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:46,294
To fool me

799
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,296
into desiring the wings

800
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:49,964
and the hellish throne
they accompany.

801
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:52,341
Well, do you know what?

802
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,845
It almost bloody worked.

803
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,472
But destroy them?

804
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,349
Why?

805
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,685
Well, you were right.

806
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:05,188
Severing the wings
was a half measure.

807
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,648
I did leave myself
an out.

808
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:11,319
A rip cord back to the life
that dear old Dad chose for me.

809
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,321
But I don't need it now,

810
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:17,992
because, in case I haven't
made myself abundantly clear,

811
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:21,329
I'm never going back to Hell.

812
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:32,381
But, uh...

813
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,383
A for effort.

814
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:38,721
I'm sure Dad will give you
a big gold star for trying.

815
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:48,564
That's right,
hit me, brother.

816
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:49,899
Go on, again.

817
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,067
Become like me.

818
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,068
Become wrath.

819
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:53,569
Fall as I did!

820
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:56,531
Come on.

821
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,161
Come on.

822
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:09,252
You never were much
of a closer, were you, eh?

823
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,922
Can't stand to get
your hands dirty.

824
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:16,217
This is far from over.

825
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:26,269
I'll do whatever it takes
to get you back to hell.

826
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,744
He was like a brother to me.

827
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:45,413
And for the last eight years,

828
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,957
he was the best damn partner

829
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,251
that I could've asked for.

830
00:36:57,758 --> 00:37:00,303
You know, I-I remember
one time that he...

831
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:04,599
What in the hell...?

832
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:09,812
What part of "not welcome"
does she not understand?

833
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:11,898
Easy, Anthony. Easy.

834
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:13,649
You got some nerve, Decker.

835
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,446
I'd like to say
a few things about Malcolm.

836
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,326
He was a hero,

837
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:26,662
who got shot doing
what all of us do every day,

838
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:29,373
by putting himself
in the line of fire.

839
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:31,500
I can't take back

840
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,669
the things I've said.

841
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:36,589
But I can promise

842
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,591
not to let his life--

843
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,801
or death-- go in vain.

844
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:46,933
And for any pain
that I've caused--

845
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:50,937
his family or otherwise--

846
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:52,688
I'm sorry.

847
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:55,775
I'm closing the case
against him.

848
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:00,404
To a good cop.

849
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,284
To Malcolm.

850
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,830
To Malcolm.

851
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,749
To Malcolm.

852
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:26,722
I hope you're right
about this.

853
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,724
Trust me, if we're
gonna find a dirty cop,

854
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,559
it's best they don't
think we're looking.

855
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:49,412
I cleaned up your mess
on the beach.

856
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,831
I'm here to stay, Maze.

857
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,835
And I truly hate
to disappoint you,

858
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:59,922
but... well, this is
where I have to be now.

859
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:04,510
And I know, even
with all the sex and drugs...

860
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,762
and more sex,

861
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:09,974
this isn't
what you bargained for.

862
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,311
And I know
you made a vow, but...

863
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,438
But nothing.

864
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,733
I am with you, Lucifer,

865
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,818
from now until the end.

866
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,406
We're a team, right?

867
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,910
Of course.

868
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,754
Now...

869
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,255
you should get some ice.

870
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:43,341
Yeah.

871
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,387
Hmm.

872
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:53,309
♪ 1:00 a.m. ♪

873
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:58,272
♪ You're invited... ♪

874
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:01,317
What happened?

875
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,319
Hmm? Oh.

876
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:05,446
Sorry. This, yes.

877
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,823
Just a little, you know,
squabble with my bro.

878
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,700
Nothing serious.

879
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:13,996
I don't...

880
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:17,208
I don't like how we
left it at the auction.

881
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:20,086
Yes. Yes, I...

882
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:22,296
I agree.

883
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,840
You definitely could have
handled things better.

884
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:29,970
And I supposed,
you know, I...

885
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:32,139
Sorry. What was I saying?

886
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:40,356
Look, I know how much
it sucks being alone.

887
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,942
And I can't pretend
to understand

888
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,194
why the wings meant
so much to you.

889
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,657
But if we're really
friends, it...

890
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:52,868
it should be enough just
knowing that they did.

891
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:57,915
The wings are old news now.

892
00:40:58,124 --> 00:40:59,917
What?

893
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:01,961
Earlier they were all
you could think about.

894
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,380
What...? Now you
just don't care?

895
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:06,465
Well, in my search
for the wings,

896
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:08,592
I realized what
they actually were.

897
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:11,220
A relic worth exactly

898
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,848
what someone was willing

00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:16,475
What can I say?

900
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:19,770
I've moved on to bigger
and better things.

901
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:21,397
So, what changed?

902
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:23,107
I don't know.

903
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,943
Huh.

904
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:27,570
Or won't say.

905
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:31,740
Well, how'd your Palmetto thing
go anyway?

906
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:34,368
Hmm? Did you find the answer
you were looking for?

907
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:37,371
I found something.

908
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,249
Oh. Well.

909
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:43,419

enigmatic futures.
