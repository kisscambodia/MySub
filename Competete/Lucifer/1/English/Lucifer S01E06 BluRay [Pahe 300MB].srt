00:00:01,336 --> 00:00:03,546
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer:

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:04,714
Lucifer Morningstar.

3
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:06,716
Is that a stage name
or something?

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:08,510
God-given, I'm afraid.

5
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:09,928
Your return to
the Underworld

6
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:11,346
has been requested.

7
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,515
Remind Dad that I quit Hell

8
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:15,892
because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play.

9
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:18,019
Oh, don't say it.
Come on, don't say it.

10
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:22,023
I'm now an official civilian
consultant for the LAPD.

11
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:23,858
I want what's best for Lucifer.

12
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,819
Then give me something that
I can use against Lucifer,

13
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:27,570
and I'll make sure you're both
back where you belong.

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,447
He doesn't confide
in me anymore.

15
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:33,034
But there is someone
he does talk to-- a doctor.

16
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:34,661
Hello there, neighbor.

17
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:37,956
I actually need someone
to confide in about a patient.

18
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:39,708
And hey, listen,
if you have any patients

19
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,377
- you need to talk about...
- You have no idea.

20
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,004
Just shoot me,
Detective, please,

21
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,588
because maybe
you'll finally realize...

22
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:48,049
You're bleeding.

23
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:49,884
What's happening to me?

24
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:52,804
You're changing,
becoming vulnerable.

25
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:54,556
- Maybe even...
- mortal.

26
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:57,392
Oh, Mazie. I know that
you'll always protect me.

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,895
No matter how mortal I become,
the Devil can depend on that.

00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,542
So, tell me...

60
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,544
did you eat...

61
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,462
the chocolate cake?

62
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,924
No, Mommy.

63
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,219
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,680
It's just cake, Chloe.

65
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,016
Cake is so not the point, Dan.

66
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,726
This is about honesty

67
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,394
and personal
responsibility.

68
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:48,271
Fine.

69
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,609
I got this.

70
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,613
Hey, Monkey.

71
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,115
Do you remember
when we had that talk

72
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:01,326
and we said that lying
is a really bad thing?

73
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:02,911
Well,

74
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,787
some of your birthday cake
is missing.

75
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,956
Now, I didn't eat it,

76
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:10,084
and we know Mommy
didn't eat it, so...

77
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,336
is there something
you want to tell us?

78
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,633
I ate it.

79
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:18,593
Mm-hmm.

80
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,803
But Lucifer said it was okay.

81
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,513
Oh, really?

82
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,308
He said, if you really want

83
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,352
to do something, you should.

84
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,564
And I really wanted
to eat some chocolate cake.

85
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:33,566
Huh. That's...

86
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,277
...interesting.

87
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,531
Why don't you
go grab your stuff.

88
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:46,788
Oh, I am so glad to hear
advice from Lucifer

89
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,998
is on the personal
responsibility lesson plan.

90
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:49,999
Dan, it's not what you think.

91
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,501
You know what, Chloe?

92
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,002
Your private life
is none of my business,

93
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,254
but when it comes to Trixie...

94
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:55,296
keep Lucifer out of it.

95
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,842
Decker.

96
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,720
Yeah, yeah. I'll hold.

97
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:05,640
Okay, just don't forget tomorrow
night's Taco Tuesday, okay?

98
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,809
I can't do it.
Why?

99
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:09,477
I'm working a stakeout
in Van Nuys.

100
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:11,813
We agreed on planned family time
so that Trixie

101
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,148
can maintain some normalcy
during the separation.

102
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:16,484
I know, but...
this is important.

103
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:18,194
I thought you wanted
to work things out.

104
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:19,612
I don't have a choice, Chloe.
This is work.

105
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:20,947
Yeah, I've never heard
that one before.

106
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,323
Yeah.

107
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,158
Long Beach?

108
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,827
Okay, I got it.

109
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,328
Thanks.

110
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,081
You know,

111
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,500
when Trixie asks where
you are tomorrow,

112
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:35,503
I'll be sure to tell her that
something important came up.

113
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:40,967
<i>Oh, Lucifer.
I brought the after...</i>

114
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:43,052
<i>after</i> party.

115
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,972
Meet Brittany...

116
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,016
...and Brittany.

117
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:49,058
Wow.

118
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,727
Hello, Brittanies.

119
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,521
Yes, very nice to meet you.

120
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:56,858
Hello.
Hello.

121
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,111
Shall we move the party
upstairs?

122
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,988
I'll need
my clothes on, actually.

123
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,198
Sorry, girls. I'm late.

124
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:05,366
For what?

125
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:06,534
- Work.
- Please don't tell me

126
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,369
you actually believe you work

127
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,872
- for the police.
- Work for, work with.

128
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,540
I'm a civilian consultant.

129
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:14,125
The detective called.
There's been a murder.

130
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,376
My services are needed.

131
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:17,003
Brittanies...

132
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,881
why don't you make my
friend feel better, hmm?

134
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:30,058

00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,901

137
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,486
Possible imprint.

138
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:42,945
I'll know more once
I'm back at the lab.

139
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,572
Okay. Call me
when you get something.

140
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,574
Howdy, partner.

141
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,409
We're not partners.

142
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,495
Right.

143
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,830
So, what unpleasantness

144
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,416
felled this heap of
unrealized ambition then?

145
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,585
Suffocation; a crushed trachea.

146
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:59,962
And this heap has a name.

147
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,840
Erwin Scovell, 55. He worked
security here for 20 years.

148
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,008
Ooh, talk about suffocating.

149
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:05,343
Vice suspects this place

150
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:06,969
has been used
by criminal organizations

151
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,638
to store illegal contraband.

152
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,306
Container went missing,

153
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:13,226
so Scovell probably walked in
on a robbery in progress.

154
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,312
Security cameras
were disabled, so no video.

155
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,980
Probably gonna need
to canvass the...

156
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,858
Lucifer,
it's a dead body.

157
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,485
A little respect.

158
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,946
Do you know, I am amazed
by the deferential regard

159
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,572
you people hold
for rotting flesh.

160
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,367
I mean, this poor sap's
either already in Hell

161
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,869
or in the Silver City enduring
Uriel's welcome speech,

162
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:34,122
which is far worse than
Hell, if you ask me.

163
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,165
Let's pretend for one second
that you're someone else.

164
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,292
Someone nice,
someone mature.

165
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,253
Ooh, I love role-play.

166
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,629
Great.

167
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,464
So, since we don't have
any leads,

168
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,341
let's focus on the next steps
of the investigation,

169
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,176
like what was in
the stolen container.

170
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,470
But I've already solved it.
I know what killed Erwin.

171
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,638
What?

172
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:52,140
Boredom.

173
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,850
I mean, getting murdered
is probably

174
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,977
the most exciting thing
that ever happened to him.

175
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,604
When do we get to raid
a drug house or shoot someone?

176
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:01,232
I mean, I gave up
an epic foursome to be here.

177
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:04,152
A man died, and we're going
to do everything we possibly can

178
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,486
to catch the killer.

179
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:06,988
Pass.

180
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,656
Are you joking?

181
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:09,991
Hard pass.

182
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,118
Hey! After all
of your manipulations

183
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,662
to get to work with me,
you're really gonna walk away

184
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,372
because you think
this case is boring?

185
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:19,000
Just call me when you've
got a murder with a pulse.

186
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,502
Or at least someone
good-looking.

187
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,212
I mean...

188
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:26,674
Is the Brittany buffet
still serving?

189
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:28,634
Okay, got it.
Huh?

190
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,428
God, I was hoping
for a good shag

191
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,096
just as a
palate cleanser

192
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:33,806
to wipe the foul taste of
boredom from my mouth.

193
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,516
We need to talk.

194
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,518
Well, as long as it's
not the detective's

195
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,854
homicide/robbery snoozefest
at the docks, I'm all ears.

196
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,689
You know, I don't
know how they do it.

197
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:44,567
40 hours a week,
52 weeks a year, 50 years.

198
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,028
I mean, I didn't leave Hell
just to step into another one.

199
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,406
Yeah, well, about that
robbery/homicide snoozefest:

200
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:53,701
The container that's missing,
it was yours.

201
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,871
What container?

202
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,915
<i>The</i> container.

203
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,936
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

204
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,395
The container is missing.

205
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,231
I heard you.

206
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,525
Then why aren't we out there
recovering it?

207
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,652
Why fuss? I suppose
if somebody wants it

208
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,403
badly enough to steal it,

209
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,489
then perhaps they
should have it, then.

210
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,991
Really?
Mm-hmm.

211
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,743
This doesn't upset you?

212
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:37,745
I don't know
what to tell you, Maze.

213
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:40,331
I guess it's not that important
to me after all.

214
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,543
Well, it's your container...

215
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,628
and your reputation.

216
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,756
What about my reputation?

217
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:51,592
Well, apparently,
it's okay to steal from you now.

218
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:53,427
But...

219
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,888
if it doesn't bother you...
doesn't bother me.

220
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,067
We're canvassing
the entire area

221
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:09,277
for witnesses now, ma'am.

222
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,278
Okay, good. Let's check

223
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,445
with the nearby businesses,

224
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,446
- All right.
- and check the--

225
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:14,115
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

226
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,658
What? Have you thought
of all new offensive things

227
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,201
- to say?
- No, I've changed mind.

228
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,995
I've come back to help.
Any leads yet?

229
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,955
I need your help
like I need a third boob.

230
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,456
- Mmm!
- Wait.

231
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,333
Don't say a word.
Knew it was a mistake

232
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,419
- the minute
it came out of my mouth.
- We're partners,

233
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,379
and I'm offering you
my services.

234
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:30,089
I think you need
a refresher course

235
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,507
on how partnership works.

236
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,134
You left me hanging, remember?

237
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,969
Yes, but now I'm here
because of the robbery.

238
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,679
Robbery? Why?

239
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,639
Because the container
that was stolen was mine.

240
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:41,309
You somehow
left that out before.

241
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,810
Well, I didn't know before.

242
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,270
Maze handles logistics--
storage and such.

243
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,606
And did you know
that this facility was used

244
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,025
- to house illegal contraband?
- No.

245
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,568
But what better place
to store my stuff

246
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:51,611
than somewhere people
hide illicit goods?

247
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,070
Asking the obvious here,

248
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,239
but was your stuff
illegal contraband, too?

249
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,158
Define "illegal."

250
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,035
What was in the container?

251
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,662
- A personal item, insignificant.
- Yeah, but what was in it?

252
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:03,289
The only thing I brought
with me to Los Angeles.

253
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,874
I know, but you're not
answering the question.

254
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,667
Look, I was storing some
stuff, it was stolen,

255
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,419
the theft sets an
awful precedent,

256
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,171
so I'm obliged to make the
person responsible pay.

257
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,840
Now, if you let me help,

258
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:16,427
I'm certain we can
solve this case quickly.

259
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:17,803
And I have a lead.

260
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:24,185
Snow cones?

261
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,394
This is your lead?

262
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:26,646
We don't have time for this.

263
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,230
We should be working.

264
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,024
- What can I get you?
- Uh, yes.

265
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,692
I'll have two Tropic Wonders

266
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,362
- and your face smashed
into the ground.
- What?

267
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:37,531
What the...?

268
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,866
Lucifer, what are
you doing? Stop!

269
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,409
I believe they call this
interrogating.

270
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,244
Lucifer, stop!

271
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:43,663
He needs to tell me
where my stuff is.
Don't.

272
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,206
- I just sell snow cones.
- Lucifer!

273
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,874
This isn't how
we do things.

274
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,876
This pathetic sap's real name
is Frankie Costa,

275
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:51,295
and his real job is transporting
and storing illegal goods.

276
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:53,297
Maze set up the warehouse
through him.

277
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:55,299
So if someone knew to rob it,
he'd be involved.

278
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:58,260
I wouldn't steal
from my own operation.

279
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:00,471
That warehouse is
off-limits.

280
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,014
Hey, man.

281
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:03,891
I'm trying to get out
of the storage racket.

282
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,892
Yes, focus, Frankie.

283
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:05,893
Who took my property?

284
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:07,019
I don't know.

285
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:08,896
I'm trying
to find out myself.

286
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,231
This is bad for business.

287
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,232
And who would know about
the storage service?

288
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,441
Who are you?

289
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,026
I'm someone with one of these.

290
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,236
But this guy
doesn't have one.

291
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:16,612
So say if I were
to walk away,

292
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,656
he can do whatever
he wants to you.

293
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,658
Of if you're not responsible,
you can point us

294
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,576
in the right direction
of someone who is. Cool?

295
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:23,994
Okay, okay.

296
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,038
Los Diablos.

297
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,039
The biker club?

298
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,708
Yeah.

299
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,918
I run the warehouse,
but they run the docks.

300
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:34,088
If anything went down,
they would know about it.

301
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,339
That's all I know.

302
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:36,590
I swear.

303
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,259
All right, all right.

304
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:39,969
Fine.

305
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,599
That was incredible.

306
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,268
It was musical,
poetic really.

307
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,936
We were like fish and chips,
salt and pepper.

308
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:50,271
Hipsters
and condescension.

309
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,647
Give me
one good reason

310
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:53,607
why I shouldn't arrest
you for assault.

311
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:54,942
Fine, Frankie's
a complete scumbag,

312
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:55,860
and he skimps
on the cherry syrup.

313
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,236
So that's two, actually.

314
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:58,738
Uh, something's
going on with you,

315
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,239
and it has to do with
that mysterious container,

316
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:01,490
so no more games--
what's in it?

317
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,368
It was a gift
from my father.

318
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:05,703
That's still
not an answer.

319
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,079
I mean, what,
was it his memoirs?

320
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,123
Some priceless
porn collection?

321
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,624
Look, if we're gonna
work together on this,

322
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,668
you're gonna have to
trust me, all right?

323
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,422
You're right, we shouldn't
work together on this.

324
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,967
Aren't we being
a touch dramatic?

325
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,469
You know, I put up
with a lot of crap

326
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,345
to let you in on my cases,

327
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,222
and that's because thus far
you've been honest with me,

328
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,099
but now, for some reason, you're
not telling me the full story.

329
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:28,726
I'm telling you

330
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,603
everything you need to know
to help find my stuff.

331
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,980
A man was murdered, and all you
can talk about is your property?

332
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:34,982
Yes, but if we find it,
then you find out

333
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,401
who killed the security
guard-- it's win-win.

334
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,653
So, please, enlighten me.

335
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,655
Under what rock will
we find Los Diablos?

336
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,824
It's a very on-the-nose
name, if you ask me.

337
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,159
We won't find them anywhere.

338
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,786
It's a conflict of interest.

339
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,837
Look, Chloe, I told you, there's
nothing I can do about tomorrow.

340
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,172
Truce.

341
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,799
This is a call
for Dan the detective.

342
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:00,800
All right?

343
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:01,801
I need your help.

344
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:02,802
Okay.

345
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,136
It's about my case.

346
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,638
Homicide at the docks.

347
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,139
Security guard killed
during a robbery.

348
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:08,974
Yeah, that container
that was stolen,

349
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,643
it was Lucifer's.

350
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,854
That storage facility was filled
with black market goods.

351
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:16,690
Yeah, it was.

352
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,818
You think what Lucifer had
stored in there may be illegal.

353
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,153
Whatever is in that container,
he won't tell me.

354
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:24,156
And for a man who's all about
over-sharing, says a lot,

355
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,491
so I want you to look into him,

356
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,493
try and find out
what he might be hiding.

357
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,703
Absolutely.

What do you want?

366
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,015
I need to see your books.

367
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,892
Without any foreplay?

368
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,561
Your boss has reported
an operating loss

369
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:54,728
for the last five years.

370
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,480
So?

371
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,482
So this club is
packed every night.

372
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,693
At 20 bucks an appletini,
it doesn't really add up.

373
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,073
You're Chloe's ex, right?

374
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:08,742
And you're Lucifer's
pet on a leash.

375
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,411
Now answer the question.

376
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,538
Well, technically,
that wasn't a question.

377
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,039
Is your divorce final yet?

378
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,207
That's none of your business.

379
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,835
Now, are you gonna
show me your records,

380
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,420
or do I need
to get a warrant?

381
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:20,421
We have nothing to hide.

382
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:21,547
That's great.

383
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,257
I'll be right here.

384
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,925
Mm-hmm.

385
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:27,386
Actually, the books
are in the office.

386
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:31,015
And there are way too many of
them to carry all by myself.

387
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:34,018
But if you come
out back with me,

388
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,270
I'll let you see
whatever you want.

389
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,314
Just the books is fine.

390
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,652

how did that make you feel?

396
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,597
Well, pissed off, of course.

397
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,933
Whatever was stolen from you
must have been very important.

398
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,517
No.

399
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,437
Actually, no, it's
the principle at stake here.

400
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:21,523
I mean, nobody steals from me
and gets away with it.

401
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,486
This loss brings up an issue
that we've been skirting

402
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:26,987
since we began
our work together.

403
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,281
Right.
Your identity.

404
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,575
It's still
the Devil, darling.

405
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:35,412
Yes, but who are you
trying so hard to become?

406
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,956
Nobody.

407
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,249
I'm completely unbecoming.

408
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,418
And yet you keep trying on
many hats to hide your horns.

409
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,671
Playboy, cop, club owner...

410
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,923
Yes, you forgot "master
of all things tongue-related."

411
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,008
Speaking of which,
shall we?

412
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,593
That's for later.

413
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:52,262
I think we're onto something
very important here.

414
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:56,016
One of the hardest
things we ever do...

415
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,518
is learn to be ourselves.

416
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:01,522
I want you to tell me
who you believe...

417
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,316
is the real you.

418
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:09,446
I...

419
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,116
I am...

420
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,412
...second-guessing
your skills as a therapist.

421
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,208
You're feeling judged.

422
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:23,794
So you're lashing out
and judging me.

423
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:24,795
But that's excellent.

424
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:26,171
It's transference.

425
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,381
Which means you seek
my approval.

426
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,091
I seek no one's approval.

427
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,261
And time's up.

428
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,804
Suddenly I'm no longer
in the amorous mood.

429
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:35,806
Okay, hold on...

430
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:37,683
Hold on, Lucifer.

431
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:41,228
You think that's a fight.

432
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:44,064
I think it's progress.

433
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:47,735
Or maybe I'm just realizing
what a waste of time this is.

434
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:57,870
I'm glad you came ba...

435
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,997
- Oh.
- Is everything okay?

436
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,999
It's-it's you. Hi.

437
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,002
I'm sorry, it's just,
uh, thin walls.

438
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,003
Oh.

439
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,254
Yes, everything's fine.

440
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,549
Uh, please.

441
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,469
Thanks again for drinks
the other night, Linda.

442
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,263
Uh, yeah.

443
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:17,681
Yes, that was fun.

444
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,767
Yeah.

445
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,437
All right, so what kind of
parent names their kid Lucifer?

446
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,899
I'm sorry, I don't mean to
be unprofessional, but...

447
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,609
We're colleagues.
Cone of silence.

448
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:31,487
And I don't believe
his real name is Lucifer.

449
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,406
We talk in metaphors.

450
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:35,741
Mmm.

451
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,077
Patients with delusions.

452
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,703
They can be really challenging.

453
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,081
Mm, he's actually
quite charming.

454
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,833
Yeah, but even Satan
disguises himself

455
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:46,293
as an angel of the light.

456
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:49,171
2 Corinthians,
chapter 11, verse 14.

457
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,297
Ah.

458
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,925
Two years of seminary school

459
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,594
before I decided I wanted to
help people in a different way.

460
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,805
Ah. Interesting.

461
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:01,475
I thought you seemed... pure.

462
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,354
Listen, you really helped me
with my patient the other day,

463
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,272
and I would love to
return the favor.

464
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,983
I know the Bible inside and out,

465
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,111
so if you ever need a consult,

466
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,279
just let me know.

467
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,225
Whoa.

468
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,768
Just quit
defending him, Mom.

469
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:47,062
You know Dan's
never gonna change.

470
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,691
Mm-hmm.

471
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,777
What's for dinner, Mommy?

472
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,863
Greens, you little cake monster.

473
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,865
Yeah.

474
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:00,868
I mean, I don't know why
I even bother telling you.

475
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:04,037
He's-he's not
gonna change, Mom.

476
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,414
You know, Dan's just
the way he is,

477
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,082
and I wasn't asking
for the world.

478
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,750
I just wanted
to see a little effort,

479
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,419
and it's probably too late.

480
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,798
Ah, it's pointless
to discuss this with you.

481
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:18,093
Why? Because you always
take his side.

482
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,597
Look, Mom, I...

483
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:23,974
- Daddy!
- Shh!

484
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,268
- Hey, Monkey!
- What are
you doing here?

485
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,354
And why are you wearing
a pillow?

486
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,565
Well, those are... that...
those are great questions,

487
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,901
and I'm gonna answer
both of them later.

488
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,236
But right now, I need you
to do something for me.

489
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:38,155
What?

490
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,782
Get me some clothes, and don't
tell Mommy that I'm here.

491
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,743
I thought you said
lying was a bad thing.

492
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:46,914
It is; it's terrible;
but this-this is different.

493
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,373
Because we're gonna
play a game.

494
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,500
It's called "Sneak Daddy
Out of the House."

495
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,252
That still sounds
like a lie.

496
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,173
You know,
it's complicated, Monkey.

497
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,592
You're just gonna have
to go with it, okay?

498
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,219
What's in it for me?

499
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,054
What do you want?

500
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,139
- Chocolate cake.
- Done.

501
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:07,267
- For a whole year.
- Absolutely not.

502
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,269
Mommy, I'm thirsty!

503
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,271
Okay, fine.

504
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,273
Done.

505
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,984
Now will you please
go get me some clothes?

506
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:24,910
What the hell
did you do to me?

507
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,287
What do you mean?

508
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,956
One second, I'm
standing here,

509
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,916
next second, I'm in
my ex's bed naked.

510
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,918
Well, you're welcome.

511
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,753
So,

512
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,296
did it work?

513
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:37,339
You two have sex?

514
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,007
No.

515
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,551
Why would you think
that putting me in her bed naked

516
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,178
would get us to have sex?

517
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:45,138
Always works for me.
And why would

518
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,682
you even want
Chloe and I to have sex?

519
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,600
So that you and her
will get back together,

520
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,018
and she'll be out
of Lucifer's life.

521
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:51,353
You're not
from around here, are you?

522
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,814
You have no idea.

523
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,732
You can't just smash two people
together like Barbies,

524
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,526
and think that that's
gonna fix things.

525
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,611
Relationships, they
take time and effort.

526
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,989
And you got to work at it,
like...

527
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,949
it's your job.

528
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:07,661
Humans are so exhausting.

529
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,955
Here are the books
you wanted to see.

530
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,040
Oh, no, we're not through here.

531
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,126
You assaulted a police officer.

532
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,211
I'm taking you in.

533
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,629
And what exactly

534
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:20,048
are you going
to say happened?

535
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,217
Hmm?

536
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,513
That a tiny female bartender

537
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:28,015
knocked you out,

538
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:29,808
stripped you naked

539
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,060
and put you in your ex's bed?

540
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,780
I can't explain it.

541
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,157
Lux's books are clean.

542
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:46,825
How is that even possible?

543
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,410
I had them run for discrepancies
with receivables.

544
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:49,453
I looked for
hidden payments.

545
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,371
Whatever Lucifer's into,

546
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,914
it's not running through Lux.

547
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,207
All right, thanks for trying.

548
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,502
Listen, Chloe...

549
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,046
I want to talk to you
about Taco Tuesday.

550
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,340
Hey, Dan,
I got to go.

551
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,802
Next time you secretly follow
someone, don't tailgate them.

552
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,512
Draws a little attention.

553
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:08,972
It's not my fault you drive
like an elderly turtle.

554
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,766
Lucifer...
go home.

555
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,059
Detective...

556
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,143
It sucks not getting
what you want.

557
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:14,186
Now you have
to deal with it

558
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:15,228
like the rest of us.

559
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,564
I'm sorry.

560
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:19,441
What did you just say?

561
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,735
I apologize.

562
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,236
I crossed the line this
morning with Mr. Snow Cone.

563
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:24,988
It was a mistake.

564
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:25,989
I realize that now.

565
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:27,574
Wow.

566
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:28,742
You must really be desperate.

567
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,410
I prefer determined.

568
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,245
Look, I need your help
to find my stuff.

569
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,915
But you have to admit
I've proven myself useful.

570
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,333
Despite the methods employed,

571
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,793
Frankie did give us
a solid lead.

572
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,419
Insanely wild guess,

573
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,213
but this is where we'll
find some Los Diablos.

574
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,923
There's an imprint
on the victim's neck

575
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,592
that we found under UV light.

576
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,719
Killer must've worn
some kind of bracelet

577
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,346
when he strangled
the security guard.

578
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,597
Cross look familiar?

579
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,226
Well, what do you know?

580
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,727
Our suspect awaits.

581
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,646
Shall we?

582
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,774
<i>♪ Don't let
our good thing go... ♪</i>

583
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,405
♪ Yes, and you
changed me, baby ♪

584
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,990
♪ Don't let
our good thing go... ♪

585
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:13,995
♪ And like a good man,
you can touch me ♪

586
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:16,623
♪ And we'll start all ov... ♪

587
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:17,624
What happened to the music?

588
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,750
- Hey!
- Come on, man!

589
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,168
What are you doing, man?

590
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:21,503
- What is this?
- What's going on here?

591
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:22,671
What's going on
with that?

592
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:24,840
Excuse me!

593
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:25,924
Pardon the intrusion,

594
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,468
you Village People rejects,

595
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,680
but one of you has stolen
something that belongs to me.

596
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:35,142
So please identify yourself,
so I can punish you accordingly.

597
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,604
Who do you think you are?

598
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,325
I thought we were past you
thinking you're invincible.

599
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,494
I really want to find my stuff.

600
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:55,745
What the hell
did you just say?

601
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,874
Hmm? Harry Potter?

602
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,917
There you go.

603
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:02,419
Mess him up, Renny.

604
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:03,879
Well, since you're
obviously lower

605
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,839
on the human
evolutionary chain,

606
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,841
perhaps your hearing hasn't
developed as well as it should,

607
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,217
so I'll repeat myself.

608
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,760
Who...

609
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:11,761
stole...

610
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,888
my...

611
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:13,930
property?

612
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:19,186
Everybody back the hell off
or you're going to jail.

613
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,779
Pardon my boys.

614
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,072
They don't always have
the best, uh,

615
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,908
people skills.

616
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,618
Take a breather, Renny.

617
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:35,660
Now!

618
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,413
Be cool.

619
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:39,623
Hank Cutter.

620
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,583
I'm in charge here.

621
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,920
Oh, a Mrs. Police.
How are you?

622
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,088
Why don't we chat
in my office, okay?

623
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:48,131
Follow me.

624
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,968
We heard that you
control the docks,

625
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,137
and if anything goes down,
Los Diablos are in on it.

626
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:56,389
Really? We're just
a riding club, okay?

627
00:25:56,598 --> 00:26:00,310
Whose members have been arrested
for guns, drugs, murder.

628
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,229
A few bad apples
shouldn't paint us all

629
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:03,605
in a bad light,
now should it, ma'am?

630
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,273
But it does paint you
as suspects.

631
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,150
Hey, look, just because we have
a reputation as outlaws

632
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,278
doesn't mean we had anything
to do with a murder.

633
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,532
You like being considered
a criminal, don't you?

634
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,660
Yeah, you do.

635
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:18,119
What else do you want?

636
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,126
To own a clothing line.

637
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,169
Oh.

638
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,337
Clothing line?

639
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:29,965
I-I did not see that one coming.

640
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:31,925
Yes, managing bikers
must be so exhausting.

641
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,969
All that brawling and pillaging.

642
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,845
I'm 54.
Really?

643
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,056
I'd rather be in my hammock
playing my Stratocaster.

644
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,141
All this motorcycle riding's
enlarged my prostate.

645
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,768
It's unpleasant.

646
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:43,520
That's an unfortunate
occupational hazard.

647
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,105
Tell me about it.

648
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:46,606
Look, we've trademarked
our name.

649
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:47,816
We're selling
T-shirts and jackets,

650
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:48,900
and we're gonna
re-brand and...

651
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,151
go legit.

652
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,778
"Legit."

653
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,863
There's a lot of money
in the apparel industry.

654
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,491
All the more reason
to keep our noses clean.

655
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,368
See, we used to cover the docks,
not anymore.

656
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:01,329
I specifically
ordered them off-limits.

657
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,956
Maybe someone missed
the re-branding memo.

658
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:06,167
Killer wore a bracelet
with an iron cross.

659
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,962
Left an imprint on the dead
security guard at the warehouse.

660
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:16,177
Look, uh, a lot of bikers
wear iron crosses.

661
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,888
Yeah, well, I'm interested in
your guys who have iron crosses.

662
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,893
Hey, look, I've told you
everything I know.

663
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,312
If you have any
more questions,

664
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,688
feel free to contact
my attorney.

665
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:27,689
But we're not finished yet.

666
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,941
Yeah, we're done.

667
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,651
Thank you.

668
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,867
<i>But why are we leaving?</i>

669
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,243
He's hiding something.

670
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:41,369
It's obvious.

671
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:42,829
We need to force
it out of him.

672
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,623
We have this little thing
called due process.

673
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:46,374
We can't just force things
out of people.

674
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,418
Besides, there's an easier way
to get our bad guy.

675
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,423
You saw the look on Cutter's
face when he saw that photo.

676
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,133
He knows exactly
who robbed the docks.

677
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,052
He's gonna need to deal
with this immediately.

678
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,220
Or it puts his plan
to re-brand in jeopardy.

679
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,722
Defying his orders--

680
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,599
it's a huge challenge
to his authority.

681
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,726
He's not gonna want to
deal with this in public.

682
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,227
Bet you the first
person he goes to see

683
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,896
is the owner of
that bracelet.

684
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,190
What, so your strategy
is just to sit here, paralyzed,

685
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,692
hoping that Cutter
leads us to the suspect?

686
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,069
What a terrible idea.

687
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:15,528
Hmm, you think so?

688
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,197
I do, I mean, for one,

689
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:18,365
even though Cutter's
no brain surgeon,

690
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:19,866
surely he wouldn't just--

691
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,076
Wouldn't what?

692
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,167
Well done, Detective.

693
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,675
A toast to Dr. Linda Martin,

694
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,760
therapist to the Devil himself.

695
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,555
I should put that
on the door.

696
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,599
Mm, well, it sounds
like he's dealing

697
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,351
with some genuine issues.

698
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,645
I'm just having such a hard time
getting through to him.

699
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,314
Maybe it's because you've
been humoring his metaphor

700
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,191
without fully embracing it.

701
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,652
You mean, completely accept
that he's actually the Devil?

702
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,404
Mm-hmm.

703
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,447
It's worth a try.

704
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:02,117
If only I knew someone who could
help me with the Bible.

705
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,162
I know so much about it,
it's almost as if I was there.

706
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,252
If he's positioning
himself as the Devil, right?

707
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,003
He must see himself as evil.

708
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:15,004
Mm!

709
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:16,131
No.

710
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,799
Actually, he's struggling.

711
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,593
I think he thinks
other people see him as evil.

712
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,430
You seem attached
to this patient.

713
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,098
I am...

714
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,976
very motivated to help him.

715
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:28,977
I see.

716
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,854
Well, um,

717
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:33,148
every culture in the world

718
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,775
and throughout history,
for that matter,

719
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,652
has its very own myth
of the Devil.

720
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,154
Mm-hmm.

721
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,406
But the one thing
that they all have in common

722
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,659
is that the Devil is
essentially a rebellious son.

723
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:45,952
Sounds like my guy.

724
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,454
I thought it might.

725
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:48,913
Now, if you're
really serious

726
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,540
about embracing
the metaphor, Linda--

727
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:53,585
truly embracing it--
I know how you can get to him.

728
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,670
But he might not like
what you have to say.

729
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:57,172
But will it help him?

730
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,341
He may not realize it,
but yes.

731
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,676
Then let's do it.

732
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:14,981
This is the longest

733
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,691
I've sat in a parked car
and not had sex.

734
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,401
Ew.

735
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:22,906
You can't enjoy this.

736
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:24,407
This sitting around endlessly,

737
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:27,076
waiting for something to happen.

738
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,078
You know, if sitting here
not being entertained

739
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:30,497
is so terrible,
then maybe it's a sign

740
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,915
you should be somewhere else.

741
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,416
Have I done something
to offend you?

742
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,085
Only every time I see you.

743
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:37,962
Ha, ha, ha.
No, this is different.

744
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,259
For the first time,
I don't think you're being

745
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:44,636
honest with me.
You have this

746
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,137
mysterious container
that was stolen

747
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,264
that someone was
willing to kill for.

748
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,809
You make shady deals
with shady people.

749
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,685
You're violent.

750
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:55,980
Your personal records only go
back five years, and the books

751
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:57,232
from Lux are way too clean.

752
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,566
It's...

753
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,276
I had Dan go and check it out.

754
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:02,737
You had Dan
deal with Maze alone?

755
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,322
Oh, dear.
For the first time,

756
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,407
I actually feel sorry
for Detective Douche.

757
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,743
It all points to you
being a criminal.

758
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,079
So what's the big deal?
What if I am a criminal?

759
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,622
I'd have to arrest you.

760
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,082
Ooh, whip out the cuffs, then.
Why shy away

761
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,625
from a little bondage fun?

762
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,627
You know, Lucifer,
this is serious.

763
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:18,962
And despite all
your weirdness

764
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,297
I...

765
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,675
I actually really like
working with you.

766
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:29,681
So, anyhow...

767
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,432
What a momentous

768
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,143
revelation, Detective Decker.
We should celebrate.

769
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,854
You can celebrate from jail

770
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:38,106
when it turns out
I'm right about you.

771
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,816
I have never lied to you.

772
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,317
And I will

773
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:43,319
never lie to you.

774
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:46,656
What was in the container?

775
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,829
Russian dolls.

776
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:54,664
Russian dolls?

777
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,049
Here we go.

778
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,013
Oh, I knew it was

779
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:11,347
gonna be that Renny guy.

780
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:12,515
About that warehouse...!

781
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:15,852
Think I won't?

782
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,689
This is Unit 831.

783
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:23,359
Shots fired at 21st and Lewis.
We need backup and an ambo, now.

784
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:25,236
...Unit 831,

785
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,155
all units in the vicinity...

786
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:53,848
♪ Get down, get down,
get down, get... ♪

787
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,266

788
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,820

795
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,476
♪ The night is my friend... ♪

796
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:46,818
Bloody mortality.

797
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:01,165
Been a while
since I had a good hunt.

798
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:09,132
That tingling sensation

799
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,134
running up your spine--
inevitability.

800
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,469
And the bit running
down your leg?

801
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,013
Fear.

802
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,417
Now...

803
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:47,837
you give me what is mine.

804
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,465
Wasn't my idea, I swear.

805
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:53,843
He didn't tell me
what was in the container.

806
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,889
But I looked.

807
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:00,683
I saw them.

808
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:03,311
Who stole them?

809
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,480
Oh, God...

810
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:08,149
Oh, God...

811
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,651
Who... stole them?

812
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,696
They were yours.

813
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:16,491
Who stole them?

814
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,159
I'm sorry.

815
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,161
I'm so sorry.

816
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:21,329
Oh...

817
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:23,331
you are gonna be more than sorry

818
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,833
unless you tell me
everything.

819
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,001
Please. Please, don't...

820
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,336
No!

821
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:29,670
No! No!

822
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:30,922
No, don't!

823
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:41,891
I couldn't stop him.

824
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:54,570
Take it.

825
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:58,574
Hey, you all right?

826
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,578
Looks like Cutter's
gonna make it.

827
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,288
He just gave a statement.

828
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:05,623
Cutter?

829
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:06,833
The guy Renny shot.

830
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,459
Renny was pissed
about the direction.

831
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,336
of the club; he thought
they were selling out.

832
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:11,921
So he went out on his own,

833
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,965
robbed the warehouse
and killed the security guard.

834
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:17,176
We got justice

835
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,262
for Erwin Scovell.
Wonderful.

836
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,682
And they've recovered
one container

837
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,267
belonging to...

838
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:25,685
a Lucifer Morningstar.

839
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:26,686
Where?

840
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,354
Inside.

841
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:29,939
You didn't take a sneaky peek
before telling me?

842
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,692
You'd never lie to me, right?

843
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:36,445
You're gonna watch me open it.

844
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:41,993
You're damn right.

845
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:20,531
Wow.

846
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,037
Hmm...

847
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,417
I told you.

848
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:43,387
Why go to all this trouble
for dolls?

849
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:44,889
Oh, come now, Detective.

850
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,266
I have to keep some
mysteries for myself.

851
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,357
Enjoy your dolls.

852
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:26,055
They're gone.

853
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:41,779
Want to grab that?

854
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:46,575
Hi, Daddy.

855
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,119
Hey, Monkey.

856
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:52,290
This is for after dinner, okay?

857
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,169
- Hey.
- Hey.

858
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,338
Thought you had
an important work thing.

859
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:01,257
Well, it wasn't as important

860
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:03,467
as having tacos with Trixie.

861
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:04,510
And you.

862
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:08,347
That is, if it's not too late.

863
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:09,765
Yeah.

864
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:11,976
We're just making the salsa.

865
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,811
Great.

866
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,315
That smells so yummy.

867
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:18,733
Oh, good.

868
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,860
<i>I'm glad you came back.</i>

869
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,361
Well, I needed to get
my parking validated.

870
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,823
So your items
were never recovered?

871
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:26,824
No.

872
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:28,492
Earlier, you said

873
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:31,287
that the items weren't
that important.

874
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:34,707
Yet now, you seem very upset
that they're gone.

875
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:36,042
Well, I'm a walking paradox.

876
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,878
What can I say?

877
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:40,463
Sometimes we need
to lose something

878
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:43,382
before we can
understand its value.

879
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:45,009
I didn't lose anything.

880
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,177
No.

881
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,887
No, you were
a victim of a crime.

882
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:51,015
It's only natural that
you would feel violated.

883
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,350
And often, our feelings of loss

884
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:53,851
connect to how we feel...

885
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,728
about who we are.

886
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,521
Oh, right.

887
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,023
So we're back on that, are we?

888
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,691
You want to talk
about my identity.

889
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,318
Yes, because you're the Devil.

890
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:03,652
You told me your names.

891
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:05,696
But you left out a few others.

892
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:07,031
Abaddon.

893
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,407
Belial.

894
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:10,242
Prince of Darkness...

895
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:11,994
- Someone's been brushing up
on their Sunday school.
- Yes.

896
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:14,038
But before you fell,
you were known as Samael.

897
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:16,832
The Lightbringer.

898
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:19,085
I don't go by that name anymore.

899
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:21,379
That was a name that connotated
your father's love for you.

900
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,839
Right.

901
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:26,050
Was casting his son into Hell

902
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:27,843
also an expression of his love?

903
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:29,637
Oh, God didn't cast you
out of Heaven

904
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,263
because he was angry with you.

905
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:34,392
How can you presume
to know God's intentions?

906
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,726
Oh, I don't.

907
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,061
I can't.

908
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,312
Then maybe stick
within the limits

909
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:39,438
of your intellectual capacity.

910
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:40,898
Or maybe my simplicity

911
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:42,566
offers me a different
perspective.

912
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,235
God cast you out

913
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,903
because He needed you

914
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:48,280
to do the most
difficult of jobs.

915
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:51,075
- It was a gift.
- Gift?

916
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:52,910
He shunned me.

917
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,245
He vilified me.

918
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,288
He made me a torturer!

919
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:00,251
Can you even begin to fathom
what it was like?

920
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:03,462
Eons spent

921
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,131
providing a place
for dead mortals

922
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,258
to punish themselves?

923
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,718
I mean, why do they blame me
for all their little failings?

924
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:12,388
As if I'd spent my days
sitting on their shoulder,

925
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,723
forcing them to commit acts
they'd otherwise find repulsive.

926
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:16,434
"Oh, the Devil made me do it."

927
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:18,561
I have never made any one
of them do anything.

928
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:19,770
Never.

929
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:22,273
What happened to you is unfair.

930
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,274
Unfair?

931
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:25,025
This is <i>unjust.</i>

932
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:27,695
For all eternity,
my name will be invoked

933
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,488
to represent
all their depravity.

934
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:32,408
That is the gift
that my father gave me.

935
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:33,451
It was an act of love.

936
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:34,952
How do you know?

937
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,121
Because you are
his favorite son, Samael.

938
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,123
Do not call me that, please!

939
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:40,958
You are his fallen angel.

940
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:41,959
But here's the thing:

941
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:43,419
When angels fall,

942
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,796
they also... rise.

943
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:47,089
All you have to do

944
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:50,134
is embrace all that you are.

945
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:52,011
I can't.

946
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,846
Yes, you can.

947
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:56,140
You just have to be open
to the process...

948
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,725
You don't understand.

949
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,643
- I can't!
- But why?

950
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:01,812
