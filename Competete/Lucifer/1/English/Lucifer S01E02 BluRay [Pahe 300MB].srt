<i>You're the Lord of Hell,</i>

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,006
for crying out loud.

4
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:07,258
Shouldn't you be spending
your valuable time

5
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,594
doing something
more significant?

6
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,305
I'm retired, Maze.
I've got nothing but time.

7
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:14,891
Your return to the Underworld
has been requested.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,018
Remind Dad that I quit Hell

9
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:19,521
because I was sick and tired
of playing a part in his play.

<i>We should be out there

11

12
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,360
We? How could you
possibly help me?

13
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:27,028
I have the ability

14
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:28,697
to draw out peoples'
forbidden desires.

15
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:30,740
I got it. I got it.
The name,

16
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,033
the whole Lucifer thing.

17
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:33,994
And desire is like
your superpower.

18
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,412
Mm, it's more like
a gift from God really.

19
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,038
You're thinking
about it, aren't you?

20
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:38,164
See, I wouldn't recommend it.

21
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:39,374
I'm like walking heroin.

22
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:41,001
Ah, you're the Devil.

23
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:42,419
Mm, correct.

24
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:51,219
Give me one second.

25
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:55,015
Please. Please
don't kill me.

26
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:56,182
You're gonna wish

27
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:57,559
that's all I did to you.

Something different about her

31
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:04,190
that I don't quite understand,
and it vexes me.

32
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,859
Maybe it's not her
that's different.

00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:12,365
but you're gonna have
to listen to me, too.

36
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:14,367
You know, just an existential
dilemma or two. Deal?

Oh, every morning
in the mirror, pal.

00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:00,914
Exactly!

55
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,415
He's in all of us!

63
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,769
Excuse me?

64
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,604
Yeah, uh, why don't you move
your shtick along.

65
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,439
Okay, I'm not sharing
my tips with you,

66
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:28,441
- if that's what you're
angling for.
- Oh.

67
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,401
Right. Is this
a performance?

68
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,278
Are you like the Chewbacca and
the Spider-Man down the street?

69
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:33,947
I have to say,
you're very good.

70
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,573
Yeah, so why don't you
go bother them.

71
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:36,783
You're bad for my business.

72
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,661
Repent! The Devil...

73
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,496
Isn't finished with you yet.

74
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,500
You see, what I hate
more than anything is a liar,

75
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,587
a charlatan, someone who doesn't
believe in what they say.

76
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,298
So what are you gonna do
about it?

77
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:55,093
Why, make you a believer,
of course.

78
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,473
S-S... uh, stay away!

79
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:01,724
He's the Devil!

80
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,434
You don't understand!

81
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:05,353
This isn't a performance!
He's the Devil!

82
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:06,980

Yes, thanks, everyone.

85
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,990
I'm, uh, here till, well, the
end of time, actually.

86
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,783
<i>- So you're the Devil.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

87
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:23,246
Yes. Well, Satan, Beelzebub,
Old Scratch.

88
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,331
Actually, I like that one
in particular.

89
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,667
But, uh, those were
the old me.

90
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,669
These days, you just have
plain old Lucifer.

91
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:33,381
And you've left Hell behind to
take a vacation in Los Angeles.

92
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,049
Well, where else would I go?

93
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:38,469
You don't seem too bothered

94
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,388
by my being
the Prince of Darkness.

95
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:43,141
I'm willing to work
within your metaphor.

96
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,893
Right.

97
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,895
Sometimes it's easier
to make intimate issues

98
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:49,397
about something
bigger than yourself.

99
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:51,524
Well, there are few things
bigger than myself.

100
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,860
I'm well aware.

101
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,405
Ah.

102
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:01,784
Last we spoke, you were bothered
about feelings of humanity.

103
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:04,245
I was, yes, but I have good news
for you on that front.

104
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:05,246
I'm healed.

105
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:06,831
Is that so?

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,917
Yes. Yes, back to my normal,
devilish self.

107
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,501
No pesky empathy to be found.

108
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,878
I'd kick a puppy

109
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,338
if one waltzed by.

110
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,381
I'm joking.
Puppies don't waltz.

111
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,051
You like to hide insecurity
in humor,

112
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,636
don't you?

113
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:20,762
I don't have insecurities.

114
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,097
Mm. Everyone does.

115
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:27,810
Very well.
I'll play your game.

116
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,729
What do you think
I'm insecure about?

117
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:32,232
That you <i>are</i> changing,

118
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,567
but that you don't know
what's causing the change.

119
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,361
Or who.

120
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:40,323
We'll pick this up next time.

121
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,283
What? Oh, very well.

122
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,911
A deal's a deal.
Though, why do I feel

123
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,913
like you're getting more
out of our bargain than I am?

124
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,081
Ooh! Hello!

125
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,458

This is from Lucifer?

145
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:32,208
He asked me to make you
something you'd like.

146
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,501
Did I get it wrong?

147
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:36,296
You and Lucifer
seem really close.

148
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:39,590
I followed him
through the gates of Hell.

I'll take that as a "yes."

150
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:05,283
Hello, Detective.

151
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,702
How has your
undercover surveillance

152
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,329
of my activities
gone so far?

153
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,372
I've looked into you.

154
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:13,833
Your name really is
Lucifer Morningstar.

155
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:16,711
And as far as I can tell,
you didn't exist five years ago.

156
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,129
On the earthly plane, no.

157
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:21,674
People don't appear
out of thin air.

158
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,426
Who were you?

159
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,512
How did you survive getting shot
six times by Jimmy Barnes?

160
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,640
Is that your normal reaction
to someone saving your life?

161
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,559
- Investigating them?
- When I see something

162
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,603
I can't explain, yeah,
I look for answers.

163
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,480
Well, I've given you the answer,
Detective. It's not my fault

164
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:36,481
you won't accept it.

165
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:37,482
Do you know what I think?

166
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,359
I stopped trying to guess.

167
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,152
I think you like me.

168
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:43,905
What part of the look on my face
gives you that impression?

169
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,907
No, no, no, it's not about
the face. It's about the eyes,

170
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,825
what's behind them.
I think you see

171
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,827
something that you truly desire,
and you...

172
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:51,496
you don't know
what to do with yourself,

173
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:54,040
do you?

174
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,875
Really?

175
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:57,210
Uh-huh.

176
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,546
- Hmm.
- That's more like it.

177
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:07,053
Detective, I never knew
you cared.

178
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,054
Mm.

179
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,264
Ooh.

180
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,399
No bulletproof vest.

181
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:20,900
What?

182
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:22,568
I just couldn't imagine
how you'd get it

183
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,237
under that suit,
but I had to check.

184
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,239
What is it? What is it?
What is it?

185
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,990
I'm gonna figure out
your secret, Lucifer.

186
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,535
Not a secret if I'm
telling you the answer!

187
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,703
It's...

188
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,872
Why don't I affect
you, Detective?

189
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,749
What makes you
different?

190
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,709
I guess we both
have our mysteries.

191
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:41,421
Ah. Well, I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

192
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,549
Oh, God, not
that again.

193
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:46,592
Decker.

194
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:49,554
Are you sure?

195
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,055
Yes.

196
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,141
Yes, um,
please send me the address.

197
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,309
I... I owe you one.

198
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,603
Oh, finally.

199
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,647
Now <i>that</i> affected you.
What was it?

200
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,442
Detective?

201
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:05,319
Detective?!

202
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,285
Come on. Active scene.

203
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,376
The victim was being
followed by a paparazzo.

204
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:21,794
Tried to lose his tail.

205
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,463
Instead, lost
control of his car.

206
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:24,755
Died on impact.

207
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:27,133
The paparazzo
following him was...?

208
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,843
Was Nick Hofmeister, yeah.

209
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,971
Who's the victim?

210
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,639
Robbie Russell Jr.

211
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,142
The son of the movie star?

212
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,144
He wasn't
in the business, was he?

213
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,146
Didn't stop everyone from
wanting pictures of him.

214
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,398
They're vultures.

215
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,025
You get a statement from Nick?

216
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,693
You can't be involved
in an active case

217
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,361
until you're off
medical leave.

218
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,115
Listen, I get why you
wanted to be here, I do.

219
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:53,242
But you have
to bring him?

220
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,291
You've got to be kidding me.

221
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,334
What are you doing here?

222
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,878
Oh! How's your ex?

223
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,172
He's not the reason
you rushed over here, is he?

224
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,673
Answer the question.

225
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,383
I'm trying to solve
my mystery, Detective.

226
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:12,178
If I don't affect you,
I'm curious as to what does.

227
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,139
Oh, and I think

228
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:16,641
I've just found my answer.

229
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,017
Who's that?

230
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:19,185
He's a paparazzo.

231
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,229
Oh. Had a little
run-in with him

232
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,814
during your <i>Hot Tub High School</i>
days, did you? Huh? Is that it?

233
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,816
Yeah, you could say that.
He's a cockroach.

234
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:28,194
But he'll figure a way
out of this. He always does.

235
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,862
You want to talk
to him, don't you?

236
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,197
Well, go on, then.
What's stopping you?

237
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,115
The rules? Huh?

238
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,408
Detective Douche?

239
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,369
If you desire something,
just take it.

240
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,412
Lucifer,
what are you doing?

241
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,165
Hello.

242
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,211
You finally did it, Nick.

243
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,338
You finally wanted a photo
so bad that you killed someone.

244
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:49,090
You're not gonna
get away with this.

245
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,341
I'm gonna make
sure of it.

246
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,468
You're right.

247
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:53,719
Say that again?
You're right.

248
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,304
I went too far.
I'll confess.

249
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:57,348
Okay.

250
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,725
Maybe he's less cockroach,
more dung beetle?

251
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:02,019
Police work
always this easy?

252
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:03,688
No. That's the problem.

253
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,065
Right. Well, do you mind
if I give it a whirl?

254
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:08,150
Tell me, dung beetle,

255
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,611
what is it you desire?

256
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:16,242
I... would like to confess.

257
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,160
Yes, yes, yes, but why?

258
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,537
Because I deserve it.

259
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,038
I've just done...

260
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,208
...so many terrible things,
you know?

261
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,044
I see it as my chance to-to...

262
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:28,045
Chance to what?

263
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,130
No. I...

264
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,008
I... If I tell you,

265
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,884
- he's just gonna...
No. Just...
- He? Who?

266
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:34,969
Would you please make him stop?

267
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,095
- Who? He who?
- Him.

268
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:37,680
- Tell him.
- What are you hiding?

269
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,682
- What are you doing? Hey.
- You said "he." Who?

270
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,350
Neither one of you are supposed
to be here. Especially you.

271
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,393
Come on.

272
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:44,020
All right. Temper, temper.

273
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,442
Right. Well, that's done.

274
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,110
No.

275
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,820
If Nick's covering for someone,

276
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,697
that means the real murderer
is still out there.

277
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,449
Yes, plenty of murderers
are out there, Detective.

278
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,909
You heard the man.
He deserves the punishment.

279
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,953
At least he's
getting it.

280
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,747
But that's not enough
for you, is it?

281
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,290
You hate that
dung beetle.

282
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,626
Are you really gonna try
and prove his innocence?

283
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,587
I'm gonna find out
who really killed this kid.

284
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,255
So that's a yes.

285
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,174
Wow, aren't you
full of surprises.

286
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,638
Well, where do we begin?

287
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:39,075
You think Nick Hofmeister
is innocent? You?

288
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,743
He confessed, Dan.

289
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,119
Nick wouldn't confess
to a parking ticket,

290
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:43,120
let alone a murder.

291
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:44,789
It just sounded like

292
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,582
- he was covering for someone.
- So wait.

293
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,794
First he confessed, then he
told you he didn't do it?

294
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,462
Well, he didn't want to.

295
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:54,423
You know, Lucifer, um...
...made him.

296
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,425
Do I even want to
know what that means?

297
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:57,760
Look, he was about
to tell us more

298
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,053
before you came
and took him away, Dan.

299
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,805
You know what, his
car is at the scene.

300
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,556
He confessed.
I know.

301
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,141
Is this the fight
that you want to pick?

302
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,768
Just promise me
you'll look into it.

303
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:07,687
I'll do my job.

304
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,021
Go home.

305
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,648
Okay.

306
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,982
And take your weird
club-owner sidekick with you

307
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,026
- before I arrest him.
- For what?

308
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,070
Let's start with smoking
pot at a crime scene.

309
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,615
Uh, sorry, do
you want a hit?

310
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:21,742
N-No.

311
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:23,661
It's "puff, puff, pass," not
"puff, puff, stomp angrily."

312
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,162
You brought pot
to a crime scene?

313
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:26,497
I most certainly did not.

314
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:27,498
I found it here.

315
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:28,999
You found it?

316
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,501
You found it here
at a crime scene?

317
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,669
Yes, in the dung beetle's car.

318
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,462
You smoked evidence?

319
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,381
Well, it would've gone
to waste otherwise.

320
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,966
That's really good stuff
you just ground under your heel.

321
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,469
Wow.

322
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,263
Any sign he'd recently lit up?

323
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,597
Well, there was a... a roach
from another joint,

324
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,099
freshly smoked.

325
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:46,142
Nick's pupils
weren't dilated.

326
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,685
He didn't seem high.

327
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,687
Maybe he wasn't alone.
Where's the roach?

328
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,105
Well, I added it to my joint.

329
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,525
Well, it's the best part.

330
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:56,777
So our only evidence is
currently in your lungs?

331
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:58,988
Uh, you really wanted to say
"up in smoke" then, didn't you?

332
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:02,032
No. No, I most definitely
did not.

333
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,367
Right, so what should we do now?

334
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:04,618
I mean, we could
head back to Lux.

335
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:05,870
I'm sure there's some stragglers

336
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:07,705
we could get
into trouble with, huh?

337
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,874
I'm good, thanks.

338
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,375
More for me, then.

00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:50,539
Bloody hell.

346
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,876
Brother,
I'm disappointed in you.

347
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,795
What?

348
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,088
It's called a devil's
threesome for a reason.

349
00:13:58,297 --> 00:13:59,757
You were once
the brightest of

350
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,759
all of God's
angels, Lucifer.

351
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,094
And now, look at you.

352
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,429
Look, if you've come
to lecture me,

353
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:06,680
can you just save it for later?

354
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,432
I'm annoyingly sober
right now,

355
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,100
and it takes ages to pour
a drink when you're around.

356
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,435
Actually, I'm here
with an offer.

357
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:12,436
Really?

358
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:13,437
Go back to Hell, Lucifer,

359
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:14,563
and I will speak to Father.

360
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:15,731
You're scared, aren't you?

361
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,316
That if I don't go back to Hell,

362
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,609
you're gonna
have to take over.

363
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:20,611
Oh, that would never happen.

364
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,113
Oh, no, no, I mean, it's not
like God sent his favorite son

365
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,782
to reign over Hell before,
is it?

366
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,450
Oh, wait, sorry.

367
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,785
Forgot.

368
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,119
So you can take your ultimatum

369
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,121
and shove it
up your feathered hole.

370
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,588
You can't see it yet, can you?

371
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:41,382
What's that?

372
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,800
You saved a human life, Luci.

373
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,469
And not for
any selfish reasons.

374
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:48,931
No, you did it simply because
you cared about that detective.

375
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:54,979
Your time here on Earth
is affecting you, dear brother.

376
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:55,813
You're changing.

377
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,148
My life is change.

378
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,651
"The same thing over and over,"
that's your boring motto.

379
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,362
True, but usually you're the one
controlling the change.

380
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:06,824
This time, you're not.

381
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,285
Now, does that
scare you?

382
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,036
Because it should.

383
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,665
You know, I am tired of
your dire warnings, all right?

384
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:17,626
So just go rattle your saber
in someone else's face.

385
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,339
You think about my offer.

386
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,174
When you've made
a decision,

387
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,968
you know how to find me.

388
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:49,700
Hey, Robbie,
where you been?

389
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:51,243
If you're gonna follow me,

390
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,037
maybe I can do
something good with this.

391
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,373
This... is the Web site
for the Red Cross.

392
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,709
Give blood, volunteer.

393
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:00,711
Don't be like
the asshat filming this.

394
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,379
Good job, kid.

395
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:03,505
Better than I did.

396
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,174
Mommy?
Yeah, baby?

397
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,384
Are you looking at a no-no site?

398
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:08,886
No. Why would
you think that?

399
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,888
Because you put it away
so fast,

400
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,890
and you look
really, really guilty.

401
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,516
No, baby, I'm just
doing police work.

402
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,393
I thought you weren't
supposed to be working.

403
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,562
And I thought you were
supposed to be getting ready

404
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:20,564
to hang out with your dad.

405
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,816
Who is early,
apparently.

406
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:27,279
Do you really
live here?

407
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:28,989
I thought I must have gotten
the wrong address.

408
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,075
How do you afford
this place?

409
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,534
Do you take bribes?

410
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,078
I don't.
And what are you doing here?

411
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,162
Lucifer!

412
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:37,748
Ah, hello again,
small human.

413
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,876
Uh, this-this
is yours, yes?

414
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,045
Yeah, that's Molly McDowell.

415
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,421
She's a ballerina by day,

416
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,340
but a ninja chemist by night.

417
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,800
When a simple yes
would've sufficed.

418
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,259
Right, on you go, then.
Go on, fetch away.

419
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,346
Well, go on, then.

420
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,682
Uh, is this too
advanced for her?

421
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,225
You're funny.

422
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,894
Trixie, babe, come on.

423
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,896
Get ready.

424
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:03,273
You need to leave now.

425
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,943
I had no idea that <i>Hot Tub
High School</i> paid so well.

426
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,278
It didn't. And can you
shh on the <i>Hot Tub?</i>

427
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,446
She doesn't know.

428
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,115
What, that her mom
was a giant star?

429
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,616
Why not?

430
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,284
Not 'cause of the old...?

431
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,079
Yeah. And can you
never do that again?

432
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:20,040
Right, sorry.
So how do you afford this place?

433
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,583
I don't; it's my mother's.

434
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,752
I moved in after Dan
and I separated, okay?

435
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:26,714
Penelope Decker?

436
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:27,965
Hold on a minute.

437
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,967
Your mother's
Penelope Decker?

438
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,635
- Queen of '80s
cheeseball sci-fi?
- Yeah.

439
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,971
You have
to introduce me.

440
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,639
Mm, I don't.

441
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,433
And I probably won't.

442
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,809
So you're part of a
family dynasty like me.

443
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:40,019
No wonder we
get on so well.

444
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,020
How did you rebel?

445
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,604
What do you mean?

446
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,231
Well, you're mad
at the dung beetle.

447
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,066
You must have done something
salacious in your youth.

448
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,235
What was it?
Did you kiss a
girl and like it?

449
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:49,570
I don't want to talk about it.

450
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,821
Oh, so there
is something.

451
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,822
Two girls?

452
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:53,532
- Okay.
- An Eiffel Tower?

453
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:57,202
What's an Eiffel Tower?

454
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,246
It's marvelous. It's when two
chaps high-five at the top,

455
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,790
- then the young lady...
- Okay, there is
an eight-year-old in the room

456
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,083
who doesn't need to hear
about an Eiffel Tower.

457
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,835
What...? What
about the case?

458
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:07,504
If I were secretly working
on it, having you around

459
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:09,631
- drawing attention won't
be good, would it?
- Well, maybe not,

460
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,300
but it'd be much more fun,
wouldn't it, Detective,

461
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,426
if we carried on
working together?

462
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,136
Detective?

463
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,347
Detective?

464
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,016
Mm-hmm.

465
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,684
I understand.

466
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,686
Mm-hmm.

467
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:24,271
Hello, there.

468
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,356
I'd very much like to
see Nick Hofmeister.

469
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,692
I'm afraid I can't... Oh.

470
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,820
Hello.

471
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,155
Hello to you.

472
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,323
Hello?

473
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,162
Afternoon, dung beetle.

474
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,707
We need to talk.

475
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,961
I, um, I'm not gonna
tell you anything, man.

476
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,963
No, no, no, I don't want
to know about the case,

477
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:53,175
so you can keep your
dirty little secrets.

478
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,469
No, I'd like to know
about Chloe Decker.

479
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:59,264
And you're gonna
tell me everything.

480
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,187
I have an effect
on people.

481
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,397
It's a way of
pulling out their

482
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,942
deepest desires,
revealing the truth within.

483
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,568
It works on everyone.

484
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:13,237
Everyone except
for Chloe Decker.

485
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:14,822
And I suspect it's
somehow related

486
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,990
to my recent bouts
of humanity.

487
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,450
What does this
have to do with me?

488
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,827
Well, you know everything
about her, don't you?

489
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,453
All her sordid secrets.

490
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,247
I'm hoping they'll
help me understand

491
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,749
why she's so frustratingly
immune to my charms.

492
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,001
Chloe doesn't have
any sordid secrets.

493
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,714
I've seen the hatred in her
eyes when she looks at you.

494
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:33,966
Come on.

495
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,384
You must have
something.

496
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,386
Do you know what happened
when she was 19?

497
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,054
She starred in
<i>Hot Tub High School</i>

498
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,014
and revealed her rather
spectacular assets to the world.

499
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,350
Right.

500
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,686
And two weeks later,
her father died.

501
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:48,689
Oh.

502
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,357
Yeah, so I knew,
of course,

503
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,359
everyone in the world
was gonna try to get

504
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,028
a... shot of them
leaving the funeral.

505
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:58,407
And I really...
I really wanted to be first.

506
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,409
Oh, dung beetle,
tell me you didn't.

507
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,910
Yeah, I crashed
the funeral.

508
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,205
And... she...
oh, she flipped out.

509
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:06,957
But I got my photo.

510
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,709
Right when
she punched the lens.

511
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,587
I mean, right then-- it cracked
the lens right in half.

512
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,630
- I made so much money
off that photo.
- I'm sure.

513
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,262
Yeah, but at what cost
to my soul, right?

514
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,100
And that'll be
for someone else to decide.

515
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:26,727
Yeah.

516
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,270
Well, that someone else
is sitting opposite you,

517
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,271
and it's not looking good.

518
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,939
I crossed a line.

519
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,608
And I knew it.

520
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,109
And after that,
I just did everything I could

521
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:35,736
to keep others from making
the same mistakes I did.

522
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,321
That's why I...

523
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,867
Why what?

524
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,410
- No, it's...
- You want to tell me.

525
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,120
- It's nothing.
- Who are you protecting

526
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,622
- from following
in your footsteps?
- I can't.

527
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,249
- It's... I just... I can't.
- You want to tell me, don't you?

528
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,251
- I really can't.
- You want to tell me.

529
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,461
Who are you protecting?

530
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:53,545
Who are you
protecting?

531
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:54,796
How are you doing this, man?

532
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,131
Look at me.

533
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,633
Who are you protecting?

534
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,509
Please, just...

535
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,969
- Look at me. Look at me.
- I won't. I won't.

536
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:01,970
- I can't.
- Look at me!

537
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,305
Leave me alone!

538
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,983
I already spoke to the
police about my son Robbie.

539
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:17,819
I don't know what
else there is to say.

540
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,155
I'm just following up.

541
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,532
I want to make sure there aren't
any suspects we overlooked.

542
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,952
But I was told Nick
Hofmeister confessed.

543
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,787
He did.

544
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,665
Mr. Russell,

545
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:32,960
I, um...

546
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,962
I don't think
Nick killed your son.

547
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,964
What?

548
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,674
Are you... Is this a joke?

549
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,884
I'm sorry.

550
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,555
Y-You just don't know

551
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,475
what Robbie went through
because of my work.

552
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,727
Now he's dead because of me.

553
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,562
No.

554
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,982
You know, my mom is
Penelope Decker.

555
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,526
So I was followed by paparazzi
all my life,

556
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,528
just like Robbie.

557
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,697
But, you know,
that wasn't my mom's fault.

558
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,907
And you got to know,
it's not your fault either.

559
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:05,284
The only person you can blame

560
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,077
is whoever ran your son
off the road.

561
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,538
I want to make sure
we get the right guy.

562
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,207
And I'm telling you,
I don't think Nick is him.

563
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,712
There was one other paparazzo.

564
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,297
Did you get a name
or a description?

565
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:19,798
No, I didn't.

566
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,758
Because Robbie
only noticed him once.

567
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,094
That's why I never
mentioned him before.

568
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:26,430
Thank you.

569
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,891
Excuse me.

570
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:34,855
Decker.

571
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:38,400
He did what?

572
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:48,910
What is wrong with you?

573
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:51,913
Nothing is
wrong with me.

574
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:54,291
I was hoping for sexy,
salacious details,

575
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,753
and instead I got taken on
a trip down depression lane.

576
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,713
You feel bad

577
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,590
for invading her privacy?

578
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,925
You're the Lord of Hell.

579
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,721
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but Amenadiel is right.

580
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:09,973
You are changing.

581
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,266
I don't mind

582
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,601
the odd smart-assed remark,
Maze.

583
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:13,977
They can be quite amusing.

584
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,812
But don't you dare
disrespect me.

585
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,023
Or what?

586
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,067
You'll cry really hard
on my shoulder?

587
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,277
You will not speak to me
this way!

588
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,656
There he is.

589
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,995
How did you get into
Nick's holding cell?

590
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,622
And there he goes.

591
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,165
Oh, sorry.

592
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:38,126
Am I interrupting some
creepy foreplay you two have?

593
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,629
How did you get into
Nick's holding cell?

594
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,130
Why, by asking
very nicely, of course.

595
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,965
Something you should
try sometime.

596
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:46,676
This case has nothing
to do with you.

597
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,136
Why won't you
leave it alone?

598
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,846
Why won't you?

599
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,973
Did you learn something,
at least?

600
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:55,143
Yes. I did, actually.

601
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,978
Our dung beetle
is protecting

602
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:59,815
someone who's following
in his footsteps.

603
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,316
Protégé, perhaps.

604
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,652
I found out someone else
was following Robbie,

605
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,986
and someone's been
uploading photos online

606
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,322
today from Nick's company.

607
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:09,157
Last one was posted
an hour ago

608
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,701
from a party
that's still happening.

609
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,412
Our killer could be there.

610
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,830
Right.

611
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,373
Are you coming or what?

612
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:17,833
Oh, sorry, I thought this was

613
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,209
the part where you
leave me behind

614
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:20,335
and say something like,
"Lucifer, stay.

615
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:21,753
Good devil."

616
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,505
I'd rather
keep my eye on you.

617
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:26,842
♪ Tell me what you like ♪

618
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,511
♪ Tell me
what you like ♪

619
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,638
♪ Tell me what you like ♪

620
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,181
♪ Tell me
what you like... ♪

621
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,316
So how do you plan on catching
our murderous protégé anyway?

622
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,694
Well, I was thinking,
what if he never left

623
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,195
the scene of the crime?

624
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,030
What, and instead blended in
with the other paparazzi

625
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,198
taking photos?

626
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,366
That's quite clever.

627
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,493
Yeah, so if
we recognize anyone

628
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,036
from the crash,
it could be our guy.

629
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,079
Right.

630
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,876
Are you okay?

631
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,294
I'm fine.

632
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:03,336
Why?

633
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,923
Oh, Nick told you
what happened, didn't he?

634
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,550
He did.

635
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,219
Got to hear all about
your wicked right hook.

636
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,804
Oh, yeah.

637
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,973
He also told me
it was a low point for him.

638
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:16,600
Which I believe, actually.

639
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:19,144
Yeah, I think our dung
beetle, of all things,

640
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:22,147
desires redemption for
what he did to you.

641
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,399
Yeah, well, he's not
going about it the right way,

642
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:25,400
that's for sure.

643
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:27,068
Yes, well, we all know

644
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,112
what the road to Hell
is paved with, don't we?

645
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:32,699
Hello, hello, hello.

646
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,409
There's a familiar face.

647
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:36,953
Yeah, from the
crime scene this morning.

648
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,539
I remember him.

649
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:40,582
And he's spectacularly
creepy as well,

650
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,042
so that's a bonus.

651
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,043
Hey, everybody,
it's Chloe Decker!

652
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,544
Penelope Decker's daughter!

653
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,005
- Chloe, look over here!
- Guys...

654
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:48,840
- Back off.
- Chloe Decker!

655
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,300
- Hey, show me your boobs!
- Hey, show us your boobs, Chloe!

656
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,302
Back off,
you mouth-breathing scaven...!

657
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,387
Well, go on then, punch him!

658
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:55,472
Come on, let's punch them all!

659
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,599
It's not me anymore.

660
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:01,269
Well, it's still very much me.

661
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:02,979
You, Friar Tuck,

662
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,982
tell me, is this depravity
really all you want out of life?

663
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,400
Hmm?

664
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:11,655
I want to win a Pulitzer
for photography.

665
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:12,822
Pulitzer?

666
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,283
Really?
Do you hear that, chaps?

667
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,077
Yeah, they don't give out
Pulitzers for nip slips.

668
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,635
He's gone.

669
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:42,394
Oh, boy.

670
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:44,145
It's not that bad, is it?

671
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,982
Trixie's classmates
all have the Internet.

672
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,109
One of them's gonna
figure out that her mom is

673
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,111
the top story on their
favorite gossip site.

674
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,655
She's finally gonna find out
about <i>Hot Tub High School.</i>

675
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,615
Great.

676
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,200
If it's any consolation,
you look really good in it.

677
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,952
Thanks.

678
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,745
Why do I feel like
you're cheering me up

679
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:01,955
for even worse news?

680
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:03,999
Nick's sticking to his story.

681
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,542
It's an open-
and-shut case,

682
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,877
but I can't help it
if a rogue detective

683
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:09,921
won't leave well
enough alone.

684
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,217
Oh, you ran the plate number
I gave you.

685
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,927
Yes, ma'am, I did.

686
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,637
It was registered to Nick--
one of his company cars.

687
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,014
Like the one
that ran Robbie off the road?

688
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,056
Exactly.

689
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,850
Did a little
more digging.

690
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,893
Guy's name is Josh Bryant.
He freelances for Nick.

691
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,312
Thanks.

692
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,524
Why are you doing this?

693
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,401
Because I think
you're onto something.

694
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,487
So go figure it out while
I buy you some time.

695
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:37,699
And... be careful.

696
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,868
All right?

697
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:57,260
Oh, sorry. Did I ruin
your creepy little moment?

698
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:02,599
I am so happy to see you.

699
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,684
I felt so bad
about what happened.

700
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,102
I'm a huge fan.

701
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:07,270
<i>Hot Tub High School</i>

702
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,772
was my favorite growing up.

703
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,565
Yes, we're really
not interested

704
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:11,941
in your formative
spank bank years, all right?

705
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,985
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

706
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,071
I would've done something,
but I'm not good with violence.

707
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,530
Mm.

708
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:18,948
Well, lucky for us,
we found you anyhow.

709
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,950
You were looking for me? Why?

710
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,745
Because she wants justice
for Robbie Russell Jr.

711
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,372
What is it you want, Josh?

712
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,707
Hmm?

713
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,834
To be first.

714
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,378
To always be first.

715
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:32,796
Really?

716
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,924
What, did Nick teach you that?

717
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:37,592
To be first?

718
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,636
Yeah. I learned a lot
working for him.

719
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:40,929
He's my idol.

720
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,639
He's the best pap out there.

721
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:44,974
So you took photos of your idol
being arrested for murder?

722
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,727
I didn't know what else to do.

723
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,020
Other than
what Nick would've done.

724
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:50,480
Which is to be first,
no matter what.

725
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:51,606
Of course.

726
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,900
Just a second.

727
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,161
You like smoking pot, Josh?

728
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,163
It's for my nerves.
I have a prescription.

729
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:11,501
Oh!

730
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,544
Hello.

731
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,048
Good timing on that photo.

732
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,342
Just lucky I guess.

733
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:24,305
Far be it for me

734
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,141
to call someone's morality
into question, but...

735
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,018
I believe that
photo was planned.

736
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,688
Yeah.

737
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:34,315
Makes me wonder
what else was.

738
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,319
Look at this.

739
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:39,821
Celebrity
shouting matches,

740
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,239
fistfights.

741
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:42,741
Josh had the first photo
on every one.

742
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:44,159
It escalates.

743
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,327
Overdose. Suicide.

744
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,121
- Or so it appeared.
- Well, I suppose

745
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:50,123
the best way to be first is
to know it'll happen beforehand.

746
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:53,251
So he follows Robbie, intent on
running him off the road,

747
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,421
but doesn't count on his own car
running off as well.

748
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,339
This is cold,
premeditated murder.

749
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:00,008
- Mm.
- Nick's a slimeball.

750
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:02,135
I just... I don't think
he'd go this far.

751
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:04,596
Which means Josh maybe
convinced him to take the fall.

752
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:05,722
The question is: why?

753
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,307
Well, who cares?

754
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,309
We know Josh is guilty.
Let's punish him.

755
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,895
Ah, I could add an ironic twist,
like I used to when I ran Hell.

756
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:13,688
Yeah, no,
it doesn't work that way,

757
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:14,898
because I need evidence.

758
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:16,858
Well, you have plenty.

759
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,109
Circumstantial.

760
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:19,444
I need concrete proof.

761
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:20,612
I'm gonna talk
to Nick...

762
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,197
Boring, boring,
boring, boring!

763
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,407
You don't decide who
gets punished and how.

764
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:25,700
That's exactly what I do.

765
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,202
No, no, you don't.

766
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,245
This is how it
works, Lucifer.

767
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,130
Whatever speech
you have brewing, Maze,

768
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,800
I don't want to hear it.

769
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:45,678
I think I've said
everything I need to.

770
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,182
You're right.

771
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,391
And I agree.

772
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,519
Let's go deliver
some punishment.

773
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,527
We believe Josh may be
a very disturbed individual.

774
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:04,697
God.

775
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,282
He caused all these?

776
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,117
Yeah. All of them.

777
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:10,745
I can't believe it. I...

778
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:13,206
Tell me what really
happened, Nick.

779
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:19,212
I took Josh in
when he was 16.

780
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,547
He was a runaway.

781
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:23,758
He was a little broken.

782
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:29,264
In him, I saw a little bit
of who I used to be.

783
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:32,433
At least, I thought I did.

784
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,269
So I took him under my wing.

785
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,771
He was a natural.

786
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,274
Taught him about all the lines
a pap can't cross.

787
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,026
You know, 'cause I just...
I just wanted him to stop

788
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:44,445
making the same mistakes
I did.

789
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:45,446
Mm.

790
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,448
And then, two days ago,

791
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:50,034
he calls me up, says he's been
in a really bad accident,

792
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:51,953
and said that
he totally understood

793
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,330
everything I was saying now.

794
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,207
But it was too late.

795
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,251
You know, someone was dead.

796
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,044
So you took the fall,

797
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:02,964
hoping that Josh would get
a chance at a new life.

798
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:04,716
Yeah.

799
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,175
Nick Hofmeister finally tries to

800
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:07,802
do something good with his life,

801
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,221
and he gets played.

802
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,432
You must really be
enjoying this.

803
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,684
I'm really not.

804
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,770
Believe it or not,
I forgive you.

805
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:20,273
This isn't about you,
this isn't about me.

806
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,066
This is about
Robbie Russell.

807
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,903
You know, he was a kid who
didn't ask to be famous.

808
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,322
He just wanted to
live a normal life.

809
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,201
Nick, if you don't testify,
Josh will do this again.

810
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,538
He'll do it again.

811
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,543
Excuse me.

812
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,378
Oh. Just a second.

813
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,465
Hey, Dan,
this better be important.

814
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,175
I think Nick's about to talk.

815
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:51,471
No, I'm not following Josh. Why?

816
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,723
What do you mean he's missing?

817
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,273
Desk Sergeant?

818
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:04,317
Yes, Detective?
Where did Nick Hofmeister go?

819
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,693
Did somebody get him?

820
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,362
Why, yes.

821
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,405
It was that tall,
handsome British fella.

822
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:11,491
Oh, no. I did it, too,

823
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,159
didn't I?

824
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:39,060
Oh, I respect what
you do, dung beetle.

825
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,979
Much as celebrities hate you,

826
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:44,607
you know, they need you,
keep them in the limelight.

827
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:47,360
You're a...
a necessarily evil.

828
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,362
Something I understand
all too well.

829
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,739
But the-the trouble is
that you tried to change.

830
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:52,907
Yeah?

831
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,535
And you failed
spectacularly at it.

832
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:59,539
Because, well,
sometimes we are what we are,

833
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,791
and we should
embrace that.

834
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,587
What are we doing
back here exactly?

835
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,047
And do you need me to...?

836
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,966
Maze!

837
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:12,468
Did you bring me my gift?

838
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:29,235
I'll kill you,
you crazy bitch.

839
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:31,988
Just be polite to the lady.

840
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,032
She isn't your enemy tonight.

841
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,952
What is this?

842
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,413
Right, well, both of you have
committed terrible acts

843
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:41,789
worthy of punishment.

844
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:42,999
However, you
will not receive

845
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:44,459
said punishment
when you die.

846
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,461
It's my fault, really. Sorry.

847
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:48,296
So I'm here to fix that.

848
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:49,922
Right now.

849
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,511
Oh. Amateurs.

850
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,013
All right, very well,
in terms you'll understand.

851
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,641
You both get a gun.

852
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,811
Let's see
who shoots who first.

853
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,029
What's to stop us
from shooting you?

854
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,323
Well, despite the waste
of bullets, let's see.

855
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,450
He's about to rat you out
to the police.

856
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:20,995
And he tricked you into
taking the fall for a murder

857
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:22,288
he committed.

858
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:23,664
Discuss.

859
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,336
You really did it, didn't you?

860
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:30,004
You killed people.

861
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,842
You lost your touch, Nick.

862
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,720
All this talk about
lines we can't cross.

863
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,972
Nowadays, the only way
to be first

864
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,391
is to realize that
there <i>is</i> no line.

865
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,352
And you were almost

866
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,687
begging to take the fall.

867
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,564
That one dramatic gesture.

868
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:51,359
As if that would erase the fact
that you've been a piece of crap

869
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,319
- for the last 30 years.
- You can't do this.

870
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:55,446
I treated you
like a son.

871
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:00,576
Oh, Maze,

872
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,203
you fiend.

873
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,080
Even I didn't see
that one coming.

874
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:05,665
You really would've killed me.

875
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:15,133
Nick...

876
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,552
I made a mistake, okay?
I realize that now.

877
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,012
And I'm sorry.
Stop!

878
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,097
Don't shoot him!

879
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,391
Detective,

880
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,392
you're interrupting
my punishment.

881
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,977
You, don't talk.

882
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,436
You're lucky
I figured out your insane,

883
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:28,604
ironic punishment
before anyone got killed.

884
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:31,065
Nick, you tried
to do some good,

885
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:32,900
to help someone.
Don't throw it all away.

886
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,027
Nick, embrace
who you really are.

887
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,779
Stop fighting it.
Come on.

888
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:37,905
Don't listen to him, Nick.
You tried to change.

889
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:39,115
Yeah.

890
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,034
- And look what happened.
- Yeah.

891
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:43,744
You screwed up,
but you know what? It's okay.

892
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:45,163
You tried to change.
That's what's important.

893
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:47,248
Humans.

894
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,834
Fascinating, aren't they?

895
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,086
Do you know,
perhaps they're onto something.

896
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:54,380
Nick... don't.

897
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,773
I was surprised
to hear from you, Lucifer.

898
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,776
Well, not as surprised as I was.

899
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,945
But I wanted to tell you
you were right.

900
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:20,489
Hmm. Is that a joke?

901
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:22,450
No, I wish it were.

902
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,286
But, no, you were right,
and I was wrong.

903
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,250
So you'll return to Hell?

904
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,127
What? No!

905
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:35,087
That is absurd.

906
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:37,173
No, you're right that
I've changed in my time here,

907
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:39,091
and that I have absolutely
no control over it.

908
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,844
And you know what?

909
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:48,017
That feels positively thrilling.

910
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:50,895
You asked me here
to tell me that?

911
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,105
No, no, no,
I thought

912
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:54,982
I'd use you to remedy a
situation that I've mishandled,

913
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:57,652
and annoy you in the process.

914
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,862
Kill two birds with one
prayer sort of thing, hmm?

915
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:02,615
Luci...

916
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,533
you should've taken the offer.

917
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:07,119
Oh.

918
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,804
You're looking
for someone?

919
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:29,058
But...

920
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:30,851
you were just
over there.

921
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,146
That's... that's
impossible.

922
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:54,000
Yes?

923
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,960
I saw Nick pull
the trigger.

924
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,838
I heard the gunshot,
but Josh wasn't shot.

925
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:01,090
Did you put blanks
in the guns? Like...

926
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:03,843
Was this some staged thing to
get a confession out of Josh?

927
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,554
That's probably more plausible
to you than my angelic brother

928
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,848
slowing time while I pluck
a bullet out of thin air,

929
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:11,183
isn't it?

930
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:13,602
Even with all that,

931
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:15,980
you were standing
right in front of me.

932
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,482
I blink, and you're here.

933
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:20,151
Is there a question there,
Detective?

934
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,320
You...

935
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:24,488
You know exactly
what I'm asking you.

936
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:26,615
And you know exactly
what I'll answer.

937
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:29,660
You know, um...

938
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:32,788
it's quite fun,
this police malarkey, isn't it?

939
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:36,375
Are we going
to watch a movie, Mommy?

940
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,669
No, babe, I just wanted
to talk to you about something.

941
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:41,881
So, before I was a cop,

942
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,674
I was an actress.

943
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,801
And I was in a movie.

944
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,888
And... it was this movie.

945
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:53,017
In the movie,
I do some very silly things.

946
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,186
Things that, uh,

947
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:57,730
maybe some of your friends
might tease you about.

948
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,858
But it is what it is,

949
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:03,319
and-and that's not me
anymore, okay?

950
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:06,197
I know.

951
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:07,573
Hmm?

952
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,492
I've seen this
before, Mommy.

953
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,870
You have? Where?

954
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,873
I have the Internet.

955
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:17,375
Oh, right.

956
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:20,628
This isn't even in HD.

957
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,297
Mm. Hmm.

958
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:25,883
Well, what'd you think?

959
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:28,260
I thought it's hilarious!

960
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,262
You did?

961
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:32,556
My favorite part is when
you ate too much cake,

962
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:34,725
and then you puked in
that cute guy's hair.

963
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:38,020
That part is really funny.

964
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:42,024
Then you stop, and
we think it's all over.

965
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:43,067
Yeah.

966
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,236
But then...

967
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:46,821
- Blah! Blah!
- Oh.

968
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:50,574
Sorry, Mommy.

969
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,076
Didn't mean
to hurt you.

970
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,453
You didn't hurt me, baby.
I'm fine.

971
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:56,747
It's gonna get better soon.

972
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:59,708
I hope the guy who hurt you
got in lots of trouble.

973
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:02,711
You know,
I should go see him.

974
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,047
So, the Devil did
a good deed today.

975
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:06,590
Oh. Hmm.

976
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,717
- There's no need
to call it that.

977
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,469
I enjoyed
every minute of it.

978
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:13,681
You know what I mean.

979
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:15,808
Mm.

980
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,811
You know, I'm so very used to
being in control of everything.

981
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:22,106
Not knowing what's gonna
come next is...

982
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:23,941
Can be scary.

983
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,986
No. No, I'm finding it
quite exhilarating, actually.

984
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:28,487
Hmm.

985
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:30,406
I think you were right,
by the way.

986
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:32,158
About what?

987
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:36,036
That it may be a "who"
that's changing me.

988
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:41,167
But now that begs the question:
what do I do with her?

989
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,127
<i>I have to warn you,
he's heavily medicated.</i>

990
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:46,464
I doubt he'll be able to string
two words together right now,

991
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:49,216
much less have
a conversation.

992
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,302
Thanks.

993
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:55,848
Hey, Jimmy.

994
00:41:57,308 --> 00:41:59,393
So this is where
you ended up, huh?

995
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:02,146
I was so wrapped up in recovery,
I forgot to come visit.

996
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,982
You know, from when you shot me.

997
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:11,697
I have to ask you something,
Jimmy,

998
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:13,991
about that day.

999
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,665
What happened to you, Jimmy?

1000
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:24,001
What happened
with Lucifer?

1001
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,714
Lucifer?

1002
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:30,883
What happened
when you shot at me?

1003
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,843
- Is he here?!
Tell me he's not here!
- No.

1004
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,553
No, Jimmy, he's not here.
He's not here, Jimmy.

1005
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:36,305
I know he's here.

1006
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:37,890
I can't get away.
I can't get away from him!

1007
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,060
Jimmy, you're safe here.

1008
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:45,105
You're safe.

1009
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:47,399
No, I'm not safe!
None of us are!

1010
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,235
- He's just a man, Jimmy.
- You don't get it, do you?

1011
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:52,154
He's the Devil!
He's the Devil!

1012
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:53,531
He's the Devil!

1013
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:56,367
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!
