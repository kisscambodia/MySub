1
00:00:00,343 --> 00:00:04,127
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,318
What does Father want?

3
00:00:05,343 --> 00:00:06,935
Someone's escaped from Hell.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,389
I think He wants me to
bring our jailbird back.

5
00:00:09,414 --> 00:00:09,866
Mum.

6
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,134
What are you hiding?

7
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,484
 Nothing.

8
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,937
I admire the steps you're taking.

9
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,373
It's hard going out on your own.

10
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:17,474
I need to figure out

11
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:18,875
where I fit in in this world,

12
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,144
and to do that, I need some space.

13
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,549
You see, I did make a promise.

14
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:24,180
I told you that you could stay here

15
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,025
until I figured out how to
reconcile my deal with Dad,

16
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,285
and now I have.

17
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,980
You shall remain right here,

18
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:32,522
on Earth, amongst the creatures

19
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,823
you so despise,

20
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,758
as one of them.

21
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,926
But that husband...

22
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,479
And there's children, right?

23
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,520
Have you
considered how your fighting

24
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:40,897
affects those caught in the middle?

25
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:43,325
You've been working
so hard to make it right.

26
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,834
You were right, before. We've been living

27
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,236
in the past for too long.

28
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,478
It's time we get a divorce.

29
00:01:08,113 --> 00:01:10,238
Damn it, Leroy.

30
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,317
Damn it, Leroy.

31
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:45,907
Damn it, Leroy.

32
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:55,235
S-H-A-G.

33
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,919
"Shag."

34
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:00,755
Oh, eight points to me and suck it, Maze.

35
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:03,124
I see you have a new toy.

36
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:04,197
Oh, this? No, no, no.

37
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:05,283
This is for work.

38
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,195
It's hard to believe I've
never had one before.

39
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:10,665
I actually have a rule about...
phones during session.

40
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:12,267
- Really?
- No phones

41
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:13,234
during session.

42
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:14,269
Oh, why not?

43
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,304
These things are incredibly therapeutic.

44
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:18,707
1,000 Tinder dates and
Sex Words With Friends?

45
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:21,042
Gosh, it's more addictive
than a whore's navel cocaine.

46
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:22,552
Uh...

47
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:25,480
Fine.

48
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,982
Oh!

49
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:28,249
Lovely. Gummies.

50
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:29,617
Love these.

51
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:32,787
And, do you know,
I've never understood these.

52
00:02:32,797 --> 00:02:35,290
Are they just decorative,
or are they for juggling?

53
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,424
I mean...

54
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:39,102
Yeah, you seem very distracted today.

55
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:41,334
Oi!

56
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,264
Oh, nearly.

57
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:44,632
Okay.

58
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:46,701
Sometimes, when we're in crisis,

59
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,670
we create distractions for ourselves,

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,172
also known as barriers to facing

61
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:53,241
our deepest fears.

62
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:55,143
Oh, sorry... right.

63
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:57,002
This is the part where you, um,

64
00:02:57,027 --> 00:03:00,281
dissect my deep psychological wounds, eh?

65
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,317
The emotion-charged gong
show of a child of divorce

66
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:04,552
who may or may not have
broken a deal with his dad

67
00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:06,187
by allowing his mum to stay on Earth.

68
00:03:06,197 --> 00:03:08,656
Mm. Has the visit with
your mom been hard?

69
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,558
Piece of cake, actually.

70
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:12,260
Mum's all sorted, not a problem.

71
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,328
Really?

72
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:14,863
Because the last time you were here,

73
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:16,464
you used the word "frightened."

74
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:19,200
And that's not like you.

75
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,002
Well, turns out Mum's a peach.

76
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:23,344
Hmm. And the "deal" with your dad?

77
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,606
To send Mum home?

78
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:26,587
What, you think I'm scared
of Him or something?

79
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:30,678
I think you're trying to avoid
the unpleasantness of conflict.

80
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,515
Hold on.

81
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:34,749
So you're saying

82
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,352
that distraction is a way
to avert your problems.

83
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:39,054
- No.
- Ergo, the more I distract,

84
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:40,088
the less I worry.

85
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:41,423
No, I did not say that.

86
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,258
Well, you didn't need to,
Doctor, I just did,

87
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:44,859
and it's bloody brilliant.

88
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:46,502
Right.

89
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,597
Where are you going?

90
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:51,399
Distraction calls.

91
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,576
This really is a breakthrough, thank you.

92
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,179
- I'm just gonna...
- Sure.

93
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:06,748
I mean, who needs
a gun and a badge

94
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:08,483
when I've got... oh!

95
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:10,385
Hey, it's a crime scene. Will you focus?

96
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:13,354
Well, someone's a grumpy pants today.

97
00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:15,390
Well, sorry, I got a lot on my mind.

98
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,858
Yes, sorry, you have, haven't you?

99
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:19,727
D-word, moving out of your mum's,
finding a new place...

100
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:22,030
Yeah, well, I'm a big girl
and I need my space,

101
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,398
and it's time.

102
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,667
Not that I have much
with work and Trixie.

103
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:27,001
Stress can be so aging.

104
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,570
You need a distraction

105
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,604
from your woes, Detective.

106
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:30,772
It's a highly effective tool.

107
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:31,873
Mm-hmm.

108
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:33,341
When was the last time you had fun?

109
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:35,110
Oh... well...

110
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,211
No, seriously,

111
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:38,079
name three friends you
could call right now

112
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:39,280
for a drink. And you can't say me,

113
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,982
your child or the man you're divorcing.

114
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:42,117
Well, trust me,

115
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:43,785
Dan is not on my list
of drinking buddies.

116
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:45,019
Well...

117
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:46,588
- Daniel.
- Hey.

118
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:47,956
I didn't mean it like that.

119
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,257
She did.

120
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:50,792
What do we have on the vic?

121
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:52,127
Young female.

122
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:53,328
C.O.D. unknown.

123
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:54,762
Another fresh-faced ingenue.

124
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,364
- Truly tragic.
- I.D.?

125
00:04:56,374 --> 00:04:58,500
No personal belongings, just a, uh,

126
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,383
a triangular-shaped ink
stamp on her hand.

127
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:02,123
Oh, hold on. I might be
able to help with this.

128
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:04,467
This is something someone
might find at a "night club."

129
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:06,374
You know, where humans go to have "fun"?

130
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:08,843
We found an abandoned
vehicle registered to Uber.

131
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:10,987
No sign of the driver.

132
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,949
Password's "Carnal," capital "C."

133
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,584
Uber I.D.s are usually linked

134
00:05:16,594 --> 00:05:19,454
to the driver's phone, not the car.

135
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:21,322
And now that we have his number,

136
00:05:21,332 --> 00:05:22,824
by the looks of this map,

137
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,893
our guy is on the corner
of Crescent and Third.

138
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:26,060
Impressive.

139
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,328
Yeah, it's called "police work."

140
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:29,230
Let's solve a murder.

141
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,878
I can
assist you with that.

142
00:05:30,902 --> 00:05:32,375
It's brilliant.

143
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:44,078
Her name's Daria Mitchell.

144
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:46,614
We traced her credit card
to a small bank in Nebraska.

145
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:49,117
We know you were the last
one to see her alive.

146
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:50,919
- I didn't touch her!
- Well...

147
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:54,255
except to toss her cold,
dead corpse into the bushes and run.

148
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:55,657
I told you.

149
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:58,193
I picked her up on the
corner of Gower and Franklin,

150
00:05:58,203 --> 00:06:00,094
gave her a ride,

151
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:01,963
and then she jumped
out of my moving car.

152
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:03,631
You just left her there to die?

153
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:07,602
By the time I pulled over and
found her, she was already...

154
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:11,272
I'm on new meds. I wasn't
thinking straight.

155
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:13,875
I just got this job. I panicked.

156
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:15,944
Killer cliché: "I panicked,"
closely followed by...

157
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:17,220
T-Talk to the other guy!

158
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:19,847
- What other guy?
- She used

159
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:21,416
my phone to call somebody.

160
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:22,951
Her boyfriend, I don't know.

161
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,619
She wanted to go over to his place,

162
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,487
he threatened to kill her.

163
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:28,030
Oh! Excuse me.

164
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,458
Oh, it's you.

165
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:33,027
Ella's got something.

166
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,075
Looks delicious.

167
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:51,079
Did you come here to gloat?

168
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,881
I just came to see how the

169
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:56,517
supreme goddess was acclimating.

170
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:58,253
Well, I wouldn't plan a
festival of celebration

171
00:06:58,263 --> 00:06:59,821
just yet, my dear.

172
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:01,923
I will not let this...

173
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:05,093
spicy chicken casserole beat me.

174
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:06,794
I'm stronger than you think.

175
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:09,097
Glad to see you're
fitting in so well.

176
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:11,833
Ha. Well, of course there
have been challenges.

177
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:14,302
Nothing I can't handle.

178
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:16,437
I'm still on a sabbatical from work,

179
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:18,072
so I spend the bulk of my day

180
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:21,509
at home with the... children.

181
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,977
Factories of filth.

182
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:24,345
Of mire.

183
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:28,116
They remind me of you,
actually, if I'm being honest.

184
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:31,052
And how's that human husband?

185
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:33,154
I discovered a trick with him.

186
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:35,957
Whenever he asks a question,
I just have sex with him.

187
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,725
Seems to render him mute.

188
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:40,695
Hmm. Took me a while to
figure that one out.

189
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:42,997
As for the rest of it,

190
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:45,633
for lack of a better
word, it is absolute...

191
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:47,468
hell.

192
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:51,179
Well, if it's so bad,
why don't you just go back?

193
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,173
Why?

194
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:53,875
So that you could go back to torturing me

195
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:54,976
for another millennia?

196
00:07:54,986 --> 00:07:58,513
- Sounds like fun to me.
- Yes, these humans

197
00:07:58,523 --> 00:07:59,914
are awful.

198
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:02,150
They breathe through their
mouths, and they won't...

199
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,253
shut up about something called gluten.

200
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:07,255
But existing in this punishment

201
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:10,674
allows me to be closer to my family.

202
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,060
Understand?

203
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,094
Of course not.

204
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:14,495
You're all alone.

205
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,346
Oh. Sorry. I...

206
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:34,382
I like to rock it old
school when I'm working.

207
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:36,417
- Know-what-I'm-sayin'?
- I do.

208
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:37,552
And rock you should.

209
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:39,787
I'm sure, studying murder all day,

210
00:08:39,797 --> 00:08:41,556
you could use a little diversion.

211
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,990
Everybody could!

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,958
Mm!

213
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:49,163
Thank you.

214
00:08:49,173 --> 00:08:51,024
What do you got for me? Well...

215
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:53,534
I found a poison in
Daria's stomach contents.

216
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:54,769
It's called mandrake,

217
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,238
it's like this crazy
organic hallucinogen,

218
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:59,941
and... you want to know
the really interesting part?

219
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:00,814
Mm-hmm!

220
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,643
It would've taken at least 90 minutes

221
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:04,416
- for it to kick in.
- The Uber driver

222
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:05,780
had back-to-back rides all night,

223
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,682
and he didn't pick up
Daria until 30 minutes

224
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:08,683
before she died.

225
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,418
Exactly. He would've barely had time

226
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,553
to torture her with his
subpar jazz and creepy

227
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:14,589
dude cologne, let alone poison her.

228
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,858
Right. We get anything from
vice on the hand stamp?

229
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:18,326
Nada.

230
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:21,162
But tech did track down that
number that Daria called.

231
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:22,730
Davis Fitzgerald.

232
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,665
Owns some hot restaurant in Silver Lake.

233
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:26,801
Food is supposed to be amaze-balls.

234
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:27,969
Deadly and delicious.

235
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:29,404
Mm-hmm. It's been on my list of places

236
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:30,838
to check out since I moved here.

237
00:09:30,848 --> 00:09:32,640
Oh, social butterfly, are we?

238
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,676
Perhaps you should, uh,
drop by Lux sometime, and we...

239
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:38,112
could, you know... Yeah.

240
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:40,982
Thanks, Ella.

241
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:49,957
Well, looks our murderous boyfriend's

242
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:51,325
doing well for himself.

243
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:53,961
Yes, your realtor did say
this is a lovely area.

244
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:56,297
- I have a realtor?
- Well, I took the liberty

245
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:57,932
of calling several on
your behalf, actually.

246
00:09:57,942 --> 00:09:59,400
It was a good hour of distraction.

247
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,803
Since when have you ever cared

248
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:03,337
about my living situation. And B:

249
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:05,473
I could never afford this place.

250
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:08,042
Well, I...

251
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:11,153
Get the hell off of my property!

252
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,215
Well, you're in luck, Detective.

253
00:10:14,225 --> 00:10:15,850
If this home's the site
of a recent massacre,

254
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,519
you may well be in an
excellent negotiating position.

255

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

256
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:31,069
Put down the knife,
and no one else needs to get hurt.

257
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:32,504
Yes, the Sweeney Todd thing's

258
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:34,139
a bit histrionic, don't you think?

259
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:35,207
Oh, you're cops?

260
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,442
Sorry. The militant vegans next door

261
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:40,162
been up in my grill all day long.

262
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:41,446
I assumed it was them again.

263
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:42,756
Come on out back.

264
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,250
I hope you hungry.

265
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,327
Tasty as charged.

266
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:51,289
See?

267
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:53,058
We're making artisanal sausage.

268
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,507
Ah. DIY butchery?

269
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:57,462
Macramé class all full up, was it?

270
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:59,731
Farm to table, man.
For my restaurant Ellipsis.

271
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:02,501
Oh, yes. I've heard the
grilled polenta's divine.

272
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:04,770
We also brew our own
kombucha, keep bees.

273
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,904
Keeping it real.

274
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:07,547
Yeah, there's no hormones in this meat.

275
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:09,074
And speaking of your meat, Davis...

276
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:11,510
are blonde Nebraskans organic or GMO?

277
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,812
Your girlfriend Daria Mitchell
was found murdered last night.

278
00:11:13,822 --> 00:11:15,213
- Murdered?
- Girlfriend?

279
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:17,315
Is there a waitress
you haven't slept with?

280
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:19,985
My gosh. Is hipster infidelity

281
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,753
really more egregious than homicide?

282
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:23,188
Babe, I don't know anything about that!

283
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:24,556
- Infidelity or homicide?
- Just...

284
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:25,999
Either.

285
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:31,226
Okay, look, I had a little
fling with Daria,

286
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,030
but I didn't kill her.

287
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,338
We got into a fight last night when

288
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:34,833
she wanted to come over,
because I was with...

289
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:36,034
So you're saying your wife is your alibi?

290
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:37,002
Actually, no.

291
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:38,403
I was with another waitress,

292
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:39,738
and Daria found out about that.

293
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:41,540
And that's what we were fighting about.

294
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,474
Okay, well, I'll need the name

295
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:43,845
and number of the other waitress.

296
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,411
Yes, and I'd like to talk to you
about your herb garden, Davis,

297
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:48,747
because I was thinking about
taking up rooftop botany.

298
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:49,956
You know...

299
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:53,285
Excuse us.

300
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,254
Botany? Realtors?

301
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:58,657
Look, I get it. I know
your mom's in town.

302
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,425
We're both going through some stuff.

303
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,294
If you need to talk, I'm here, okay?

304
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,679
- All right, understood.
- No, now.

305
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:06,231
What's going on with you?
Why is it so hard for you to focus?

306
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:07,799
What's up?

307
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,943
Just give me a minute, would you?

308
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:13,305
Face chat Maze.

309
00:12:14,382 --> 00:12:15,707
What?

310
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:17,175
My hands are kind of full right now.

311
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:18,543
Right, well, here's the sitch:

312
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:20,599
The detective is annoying
me with questions

313
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:22,447
that clearly won't lead anywhere,
so I need a favor.

314
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:23,949
Favors are your thing, not mine.

315
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:24,916
All right, then.

316
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:25,917
What about a wager?

317
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:26,985
What's in it for me?

318
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:28,153
Whatever you want.

319
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,387
Your convertible.

320
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:30,422
Fine. But you need to take

321
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:32,057
the detective out and have fun.

322
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,658
Three drinks should do the trick.

323
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:36,528
Sucker's bet. Easy.

324
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:38,015
Yes, but you're not allowed to tie her up

325
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,352
and pour booze down her throat.

326
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:40,365
Less easy.

327
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,800
Fine.

328
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,668
- All right. Deal.
- I said get naked!

329
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:44,936
Oh, hello.

330
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:47,172
Want to watch?

331
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,709
Okay, you were the last
one to talk to Daria,

332
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,344
you're telling me you have no idea

333
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,612
who she was with last night?

334
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:56,448
No. She was having a girls' night.

335
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,385
She was roomies with another
waitress, uh, Naomi.

336
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:02,854
Maybe she was with her.

337
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:04,163
Do not leave town.

338
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:07,826
So did Casanova's alibi check out?

339
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:09,694
Working on it, but in the meantime,

340
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:12,430
Daria's roommate, Naomi,
might have an idea of her timeline.

341
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,467
Oh, lovely. Then can we
go for grilled polenta?

342
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,702
Well, I can't focus on an
empty stomach, Detective.

343
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:21,147
Hey...

344
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:31,983
Oh. Hi.

345
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:33,251
Hey, uh...

346
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:35,820
I just wanted to return this.

347
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,122
Oh. Uh...

348
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:39,124
Therapeutic Truth.

349
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:40,859
So much for that, right?

350
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,964
Are you okay?

351
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:50,869
One exhalation yes, two...

352
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,038
- none of my business?
- Yeah, listen.

353
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,073
Thanks for your concern,
but, um, I'm fine.

354
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,309
No more false pretenses, remember?

355
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:00,497
Friendship means honesty.

356
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:02,614
You can talk to me, Amenadiel.

357
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,749
Apparently, that is your real name.

358
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,327
It is.

359
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,491
This is hard to explain.

360
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:15,760
Uh, it's kind of a, uh...

361
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,995
physical problem.

362
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:18,196
Oh?

363
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,799
And things aren't working
the way they used to.

364
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:24,069
Oh.

365
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,004
And I-I don't, I don't know
what to do about that.

366
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:29,074
I see. Well, you know, it's very common.

367
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:30,408
I doubt that.

368
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:31,710
Generally stress related.

369
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,111
It is very stressful.

370
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:34,245
My advice?

371
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:36,081
Don't overthink it.

372
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:39,317
You need to relax.
Try to put it out of your mind.

373
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:40,852
Maybe have a bit of fun.

374
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:42,354
- Fun?
- Yes.

375
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,689
Maybe a cocktail.

376
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,200
And before you know it...

377
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,566
It doesn't make you any
less of a man, Amenadiel.

378
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:56,009
Not even a bit.

379
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:05,176
Was everything okay?

380
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:07,912
I haven't seen Daria or Naomi all week.

381
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:09,748
We feed each other's cats.

382
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:12,417
Oh, gosh, I detest cats.

383
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:14,452
Want an animal to stare
at you with contempt?

384
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:16,647
Get a cat. Open box of excrement

385
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,156
in your house? Cat.

386
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,491
Oh, gosh. Can you smell that?

387
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,426
Foul, incontinent creatures.

388
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:24,370
That's not a cat smell.
That's a dead smell.

389
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:30,943
Oh, my God! Naomi!

390
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,444
She's got the same
triangular stamp as Daria.

391
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:41,680
Same signs of poison.

392
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,815
Well, well. Talk about a
girls' night gone wrong.

393
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,082
Lovely. Why don't we
go up to the penthouse,

394
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,451
and I can show you the
original Stairway to Heaven.

395
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,054
Ah, Detective.

396
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,922
After 6:00 on a school night?

397
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,302
Ella's final forensic report came in.

398
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:08,301
Right.

399
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:09,592
Um...

400
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:10,909
Sorry. Can this wait?

401
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,010
I mean,

402
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,545
those deaths were fiendishly tragic,

403
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,947
but I'm pretty certain that
tomorrow, during office hours,

404
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:17,916
our dead girls will still be dead.

405
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:18,917
I just wanted to run a couple...

406
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,318
Good. Saved me a trip.

407
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:21,853
You, me, drinking. Now.

408
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:23,955
- I'm in!
- What are you doing here?

409
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:25,857
Lucifer said I should drop by.
But we're working.

410
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,125
No, you're working.

411
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,226
Who the hell is she?

412
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:30,128
Oh, sorry. Hi, I'm Ella!

413
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:32,693
I was about to
give him the rundown

414
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:34,462
- on your report. Do you want to...
- No, go for it.

415
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:35,863
I got to dehydrate. Whew!

416
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:39,462
Okay. Anyhow, first off,
there was tissue damage

417
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:40,701
to Daria's stomach lining,

418
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:42,069
caused by liquid nitrogen,

419
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,071
the stuff that makes
fancy cocktails smoke.

420
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:45,873
It's probably how she
ingested the poison.

421
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:46,785
Well, excellent lead, Detective,

422
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:48,643
but you just ruined my ménage à trois.

423
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:52,017
Second, I assumed that Daria
was at a club on Gower,

424
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,869
and we found an abandoned
building on the corner.

425
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,450
It looked like they had
recently had a party there.

426
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,451
Fascinating.

427
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:58,119
I'm thinking it was a rave, so...

428
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,854
Any way you could make some
phone calls to help me out?

429
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:01,622
You know, you seem to have
your finger on the pulse.

430
00:17:01,632 --> 00:17:03,658
Not the appendage I'd
hoped to be pulsing by now.

431
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:05,359
I know that hood.

432
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,461
There's a great tiki bar

433
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:08,196
across the street from that building.

434
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:09,363
I know the bartender.

435
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:10,565
Course you do.

436
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:12,300
We could go and have a drink,

437
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,768
ask about the dead girls.

438
00:17:13,778 --> 00:17:16,170
Yes. That sounds like a
very good lead, Detective.

439
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,672
If you want to retrace the steps

440
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:19,540
of two hot girls on a girls' night,

441
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,642
you need to think like two
hot girls on a girls' night.

442
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,752
With your lady parts.

443
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:25,947
And piña coladas in hand.

444
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,216
Oh, my God, I love piña coladas!

445
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:29,758
Lovely!

446
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:43,397
So, I was watching Chinatown, right?

447
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:45,066
And all of a sudden, it hits me.

448
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:47,902
I need to go to L.A. I mean,
do you ever feel like

449
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:49,537
God is telling you to do something?

450
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:50,771
No.

451
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:53,096
Oh. You think Chloe's gonna drink that?

452
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:54,090
No.

453
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,820
Hey, guys. Do you
recognize this hand stamp?

454
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:00,281
What about these women?

455
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,083
No.

456
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:03,684
Okay, look. I'm LAPD,

457
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:05,386
and if there's any info
that you can give me

458
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:07,355
on any...

459
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:09,690
How not to get laid.

460
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,527
I'm not trying to get laid, Maze.

461
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:14,028
I don't get it.

462
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:15,796
Well, did you talk to the bartender?

463
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:18,200
Yeah. He said something was going on

464
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:19,583
across the street in the
abandoned building.

465
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,457
I put a call in for a warrant to the judge,

466
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:22,537
and I'm waiting to hear back.

467
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:24,505
Great. Looks like you
have some time to kill.

468
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:25,439
Have a drink.

469
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,375
No. I'm gonna call it a night.

470
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:28,342
Hello, ladies.

471
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:31,012
Hi. What are you doing here?

472
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,346
Maze invited me.

473
00:18:32,356 --> 00:18:34,315
- She said it's girls' night.
- Yeah.

474
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:37,118
No. I'm working a double homicide.

475
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:39,687
Would it kill you to just relax for once?

476
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:41,088
All you do is

477
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:42,757
work, work, work.

478
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,091
Wow. Like you're one to talk.

479
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:46,022
You're at Lucifer's beck and call 24/7.

480
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,929
It's like you're his personal concierge.

481
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:50,665
I'm not his personal anything, anymore.

482
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:54,027
Hmm. Well, you basically still
live there, and it's not like

483
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:55,344
he's pouring you any drinks.

484
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:58,472
Least I know how to have fun.

485
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,649
What about pleasure?

486
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:02,685
Men?

487
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,212
When's the last time you had sex?

488
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:06,738
Hey, why does
everything always have to be

489
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:08,482
- about work or sex?
- Yeah, I agree.

490
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:12,320
Girls' night, done right,
is about female bonding.

491
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,655
- Exactly.
- Really getting to know each other.

492
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:18,359
Sharing problems,
origin stories, secrets.

493
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:20,094
- Can't we just drink?
- Fine.

494
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:22,063
I'll start. Um...

495
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,132
I worked my way through med school as

496
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:26,334
a phone sex operator.

497
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:28,903
1-800-ProfessorFeelGood.

498
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:31,372
I would totally call that.

499
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:32,406
Nice.

500
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,652
I'm Ella, by the way.

501
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:35,364
I love that we just
skipped the small talk.

502
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:36,110
Yes.

503
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,512
Um, okay. I'll go next, I guess. Um...

504
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:39,922
I used to steal cars.

505
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:42,216
Who's next?

506
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,018
I was forged in the bowels of Hell

507
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:47,288
to torture the guilty
for all of eternity.

508
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:49,557
Interesting share.

509
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,559
Okay, so...

510
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:52,860
Now, you go, Chloe.

511
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,595
Female trust.

512
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:55,596
Come on.

513
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:56,964
What's on your mind?

514
00:19:56,974 --> 00:19:59,100
What's on my mind...

515
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,002
like, other than the case?

516
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:02,277
Yeah.

517
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:06,548
Um...

518
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:09,977
A little divorce.

519
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:11,212
- Uh...
- Mm-hmm.

520
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:14,882
Single parenthood...

521
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:18,185
uh, possible homelessness and...

522
00:20:18,195 --> 00:20:22,189
most likely many, many cats in my future.

523
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:24,158
Or things that require batteries.

524
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:25,326
Okay, you know, that's-that's...

525
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:26,694
that's what I'm talking about.

526
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:29,330
You guys, this is so fun!

527
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,575
- Is it?
- Yes!

528
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,900
Yeah, uh, tequila, stat.

529
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,502
- Yes.
- Keep 'em coming!

530
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:36,003
This is really
gonna help you feel,

531
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:37,646
you know, anything.

532
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:42,009
Ugh!

533
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:43,411
Cosmopolitan?

534
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:45,379
Perhaps this really is girls' night.

535
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:48,282
There are only two reasons to
drink alone, brother.

536
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:49,684
Either you're a chronic dullard,

537
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:51,852
or you're trying to avoid your problems.

538
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:53,154
If it's the latter, I approve.

539
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:55,189
My problems are your problems.

540
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,491
Ooh! Aren't we the little empath?

541
00:20:57,501 --> 00:21:01,028
You think letting Mom stay here
on earth doesn't affect us all?

542
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:01,962
Why?

543
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:02,971
Because you think Dad is gonna

544
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,032
forgive and forget about the
fact that you broke a deal?

545
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,600
Haven't broken anything.

546
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,702
I found a loophole.

547
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:09,704
As such, I'm not
thinking about it at all.

548
00:21:09,714 --> 00:21:10,671
You should try it.

549
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:12,648
There will be consequences!

550
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:16,477
I don't get it.

551
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,112
If you're so concerned,
why don't you just

552
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:19,380
fly Mum back to Hell?

553
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,531
Because I can't!

554
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:25,052
That was a tad dramatic.

555
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:26,020
Why not?

556
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,696
It's complicated.

557
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:30,825
Never fear, fun brother's here.

558
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:33,062
I'm gonna show you the
magic of distraction.

559
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:35,596
But no more girly drinks. All right?

560
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:37,264
Cosmos are yummy.

561
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:40,468
Oh... Bourbon. Stat. Keep 'em coming.

562
00:21:53,691 --> 00:21:55,116
Yes!

563
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:57,451
Thank you, Los Angeles!

564
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:02,690
And then Lucifer's all like...

565
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,127
"Hey Chloe, name three friends

566
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:09,163
that you could go call
and have a drink with."

567
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:10,631
- So smug, you know?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

568
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:13,100
Well, one... two... three!

569
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,929
So, you're saying,

570
00:22:13,953 --> 00:22:15,354
if I called you guys,

571
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:16,771
you would drop everything

572
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:18,205
and come and have a drink with me?

573
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:20,741
Mm-hmm. 'Cause that is what
girlfriends do for each other.

574
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:23,010
Yes, especially during tough times.

575
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,411
Exactly.

576
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:26,680
I've never had friends like that.

577
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,681
Like, ever.

578
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:29,350
Well, you're a lot more tolerable

579
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,417
when you're drunk, Decker.

580
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:31,886
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

581
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:33,087
And then Lucifer's like,

582
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:36,223
"You use work to avoid having fun."

583
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:37,892
Oh, yeah. Well, not anymore, lady.

584
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:39,226
'Cause we're your tribe, now.

585
00:22:39,236 --> 00:22:41,695
And we like to party!

586
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,332
I wish I had my knives.
We could have made a blood pact.

587
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:46,667
- Ooh, next time.
- Aww... Yeah, yeah.

588
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:48,569
Next time? This is progress.

589
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:49,804
To tribes!

590
00:22:49,814 --> 00:22:51,572
To tribes!

591
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:53,207
Sip it.

592
00:22:54,985 --> 00:22:56,544
I think we should go back up there.

593
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:59,380
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

594
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,948
Mm.

595
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,485
Oh, it looks like someone's
made a fourth friend.

596
00:23:04,495 --> 00:23:06,887
Oh, you get it, girl!

597
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:08,355
Oh, no!

598
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:10,568
- Abort! Chloe!
- Oh... don't do that.

599
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:12,526
I don't think she...

600
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:14,328
Does she wear contacts?

601
00:23:14,338 --> 00:23:15,462
- She's really into him.
- And she's bringing him over.

602
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:16,597
- Is she?
- Look!

603
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:18,465
Same hand stamp

604
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:19,700
as Daria and Naomi!

605
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,601
Where did you get this?

606
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:22,703
I saw some hot women, uh,

607
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:24,905
g-going into a party across
the street last night.

608
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:26,106
- Okay.
- It was just...

609
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:27,208
Do you recognize these women?

610
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:28,142
Did you see these girls there?

611
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:30,244
What's your deal?

612
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:31,946
Hey, she's just asking a few questions.

613
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:34,415
Well, he's taken. So back off, skank!

614
00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:35,716
- I...
- Hey!

615
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:38,219
No one calls my skank a skank.

616
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:39,687
- I'm hurting her.
- No! Oh, no, no...

617
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:41,722
No. Okay, no. No, no, Maze.

618
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:42,690
Maze...

619
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,391
Wipe that smile off her face.

620
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:46,727
Maze, remember... aggression

621
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,596
is not the answer, okay.

622
00:23:48,606 --> 00:23:50,064
Clearly, this woman is having

623
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:51,432
some serious trust issues.

624
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:52,499
Clearly.

625
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:54,435
Or maybe she's just a raging bitch.

626
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:55,502
Oh!

627
00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:12,686
LAPD! Hey!

628
00:24:12,696 --> 00:24:14,421
Everybody take a breath!

629
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:16,490
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

630
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,092
What is happening?!

631
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,699
Maze, Maze, Maze!

632
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:30,871
Maze, I wasn't done questioning him!

633
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:36,410
Ugh!

634
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,545
Carry on.

635
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:40,247
Hey.

636
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:41,715
Did you see these girls?

637
00:24:41,725 --> 00:24:42,983
Yeah, maybe.

638
00:24:42,993 --> 00:24:44,385
- Where?
- It was... it was...

639
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:46,053
- Where?!
- It was a crowded sex club,

640
00:24:46,078 --> 00:24:47,634
and there was so many hot girls...

641
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:48,752
A sex club?

642
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:51,425
Yeah, just...

643
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:53,193
Don't tell my girlfriend. Just...

644
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,107
Girls' night out.

645
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:10,540
Oh...

646
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,941
Oof.

647
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:13,743
Happy hour over already?

648
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:15,245
Must have been some party.

649
00:25:15,255 --> 00:25:16,436
Yeah...

650
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:18,548
other than the half hour-ish

651
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,850
from 8:47 to 9:17

652
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,752
that I can't quite remember anything.

653
00:25:22,762 --> 00:25:24,561
Classic Chloe.

654
00:25:24,586 --> 00:25:26,456
Only you would make
a point of remembering

655
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:28,658
the exact amount of
time you can't remember.

656
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:30,260
Mm. Well,

657
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,896
I was lucid enough to destroy a tiki bar

658
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,431
and get a lead on our two dead blondes.

659
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:37,567
I found a guy with a hand stamp.

660
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,610
The same club that Daria
and Naomi went to?

661
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,624
Not a club.

662
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:45,728
More like a roving, pop-up sex party.

663
00:25:45,738 --> 00:25:47,430
Secretive, invite-only,

664
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,765
caters to rich jerks
who like to pay for it.

665
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:50,564
So gross.

666
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,276
So those two girls were sex workers?

667
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:54,236
Looks like it.

668
00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:55,905
But the only way to know for sure

669
00:25:55,915 --> 00:25:57,740
is to get you into the next shindig.

670
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,608
Which hand stamp guy told me...

671
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:01,043
Right before he passed out...

672
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:03,279
Is happening as we speak.

673
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:04,447
Me?

674
00:26:04,457 --> 00:26:07,591
Uh-huh. Men only. And I got you a date.

675
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:09,719
- Nope.
- Yes.

676
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:11,087
- Mm-mm. No way.
- Yes.

677
00:26:11,097 --> 00:26:12,855
It's good to have Lucifer
there with you as back up.

678
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:15,299
So they don't think you're a cop.

679
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:18,435
I don't look like a cop.

680
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:21,572
Uh-huh.

681
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:24,734
Hey.

682
00:26:24,744 --> 00:26:25,901
Do I look like a cop?

683
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:34,377
Ah. Finally, you're here. Right.

684
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:35,578
I promise this will be more fun

685
00:26:35,588 --> 00:26:37,646
than light beers and Bachelor reruns.

686
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:38,981
Your jokes never get old.

687
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:40,950
Oh, come on, who doesn't
love a sex party?

688
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,017
Then again, if you're me,

689
00:26:42,027 --> 00:26:43,853
every party's a sex party of sorts.

690
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:45,017
It's illegal, for starters.

691
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,689
Why do you think they change
the location every night?

692
00:26:46,699 --> 00:26:48,657
No liquor license, underage girls...

693
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,159
Well, the world's oldest profession

694
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:51,894
seems to be surviving quite nicely.

695
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:53,996
Hello, chaps.

696
00:26:54,006 --> 00:26:56,265
Yes, my first startup was
a sex club, actually.

697
00:26:56,275 --> 00:26:57,967
Little place called "Eden".
Perhaps you've heard of it?

698
00:26:57,977 --> 00:27:01,370
I'm... good. Thank you.

699
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,539
Best case scenario,
this club exploits women.

700
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:05,474
Worst case? It got those
girls a belly full of poison.

701
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:06,409
Mm.

702
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,511
- One other thing.
- Hm?

703
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:11,614
I'm not sure why he's here.

704
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:13,749
Only dullards drink alone.

705
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,384
Yes, he's a tad anxious these days.

706
00:27:15,394 --> 00:27:16,952
I thought a night out would do him good.

707
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:18,687
Right. Well, we have one mission:

708
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:21,390
to find out who knew the dead girls.

709
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,175
And remember... We're undercover, okay?

710
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,728
As if you could look
like anything other than a cop.

711
00:27:25,738 --> 00:27:27,129
I do not look like a cop!

712
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:27,930
Cop.

713
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:32,301
All right, will you guys just please,

714
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:33,869
for God's sake, be chill?

715
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:36,413
And three rules: no
drinking, no touching...

716
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:38,908
...and just keep everything low-key.

717
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:41,377
Yes!

718
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:44,079
Oh, my God.

719
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:46,682
This is not helping us find
out who knew the dead girls.

720
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:49,018
Agreed. His shimmy is a tad off-putting.

721
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:50,319
Come on, Luci!

722
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:52,254
Come cut a rug with your big bro!

723
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:53,556
Uh. No, no, no, no, no.

724
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:54,757
White man's overbite,

725
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:56,425
that is definitely where I draw the line.

726
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:57,726
Hold on a second.

727
00:27:57,736 --> 00:27:59,102
Look at the bar.

728
00:28:00,473 --> 00:28:02,264
It's liquid nitrogen.

729
00:28:02,274 --> 00:28:03,632
It's the same thing that caused damage

730
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:05,201
to Daria Mitchell's stomach lining.

731
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:06,443
Yes.

732
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:09,605
Hey, buddy.

733
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:10,639
Hey.

734
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,583
What do you know about these two girls?

735
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:17,847
Not so fast, buddy boy.

736
00:28:17,857 --> 00:28:20,850
Seems my martini isn't the
only thing here that's dirty.

737
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,418
Mmm.

738
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:23,919
A drink to savor, don't you think?

739
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:25,621
Ah...

740
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:27,890
Want to explain why you ran?

741
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,725
Come on. You're obviously a cop.

742
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:30,960
Shut it.

743
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,995
I figured you were here to bust me.

744
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:34,797
Yes, we are here to bust you.

745
00:28:34,807 --> 00:28:37,466
For the untimely fate of two
innocent Nebraskan girls.

746
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:39,201
Wait... what?

747
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:40,536
It's funny how killers go deaf

748
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:42,137
at the moment of reckoning, isn't it?

749
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:43,372
No, no. I...

750
00:28:43,382 --> 00:28:44,440
I'm no killer.

751
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,809
I-I-I keep an eye on
the girls that work here

752
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:49,311
and serve the pervs drinks.

753
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:50,379
And pot...

754
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:51,741
Maybe a bit of "E."

755
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:54,083
- What about mandrake?
- Who's Mandrake?

756
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:56,418
Did you put poison in
these two girls' drinks?

757
00:28:56,428 --> 00:28:58,938
No-no. What? No.
I-I remember these girls.

758
00:28:58,963 --> 00:29:01,323
Their drinks were clean when I made 'em.

759
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,642
Who was paying for 'em?

760
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,360
I don't know, it was some
Hollywood dirtbag

761
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,661
with a gold card.

762
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:08,230
You'll need to be a little more specific.

763
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,900
It's... Yuri something.

764
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,501
He's not here tonight though.

765
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,003
I guess your two dead girls

766
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,694
and the other blonde must
have really worn him out.

767
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:16,238
Wait a minute.

768
00:29:16,248 --> 00:29:17,540
- There were three blondes?
- Yeah.

769
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,875
Your two newbies and their hot friend.

770
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,010
Right. First name:

771
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,344
"Hot", last name "Friend"?

772
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:24,393
They don't use their real names.

773
00:29:24,924 --> 00:29:26,081
She's one of our regulars though.

774
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:28,083
You know, life of the party.

775
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:29,151
Oh, she won't be the life of anything,

776
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,119
if we don't get to her

777
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:31,754
before lady killer Yuri has his way.

778
00:29:31,764 --> 00:29:32,855
If he hasn't already.

779
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:34,123
Thank you.

780
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,230
Oh, silly me.

781
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:44,300
Come on. Rise and shine, Crantini.

782
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,334
Time to go.

783
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,669
Yeah. Let's do this.

784
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,708
Gosh, I wish I got that on video.

785
00:29:52,718 --> 00:29:53,943
Oh, I can get that on video!

786
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:55,874
Hold on. Douche-cam.

787
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:15,733
Must have been some party.

788
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:17,468
Ah, that's funny.

789
00:30:17,478 --> 00:30:19,737
And I'll laugh after we
find this Yuri scumbag.

790
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:21,639
You have anything on the third girl?

791
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:23,641
Bartender said she was, "Blonde, hot,

792
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:24,675
and had an exposed midriff".

793
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:26,978
Which describes half
the population of L.A.

794
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:29,413
Well, the chef's wife, Gisele,
fits that description.

795
00:30:29,423 --> 00:30:31,816
Yeah, but when you saw
her, she was healthy.

796
00:30:31,826 --> 00:30:33,217
You think she could have
worked with Naomi

797
00:30:33,227 --> 00:30:34,585
and Daria at the sex club?

798
00:30:34,595 --> 00:30:36,128
She knew them

799
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:37,555
through her husband's restaurant.

800
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:39,524
I mean... but part-time sex worker?

801
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:41,359
Would that be the first thing
you put on your résumé?

802
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:43,728
No. But if she was there,

803
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:45,796
she was witness to everything
that went down that night.

804
00:30:45,806 --> 00:30:47,965
So, maybe Yuri's after her.

805
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:49,300
Yeah, well, the tech got Yuri's info

806
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,102
from the credit card he
used at the sex party.

807
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:52,270
Only has a P.O. box.

808
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,437
No home address, but I did get

809
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:54,772
a cell and a plate number.

810
00:30:54,782 --> 00:30:55,431
Okay, good.

811
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:56,893
Lucifer and I will go find Yuri,

812
00:30:56,918 --> 00:30:58,342
and, uh,

813
00:30:58,352 --> 00:30:59,443
and, um...

814
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:01,412
...you track down Gisele.

815
00:31:03,457 --> 00:31:04,482
Oh...

816
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:05,624
Copy that.

817
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:08,076
- _
- That is...

818
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:11,289
What did Maze win

819
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,758
and why does it involve
my tragic drunk face?

820
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:14,992
Just a little wager.

821
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:16,694
Well, you had a lot on your mind,

822
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:18,329
so I decided to distract you,

823
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:19,705
with "girls' night."

824
00:31:22,243 --> 00:31:23,334
Last night was a setup?

825
00:31:23,344 --> 00:31:25,403
Yes. Well, you had fun, didn't you?

826
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:26,612
You should be thanking me.

827
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,808
What are you doing?

828
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:33,319
Detective...

829
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:37,529
_

830
00:31:39,827 --> 00:31:41,686
Uh, hey, Davis hasn't seen Gisele,

831
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:43,421
and she's, uh, not answering her cell,

832
00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:45,223
so if Yuri has her,
we've got to get there fast.

833
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:46,524
I'm on my way.

834
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:48,826
Detective...

835
00:31:48,836 --> 00:31:51,237
What did you say to her?

836
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:02,506
LAPD. Get out of the car, Yuri.

837
00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:03,941
Good Lord, you could at least

838
00:32:03,951 --> 00:32:05,276
fork out for a room, Yuri.

839
00:32:05,286 --> 00:32:06,978
No, no, no, no!

840
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:08,679
Not the Italian leather!

841
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:10,815
Bloody hell!

842
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:13,150
Yeah, more like karma.

843
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,386
We know you were at
the sex club last night,

844
00:32:15,396 --> 00:32:17,655
and you're responsible for
the death of two girls.

845
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:19,290
What do you know about Gisele?

846
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,959
I don't know anyone named Gisele.

847
00:32:21,969 --> 00:32:23,427
You have it all wrong.

848
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:25,696
I only went to that club

849
00:32:25,706 --> 00:32:28,866
because Crystal promised me newbies.

850
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:30,868
I paid five grand apiece

851
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:32,403
for those two sweethearts.

852
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:33,604
Who's Crystal?

853
00:32:33,614 --> 00:32:35,840
She was with Daria and Naomi.

854
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,907
Then you should most definitely

855
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:38,743
- ask for a refund.
- I know.

856
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:41,512
Those girls had no idea
that I was their date.

857
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:42,880
You're telling me Daria and Naomi

858
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,515
had no idea it was a sex club?

859
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:46,384
No.

860
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:48,219
When they found out,
they wanted to leave.

861
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:50,521
Crystal bought them drinks,

862
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:53,224
but they drank them and bailed anyway.

863
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:56,060
I was so upset that I
took the last sip and...

864
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,670
You drank the rest of the poison.

865
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,433
I have been sick ever since.

866
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:03,367
Oh, God.

867
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:05,511
Oh, no, no, no. Not again.

868
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:08,406
Is Gisele Crystal?

869
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:09,774
Oh, you mean the chef's wife?

870
00:33:09,784 --> 00:33:11,475
Could she be the one who
killed Daria and Naomi?

871
00:33:11,485 --> 00:33:13,077
Well, Daria was sleeping
with her husband,

872
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:15,112
so if anyone had a bone to pick,
it would be her.

873
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:19,355
Yuri, do you know Crystal's real name?

874
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,086
No. But I have a picture.

875
00:33:22,096 --> 00:33:24,722
Oh, lovely. I'll take that.

876
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:27,458
Right. Ooh, pecker pic.

877
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:29,093
- Pecker pic.
- Eww!

878
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:30,602
Oh, hold on.

879
00:33:32,073 --> 00:33:33,664
That's not Gisele.

880
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:35,966
No, and that blonde hair
doesn't look real either.

881
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:38,069
You're right, it's a wig.

882
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,446
And the girl wearing
it looks real familiar.

883
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:49,113
Oh, it's just rush, rush,
rush in this town, isn't it?

884
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:51,349
Oh, hi, detectives.

885
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,484
I'm just putting a few things in storage.

886
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:54,852
I'm going back home.

887
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:56,587
Right, you can take the
girl out of Nebraska,

888
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:58,956
but you can't take
Nebraska out of the girl.

889
00:33:58,966 --> 00:33:59,957
Or can you?

890
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:02,626
I don't feel safe in L.A. anymore.

891
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:04,762
You wouldn't either if
two of your neighbors

892
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:05,663
wound up dead.

893
00:34:05,688 --> 00:34:07,298
Don't you just hate that?

894
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:09,333
I'm sorry, I have a flight at 3:00.

895
00:34:09,343 --> 00:34:10,534
Yes, and I've just discovered

896
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:12,269
this wonderful thing called Facebook.

897
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:14,038
- Have you heard of it?
- I have to go, please.

898
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:15,940
'Cause Facebook's heard of you.

899
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,575
It knows that you're a big deal

900
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:18,676
in your small town.

901
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:19,877
A ten back home,

902
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:23,147
but in L.A., just a five.

903
00:34:23,157 --> 00:34:25,249
Things haven't worked out for
you here, have they, Lily?

904
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:28,819
So much heartache, struggle, compromise.

905
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:30,788
It made you desperate enough

906
00:34:30,798 --> 00:34:32,790
to turn against your
own sorority sisters,

907
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,824
Daria and Naomi.

908
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:36,227
No. Daria and Naomi were my friends.

909
00:34:36,237 --> 00:34:37,528
Were they?

910
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:39,964
Because we know you were with
them the night they died.

911
00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:42,032
You said you hadn't seen 'em for a week.

912
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,267
You have no proof of that.

913
00:34:43,277 --> 00:34:47,204
Except for a photo taken by
your charming buddy Yuri.

914
00:34:47,214 --> 00:34:48,572
Nice wig, by the way.

915
00:34:48,582 --> 00:34:51,090
Really brings out the
murder in your eyes.

916
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:57,856
Seems kitties do have claws.

917
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:04,428
Please, just let me go.

918
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:06,430
Is this the part where you
wish I had a gun, Detective?

919
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,398
Shut up, Lucifer, I got this.

920
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:10,400
You pretended to be
a friend to those girls.

921
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,935
Shame on you.

922
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:13,737
They called me!

923
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:15,572
They were desperate for my help.

924
00:35:15,582 --> 00:35:18,442
The best workout class, where to hike...

925
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:19,776
this apartment!

926
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,012
They asked you for help
and you preyed on them?

927
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:23,580
I was doing them a favor.

928
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,549
What, by putting mandrake in their drinks?

929
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,951
I thought it was an
organic kind of roofie.

930
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,561
I didn't know that it would kill them.

931
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:31,688
I was just trying to loosen them up.

932
00:35:31,698 --> 00:35:33,290
You were trying to make an extra buck

933
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,725
by bringing in a couple newbies.

934
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:37,828
I won the Dame Judith
acting award in college.

935
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:40,998
I was the president of our sorority.

936
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,333
I should have made it by now!

937
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:46,436
L.A. was supposed to be easy!

938
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:48,472
Oh, phones...

939
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,548
They can be so distracting.

940
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:58,715
There's a special place in Hell
for women who fake friendships

941
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:03,687
as a way of manipulating other women!

942
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:05,964
She's right, you know.

943
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,593
And I think we have
silver lining, Detective.

944
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:12,462
What with Lily going away,
and Daria and Naomi dead,

945
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:14,431
I believe that there's an
apartment vacancy.

946
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,967
Are you seriously suggesting
that I should move

947
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:18,335
into a dead girl's apartment?

948
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,904
No, no, no, the killer's
place is much nicer.

949
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:23,915
I mean, just look at this view!

950
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,467
How'd you get in here?

951
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:53,470
Let's just say Samantha at the front desk

952
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,440
is no longer into men.

953
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,575
What, you still mad?

954
00:36:58,585 --> 00:37:01,645
What was all that stuff
about being my tribe?

955
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:03,655
You had fun, didn't you?

956
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:06,683
I don't have time for this.

957
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:08,727
I have work to do. You can go.

958
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:15,800
I wasn't totally faking it.

959
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:21,064
Like when I strangled
psycho chick for the win.

960
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,432
That was genuine.

961
00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:24,901
Gee, thanks.

962
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:28,205
You know, I wouldn't
just kick ass for anyone.

963
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:29,906
Okay, fine, I would.

964
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:33,477
But this time it was... sweeter.

965
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:36,413
This is some twisted
version of an apology?

966
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,382
I don't do apologies.

967
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:40,191
But I don't want to kill you anymore.

968
00:37:41,561 --> 00:37:44,287
You're a very, very deranged person.

969
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:46,164
Thanks.

970
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:48,925
So, we're still good to be roomies, right?

971
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,293
What are you talking about, roomies?

972
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:51,328
We shook on it.

973
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:53,363
Post-karaoke, pre-potbelly dude.

974
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:54,765
What?

975
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,299
I told you I was in between places.

976
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:57,934
You said that you were
looking for someone

977
00:37:57,944 --> 00:37:59,269
to share expenses.

978
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,445
Don't you remember?

979
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:04,775
The missing half hour.

980
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:08,044
Look... I've got money.

981
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:10,747
I like your kid, and you dress like crap,

982
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:12,949
so I won't be stealing
any of your clothes.

983
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,959
What, you got a better plan?

984
00:38:18,432 --> 00:38:20,331
You said you wanted fun, Decker.

985
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:23,067
Fun.

986
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,837
Oh, my...

987
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,033
Roommates?

988
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:31,301
You and Detective Decker?

989
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,870
No, no, no, no, no, no.

990
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,273
And have I mentioned
"no," and also, "no"?

991
00:38:36,283 --> 00:38:38,608
- You're not my boss anymore.
- Well, that may be.

992
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:40,644
But I can't have the women
in my life teaming up.

993
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:41,945
I'll be outnumbered.

994
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:43,580
Dad forbid you manage
to have sex with her

995
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,015
before I do.

996
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,551
Oh, actually, can I interest
you in another wager?

997
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:49,719
No. Done deal. Pay up.

998
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:52,689
Fine, the convertible's yours.

999
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:53,657
I'm over that.

1000
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,525
Well, the hot, new bartender.

1001
00:38:55,535 --> 00:38:56,760
Been there, done that.

1002
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,195
Well, spit it out then, Maze.

1003
00:38:58,205 --> 00:38:59,471
What is it you want?

1004
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,570
I want a drink.

1005
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,205
What, that's it?

1006
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,940
Fine. Pick any bottle, pull two glasses.

1007
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,985
No, I want you to pour me a drink.

1008
00:39:15,722 --> 00:39:16,855
All right.

1009
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:30,193
To newly defined relationships.

1010
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:31,895
Cheers.

1011
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:38,335
Oh... please...

1012
00:39:38,345 --> 00:39:40,270
don't drink in front of me.

1013
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,405
Bad case of the distractions, brother?

1014
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:44,674
Well, I better go.

1015
00:39:44,684 --> 00:39:47,043
I'll let you deal
with the lightweight.

1016
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:50,280
Judging from your behavior last night,

1017
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,449
that lunatic dancing,
I fear that my advice

1018
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:54,417
may have created a whole
new set of problems.

1019
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:57,454
No more turning a "blind eye," Lucifer.

1020
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:59,130
Listen...

1021
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:03,994
We both know that Dad is not the kind

1022
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:05,295
to forgive and forget.

1023
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:08,265
No distraction on earth
is gonna change that.

1024
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:10,000
I said that I would punish Mom,

1025
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,135
and I'm doing so here on earth.

1026
00:40:12,145 --> 00:40:13,970
Deal maintained, loophole achieved.

1027
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,513
What if He doesn't feel that way?

1028
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,775
There will be real consequences, Luci,

1029
00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:20,076
for all of us.

1030
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:22,112
Especially me.

1031
00:40:22,122 --> 00:40:23,647
You know, I liked you better drunk.

1032
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:26,850
Tell me something, brother,
what deal did you make?

1033
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,152
What was worth writing
Father, of all people,

1034
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:30,186
a blank check?

1035
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:32,730
Not a what. A who.

1036
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:43,099
You made a deal for Chloe's life?

1037
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:44,501
Don't look at me like that!

1038
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:46,636
At the time, it made a
certain amount of sense.

1039
00:40:46,646 --> 00:40:47,912
Don't you understand?

1040
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:51,107
You made a deal to return Mom to Hell.

1041
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:53,910
In exchange, Chloe's life was spared.

1042
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,645
Well, that's one interpretation.

1043
00:40:55,655 --> 00:40:57,948
Despite whatever loopholes
you think you found,

1044
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,098
and the lies that you have told yourself,

1045
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:03,086
you still haven't delivered
on your end of the bargain.

1046
00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:06,256
Luci, what if Dad decides to

1047
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,525
take back His side of the deal?

1048
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:15,065
One silly human soul?

1049
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:17,968
I can't imagine Dad would
take much interest in that.

1050
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:21,122
Yes, two adult women and a child.

1051
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,540
Just bring over a
deposit, and the apartment's yours.

1052
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,676
Really? Oh, yeah, I will, uh...

1053
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:28,511
Great, I'll drop off a check right away.

1054
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:30,700
- Okay, thank you.
- Of course.

1055
