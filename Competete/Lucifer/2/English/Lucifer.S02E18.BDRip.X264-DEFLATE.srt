00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:03,797
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
I wasn't lying.

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,007
I do intend to use
the Flaming Sword

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:07,384
to cut through
the Gates of Heaven.

4
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:08,551
But what you left out?

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,595
I plan on kicking Mum
into Heaven

6
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:12,681
<i>and slamming the gates
on her backside.</i>

7
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:15,225
Maybe there's
another piece missing.
MOM: <i>If you find the killer,</i>

8
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,060
<i>then you'll find our piece of the Flaming Sword.</i>

9
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:18,603
I went through a
lot this last year,

10
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:20,897
and improv sort of helped
me reorient myself.

11
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:22,023
LUCIFER: Amenadiel
told you about our trip

12
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:23,274
back to Heaven,
didn't he?

13
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:25,860
(shouts)
<i>You</i> should have told me.

14
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:29,030
- As promised.
- This opens a
safety deposit box.

15
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:31,866
LAPD. Bianca Ruiz,
you're under arrest.

16
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:35,412
Are you certain this is all that
was in the safety deposit box?

17
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,122
We'll fix it.
There's plenty of time.

18
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:38,415
MOM:
<i>Just not for me.</i>

19
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:41,584
God shattered the Flaming Sword
into three distinct pieces.

20
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:43,586
The Blade of Death,
the Medallion of Life

21
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:45,588
and the Key that binds
them all together.

22
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:46,923
Look down.

23
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:50,135
He entrusted
it to you.

24
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:51,886
Congrats on nabbing
Queen Tequila.

25
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:53,263
Well, Chet's still out there,

26
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,556

Uh, no, it means that once again

71
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:41,037
Dad is manipulating us
six ways to Sunday.

00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:42,914
But, hey, what's new?

73
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,624
At least we have it now.

74
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,126
So...

75
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:52,757
Well, hand it over, Brother.

76
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,634
The sword's not
gonna ignite itself.

77
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:58,805

give it to me.

78
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:01,474
Give it to me. Right,
don't be silly, Brother.

79
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:02,934
You know I'm ten times
stronger than you.

80
00:03:03,143 --> 00:03:04,435

00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:06,646

No, Luci, you're
right, I'm not.

86
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,451
Well, oh.

87
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:22,704
I didn't mean to make you
all broody again.

88
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:23,872
No, it's okay.

89
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,708
I just need a little time to
process what it all means.

90
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,042
Process?

91
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,587
Okay. Fine.

00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,048

104
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,043
Then go to a hospital.

This isn't exactly
a human injury,

keep doing this to me?

I am a doctor,

111

LUCIFER: (chuckles)
Naked girl stuff?

182
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,066
Dr. Linda, I had no idea.

183
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,443
(laughs)

184
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:23,486
What is that?

185
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,785
All right,
out with it, Mother.

186
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:32,662
It's nothing.

187
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:34,455
That spoiled brat,

188
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:35,915
Chet Ruiz, stabbed me,

189
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:36,999
and now I'm bleeding light.

190
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,293
It's... it's no big deal.

191
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:40,878
What?

192
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,422
That's a huge deal.

193
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,924
Mum, if your powers are
returning to this degree,

194
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,635
then your human body won't be
able to contain it, you'll...

195
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:49,387
you'll burst.

196
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:50,430
Oh, no.

197
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:51,973
I need to find Amenadiel now.

198
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,141
I'd rather you didn't.

199
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:54,809
I mean, it's bad enough

200
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,644
- that you'll be worried.
- No, that's just it, Mum.

201
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,063
Amenadiel has the missing
piece of the sword.

202
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,982
You're k... you're kidding.

203
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:03,776
Son, why didn't
you say something?

204
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,530
Now we can finally ignite it and
cut through the Gates of Heaven

205
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:12,160
and I can see my... I can...
I can see my children.

206
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:16,539
Yes. Yes, but for now,
I need to find Amenadiel

207
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,458
and you need
to stay away from humans.

208
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,460
You're a... ticking bomb.

209
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,462
Uh, um, actually,

210
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,841
speaking of that, I...
may have already

211
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,303
harmed... someone.

212
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:33,473
Oh, no.

213
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,307
No, no, no.

214
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,893
I just came from a crime scene--
the man with a burned head.

215
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:38,603
Please tell me that isn't Chet.

216
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,855
The detective
is on that case.

217
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,149
Well, not to worry.
I had a pro clean up the mess.

218
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,358
You don't understand.

219
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,236
The detective is good,
annoyingly good.

220
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,906
Well, then we just need
to find Amenadiel, don't we?

221
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,824
- Yes.
- And get the piece.

222
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,326
Because if we don't
get you back to Heaven

223
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:54,869
before the detective
gets to you,

224
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,372
then she is quite
literally toast.

So, I left Mum
in the wine cellar at Lux,

233
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,195
and that's the situation.

234
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:30,488

Ouch.

I still don't get

Because I need the best
bounty hunter out there.

238
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:37,954
I can deal
with the detective,

239
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,539
but I need you
to find Amenadiel.

240
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,457
Then we can get the pendant,
assemble the sword

light everywhere.

your mother explodes?

00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,174
Why should I care?

246
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:53,719
Because many, many humans
could get hurt.

247
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:54,554
Yeah, and?

248
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,430
Oh, nice try, Maze,
but I happen to know

249
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,432
there's a few
that you care about.

250
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,519
Fine.

251
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:03,771

my standard fee.

But, unfortunately, he got

He didn't deserve to die.

you have something.

No, no, nothing.
It's so frustrating.

294
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,550
Well, there is one
thing I'm waiting on.

295
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,344
- But I thought you
just said we had nada.
- Well,

296
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,553
so the only thing
we know for sure

297
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:00,930
is that someone
had to drive there

298
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:01,806
to dump the body.

299
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,642
So, the tech team is checking
the vicinity for cameras,

300
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,104
but it's such a remote place,
so don't get your hopes up.

301
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:10,564
Ooh, yes. I think you're right,
Miss Lopez.

302
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,233
Sadly, the only witness
to this one

303
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,235
is my dear old dad.

00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:17,071
Oh, right. Yes, your dad...
(clicks tongue)

305

...is always watching.

306
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,993
Wait a second.
That gives me an idea.

307
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:23,869
It does?

308
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,455
Satellite imaging takes
sporadic photos of,

309
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,249
well, everything, so...

310
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,583
So there may be footage
of the killer

311
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,085
going to or from the warehouse.

312
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,128
Exactly.

313
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,754

318

I actually thought

319
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,434
that God had lost faith in me,
but it was me.

320
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,852
I lost faith in him.

321
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,729
I can see that now.

322
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,776
That losing my powers
must have been a test.

323
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,114
And if so, I failed.

324
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:01,907

00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:09,123
Yes, and how was

So, uh, good job.

332
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:21,177
But there are a few subjects
that we try to avoid:

333
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,763
you know, religion, politics,
anything too polarizing.

334
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:24,638

00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:19,693
It was the only
vehicle parked

359
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,446
near the crime scene
between midnight and 5:00 a.m.

360
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:24,573
Yes, but how do you know this
parked van's even the same one?

361
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,116
I mean, there's no license
plates on this image.

362
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:29,078
Oh, come on! How many vans
have dandelions on the side?

363
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,789
They're not dandelions;
they're jellyfish.

364
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,624
What? Jellyfish?

365
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:34,834
LUCIFER:
Right, yes.

366
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,377
Well, I'm simply saying that

367
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,796
we should be focusing on
more pressing criminal issues.

368
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,840
- Such as?
- Well, I'm glad you
asked, actually.

369
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,591
The death of
Celeste McDougall.

370
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,134
Very suspicious, indeed.

371
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,470
- She was 92.
- Yes, and fit as a fiddle.

372
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,597
- I mean, look at that
smug face. Look.
- I know.

373
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:50,224
Yeah, I got it,
I got it.

374
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:52,476
LAPD!

375
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,811
Don't move!

376
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:56,856
You still think
we're wasting our time?

377
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,658
Definitely rethinking the
lasagna I had for lunch.

378
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,868
WOMAN:
Oh, my gosh.

379
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,202
This is not
what it looks like.

380
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,787
What? Minions day out?

381
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,081
Take your hoods off, slowly.

382
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,130
I know this looks bad,
but we can explain.

383
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:22,506
I'm Ava.

384
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:23,757
This is my sister Kathleen.

385
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:24,967
Hi. How ya doin'?

386
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,719
Friendliest serial killers ever.

387
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,221
AVA: Oh, that's hilarious.
We're not killers.

388
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,472
(laughs):
God, no.

389
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,266
We run Dandy
Lyon Cleaners.

390
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,685
Lyon's our last name.
Get it?

391
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,438
We take care of crime scenes,
dead body removals.

392
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,606
All the icky stuff.

393
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:39,982
But totally legit.

394
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,359
Yeah, like this poor guy,
died of a heart attack.

395
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:43,694
Like, two weeks ago.

396
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:45,446
Right, well, perfectly
good explanation.

397
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,156
- I knew it. Shall
we, Detective?
- Wait, wait, wait.

398
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:48,324
Why was your van

399
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,910
outside of an abandoned
warehouse in Eagle Rock

400
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,244
at 3:00 a.m. last night?

401
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:54,955
I'm... pretty sure
you're mistaken.

402
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,665
We were nowhere
near that area.

403
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,334
Well...

404
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,045
Ugh, no. Eagle Rock.

405
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,088
Do not tell me you went
to see Fred again.

406
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:04,882
I thought you were done
with that jerk.

407
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,176
I was, till I ran into
him at Jamba Juice.

408
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,011
LUCIFER:
Understand completely.

409
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,138
I mean, what's more intoxicating
than a Mango-A-Go-Go?

410
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,015
Alibi sorted.

411
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,225
We'll leave you here with Soupy,
and we'll be on our way.

412
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:16,810
- Come on.
- No. Wait, wait. Hold on.

413
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,145
Can I talk to you for a second?

414
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:19,813
- Yes?
- Enough with this.

415
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,899
Why are you trying to rush
our investigation?

416
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,817
Why are you still
hiding things from me

417
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,194
after all we've been through?

418
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,904
You know I don't
lie, Detective.

419
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,822
But you also don't
tell the whole truth.

420
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,616
Does this have to do

421
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,159
with what you were upset
about this morning,

422
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:33,327
with your family?

423
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:35,996
(sighs) Yes, but
I can't explain,

424
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,206
because you wouldn't
understand.

425
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,916
Not if you don't talk to me.

426
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,377
Never mind.

427
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:42,836
I thought
we were past this.

428
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:45,464
Going backwards, Lucifer,
is not good.

429
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:46,840
For anyone.

430
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,685
Trust me, dude, you're gonna
find this really freeing

431
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:58,894
once you get
the hang of it.

432
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,145
And I'll help
you through it.

433
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,398
Just takes practice.

434
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:04,900
You're a good man, Daniel.

435
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,527
(chuckles)
Yeah.

436
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,737
Ooh!

437
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:10,280
Okay.

438
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:11,740
All right.

439
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:13,409
Wow. You're strong.

440
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,285
(chuckles)

441
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,581
(quietly): That
family is so weird.

442
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,545
"You'll get
the hang of it."

443
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,088
"It just takes practice."

444
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,424
And that hug.

445
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:30,801
You guys doing it?

446
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:32,928
So, what are you
even doing here?

447
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,431
I'm bounty hunting you,
thanks to Lucifer.

448
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,683
Time to assemble
the sword, Amenadiel.

449
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,768
I don't know
that I want to, Maze.

450
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,979
Father entrusted me
with the final piece.

451
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,105
That changes things.

452
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,649
- Are you coming with me or not?
- Think about it,
Mazikeen.

453
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,318
All of my actions,
all of my feelings,

454
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,863
they were all
just based on lies.

455
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,157
You see, I thought
I had fallen, and I...

456
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:54,783
- (Taser crackling)
- (grunting)

457
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:58,787
I don't get paid by the hour.

458
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:00,247
(floor squeaks)

459
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,254
Oh, my God!
Are you going to Paris?

460
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:08,839
Can I be
your travel buddy?

461
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,382
I love Paris.

462
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,554
<i>Les hommes, oh, très sexy,
romantiques, avec...</i>

463
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:19,099
This is the Paris hotel
in Vegas, actually.

464
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:19,975
Oh.

465
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,685
Not... going there.

466
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,854
Vegas and me...

467
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:25,022
(whispers):
not pretty.

468
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,273
Yeah, I'm not
going, either.

469
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,192
But Kathleen Lyon's ex

470
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,861
Brad did, and according
to his Wobble page,

471
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,446
he's been partying there
all weekend.

472
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,781
Oh, well, that blows up

473
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,992
Kathleen's reason for being
in Eagle Rock at 3:00 a.m.

474
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,205
You think our two
sweet, "legit" cleaners

475
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:42,956
are up to something
not so legit?

476
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:51,757
Hello, Brother.

477
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,592
I notice you've
changed your look.

478
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,427
Where's your
pretty necklace?

479
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,888
Oh, I've put it
in a safe place.

480
00:18:58,097 --> 00:18:59,556
Ah. Keister it, did you?

481
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,725
Nope. Already checked.

482
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:02,601
Not there.

483
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:03,602
Lovely.

484
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:04,853
Listen, Amenadiel,

485
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,480
I need the final piece.

486
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,233
Right. So you and Mom can slice
through the Gates of Heaven

487
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,526
and destroy Father.

488
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:11,944
Yeah. I know.

489
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,320
(sighs):
Right.

490
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:14,738
Maze, darling,
would you mind

491
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,657
running down to the wine cellar
and fetching Mum?

492
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,408
I think she'd like
to hear this.

493
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,998
I've been thinking
about this, deeply.

494
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,793
And I think that we've been
looking at things the wrong way.

495
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:28,669
Oh?

496
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,462
That necklace
was a gift.

497
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,256
It's not some
manipulation.

498
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,591
Well, you only think that
because it was gifted to <i>you.</i>

499
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,926
No, no, Luci!

500
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:37,761
It's all about perspective.

501
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,847
Father doesn't
always make things clear,

502
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,057
because he wants us
to form our own beliefs.

503
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:45,269
And I strongly believe
that I am to guard that piece.

504
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,062
Now, I may have
lost my way,

505
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,606
but that doesn't mean that
I can't rectify things now.

506
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:51,692
Fine.

507
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,360
What if I was
to tell you

508
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,279
I never planned
on destroying Dad?

509
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,865
- I'd say you were full of it.
- Yes, I want to
assemble the sword,

510
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,867
yes, I want to cut through
the gates, blah, blah,

511
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,994
but then I was just gonna
kick Mum into Heaven

512
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,620
and slam the gates
behind her.

513
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,123
Let the two lovebirds torture
each other for eternity.

514
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,041
- And that's better?
- Yes.

515
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,084
No!

516
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,378
Regardless of whether
you're with Mom or not,

517
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,422
I simply can't
let Mom loose on Dad.

518
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,591
Now, it is finally
time that I go back

519
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,385
to being the loyal soldier
that he entrusted me to be.

520
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,429
Mom is not
going anywhere!

521
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,640
Well, I am afraid that we do not
have a choice, Brother!

522
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,601
Mum's powers
are returning,

523
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,686
and it won't be long
before we can't contain them.

524
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,354
I mean, she's already
killed one person,

525
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,023
and now the detective is on a...

526
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,234
the detective is on her case.

527
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,403
So, please,
no discussion.

528
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,572
- Mum has to go!
- (elevator bell dings)

529
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,116
MAZE:
She already has.

530
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,369
Your mother's gone.

531
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,164
What?

532
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,417
MOM: It's Cheval
something or other.

533
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:53,086
It's valuable,
so it must be good.

534
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,384
I wasn't expecting to see you

535
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,136
or your...
(chuckles)

536
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,305
deadly light back so soon.

537
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,140
Well, something's
been bothering me.

538
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,809
When you first
saw my wound...

539
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,187
you asked if Lucifer
had done it.

540
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:12,481
What did you
mean by that?

541
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,066
I meant nothing by it.

542
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,234
(chuckles):
You know?

543
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,819
Meaningless brain fart,
you know?

544
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,155
Just blah. Came out.

545
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,366
There was a lot
going on that day.

546
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:23,325
Hmm.

547
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,078
I don't think so.

548
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,456
I think, in fact,

549
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,124
that you know something.

550
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,001
I don't want to
hurt you, Linda.

551
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:35,879
I... am running...

552
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,756
out of time.

553
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,634
You've seen what's
happening to me.

554
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:44,304
So you can either
tell me what you know

555
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,473
over a glass of wine

556
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:50,978
or over your own
charbroiled corpse.

557
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:52,604
Your choice.

558
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,902
I came here to grill
Kathleen on the false alibi.

559
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:03,282
DAN: Whoa. Somebody
already had, huh?

560
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:04,866
Yeah.

561
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,076
It's Ava Lyon.

562
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,036
I'm thinking whoever killed Chet

563
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,414
hired the Lyon sisters
to clean up,

564
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:11,748
then cleaned up the cleaner.

565
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,792
Excuse me, what is going on?

566
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:14,918
I work here.

567
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,045
Ava!

568
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,047
Stop.

569
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,216
(crying):
Oh, my God.

570
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,136
What did I do?

571
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,722
KATHLEEN:
<i>It's me, only me.</i>

572
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,433
Ava knew nothing about it.

573
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,477
I wasn't lying about Brad.

574
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:34,896
I did get back
together with him,

575
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,734
but he gambles a lot,
and he needed money.

576
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:43,864
Then I got this call
offering me a hundred grand.

577
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,618
Who hired you?

578
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,829
Who killed Chet and your sister?

579
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,332
Maybe Ava's death was a warning.

580
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,585
For me to keep
my mouth shut.

581
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,295
Maybe if I don't say anything...

582
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,213
(sighs)

583
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,178
So how do we find Mom?

584
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,347
Follow the trail
of roasted humans?

585
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,932
Well, if anyone can find
that wily goddess, it's Maze.

586
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,477
- She's on it.
- (phone ringing)

587
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,981
Detective.
Everything all right?

588
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,857
CHLOE:
We found a body.

589
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:19,733
Another body?

590
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:20,567
A burned head.

591
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,611
- Same burned head?
- CHLOE: Yes.

592
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,905
So, what, you think whoever
killed Chet killed again?

593
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,032
Look, Lucifer,
it's a long story,

594
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,034
but the second victim
is Ava Lyon.

595
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,827
She's one of
the cleaners we met.

596
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,454
I have her sister Kathleen here,

597
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,373
but she's not saying anything--
she's scared.

598
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,124
So I need you to come here,

599
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,043
and I need you to do
your mojo thing.

600
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:41,254
Yes, Detective,
believe me when I say

601
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,715
I want to find the killer
as much as you do.

602
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:44,966
Hello, boys.

603
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,093
Mum.

604
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,677
What? What? What's going on?

605
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,971
I-I'm so sorry. My mum's here.

606
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,139
I-I've got to rush.

607
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,892
Good luck with
Kathleen. Ciao.

608
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,352
Damn it.

609
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,520
- What's wrong?
- Lucifer.

610
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:57,813
He's...

611
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:00,232
He's hiding something from me,
I can tell.

612
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,901
Oh, you know what? It's probably
just embarrassing family stuff.

613
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,195
I mean, they seem
totally bonkers.

614
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,029
Yeah.

615
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:07,030
Maybe.

616
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:09,408
He is with
his step-mom now, so...

617
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,661
So maybe...

618
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,123
maybe he's not hiding
<i>something</i> from me,

619
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,208
but <i>someone.</i>

620
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,627
Someone who knew Chet.

621
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,130
And someone I still don't trust.

622
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,006
AMENADIEL:
What have you been doing?

623
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,467
Oh... this and that.

624
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,345
<i>This</i> being firing up
the celestial barbecue

625
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,264
so <i>that</i> you can
grill another head?

626
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,058
No. I just needed
to get cleaned up.

627
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,351
Get some air.

628
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,645
I was feeling
a little claustrophobic.

629
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:42,607
Don't you just hate
being kept in the dark?

630
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:47,821
The good news is
you found Amenadiel.

631
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:50,949
So we have the piece?

632
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,242
Yes.

633
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:54,536
Yes. Well, interesting
story, actually.

634
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:55,620
Why don't you
tell her, Brother?

635
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,414
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
This one's all you.

636
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:58,999
Brother, I insist.

637
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,461
- Thank you.
- (chuckles softly)

638
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,378
Right. Well, uh,

639
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,422
upon careful
consideration,

640
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,340
we've decided this whole
Flaming Sword plan

641
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:08,550
is a crap idea.

642
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,676
Yes, crap.

643
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:10,927
Mm. Have you ever considered

644
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,013
finding, well,
I don't know,

645
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,389
a-a place of your own?

646
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,725
Yeah. Somewhere away
from Dad, maybe?

647
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:17,559
Yes.

648
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,269
LUCIFER:
Somewhere familiar,

649
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:21,104
warmer, perhaps?

650
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:26,735
You want...
you want me back in Hell?

651
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,403
Well, not <i>in</i> Hell,
per Se,

652
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:29,696
but in charge of Hell.

653
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:31,323
I mean, after all,
it is a kingdom

654
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:32,657
without a ruler.

655
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:33,825
He is right.

656
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,495
I mean, there's a great
opportunity for upward mobility.

657
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:38,955
Lick of paint
here or there.

658
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:40,749
The columns
would look great in white.

659
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,628
Beige?

660
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,757
(chuckles softly)

661
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,509
So it's true.

662
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,178
You <i>are</i> working
against me.

663
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:58,350
You never planned
on going with me to Heaven.

664
00:25:59,184 --> 00:25:59,809
Wait.

665
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,520
How did you find out?

666
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,606
Well, I persuaded...

667
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:06,942
your little doctor.

668
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,152
I'm sorry.
I had no choice.

669
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,529
What did you do?

670
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:13,198
Mum.

671
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:14,491
AMENADIEL:
Mom.

672
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,034
Listen, I understand.

673
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:17,285
You're angry.

674
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:20,705
Oh, I'm not angry.

675
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,667
Just disappointed.

676
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:25,710
(Lucifer and Amenadiel grunt)

677
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,676
(groaning)

678
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,972
Give me the piece!

679
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,390
No, Mom.

680
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:42,227
You're gonna have to kill me.

681
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:50,527
Guess I'll have to find
another way, won't I?

682
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,703
Well, now look
what you've made her do.

683
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,329
I've just had this tuned!

684
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:05,041
Me? How about you
suggesting Hell

685
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,669
as a retirement home? Nice.

686
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:08,587
Maybe if you had just

687
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,171
mentioned the pottery class

688
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,716
or water aerobics,
she would have gone for it.

689
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:14,634
Oh, and did you have
a better idea?

690
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,637
Mom's coming undone, Luci.

691
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:20,640
- In every way.
- I know.

692
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,726
And she doesn't care
who she hurts anymore.

693
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,686
Linda.

694
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:25,854
I'll go check on Linda.

695
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,981
You go after Mom;
she'll listen to you.

696
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,025
But, Luci, don't you dare
promise her that piece,

697
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:31,610
because I won't
give it to her.

698
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:40,076
♪♪♪♪

699
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,002
Well, well.
Someone's clever.

700
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:51,129
How did you get me?

701
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,214
Wasn't that hard.
We tracked your phone.

702
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:57,135
No, I mean, how did you
figure out I was the bad guy?

703
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:59,304
Did Little Miss Dandy Lyon
tell you?

704
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:01,014
It's over, Charlotte.
Put your hands up.

705
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,266
Oh, don't worry, I'm
not going to resist.

706
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,143
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

707
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:07,937
I just have one small request.

708
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:12,025
(phone ringing)

709
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:14,486
Detective.

710
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:15,987
Any chance you've seen my Mu...

711
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,489
MOM:
Looking for little ol' me?

712
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,448
You were right, dear.

713
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:21,284
Your detective
is quite good.

714
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:22,827
(Mom chuckles)

715
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,037
(whispers):
She caught me.

716
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,080
Where are you?

717
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,331
Santa Monica Pier.

718
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,957
Such a beautiful place.

719
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,210
So many people.

720
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:31,920
If you hurt anyone, Mum,

721
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,171
if you hurt her...

722
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,757
And if you and your brother had
just given me what I needed.

723
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:36,591
But who knows?

724
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,593
Maybe you still can.

725
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:40,804
Okay, that's enough.

726
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:41,888
Mum!

727
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:44,766
Start talking.

728
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,310
Just the two of us.

729
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,978
If that's all right.

730
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,106
I'd rather not
put Daniel in...

731
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,149
an awkward position.

732
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,070
Hate to ruin all the good ones
we've been in.

733
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,822
(clears throat)

734
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,115
Can we go outside?

735
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:01,241
Mm-hmm.

736
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,159
I'll be fine.

737
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,504
I'll miss you, Daniel.

738
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,465
You are my
favorite human.

739
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:24,597
(phone ringing)

740
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,224
Hey. You find Mom?

741
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,476
She's on Santa Monica Pier,
and she wants the piece.

742
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,437
(horn honks, tires screech)

743
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,231
We have to give it to her,
Amenadiel.

744
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:34,733
We've run out of options.

745
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:35,859
Please.

746
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,277
Brother, please.

747
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:40,822
She... she has Chloe.

748
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,287
Linda! You here?!

749
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,289
I'm tracking Lucifer's mom,

750
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,459
and I think she might
be on her way.

751
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,839
(groans weakly)

752
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:58,923
Oh, no.

753
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:00,550
No, no, no!

754
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:07,265
Linda.

755
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,850
Hey. It's okay.

756
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,894
I'm here. Okay?

757
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:12,604
You're gonna be fine.

758
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,734
She did this to you, didn't she?

759
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:21,529
(crying): She wanted to know
what Lucifer's plans were.

760
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,156
I didn't want
to tell her.

761
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:25,366
I tried to resist.
I'm so sorry.

762
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,452
It's not your fault, okay?

763
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,412
And you're going to be fine.

764
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,122
I promise.

765
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,957
I'm-I'm gonna fix you.

766
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:33,917
Okay?

767
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:41,466
(crying):
Help me.

768
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:45,512
Hello, Daniel.

769
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:46,471
Whoa!

770
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,139
Whoa, whoa!

771
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:49,724
She kissed me.

772
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,142
Literally no idea
what you're talking about.

773
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,101
Just get your hands up.

774
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:53,186
No, don't be silly.

775
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:54,813
I'm not gonna stab you.

776
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:56,022
I'm just looking
for something.

777
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:57,982
Come on, up. Up!

778
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:02,529
What are you looking for?

779
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:03,780
Uh...

780
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,657
- Hello.
- Whoa.

781
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,367
What the...?

782
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:09,494
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

783
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:10,995
Ah.

784
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,580
Ah-ah-ah.
It's my brother's.

785
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,707
He left it there for
safekeeping, so thanks for that.

786
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,292
You're a lifesaver.

787
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:18,086
Okay, Charlotte, this
has been a great chat,

788
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,629
but are you gonna
confess or what?

789
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:21,965
I'll never understand
why you concern yourselves

790
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:25,343
with one little human,
but... fine.

791
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,303
Yes, I was involved
in Chet's death,

792
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,472
but not in the way you think.

793
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:31,766
Well, correct me if I'm
wrong. You killed him.

794
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,726
You hired a cleaner to
take care of the body.

795
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,061
And then you
killed the cleaner.

796
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:36,062
Is that it?

797
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,189
The cleaner's dead?

798
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:39,232
(quietly):
What?

799
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,817
Oh, that's unfortunate.

800
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,319
I certainly had nothing
to do with that.

801
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:45,446
But if you didn't,
then who did?

802
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:46,781
LUCIFER:
Mom!

803
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:49,701
I've got it.

804
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,035
Now let the detective go.

805
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:51,953
Lucifer,

806
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,371
put down the knife.

807
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,290
You can't protect
your mother anymore.

808
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,833
I'm not protecting her.

809
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,459
It's you I'm trying to save.

810
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:00,295
Now, here it is, Mum.

811
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:03,298
I have the blade
and the final piece.

812
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:05,216
You let the
detective go,

813
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,634
and they are yours.

814
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,261
CHLOE:
Let me go? Really?

815
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,429
I'm the one holding her.

816
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:10,889
- Mum?
- MAN:
No one's going anywhere!

817
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:12,765
(crowd gasping)

818
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,976
Oh, I think we found
our mystery killer.

819
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,020
How can you be so glib?!

820
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,396
You were our lawyer!

821
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:19,480
You betrayed us!

822
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:20,940
Put the gun down, Hector.

823
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:23,151
HECTOR: Thank you for
leading me to her, Detective.

824
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:26,237
You promised to approach this
fairly, and you did.

825
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,364
But now I have to make things
right for my family.

826
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,407
LUCIFER:
Ah!

827
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,075
A little wrinkle.

828
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:31,910
You shoot her

829
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,828
and we're all dead, okay?

830
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,582
I need a hospital.

831
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:39,042
Yes.

832
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,168
Okay.

833
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:41,794
It's too far, Maze.

834
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:43,713
She won't make it.

835
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,841
We need to do something.

836
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,011
We need more time.

837
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,639
We just need
more time.

838
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:05,777
What are you doing?

839
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:09,113
Look, it's very difficult
to explain,

840
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:10,907
but believe me
when I say

841
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:13,701
that there are many,
many lives at stake here.

842
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:17,747
So, please,
just put the gun down, huh?

843
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:23,878
LUCIFER:
No!

844
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,471
♪♪♪♪

845
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:45,566
Amenadiel.

846
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,319
You son of a bitch.

847
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:53,992
How?

848
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:55,827
Go.

849
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:04,544
(groans)

850
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,476
I'm sorry, Mum.

851
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:24,981
But I'm afraid
that this ends now.

852
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,700
You've hurt so many people,
Mum. It has to stop.

853
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,161
You know that everything I've
done, I've done for, for us,

854
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:39,037
for our family.

855
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:40,788
You used me.

856
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:42,790
Used Chloe.

857
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,000
Me?

858
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:45,835
What about your father?

859
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:48,963
He created Chloe
just to manipulate you.

860
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:52,383
Lucifer, look.

861
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,302
We have the sword.

862
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:58,347
Finally, finally,
we can get revenge.

863
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:01,100
We can destroy him.

864
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:02,518
We can take our home back.

865
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,854
I'm not leaving, Mum!

866
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:06,064
Okay.

867
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,816
I can take care of it
for both of us.

868
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:13,738
Just give me the sword,
and I'll do the rest.

869
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:17,784
Please, son. I just...

870
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:21,746
I just want a chance
to start over.

871
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:25,208
But... going home?

872
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:29,420
That's not starting over,
that's...

873
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,464
that's going backwards.

874
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,760
And that's not good for anyone.

875
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,850
So it's time for you
to move forward, Mum.

876
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:48,439
Even if it means
I'll never see you again.

877
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,025
Lucifer.

878
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:52,985
No!

879
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:54,904
(yells)

880
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,533
Bloody hell, it worked.

881
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,954
I guess it can cut through
anything, even the world itself.

882
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,372
What is that?

883
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,666
It's-it's nothing.

884
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,377
At least, for now.

885
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,756
This is the real way
to move forward, Mum.

886
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:17,593
To create a whole new world,
your own world, without Father.

887
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,470
But what about you?

888
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,098
Amenadiel? My children?

889
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:25,143
You know that if
we go back to Heaven,

890
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,769
then there will be a war.

891
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:28,229
And in war,

892
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,607

00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,821
So what do you think
will happen to Charlotte?

947
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:28,784
Well, given her law firm's
track record, probably not much.

948
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:30,786
You know, the more I think
about it, the more I think

949
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:32,455
that Hector killed
both victims.

950
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:34,290
What, you think
he killed his own brother?

951
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:36,208
I think you would be
the first to agree.

952
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,502
You know, things between
families can get pretty heated.

953
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:39,462
(chuckles)

954
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:41,005
Yes. Heated.

00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,799
Oh, and Ella found a Mondo
blowtorch in Hector's car,

956
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:45,801
- so there's that.
- Right.

957
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:48,679
The only thing
I still don't understand is

958
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:51,015
you seemed to have
some inkling of this

959
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,808
from the very
beginning, so...

960
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:54,310
