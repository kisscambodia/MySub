1
00:00:00,893 --> 00:00:03,828
- <i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- So, you're the Devil

2
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:05,330
and you've left Hell behind

3
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:07,956
to take a vacation in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:07,957 --> 00:00:09,089
Well, where else would I go?

5
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:10,600
Your return to the Underworld

6
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:11,999
has been requested.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,049
Remind Dad that I quit Hell
because I was sick and tired

8
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,432
of playing a part in his play.

9
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:17,177
I got it.

10
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:18,743
The name, the whole Lucifer thing,

11
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,192
and desire's like your superpower.

12
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:21,676
More like a gift from God, really.

13
00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:23,148
Why don't I affect you, Detective?

14
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:24,696
I guess we both have our mysteries.

15
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:26,613
Chloe Decker is causing
your vulnerability.

16
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:27,332
I'm bleeding.

17
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,201
I've been sleeping with a demon.

18
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:30,628
I'm ready to turn myself in.

19
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,697
I removed a firearm
from evidence lockup.

20
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:35,640
Dad.

21
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,275
I'll be the son

22
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:40,178
that you always wanted me to be.

23
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:41,913
This is impossible.

24
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:44,015
Where's Maze?

25
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,851
I was gonna ask you the same question.

26
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:46,918
What does Father want?

27
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:48,120
Someone's escaped from Hell.

28
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:49,855
Who escaped Hell?

29
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:51,546
Mum.

30
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:11,877
Everybody, get the hell on the ground!

31
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:20,285
Fill the bag with everything

32
00:01:20,353 --> 00:01:21,620
on display.

33
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:22,754
Hurry up!

34
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,391
This is such a cliché.

35
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,326
I mean, for one,

36
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:29,728
those are all conflict diamonds.

37
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:30,795
Terrible karma,

38
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:32,330
but more importantly,

39
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:34,933
is this really how you want
to spend your time on Earth?

40
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:36,401
I don't know who you are,

41
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,637
but if you don't step
back, I will kill you.

42
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:40,805
But that's not what

43
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:42,274
you really desire, is it?

44
00:01:45,077 --> 00:01:46,244
No, it isn't.

45
00:01:46,312 --> 00:01:48,513
So, what do you want?

46
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:50,916
Freedom.

47
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:52,150
Oh...

48
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:53,733
just as I suspected.

49
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,864
You were tired of being
a prisoner, weren't you?

50
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:57,656
Yeah, that's right.

51
00:01:57,723 --> 00:01:58,963
I-I-I couldn't take it anymore.

52
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:01,493
So you wanted to break
your shackles, be reborn.

53
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:02,460
I did.

54
00:02:02,528 --> 00:02:03,328
So you escaped Hell,

55
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:04,586
looking for an empty body,

56
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:05,730
and found this poor sod,

57
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:07,506
who'd just died of a heart attack,

58
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:09,901
and now here you are,
wreaking havoc on Earth.

59
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:11,770
The jig is up.

60
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:14,105
We found you, Mum.

61
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:16,174
Wait, what?

62
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:18,410
You just said you wanted
to escape your shackles.

63
00:02:18,477 --> 00:02:19,511
Yeah.

64
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:21,613
When the paramedics brought me back,

65
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:23,381
I realized I needed to be free.

66
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:24,883
Yes, from Hell.

67
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:26,518
No, man, from debt.

68
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:28,086
I owe a ton of money.

69
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:29,998
And this was gonna get me
out from underneath it.

70
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:31,623
You know what, I'm sick of this.

71
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:33,391
The two of you are...

72
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:35,875
It's not Mom.

73
00:02:35,943 --> 00:02:37,176
Oh, you think?

74
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:38,288
Well, we had to check.

75
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:39,912
She doesn't have a body.

76
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,380
She must have entered a human form

77
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:42,815
of someone who's recently died.

78
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:44,460
Which means anyone who kicked the bucket

79
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:45,762
whilst you were sleeping on the job.

80
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:48,354
Luci, do you realize
he's the last one on our list?

81
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,290
Well, you must have missed one.

82
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:53,659
Or maybe she's not in Los Angeles.

83
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:55,061
No, she's here.

84
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:56,996
I kept her prisoner
for thousands of years.

85
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:57,997
She's coming for me.

86
00:02:58,065 --> 00:02:59,298
I know it.

87
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:01,133
We just need to get to her first.

88
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:03,803
Are you coming?!

89
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,705
In a moment.

90
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:08,908
There's so much punishment,
so little time.

91
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:13,779
...dead.

92
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,253
What's going on?

93
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,891
My mum's gonna kill me.

94
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,227
And before you say it,
that's not a metaphor.

95
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:29,962
She's literally going to kill me.

96
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,273
She's not the forgiving type.

97
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:33,966
You've never mentioned
your mother before.

98
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:35,101
Why is that?

99
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:37,870
Well, you wouldn't understand,
would you?

100
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:39,705
I'd like to.

101
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,175
Oh, all right.

102
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:44,243
Very well.

103
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,545
In human terms,

104
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:50,016
once upon a time, a boy met a girl,

105
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,018
and they fell in love.

106
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:53,352
They had sex.

107
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,822
The only trouble was,

108
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,165
they were celestial beings,

109
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:58,190
so that moment created the universe.

110
00:03:58,258 --> 00:03:59,692
Mm, the Big Bang?

111
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,194
Never knew how appropriate
the name was until now, did you?

112
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:03,929
Anyway, they became Mum and Dad.

113
00:04:03,997 --> 00:04:07,800
They had a whole litter of
kids, including yours truly.

114
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:09,201
And they built a house.

115
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:10,302
They called it Heaven.

116
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,337
They were happy.

117
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:13,205
Dad was...

118
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:15,808
well, Dad, and Mum...

119
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:21,647
Well, Mum was rather lovely
in the beginning.

120
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,917
But things change, don't they?

121
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:27,853
Dad started going into the garage

122
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:30,923
and tinkering with a little
project he called humanity.

123
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:36,162
Mum grew cold... distant.

124
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:39,799
And pretty soon, they were both
neglecting their family.

125
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:42,868
And then one of his children
started to act out?

126
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:43,969
Indeed.

127
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:45,504
Yeah... so Dad got pissed off

128
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:47,173
and tossed me out of the house.

129
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,642
And what did your mother do?

130
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:51,610
Nothing.

131
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:54,747
She just stood there and let it happen.

132
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,517
Anyway, a couple of
thousand years later,

133
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:00,319
Dad kicked her out, too.

134
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:03,322
Cast her into Hell
and put her in a cell.

135
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,059
So, I did the same
for her as she did for me.

136
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:08,761
Zilch.

137
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:11,997
Is it good to be back

138
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:13,365
on a studio set, Detective?

139
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:14,400
Not really.

140
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,604
It's bringing back memories
of your acting days?

141
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:19,792
If you're feeling nostalgic,

142
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,611
sure I can find some horny
teenagers and a hot tub.

143
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:24,821
'Cause the movie you were in was...

144
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:25,678
Yeah, I got it.

145
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:27,023
Is everything all right, Detective?

146
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:28,293
You seem distracted.

147
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,126
Usually I get at least
a glimmer of a smile

148
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,117
from my remarks,

149
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:32,318
the occasional eye roll.

150
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:34,620
I think I got a snort once.

151
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:36,388
Two days ago, you were
shot point-blank.

152
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:38,290
Ah, well, no need to
thank me for my heroism.

153
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:39,335
Well, maybe just a little.

154
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:40,292
No one's stopping you.

155
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:43,028
There was blood all over you.

156
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:44,173
- You should be dead.
- Well,

157
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:45,641
par for the course for our adventures,

158
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:46,632
Detective. What's new?

159
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,167
I have a sample of your blood

160
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:49,579
and I'm gonna take it and test it.

161
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:50,936
- Oh.
- And I'm gonna find out

162
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:52,872
exactly what you are once and for all.

163
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:53,873
- Yeah.
- Oh.

164
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,840
The Devil himself?

165
00:05:54,908 --> 00:05:55,918
No, I'm guessing Larry Morningstar,

166
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:57,382
the son of a plumber in Connecticut.

167
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,512
Right, well, wrap that up, would you?

168
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:01,180
'Cause I could use your help on my end.

169
00:06:01,248 --> 00:06:02,481
I'm on a bit of a manhunt.

170
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:05,417
Well, womanhunt, and I
need to find her before...

171
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:10,856
I'm too late.

172
00:06:10,924 --> 00:06:17,022
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

173
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:26,261
So, our victim's name is Gillian Taylor.

174
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:29,665
She was a stand-in for the lead
actress on Leave It to Leslie.

175
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:30,833
Stand-in?

176
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,901
Yeah, stand-ins are
used to light a scene

177
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:33,969
as the actors prep.

178
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:35,281
Usually want to be actors themselves.

179
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:38,107
And now she's dead because of me.

180
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:39,285
What do you mean, because of you?

181
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:40,637
Well, remind you of anyone?

182
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:42,544
That's weird.

183
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:43,746
What's weird, Ella?

184
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:45,514
Well...

185
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:47,816
you'd think cause of death would be

186
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:49,051
the giant chunks of metal

187
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:51,120
sticking out of her head, but no,

188
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:52,221
she was strangled. Look.

189
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:53,566
You can see the contusions on her neck.

190
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,124
So, the horns were added postmortem?

191
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:58,494
Yeah, soft tissue at the point
of impact is yellow-pink.

192
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,329
That means that there
was no blood pressure

193
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:02,464
when our killer went all stabby-stab.

194
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:03,298
And...

195
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:05,768
she was killed somewhere else.

196
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:07,202
This body was moved here.

197
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,995
So, the killer is sending a message.

198
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:10,549
Ah, good, so you agree with me.

199
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:12,474
I didn't say the message was to you.

200
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:13,753
Well, who else would it be for?

201
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,010
What the hell?

202
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:21,083
Oh, joy of joys, I thought
Detective Douche

203
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:22,117
was in jail.

204
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,318
He's suspended.

205
00:07:23,386 --> 00:07:24,820
Or at least he was.

206
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:26,488
Give us a minute.

207
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:27,523
Hi.

208
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,390
Hey.

209
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,992
What are you doing here?

210
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,727
I've been reinstated.

211
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:32,795
What?

212
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:35,030
After Malcolm and
everything that happened at Palmetto,

213
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:36,409
they wanted to sweep everything
under the rug.

214
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:37,966
And the only thing I confessed to was

215
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:39,354
improperly checking out evidence.

216
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:40,803
A gun that killed someone.

217
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,104
I didn't ask for this.

218
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,872
You didn't turn it down, either.

219
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,084
Would you rather I go to jail?

220
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:46,218
You think Trixie would prefer that?

221
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:50,579
No, it's just... it's a lot to take in.

222
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:55,617
I've been demoted.

223
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:57,052
I've been reassigned

224
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,988
to assist on cases, so...

225
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:01,490
for now, how can I help?

226
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:04,593
Uh, interview crew members.

227
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:06,962
See if they know anything,
any enemies she had.

228
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,197
I mean, you know.

229
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:09,565
Thanks, Chloe.

230
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:10,833
Yeah.

231
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:17,172
You're a newbie, aren't you?

232
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,974
Oh, hey, yeah.

233
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,509
Ella Lopez.

234
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:22,088
I just transferred in a couple days ago.

235
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:24,880
You must be Detective Decker's
civilian consultant.

236
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:26,715
Lucifer Morningstar.

237
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:27,583
Cool.

238
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:29,451
I was expecting

239
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,120
a different reaction considering

240
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:32,121
your choice of bling.

241
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:33,122
Oh.

242
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:34,923
Dude, I had a friend named Adolf.

243
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:35,924
Okay, Adolf.

244
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:37,103
I didn't hold it against him.

245
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:38,537
And besides, I think the Devil

246
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,262
- gets a bad rap.
- Oh.

247
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,697
- You do, do you?
- Sure.

248
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:44,333
I mean, what did he really
do that was so bad?

249
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,901
What, rebel against his dad?

250
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:48,370
Ask some naked lady
if she wanted an apple?

251
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:50,139
Be still my heart. Do go on.

252
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:51,840
I suppose he does run Hell.

253
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:54,276
That's not so great,
you know, with the torture

254
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:55,577
and eternal damnation.

255
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:56,612
I'm retired.

256
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,723
And besides, I didn't create Hell.

257
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:58,714
I just worked there.

258
00:08:58,781 --> 00:09:00,983
And now you're talking

259
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,317
in the first person.

260
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:03,385
Wait.

261
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:05,287
- Are you...
- The Devil?

262
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:06,955
- ...a method actor?
- What?

263
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:13,929
Not exactly an Emmy-worthy performance

264
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:15,063
from our child actor.

265
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:16,698
And her dick nozzle boyfriend.

266
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:17,643
Weird, for a girl

267
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:18,677
who normally doesn't wear mascara,

268
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,169
she's certainly wearing a lot.

269
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:21,670
I wonder why.

270
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:22,671
Trixie loves her show.

271
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:24,439
Oh, my God, me, too.

272
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,145
Sweet candy coating on the outside,

273
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:31,980
delicious evil on the inside?

274
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,515
Or she just likes the attention.

275
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,751
Either way, she's got a wall
of reps surrounding her.

276
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:37,258
I've got a call in to interview her.

277
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:39,488
But for now let's focus on Gillian.

278
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:41,456
Yeah.

279
00:09:43,593 --> 00:09:47,196
Gillian rented from me for four years.

280
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,565
Such a sweet, strong girl.

281
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,701
You know, I... I don't have
a daughter, but, uh...

282
00:09:54,404 --> 00:09:57,072
You know, she got so close
on so many auditions.

283
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,577
I... I really thought that
she was gonna break in.

284
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:06,682
This is my fault.

285
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,951
Why do you say that?

286
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:10,752
Well, I work as a set nurse.

287
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,987
I pulled a few strings.

288
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:13,822
I got her that job.

289
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,824
If she hadn't met Amy...

290
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:17,192
Do you think Amy did this?

291
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,028
No, sweet, darling, innocent Amy?

292
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:22,998
Oh, I'm sensing sarcasm
and general loathing.

293
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, that girl's a bad influence.

294
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:27,569
She has so much cocaine
up her nose, it would snow

295
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:29,448
- if you shook her.
- Yes, I've tried that.

296
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:31,073
The show kept it out of the news.

297
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,407
They even hid her O.D.

298
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:33,675
a couple of days ago.

299
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:35,911
Hospital was barely able
to start her heart again.

300
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,179
Well, hold on.

301
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,181
You're saying Amy died,
then came back to life,

302
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:40,593
and then an innocent girl was found dead

303
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:42,061
with devil horns shoved into her skull?

304
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:44,386
I... guess that's

305
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:45,554
one way to put it.

306
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:46,855
Yes.

307
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:53,003
Maybe Gillian wasn't
as innocent as she seemed.

308
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:58,141
Well, maybe she needed the cash
to fund her flamingo army.

309
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,343
We need to check on
Gillian's financials.

310
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,513
See if she made any large
cash deposits and, if so, when.

311
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,482
I don't know. Maybe we
can find a pattern.

312
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:08,218
Well, it doesn't matter, because
I know who the killer is.

313
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:10,654
Really? Who?

314
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:13,390
My mum.

315
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:14,924
Your mom?

316
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,145
It's a long story, but I think

317
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:19,295
my mum's soul is currently inside Amy.

318
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:21,141
She's the perfect choice
of host body, really.

319
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:23,299
Young, beautiful, worshipped
and adored by millions.

320
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,201
You're making less sense
than you normally do.

321
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,937
That's because you
still don't believe me!

322
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:29,506
Just test my blood, Detective.

323
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,241
Then we can have a real conversation.

324
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:46,156
Oh.

325
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:47,924
Look at you, all broody.

326
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:51,995
Suits you.

327
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:55,799
Well, don't worry.

328
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,367
Maze always turns up eventually.

329
00:11:57,435 --> 00:12:00,236
She's like a bad
penny... in tight leather pants.

330
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:05,675
Unless, of course, you
scared her away for good.

331
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:07,444
I scared her away?

332
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:10,747
Well, everything was fine until
you went all lovey-dovey on her.

333
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:12,761
Really? Because I seem to remember

334
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:14,384
her telling both of
us where to shove it.

335
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:23,493
Luci, you don't think she
helped Mom escape, do you?

336
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:25,595
Well, that doesn't sound
like the kind of evil,

337
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,997
duplicitous thing a demon
would do, now, does it?

338
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:29,733
But, no,

339
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,236
I don't because I found Mum.

340
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,472
- You did? Where?
- On a case.

341
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,774
And on top of that,
I think the detective's

342
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:40,844
gonna finally believe me
about who I am soon, so cheers!

343
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:42,479
Everything's coming up Lucifer.

344
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:45,381
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

345
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:47,617
She's going to test my blood.

346
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:50,620
- She's what?!
- Mm. Exciting, isn't it?

347
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,222
Humans can't have proof of divinity!

348
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:54,040
Just the detective.
I don't see the harm.

349
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,192
Sure. I mean, what could
possibly go wrong

350
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,496
if angel blood enters the police
department's forensic database?

351
00:12:59,563 --> 00:13:02,031
I'm sorry. Am I supposed to answer that?

352
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:03,767
You just deal with Mom.

353
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,468
I'll deal with this mess.

354
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:09,072
At least I got you to stop brooding.

355
00:13:10,274 --> 00:13:12,909
And you're welcome.

356
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,616
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey.

357
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:21,050
I interviewed the crew.

358
00:13:21,118 --> 00:13:23,953
For the most part, Amy and
Gillian got along great.

359
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:24,988
For the most part?

360
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,422
Yeah, they got into a big fight

361
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,026
a couple days ago as they
were setting up a shot.

362
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:31,761
Unfortunately, they weren't
rolling audio.

363
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:33,263
Well, I get the gist of it.

364
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,366
Gillian had a bunch of money
hidden away at her place.

365
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,168
And then this blowup.

366
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,369
What do you think?

367
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:41,337
Amy had a secret drug problem?

368
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,940
Then Gillian found out
about it and was blackmailing her?

369
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:45,452
If so, that's a pretty strong motive.

370
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:48,578
It is, yeah. Thanks, Dan.

371
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:04,727
Well, now I know where I got
my taste for the good life.

372
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:06,796
- What are you doing in here?
- Amy Dodd, eh?

373
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:08,464
Role model for teen girls,

374
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:10,300
awkward erection for their fathers.

375
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,735
A wolf in a sheep's tiny skirt.

376
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:14,797
It's very appropriate, Mum.

377
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:16,998
Who are you, and what
are you doing in here?

378
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,508
Yeah.

379
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:20,176
Let's stop playing games, shall we?

380
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:23,913
I know you're not who you pretend to be.

381
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,051
I know who you really are.

382
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,385
All right.

383
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,955
Attacking me would be a waste
of... What are you doing?

384
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:33,289
You can't do this!

385
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:36,059
I'm tired of everyone
thinking I'm so innocent.

386
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,894
But I'm not, and I'll prove it.

387
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,230
Please don't! Oh, God, don't!

388
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,398
Good Lord, that's... Ugh.

389
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,267
Mmm. Wait.

390
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:46,636
You're not who I thought
you were, are you? I hope.

391
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:48,905
Oh, I'm exactly who you think I am.

392
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,517
Well, then this truly
is the most evil thing

393
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,621
that's ever happened to me.

394
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:53,910
Just-just stop doing
the buttons and just...

395
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:54,921
just please...

396
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:56,045
Ms. Dodd?

397
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:58,982
- Ah.
- What the hell is going on?

398
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,485
Right. For once, this
is not what it looks like.

399
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:08,365
- I'm in so much trouble.
- We don't care

400
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,307
- about your drug use, Amy.
- You don't?

401
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:11,916
What we care about is
that you and Gillian

402
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:14,096
had an argument
right before she died. Why?

403
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,353
- Does it matter?
- We found

404
00:15:15,421 --> 00:15:17,122
a lot of cash at Gillian's house,

405
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:18,657
so if she was blackmailing you...

406
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:19,891
She wasn't blackmailing me.

407
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,193
She was my sober companion.

408
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:24,329
Well, clearly not very good at it.

409
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:26,798
The production company thought
it was a good idea

410
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:30,302
to hire my stand-in to
also keep an eye on me.

411
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,203
They thought it would
help keep it a secret.

412
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:34,172
- What was the fight about?
- I was getting

413
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,341
tired of her treating me like a child.

414
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:37,542
I'm an adult!

415
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,210
I can make my own decisions.

416
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:40,812
Clearly.

417
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:47,185
I'd gotten a new supply in.

418
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:49,721
She was trying to take it away from me.

419
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:53,158
Oh.

420
00:15:58,064 --> 00:16:00,165
Just take-take it all away.

421
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:03,201
A devil emoji? That's it.

422
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,070
I'm speaking to a copyright
lawyer today.

423
00:16:05,137 --> 00:16:07,172
So Gillian cut off your supply.

424
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:09,207
That must have pissed off
your dealer. Who is he?

425
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,575
I-I never met him.

426
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:11,876
All I have is a number.

427
00:16:11,944 --> 00:16:13,912
I'd text him, he'd messenger
me the drugs.

428
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,748
Okay, good. I'm gonna need that number.

429
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:18,750
Okay. Thank you.

430
00:16:18,818 --> 00:16:21,820
Okay, so the production company

431
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:24,456
confirms that they
paid Gillian under the table

432
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:26,191
to be Amy's sober companion.

433
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:27,178
That explains the cash.

434
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:28,760
I mean, I'm not saying Amy's innocent,

435
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:30,161
but I don't see a motive anymore.

436
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:33,865
Well, what about our
emoji-loving drug dealer?

437
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:35,053
Could be a show of strength.

438
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:36,812
Making sure no one screws
with him in the future.

439
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:40,405
I put a warrant in to locate
his cell phone, and, uh...

440
00:16:40,473 --> 00:16:41,544
What?

441
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:43,452
Do you still think this is about you?

442
00:16:43,476 --> 00:16:45,443
Of course I do, but it's
worse than I thought.

443
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:47,579
My mum is clearly playing the long game.

444
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:50,582
Taunting me with my own
distorted image again and again.

445
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,085
No, really. Do you really
think the drug dealer is your mother?

446
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:56,621
Well, she's clever enough
to pull it all off.

447
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:58,256
What? You thought I took after my dad?

448
00:16:58,324 --> 00:17:01,793
Oh. You don't have to believe
anything I say, Detective.

449
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:04,029
Test my blood.

450
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:07,332
Oh, dearie me, why are you hesitating?

451
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,867
Scared to find out the truth?

452
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:10,201
I'm not scared about anything

453
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:12,737
other than finding out
what STDs you have.

454
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:14,205
Very funny.

455
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:25,183
Hey.

456
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:47,672
Hey!

457
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,240
- How did...?
- What the hell

458
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:50,875
are you doing in here?

459
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:53,912
I'm sorry. I, uh...

460
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:56,181
I must have gotten lost.

461
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,889
Good night.

462
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:09,094
You don't think you deserve
any of the blame

463
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:10,628
for what happened with your mother?

464
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:13,364
No. That's between her and Dad.

465
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:14,499
Then whose fault is it?

466
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,168
Well, I suppose none of
this would have happened

467
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:19,204
if Amenadiel had been watching over Hell

468
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:20,115
like he was supposed to.

469
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:21,473
I thought that was your job.

470
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,642
Well, it was, but when I
abdicated, it became his.

471
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,778
Sort of like a game of hot potato.

472
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:29,414
And then there's Maze.

473
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:30,582
And what about her?

474
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:31,783
Well, she's still missing.

475
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:33,351
See, I'm-I'm worried she might

476
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,053
be involved in all this.

477
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:36,321
Might explain why Mum was able

478
00:18:36,388 --> 00:18:38,356
to hit the ground running
with my torment.

479
00:18:38,424 --> 00:18:39,457
And

480
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:40,859
I wouldn't be in this mess

481
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:41,970
if it wasn't for the detective,

482
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:43,394
and she doesn't even know it!

483
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:44,629
And why is that?

484
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:47,899
Well, when I asked Father
for the favor, I...

485
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:50,668
Look, it doesn't matter.

486
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:52,414
Even if I told her, she wouldn't
believe me anyway.

487
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:55,907
Sounds like there's a lot
of blame to go around.

488
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:57,008
Yes.

489
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:59,444
Is there anyone you
might be leaving out?

490
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:01,446
Anyone I'm leaving out.

491
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:03,448
Um...

492
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:07,485
Oh, you're right.

493
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:08,820
Yes.

494
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:10,688
If you'd fixed my existential
problem earlier,

495
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:12,033
none of this would have happened.

496
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:15,160
Well, good on you for taking
responsibility, Doctor.

497
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:17,428
It's very noble.

498
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:19,430
Ah.

499
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:27,138
I worry you're not gaining
anything from our sessions.

500
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:28,907
- What do you mean?
- Lately,

501
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:31,176
you're using our sessions as an excuse

502
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:34,212
to misinterpret what
I say for your own gain.

503
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,880
What?

504
00:19:35,948 --> 00:19:38,016
I don't think I'm actually helping you.

505
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,617
Are you breaking up with me?

506
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:41,152
I'm asking the question.

507
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,721
Are our sessions actually helping,

508
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:46,324
or just making things worse?

509
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:54,899
Lucifer?

510
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,769
You said you wanted to talk.

511
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:01,072
Hello, Chloe.

512
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:04,542
What's going on?

513
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,179
I was really hoping I wouldn't
have to do this, but...

514
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:10,915
recent developments have
left me with no other choice.

515
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:12,784
No other choice than to what?

516
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:14,819
You need to know the truth, Chloe.

517
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:17,155
About Lucifer.

518
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:19,257
All right.

519
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:20,525
I'm listening.

520
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:23,720
Oh, I'm not gonna tell
you. I'm gonna show you.

521
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:27,265
What are you doing?

522
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:31,785
Amenadiel. Amenadiel, no!

523
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:42,266
Okay, you're gonna be fine.

524
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,401
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
You're gon...

525
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:49,940
You c...

526
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:56,046
You're... you're okay.

527
00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:00,651
How?

528
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,587
Okay, this is going to
be hard for you to hear,

529
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:07,157
which is why I needed you
to see what Lucifer is.

530
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:10,596
No.

531
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:12,265
I don't believe it.

532
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:14,267
Good.

533
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:15,968
Because it's all a lie.

534
00:21:16,036 --> 00:21:18,671
Bulletproof vest and blood packs.

535
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:20,773
Are you insane?

536
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:22,675
You could have killed yourself!

537
00:21:22,743 --> 00:21:24,010
I was perfectly safe, Chloe.

538
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:25,645
This, by the way, is what Lucifer wore

539
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:27,023
when you guys confronted Malcolm.

540
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:28,858
- How would you know that?
- Because I put it on him.

541
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:30,483
He knew what he was walking into.

542
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:34,954
Listen, everything that he does
is part of a performance.

543
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:37,990
All right.

544
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:40,326
Then what about the weird
mojo thing he does?

545
00:21:40,394 --> 00:21:41,861
Neural linguistic programming?

546
00:21:42,763 --> 00:21:44,130
The power of suggestion?

547
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:46,332
Look, he studied it at a very young age.

548
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,935
And I hate to admit this, but
he's actually really good at it.

549
00:21:49,002 --> 00:21:50,713
What about the fact
that you two are brothers?

550
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:53,706
Come on. You've never heard of adoption?

551
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:57,443
Why? Why would he do all this?

552
00:21:57,511 --> 00:21:58,888
Listen, what you have to understand

553
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,514
is that my brother and I had
a very difficult childhood.

554
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:03,215
And to deal with it, he created

555
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:06,953
this persona for himself...
Lucifer Morningstar, the Devil,

556
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,355
incorrigible and invincible.

557
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:10,656
So he's a liar?

558
00:22:10,724 --> 00:22:12,325
Chloe, he means well,

559
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:13,693
but in the end, the only person

560
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,861
he ever truly lies to is himself.

561
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,933
Decker.

562
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:23,369
You tracked our dealer's phone? Great.

563
00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:25,137
I'm on my way.

564
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:26,939
Any other questions?

565
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:27,807
Yeah.

566
00:22:27,874 --> 00:22:29,742
Why tell me all this now?

567
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,044
Because you needed to know.

568
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:37,350
When I woke up a week later,

569
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:40,386
they'd written in a...
a wisecracking neighbor.

570
00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:43,856
You know, he-he got all the best lines.

571
00:22:43,924 --> 00:22:45,625
Your heart goes out to him, doesn't it?

572
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:48,494
A dealer trying to find
a buyer at an AA meeting,

573
00:22:48,562 --> 00:22:50,930
people at their most vulnerable...
that's really low.

574
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:54,066
Yeah. It's also not
something my mum would even care about.

575
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:56,836
Because... and I can't
believe I'm saying this...

576
00:22:56,903 --> 00:22:58,638
The killer isn't your mother.

577
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:00,740
Unfortunately, I think you're right.

578
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:03,376
Dear me, this has all been
a wild goose chase.

579
00:23:03,443 --> 00:23:05,611
Hey.

580
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,546
There's still a killer
out there, Lucifer.

581
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:09,181
And we tracked his phone to this room.

582
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:10,983
We've got to figure out
who the dealer is.

583
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:13,119
It was the lowest point in my life.

584
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:14,453
Thanks, David.

585
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:15,888
Thanks, David.

586
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:18,900
All right, does
anybody else want to speak?

587
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:21,560
Yes, I'd like to say something.

588
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:23,295
Thank you.

589
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:28,534
Hello.

590
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:32,071
My name is Lucifer Morningstar

591
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:35,307
and I...

592
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,942
love drugs.

593
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,211
Love them! Mmm!

594
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,414
Yummy, yummy, yummy. Can't get enough.

595
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:43,949
And... I've got lots of money...

596
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:46,752
mmm, that I love spending on drugs.

597
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,888
Not even picky. I'll do any of them.

598
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:51,257
Mix them together sometimes.

599
00:23:51,324 --> 00:23:53,259
You ever done a he-she?

600
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:55,628
No? A neon nod? A donk?

601
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:57,930
Ah. Yeah, he knows
what I'm talking about.

602
00:23:57,998 --> 00:23:59,932
That man has
definitely donked. Haven't you?

603
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,002
Uh, the theme of the day
is your lowest point.

604
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,404
Right, my lowest point.
Well, geographically,

605
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:06,872
that would be Hell, of course.

606
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,242
Hard to get much lower than that.

607
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:13,846
And...

608
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:23,055
Well, then I suppose it was
when my mother abandoned me.

609
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:28,561
Turnabout was fair play, so I...

610
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:30,996
abandoned her in turn.

611
00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:35,067
Didn't even give her a chance
to defend herself.

612
00:24:35,135 --> 00:24:36,702
I mean, what could she possibly say

613
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,071
that would justify what she did?

614
00:24:43,744 --> 00:24:45,945
What would she say?

615
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:54,153
Well, that was a disaster.

616
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:56,188
Actually, I thought
that was really impressive.

617
00:24:56,256 --> 00:24:59,024
- You did? It didn't draw anyone out.
- Yep.

618
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:00,626
That's not what I was impressed with.

619
00:25:00,694 --> 00:25:02,294
Hey, guys. Looking to score?

620
00:25:02,362 --> 00:25:05,564
Because I've got some really good stuff,

621
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:07,032
if you've got cash.

622
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,534
Are we playing show and tell?

623
00:25:08,602 --> 00:25:10,703
I got something to show you.

624
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:13,416
I actually found this on the
ground... this isn't even mine. I just...

625
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,909
No, it-it really isn't. I...

626
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:19,812
Oh, okay. Where-where
did those come from?

627
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,814
Right. Now I've flushed out your dealer,

628
00:25:21,882 --> 00:25:23,282
do you mind if I...?

629
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,850
Knock yourself out.

630
00:25:25,752 --> 00:25:27,086
Those really are not mine.

631
00:25:27,154 --> 00:25:28,733
Oh, of course they aren't.

632
00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:30,835
You don't really think I
could do that to someone?

633
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:32,971
I think you were pissed off that
someone blocked your meal ticket,

634
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:34,970
and I think you were
trying to send a message, yeah.

635
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:37,432
Yeah, but I couldn't do that. That...

636
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:39,734
Oh, God. Is that her skull?

637
00:25:39,802 --> 00:25:42,804
Can you take that away, please?

638
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:45,039
Not until you tell me
what you know about...

639
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:49,077
Oh, God.

640
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:52,380
That poor girl.

641
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:55,650
All right, if it wasn't you,

642
00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:58,920
then who would want to
make it look like it was?

643
00:26:00,322 --> 00:26:03,121
If she had a dealer
before me, you know, I...

644
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:07,895
I doubt... I doubt he was
happy I stole his best buyer.

645
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,258
Who was he?

646
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:56,504
Oh, there you are, Maze.

647
00:26:56,572 --> 00:26:58,106
I've missed you.

648
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:12,678
So, where the hell have you been, Maze?

649
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:14,762
Away.

650
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,164
Wonderfully vague,

651
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:19,100
but you'll have to be a tad
more specific, I'm afraid.

652
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,435
I needed you.

653
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:21,736
Oh.

654
00:27:21,804 --> 00:27:25,106
So I'm supposed to just come
running whenever you need me?

655
00:27:25,174 --> 00:27:27,575
Yes. That's exactly what
you're supposed to do.

656
00:27:27,643 --> 00:27:31,012
- And why is that?
- Because since fire and brimstone,

657
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,647
that's just how it is between us.

658
00:27:32,715 --> 00:27:34,082
Through thick and thin.

659
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:37,085
So, come on. Where were you?

660
00:27:37,152 --> 00:27:38,720
Shouldn't you be more concerned

661
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:40,488
with the guy I just saved you from?

662
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:43,991
Oh, please. I'm only
vulnerable when the detective is around.

663
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:48,730
So, who is he?

664
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:52,400
Amy Dodd's dick nozzle boyfriend.

665
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:56,637
- She's the actress from Leave It...
- ♪ Leave it to Leslie. ♪

666
00:27:56,705 --> 00:27:59,273
What? It makes me laugh.

667
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:00,787
Well, he must have seen me going into

668
00:28:00,788 --> 00:28:02,601
Amy's trailer when
I thought she was Mum.

669
00:28:02,644 --> 00:28:04,145
Jealous, were you?

670
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:06,347
Wanted to prove yourself to be a big boy

671
00:28:06,415 --> 00:28:07,749
by waving a knife in my face?

672
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:09,317
Wait, your mom escaped Hell?

673
00:28:09,384 --> 00:28:10,184
Yes.

674
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:11,853
Funny timing, isn't it?

675
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,721
She slipped out whilst
Amenadiel was injured.

676
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:14,822
And you, uh...

677
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,924
Well, where were you, Maze?

678
00:28:16,992 --> 00:28:19,494
Wait, you think I'm helping her?

679
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:20,828
Have you forgotten

680
00:28:20,896 --> 00:28:22,830
who actually tortured her in Hell?

681
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:26,033
Well, desperation makes
for strange bedfellows.

682
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:29,837
I've just pictured you
in bed with my mom.

683
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:32,106
Oh, I can't un-see that now.

684
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:35,309
So, Mama Morningstar's on the loose.

685
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:37,678
I never could break that woman.

686
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:39,881
She wouldn't submit.

687
00:28:39,948 --> 00:28:42,450
Seems like I have another chance.

688
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:45,686
You sure he doesn't know anything?

689
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:48,656
What is wrong with you people?!

690
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:50,958
Yes, I'm sure. Give me that.

691
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:56,430
I think he would disagree.

692
00:28:58,133 --> 00:28:59,273
Fine.

693
00:29:01,236 --> 00:29:03,538
I know things... about the murder.

694
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:06,774
We found the drug dealer with
the adorable devil drawings.

695
00:29:06,842 --> 00:29:08,910
- Case closed.
- You think Irwin killed her?

696
00:29:08,977 --> 00:29:11,813
- No, he'd never do that.
- Maybe, maybe not. Don't care.

697
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,424
You guys are with
the cops, though, right?

698
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:16,419
More of a day job
thingy... Got much more pressing issues

699
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,853
at the moment. Right, seriously...

700
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:21,622
if you weren't helping
my mom, then where were you?

701
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:25,226
Ah...

702
00:29:28,204 --> 00:29:29,971
I was with a friend.

703
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,206
Friend?

704
00:29:31,273 --> 00:29:32,607
Demons don't have friends.

705
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:36,077
Someone who's been helping me do some...

706
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:39,147
...soul-searching.

707
00:29:39,215 --> 00:29:40,926
What, like hunting them
down and killing them?

708
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,784
I wish.

709
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:44,852
That would be a lot easier.

710
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,120
No.

711
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:49,791
Now that we are stuck here,
I need to figure out...

712
00:29:49,858 --> 00:29:51,392
where I fit in.

713
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,595
And she's been helping me do that.

714
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:57,966
Thanks. I knew you wouldn't understand.

715
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:00,134
I barely do.

716
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:04,372
What?

717
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,241
Amy had another drug dealer.

718
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:07,475
- Go on.
- She used

719
00:30:07,543 --> 00:30:09,677
to score big from some
other guy before she got clean.

720
00:30:09,745 --> 00:30:11,679
But then Gillian cut him off completely,

721
00:30:11,747 --> 00:30:13,414
and the guy, he was super pissed.

722
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:15,617
Right, and where can I
find this other dealer?

723
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:16,751
I don't know.

724
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:17,885
- Oh...
- No, I-I-I swear

725
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:19,120
I've never met him.

726
00:30:19,188 --> 00:30:20,989
Look, he goes by the name of...

727
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:22,357
of Bobby B.

728
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:24,726
Lovely.

729
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:27,662
I thought you said

730
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,498
this case doesn't have anything
to do with your mom anymore.

731
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:32,033
It doesn't.

732
00:30:32,101 --> 00:30:34,235
Then why are you
running off to tell Chloe?

733
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:37,705
Well, maybe there are things you wouldn't
understand about me, either.

734
00:30:42,711 --> 00:30:46,247
So you guys are gonna
let me go now, right?

735
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,751
Of course.

736
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:54,255
After I've had my fun.

737
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:58,393
- Ah, there you are!
- Oh, hey.

738
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,695
- I've got some news on the case.
- Oh, me, too.

739
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:01,929
But go on. Ladies first.

740
00:31:01,997 --> 00:31:04,399
Well, our drug dealer's
alibi is still shaky.

741
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:06,801
Uh, but he did mention
there's another dealer.

742
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:09,470
- Oh. That's what I had.
- And Amy's lawyered up,

743
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:11,406
so we can't get anything out of her.

744
00:31:11,473 --> 00:31:13,274
And all we have on this "other dealer"

745
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:15,143
is that he's selling prescription pills.

746
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,377
Oxys. Percocet.

747
00:31:16,445 --> 00:31:18,705
Oh, not my faves, but
they'll do in a pinch.

748
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:21,726
So if the story stands, we're
looking for someone in health care: doctor,

749
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,830
pharmacist. I'm gonna go through
these booking sheets

750
00:31:23,886 --> 00:31:25,563
for anyone in the medical
industry that's

751
00:31:25,588 --> 00:31:27,145
been charged in the last couple years.

752
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,556
Right.

753
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:31,025
Feel free to jump in and help me.

754
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:34,696
Joy of joys.

755
00:31:34,763 --> 00:31:37,498
Oh, there is one thing that might help.

756
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah, what's that?

757
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,738
Bobby B.

758
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:45,773
What's that?

759
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:48,509
She was like a mother to her.

760
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:52,180
I have some issues
that I need to work out,

761
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:54,415
and I think I know just how to do it.

762
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:58,619
What?

763
00:32:01,857 --> 00:32:05,059
- Oh...
- What is wrong with you people!

764
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:06,711
You people are nuts!

765
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,171
So you're back.

766
00:32:21,076 --> 00:32:22,777
I'm here.

767
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:24,312
I wouldn't say I'm back.

768
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,180
You know I was looking for you, right?

769
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:28,149
After what happened?

770
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:30,251
Maze, what you did for me was...

771
00:32:32,888 --> 00:32:34,489
But you were gone.

772
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:38,326
I needed to get away from Lucifer.

773
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:39,427
And you.

774
00:32:39,495 --> 00:32:42,063
I need to figure out

775
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:44,532
where I fit in in
this world. And to do that,

776
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,200
I need some space.

777
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:47,635
From the both of you.

778
00:32:47,703 --> 00:32:49,871
Yeah.

779
00:32:49,938 --> 00:32:51,873
No, I mean, I was...

780
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,508
feeling the same thing, you know?

781
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:55,276
I think some distance between us

782
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:57,311
might be a good thing.

783
00:33:20,068 --> 00:33:22,470
Hey, can I ask you a question?

784
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:23,304
Shoot.

785
00:33:23,372 --> 00:33:25,540
Do you really believe in God?

786
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:29,644
Whoa. I was expecting more like,

787
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:32,046
"Hey, Ella, what's it like
moving from Detroit to L.A.?"

788
00:33:32,114 --> 00:33:35,249
"Hey, Ella, how'd you survive
growing up with four brothers?"

789
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:37,752
But the big "G"
question right off the top...

790
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,253
Did not see that coming.

791
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:42,223
- Okay, sorry, it's inappropriate.
- Oh, no, no, no. I actually

792
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,492
really like talking about
it. It's my faith.

793
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,928
It's kind of a big part of my life.

794
00:33:46,995 --> 00:33:50,431
So, uh, yeah, sure. Uh, hit me.

795
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:52,099
Okay.

796
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:54,836
Do you believe that
it all really exists?

797
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:55,803
What do you mean?

798
00:33:55,871 --> 00:33:57,538
Say, angels.

799
00:33:57,606 --> 00:33:58,773
Or the Devil.

800
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:01,542
That sort of thing.
That's all a metaphor, right?

801
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,444
Maybe.

802
00:34:03,512 --> 00:34:04,712
Maybe not.

803
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,614
Oh, okay. That's pretty...

804
00:34:06,682 --> 00:34:08,649
I just thought there would be more faith

805
00:34:08,717 --> 00:34:09,984
in your faith, I guess.

806
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:12,386
Oh. No, see, my aunt was a nun, okay?

807
00:34:12,454 --> 00:34:14,566
And she always taught me that
doubt was really important.

808
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,657
Right? I mean, if you don't
question something,

809
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:18,960
then what's the point of believing it?

810
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:19,827
Mm-hmm.

811
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:21,095
I doubt

812
00:34:21,163 --> 00:34:23,130
so that I can believe.

813
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:24,342
So, then, if you had the chance

814
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:26,501
to prove it was all real or fake,

815
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:27,502
would you do it?

816
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:29,871
I mean, that kind of defeats the point,

817
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:32,707
don't you think? It's faith...

818
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:34,375
Roses.

819
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:36,748
What? What do roses have
to do with faith?

820
00:34:36,749 --> 00:34:38,679
No, nothing to do with faith.

821
00:34:38,747 --> 00:34:40,781
And everything to do with the case.

822
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:43,651
Um, okay, so I-I found
nitrogen, right, on the rods

823
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,120
in the victim's head,
and-and it got me thinking.

824
00:34:46,188 --> 00:34:49,090
It could be almost
anything. And then I found

825
00:34:49,157 --> 00:34:50,358
the capital "K."

826
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:52,360
- Capital "K"?
- Potassium? Periodic table?

827
00:34:52,427 --> 00:34:53,827
Why don't you just skip to the end?

828
00:34:53,862 --> 00:34:55,930
And... rose fertilizer.

829
00:34:55,998 --> 00:34:59,433
Which also has nitrogen.

830
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:01,736
So the rods were taken from a garden.

831
00:35:01,803 --> 00:35:02,970
Exactly.

832
00:35:03,038 --> 00:35:04,372
Garden tools,

833
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:06,507
- lawn accessories...
- Like flamingos.

834
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:08,910
Well, yeah, I mean,
that's oddly specific,

835
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:11,345
- but, yeah, flamingos...
- Thank you. Thank you.

836
00:35:21,189 --> 00:35:23,024
Mr. Morningstar.

837
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:25,159
Hello, murderer.

838
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:26,994
Murderer?

839
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,830
I don't... I don't understand.

840
00:35:29,898 --> 00:35:32,833
Oh, Roberta, can we skip the
boring part where you deny it

841
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:37,104
and just, uh... Let's get
to the good stuff, shall we?

842
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:39,707
Does it help if I call you Bobby B.?

843
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:41,242
What are you talking about?

844
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,444
Oh. Oh, it's very simple.

845
00:35:43,512 --> 00:35:45,179
You stole drugs from the hospital

846
00:35:45,247 --> 00:35:46,480
and sold them to Amy Dodd,

847
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:48,349
your biggest client, who you met on set.

848
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:51,085
You introduced Gillian
to Amy, got her the job.

849
00:35:51,153 --> 00:35:53,688
But then she helped Amy get sober.

850
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:55,790
You felt betrayed, yadda yadda yadda,

851
00:35:55,857 --> 00:35:58,593
you killed her. Then you tried
to frame her new dealer.

852
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,727
Am I getting close?

853
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:00,828
That's ludicrous.

854
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,130
No. No, what's ludicrous

855
00:36:03,198 --> 00:36:04,799
is that you were like a mother to her,

856
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:07,401
and you sacrificed her
like she was nothing.

857
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:10,605
Did she mean so little
to you in the end?

858
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:12,974
Really? Tell me,

859
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,209
why would you do that? Why?

860
00:36:15,277 --> 00:36:16,644
You need to go now.

861
00:36:16,712 --> 00:36:17,712
Tell me why.

862
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:18,946
Stay back.

863
00:36:19,014 --> 00:36:20,325
You plunged two rods into her skull

864
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:22,026
to make her look like the
Devil. But, you know what,

865
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,417
she's not the Devil... I am.

866
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:26,106
Oh, ho, ho, ho! There we go!

867
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:27,310
I love a game of poker. Go on, I'll give

868
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:28,600
you a freebie, just
to make it interesting.

869
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:34,495
How is this possi...?

870
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,003
All right. Okay. Can we just...

871
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:49,173
have a-a time-out, please?

872
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,682
Is this a supernatural fire poker?

873
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,219
How is this possible?

874
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:05,156
Mrs. Beliard, it's Detective Decker.

875
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,158
Bloody hell. Of course she's here.

876
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,127
Detective! Detective, you need to leave.

877
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:14,799
It's gonna be over real soon.

878
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:23,874
I know someone's in there.
I can wait out here all day.

879
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:26,410
I took in that girl and I gave her a job

880
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:29,647
and then she cut me off
from my best customer.

881
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:33,184
So, yeah, I put three inches
of steel into her brain.

882
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,618
And I actually liked her.

883
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,887
Please.

884
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,089
Please don't...

885
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:40,291
- please...
- What?

886
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,326
What, you're gonna beg
for your life, huh?

887
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,062
...don't tell anyone...

888
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,331
that I died like this.

889
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:52,036
Just...

890
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:02,947
Nearly had her.

891
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,784
Yeah.

892
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,901
I'm never living this down, am I?

893
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,837
Not if I have anything to say about it.

894
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:29,673
You know, you weren't there
when Ella's forensic report

895
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:31,375
pointed us at Roberta.

896
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,683
So how'd you put this together?

897
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,678
Well, I was on the
Devil's business, Detective.

898
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,628
Look, even if I told you,

899
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:39,329
you'd just say I was being crazy.

900
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:41,498
Hmm. That's funny.

901
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:43,600
That's what your brother
was just saying about you.

902
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:45,702
Oh. Amenadiel talked to you, did he?

903
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,971
He did. He explained everything.

904
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:51,174
Was very impressive.
Filled in all the gaps.

905
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:52,709
But?

906
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:54,711
But I don't buy it.

907
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:56,991
I don't accept that you're crazy,

908
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:59,349
and I don't accept this "Devil's
business" either.

909
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:00,594
All right, so what do you believe?

910
00:39:00,618 --> 00:39:02,252
That I need the eggs.

911
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,754
Excuse me?

912
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:06,590
It's an old joke. Guy walks
into a psychiatrist's office,

913
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:08,525
he goes, "Doc, you got to help me.

914
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:10,694
My brother's crazy. He
thinks he's a chicken."

915
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:12,796
And the doc goes, "Well, why don't

916
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:14,231
you turn him in?" The guy goes,

917
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:18,302
"You know, I would,
but I need the eggs."

918
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:19,670
That's not very funny.

919
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:20,637
Yeah.

920
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,875
Look,

921
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:27,277
I don't know what your deal is,

922
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:29,680
but you make me a better detective.

923
00:39:29,747 --> 00:39:32,449
And you've always got my back.

924
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:35,385
What more could I ask for?

925
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:40,657
And you need the eggs.

926
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:42,066
Damn right I do.

927
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:47,356
Lucifer.

928
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:48,925
We don't have an appointment.

929
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,927
No.

930
00:39:50,994 --> 00:39:53,362
No, we don't. I, uh...

931
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:57,099
I just wanted to drop by and say...

932
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,935
thank you.

933
00:39:59,002 --> 00:40:01,304
And why's that?

934
00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:02,939
Because you were right.

935
00:40:03,006 --> 00:40:04,340
I've been blaming everybody else

936
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:06,152
for the situation I'm in.
And the fact of the matter

937
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:08,644
is that...

938
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:11,347
I chose to do nothing

939
00:40:11,415 --> 00:40:13,216
when my mother was cast out.

940
00:40:13,283 --> 00:40:16,319
To never ask her why
she did what she did.

941
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:17,553
So that's on me.

942
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:20,489
That's good, Lucifer.

943
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:23,593
No.

944
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,494
No, it's not.

945
00:40:25,562 --> 00:40:27,029
Why do you say that?

946
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:29,031
Well, I've assumed
a lot about my mother,

947
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,699
including the fact
that she wants revenge

948
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:32,201
for what I did to her.

949
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:35,271
- And now she doesn't?
- Well, it doesn't appear so, no.

950
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:36,939
And why is that a bad thing?

951
00:40:37,007 --> 00:40:39,575
Well, because, Doctor, if she's
not coming to kill me,

952
00:40:39,643 --> 00:40:41,410
then I don't know what she's doing.

953
00:40:41,478 --> 00:40:43,913
And...

954
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:48,251
