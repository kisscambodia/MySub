1
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:02,140
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,142 --> 00:00:04,367
- You slept with my...
- Whoa!

3
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:07,990
I know you had Boris
killed. And John Decker.

4
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:09,177
Aw, such a shame

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,513
- there's no evidence, right?
- You see, the Russians,

6
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:13,181
they don't like it when one
of their own is taken out

7
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:14,382
without permission.

8
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:15,917
I didn't think you had it in you.

9
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,185
I'm impressed.

10
00:00:17,187 --> 00:00:18,753
You want Perry to go to jail,

11
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:21,022
call Lucifer a liar.

12
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:22,257
"A liar"?

13
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:24,230
Lucifer is not a liar.

14
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:25,554
He is the...

15
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:28,329
best partner I have ever had.

16
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:31,566
And I can only hope
that he can count on me

17
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:33,768
as much as I count on him.

18
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,069
Your Father put her here.

19
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,588
In Lucifer's path.

20
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:38,873
It means Chloe's not an obstacle.

21
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,476
She's how we'll get it all back.

22
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:42,577
Detective...

23
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:45,046
what you said today in the courtroom...

24
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:46,147
It was the truth.

25
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:06,367
I, um...

26
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:07,802
What?

27
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:11,105
Well, I-I got you burgers and
fries but I forgot the ketchup.

28
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:13,475
I hate ketchup.

29
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:16,611
Foolish condiment.

30
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:18,577
Lucifer!

31
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:20,014
Hello!

32
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:22,684
This is your flight attendant speaking.

33
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:24,652
Please buckle up.

34
00:01:24,654 --> 00:01:26,621
Jana?

35
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:29,757
I didn't know you
were expecting company.

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,593
I wasn't. I...

37
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:33,728
Surprise layover in L.A.,

38
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,264
I thought we could rack up some miles.

39
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:41,002
She's welcome to join, if she's game.

40
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:43,338
Excuse me.

41
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,106
Wait. No... Detective.

42
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,842
I had no idea that Jana was coming over.

43
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:50,007
It's okay. I'll let you two catch up.

44
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:51,646
Detective, please! Come on.

45
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:55,016
I mean, we were... we
were having a moment.

46
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:56,518
Don't be angry.

47
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,353
I'm not angry.

48
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:01,589
I'm... glad she showed up.

49
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:03,758
- You are?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,762
She just kept me from
making a big mistake.

51
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:09,898
Detective!

52
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:15,203
I... Jana...

53
00:02:15,205 --> 00:02:17,472
Wheels up, Captain?

54
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:20,575
I'm afraid this flight's grounded.

55
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:26,748
As long as you are mine

56
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,183
As long as you are mine

57
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:35,456
As long as you are mine.

58
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,495
You want some juice
with your eggs, honey?

59
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:43,236
- I don't like eggs.
- What?

60
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,028
Since when don't you like eggs?

61
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:49,604
They're a wondrously
scrumptious start to your day.

62
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:50,939
Give me that.

63
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,685
Who got you this? Maze?

64
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,008
They're my favorite.

65
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,110
Please, please, Mommy?

66
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:58,613
Honey...

67
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:00,982
Okay. But only because
I missed story time.

68
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:02,884
Were you working last night?

69
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:05,053
Uh, no.

70
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:06,754
I had a little dinner.

71
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:08,923
With who?

72
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:11,392
Uh, Lucifer.

73
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:12,460
Oh.

74
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:14,395
So if you weren't working,

75
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:15,697
was it, like, a date?

76
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:20,001
With flowers and candles
and songs about naked stuff?

77
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:21,669
No! Definitely no.

78
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:25,306
It wasn't a... it wasn't
a date. It-it really wasn't.

79
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:27,675
Then why are your cheeks
getting red, Mommy?

80
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:30,712
My cheeks aren't getting red...

81
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,583
Check it out.

82
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:39,287
Oh. Yeah. I had no idea
you were so concerned

83
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,955
about L.A.'s water shortages.

84
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:42,223
- What? No.
- Yeah.

85
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:43,925
Wrong side.

86
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:46,027
Someone got his ass.

87
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:47,495
Yeah.

88
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:48,997
Monkey, go get your backpack.

89
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:51,399
I'm good. I'll stay here.

90
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,474
Yeah. Someone told me he
died this morning. I heard.

91
00:03:59,476 --> 00:04:01,909
Wait, why aren't you happy?

92
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:04,606
Your father's killer
finally got what he deserved.

93
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:07,459
What Perry Smith deserved
was to rot in jail

94
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:08,850
for the rest of his life.

95
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:10,885
But still.

96
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:13,921
Pretty awesome that
someone took him out, right?

97
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:15,623
I bet it hurt.

98
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,991
A lot.

99
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:20,328
Whoever did this is
no better than he was.

100
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:24,399
Save yourself

101
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,402
Last night

102
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:30,338
You didn't look at me this way

103
00:04:32,776 --> 00:04:35,877
Ooh...

104
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:40,381
Lucifer.

105
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:42,617
There's something very
important we need to discuss.

106
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:45,286
New visitors policy. Hot
women turning up unannounced

107
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:46,454
are no longer welcome.

108
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:48,389
Especially those who
are secretly my mother.

109
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:50,191
Well, I think you'll make an exception

110
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:52,060
when you hear what I have to say.

111
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:55,630
Well, spit it out. I don't
have an eternity here.

112
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:57,398
Oh, yes. Actually, I do.

113
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,833
I just want you gone.

114
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:01,969
It's about Chloe.

115
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,139
What have you done this time?

116
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:09,811
Son, I don't know how to tell you this.

117
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:12,180
What is it, Mum?

118
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:14,749
I...

119
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:17,218
...was wrong.

120
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:18,702
I wanted to prove to you

121
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:20,221
that Chloe wasn't worthy of you.

122
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:22,824
I gave her every
incentive to turn on you.

123
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:24,659
But she didn't.

124
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:27,028
She impressed me.

125
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,864
I'm starting to understand
what you see in her.

126
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:35,203
But, uh, regardless, it's a moot point.

127
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:36,875
Why's that?

128
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,842
Because what you couldn't
destroy, I did all on my own.

129
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:42,610
Oh?

130
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:47,882
Look, just call it a case
of stewardess interruptus.

131
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,984
Perhaps it was for the best.

132
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:53,087
I know you don't believe that.

133
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:55,923
I don't know

134
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:57,658
what happened between you two.

135
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,329
But I do know that Chloe
proved herself to you.

136
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:04,866
Maybe now it's your turn.

137
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:08,970
Maybe now it's time that
you prove yourself to her.

138
00:06:12,175 --> 00:06:13,274
You don't have

139
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:14,842
to prove anything to me.

140
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:16,744
Well, normally, I would
agree with you. But you insist

141
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,880
on letting an impossibly
attractive flight attendant

142
00:06:18,882 --> 00:06:20,848
come between us. And not in the fun way.

143
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,550
Lucifer, we are very different people

144
00:06:22,552 --> 00:06:24,152
with very different personalities,

145
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:25,319
and I'm not judging.

146
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:27,889
I'm a homicide detective,
not the slut police.

147
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:29,357
And I mean you, not her.

148
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,092
Nothing happened after you left.

149
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,660
Not my business if it did.

150
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:34,796
No. But what I'm saying
is things have changed now,

151
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:36,898
since we had our moment.

152
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:38,828
We didn't have a moment.

153
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,742
Yes we did. And I can assure you

154
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,702
Detective, I will never lay eyes
on that flight attendant again.

155
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:50,411
You sure about that?

156
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,980
Oh, no. Jana.

157
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:55,583
Always with the tragic timing.

158
00:06:57,026 --> 00:07:02,944
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

159
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:12,285
Doesn't seem to be a mugging.
Cash, credit card, keys,

160
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:13,820
all still here.

161
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:15,988
- Can you look for her phone?
- Yes.

162
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,257
Thanks.

163
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:21,227
I'm sorry about your friend.

164
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:23,461
I don't think I deserve the term.

165
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:24,963
We hardly knew each other, really.

166
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:27,098
So a woman showed up
to your house for sex

167
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,867
and you barely knew her? Of
course that's what happened.

168
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,603
Guilty as charged.

169
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:34,138
You want to tell me
what happened last night?

170
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,475
Jana left five minutes
after you did. Alive.

171
00:07:37,477 --> 00:07:40,151
I believe you, but can anyone
else confirm your story?

172
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:44,292
Well, I was with 300 of my
closest strangers in Lux.

173
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,517
I went to the bar right after she left.

174
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,519
Well, what about the five
minutes before she left?

175
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:51,155
Are you jealous, Detective?

176
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:54,058
No. I'm just trying to
piece together a timeline.

177
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,994
A lot can happen in five minutes.

178
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:57,395
You can't be suggesting...

179
00:07:57,397 --> 00:07:58,963
That you slept with her? I'm not.

180
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:00,264
No. That I'm a two-pump chump.

181
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,100
If we'd slept together,
she wouldn't have left

182
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:05,136
until the morning. Believe me.

183
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:07,305
Maybe she'd still be alive.

184
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:09,340
Okay, what else can
you tell me about Jana?

185
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:11,409
I need to put together a victim profile.

186
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:13,745
Well, I mean, she gave incredible...

187
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:15,980
And I'm not talking
about her sexual skills.

188
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:17,982
- Right.
- Maybe her last name,

189
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:20,284
friends, family, where she was
staying when she was in L.A.?

190
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:21,753
I'm a lover, not a Rolodex.

191
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:23,388
Detective.

192
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,522
Found it in the tunnel.

193
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,591
Thank you.

194
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:29,975
All threatening texts.

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,633
All sent from the same number.

196
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:34,265
This last one, just before
she got to your place.

197
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:36,934
"Ditch the loser from Lux"?

198
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:39,570
Oh, this is terrible. She was
seeing someone else at Lux?

199
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:42,840
I think it means you.

200
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:48,780
The number on Jana's cell

201
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:52,150
belongs to a wealthy Silicon
Valley guy, Andy Kleinberg.

202
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:53,584
We tracked his phone's GPS

203
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:56,821
to some swanky Malibu beach house.

204
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:01,259
I'll send you the address, Chloe.

205
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:04,395
What the hell are you doing here?

206
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:06,164
You see this?

207
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:09,901
We're basically famous.

208
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:11,369
Are you nuts?

209
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:14,172
You brag about what we
did in a police precinct?

210
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:16,140
Dude. Chill.

211
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:18,109
- I was coming to get my check.
- Yeah.

212
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,545
And I thought

213
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:22,747
that we could, uh,
celebrate our righteous kill.

214
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:27,285
We didn't kill anyone, okay?

215
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:28,286
We just...

216
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:31,522
We gave karmic justice a little nudge.

217
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:34,292
Oh. Is that what we're
calling the Russian mob now?

218
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:36,828
Shh!

219
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:38,025
Come on!

220
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,640
Let's grab some vodka,
we'll make it a theme.

221
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:43,078
Maze, we're not having a drink.

222
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:44,235
We shouldn't even be seen together

223
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:46,704
until all this blows
over. Do you get it?

224
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,324
Trying to blend in?

225
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:09,527
Well, it's not often I
get to break out the linen.

226
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,729
Speaking of style, I've got
to get one of these for Lux.

227
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:14,565
Yeah, that would really
tie the place together.

228
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,000
- Look, for the last time...
- Hey, Lucifer.

229
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:17,935
Yes. Hello. For the
last time, Detective,

230
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:19,771
nothing happened with
Jana after you left.

231
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:20,872
I believe you.

232
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:22,340
- It just doesn't...
- Hey, Lucifer.

233
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:23,741
...change anything.

234
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:25,042
Well, why not?

235
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:28,112
Well, look at this party.

236
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:30,314
I bet this is your your
definition of fun, isn't it?

237
00:10:30,316 --> 00:10:32,984
Well, I mean, I prefer scotch in
a lowball to sex on the beach...

238
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:36,120
and the drink, I mean.
But dealer's choice.

239
00:10:36,122 --> 00:10:37,955
Okay, well, fun for me

240
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:39,690
is being home with
Trixie, reading her a book.

241
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:40,825
Really?

242
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:42,960
Yeah.

243
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:45,563
And that's okay, but we're different.

244
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:46,664
Like, too different.

245
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,733
Well, as a wise man once said,

246
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:50,468
"opposites attract."

247
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,069
I believe that was an animated cat

248
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:53,004
in a music video.

249
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,473
- A wise animated cat.
- Excuse me.

250
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:57,942
Hi. I am looking for Andy Kleinberg.

251
00:10:57,944 --> 00:10:59,377
Do you know where he is?

252
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:01,746
Don't waste your time with him.

253
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:02,847
Let me get you a drink.

254
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:04,782
Keep it in your pants, Tommy Bahama.

255
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:05,950
She's spoken for, thank you.

256
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:07,218
No, I'm not.

257
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,853
So do you know where Andy is?

258
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:11,189
Your loss.

259
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:14,826
Oh. Thank you.

260
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:16,394
Andy Kleinberg?

261
00:11:16,396 --> 00:11:17,698
You're blocking my view.

262
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:19,990
The view from a jail cell sucks, too.

263
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:21,666
What, is this a joke?

264
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:23,334
Wait, is this one of George's pranks

265
00:11:23,336 --> 00:11:25,636
to get me back for that stripper?

266
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:26,904
Hey, are you a stripper?

267
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:29,040
I'd recommend you stop talking now.

268
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,209
Jana Lawrence was found
murdered this morning.

269
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:33,942
She was my stewardess on
my flight yesterday. So?

270
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,690
So you sent her a threatening text.

271
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:36,981
"Ditch the loser from Lux."

272
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:38,015
Yeah.

273
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:39,083
She said she was hooking up

274
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:40,718
with some DJ named Lucifer.

275
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,321
DJ? How dare you!

276
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:44,589
"Meet me now, or else"?

277
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:48,759
Yeah, or else this is shut off. No mas.

278
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:50,107
Look, I sent that text

279
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:51,629
to, like, 25 girls last night.

280
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:53,497
It's called a "booty
call." You ever have one?

281
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:55,466
Of course not. Booties call me.

282
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:57,119
Sometimes.

283
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:58,544
Look, is there anyone who can prove

284
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:00,201
you not having sex?

285
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:01,359
Oh, I had sex.

286
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:02,550
Meet Sharon.

287
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:04,901
Hey, Lucifer.

288
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:05,926
Oh, yeah.

289
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,589
She can attest to my whereabouts

290
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:08,679
all night long.

291
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:10,615
And she can, too.

292
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:13,084
Now... if you'll excuse me,

293
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:17,121
I'd like to go somewhere
where you two are not.

294
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:22,727
- Charming.
- You know...

295
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:24,495
you and him have a lot in common.

296
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:26,330
We are nothing alike.

297
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:27,847
Really? Right.

298
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,401
Well, that is clearly off the rack.

299
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:31,402
Inferior linen.

300
00:12:31,404 --> 00:12:32,570
Not remotely the same.

301
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:34,338
Regardless, I don't
think he's our killer.

302
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,774
Let's go talk to your friend Sharon.

303
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:38,376
See if his alibi checks out.

304
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:40,478
She's not my friend. She's
just a woman that I...

305
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,246
No, actually, that's worse.

306
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:43,547
Right, where to, then?

307
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:45,216
There's been another murder.

308
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:47,285
Ballistics match our flight attendant.

309
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,438
The victim was in the
shower when he was killed.

310
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:59,570
Signs of a struggle. Looks
like he was tortured, too.

311
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:01,064
So Jana's killer had it in

312
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:03,834
for this poor chap as well, did they?

313
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,469
On the upside, looks like he didn't have

314
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:07,571
anything to do with this case after all.

315
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:10,841
Pretty sure you didn't
sleep with this guy.

316
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:15,179
Uh, actually, you're wrong
about that, Detective.

317
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:20,017
Raj. So fit.

318
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:22,719
This isn't good.

319
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,488
What, that a man was one of my lovers?

320
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,523
Come now, Detective,
it's the 21st century.

321
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:27,858
It's not that,

322
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,760
it's that you slept with both victims.

323
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:31,228
We've been trying to find a connection

324
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,896
between the two, and so far

325
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:34,164
all we have is you.

326
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,566
Well, I wish I could help you.

327
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:37,467
What, you didn't get details
between the sweet nothings?

328
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:38,502
Quite a few, actually.

329
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:40,337
But they were mostly
about what he desired,

330
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,905
which I doubt you want to hear.

331
00:13:43,842 --> 00:13:45,842
What if this whole
thing is about desire?

332
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:47,144
You've been with a lot of people.

333
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:48,512
What if one of them got jealous

334
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:49,780
and wanted you all to themselves?

335
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:51,415
What, you think one of my exes is

336
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:52,549
killing off the others?

337
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:55,419
Look, I've seen what
your exes are capable of.

338
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:56,887
Charlotte Richards, to name one.

339
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:58,388
Bloody hell, for the last time,

340
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,923
she is not an ex.

341
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:02,259
Either way, we should warn them

342
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:03,493
that they could be in trouble.

343
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:05,529
While Dan's looking
into other connections

344
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:06,964
between our victims, we should talk to

345
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:08,440
anyone you've slept with.

346
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:09,933
Oh, that's a brilliant plan.

347
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:10,910
It is?

348
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,903
Well, what better way
to prove my word to you

349
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:14,671
than a bevy of exes singing my praises?

350
00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:16,006
Sure.

351
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:17,341
That's definitely what's gonna happen.

352
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,709
- Yeah.
- Okay,

353
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:20,344
a list of everyone you've slept with

354
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:22,346
in the last eight weeks.

355
00:14:22,348 --> 00:14:24,815
Right, you'll need a
much bigger notepad.

356
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:26,583
One, two, three, unh!

357
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:33,690
Hot pants

358
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:35,692
Hey, hot pants

359
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:37,294
Unh, no, hey

360
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:39,363
Ha

361
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:40,897
Hot pants

362
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:43,367
Hey, hot pants

363
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:44,434
Smokin'

364
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,106
Ow!

365
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:50,674
Girl over there

366
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:53,176
With the hot pants on

367
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:55,646
Filthy MacNasty

368
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:57,214
All night long

369
00:14:57,216 --> 00:14:59,149
Get down...

370
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,717
Wow.

371
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,818
You slept with all of them?

372
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,621
Yes. Bit of a dry spell
the last couple of months.

373
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:06,523
This is a waste of time.

374
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,625
I refuse to believe that
one of my former lovers

375
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:09,593
would kill another.

376
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:10,899
Yeah, well, so far we don't have

377
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:12,123
any other connections.

378
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:14,048
And people will go to crazy lengths

379
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:16,600
for the ones they love,
even if they're the ones

380
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:18,835
who suggested the split...

381
00:15:18,837 --> 00:15:21,838
and still have feelings,
even though they shouldn't.

382
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,675
What on earth are you talking about?

383
00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:27,210
Did I just say that out loud?

384
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:30,514
- Yes.
- Oh. Never mind.

385
00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:32,452
Right.

386
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:34,128
It was an amazing,

387
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:36,153
amazing night.

388
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:38,088
But the next day, Lucifer was with

389
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,158
another woman, so did
that make you jealous?

390
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,226
Jealous? Why?

391
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:45,062
Well, because he basically

392
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:47,064
used you for sex and moved on.

393
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,366
- Did that bother you?
- I knew what I was in for.

394
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:50,334
And what were you in for?

395
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:52,736
The best night of my life.

396
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:54,104
The best night of my life.

397
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:55,739
The best night of my life.

398
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:56,940
The best night of my life.

399
00:15:56,942 --> 00:15:59,361
The best night of my life.

400
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:00,811
You know, this is actually feeling

401
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:02,690
a bit masturbatory, even for me.

402
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:05,174
Though clearly not
the words of a killer.

403
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,294
He knew exactly what I wanted.

404
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:08,919
And he did this thing...

405
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:10,554
He did this thing...

406
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:13,090
He even did this thing with a Pan flute

407
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:14,691
and a butternut squash...

408
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:16,259
I was improvising.

409
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:17,768
I didn't have any zucchinis.

410
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:21,398
He did this thing with
my Tibetan singing pot

411
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,333
and artisan honey.

412
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:24,534
It's a game I play called,

413
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:26,273
"Do I make you horny, honey?"

414
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:27,849
...with some Vaseline and a car battery.

415
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,740
- What?
- That was a move I call,

416
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:31,108
"Gentlemen, start your engines."

417
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,143
It's bloody brilliant.

418
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:37,047
Did you and Lucifer have
any intimate moments?

419
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:38,881
Obviously, we were intimate.

420
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:40,761
We were hella intimate. Mm!

421
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:42,519
Did you not hear about
the honey? I mean...

422
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:48,392
We're talking about,
um, emotional intimacy.

423
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:49,926
Like, um...

424
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:53,730
did Lucifer, uh, bring you dinner?

425
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:56,500
Or did he

426
00:16:56,502 --> 00:16:58,935
do anything special for you?

427
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:01,238
Get you a burger, fries?

428
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,606
What? No.

429
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:04,875
Look, it was a rad night.

430
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:05,942
...and morning...

431
00:17:05,944 --> 00:17:06,910
...and afternoon...

432
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:11,109
- But... that's all.
- Mm.

433
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:13,994
I mean, I certainly wouldn't
hurt anyone over him.

434
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:16,080
- What?
- No.

435
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:17,998
There was no reason to hurt anyone.

436
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:19,723
I mean, he was just a meaningless

437
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:21,565
- one-night-stand.
- Mm.

438
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,871
- It was just about sex.
- It's just sex.

439
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:24,861
It's just sex.

440
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:27,464
There was no emotional connection.

441
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:28,965
That was it, it was fun,

442
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,534
but completely meaningless.

443
00:17:30,536 --> 00:17:31,735
- Just fun...
- ...but meaningless.

444
00:17:31,737 --> 00:17:34,204
- Meaningless.
- It meant nothing. Nada.

445
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:35,472
I never saw him again.

446
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:37,307
See where I'm going with this?

447
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:44,347
Well, look, man, the good news is...

448
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:45,982
none of them has
motive to be the killer.

449
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:49,553
Yes. Because none of
them cared enough about me

450
00:17:49,555 --> 00:17:51,488
to murder.

451
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,656
Thanks for calling me in.

452
00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:55,725
I actually wanted to speak with you.

453
00:17:57,429 --> 00:17:58,929
Wait a minute, why is she here?

454
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:02,032
I don't know. I keep telling
the detective she's not my ex.

455
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:04,167
I wanted to tell you that

456
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:05,435
you impressed me

457
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:06,603
Really?

458
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:08,338
- Yeah.
- Mm.

459
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,474
I underestimated you.

460
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:12,843
I gave you all the reason in the world

461
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:14,044
to betray Lucifer.

462
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:15,846
You did. During that case

463
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:17,013
you went to incredible lengths

464
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:18,148
to hurt Lucifer.

465
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,416
I did nothing of the sort.

466
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:21,852
You took that case
just to try and get me

467
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:23,587
to call Lucifer a liar in court.

468
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:26,223
True, but I would never hurt Lucifer.

469
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:28,492
I was trying to prove

470
00:18:28,494 --> 00:18:30,427
that you weren't worthy of him.

471
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:32,929
I see. What about the other women

472
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:34,631
that you don't think are worthy of him?

473
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:35,832
What'd you do to them?

474
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:38,168
Nothing.

475
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,370
They are inconsequential.

476
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:42,606
You're different.

477
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:44,941
He's different when he's with you.

478
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:49,446
Does that threaten you?

479
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:52,649
Perhaps at first.

480
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:53,950
Not anymore.

481
00:18:53,952 --> 00:18:56,453
It makes me happy.

482
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:58,188
I'm glad he found someone.

483
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,525
He deserves a woman
like you in his life.

484
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:08,632
Have you slept with him yet?

485
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:09,833
What?

486
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:11,935
See?

487
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:12,936
You're different.

488
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:15,639
Where were you the night of the 27th?

489
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:19,509
Hey, listen, man,
you're not gonna, uh...

490
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:20,677
You're not gonna tell Chloe about

491
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:21,678
me and Charlotte, right?

492
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,380
Well, as long as you promise to never

493
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:25,115
touch Charlotte again.

494
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:26,316
No, it's not a problem.

495
00:19:26,318 --> 00:19:29,920
Good. 'Cause the last
thing I need is a step-Dan.

496
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,212
You say some really weird things, man.

497
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,900
You ever do something
awesome for somebody,

498
00:19:43,902 --> 00:19:45,969
and they just don't care?

499
00:19:45,971 --> 00:19:47,971
I'm a therapist.

500
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:50,874
Being taken for granted
is in the job description.

501
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:53,577
Like, for example, when a friend

502
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:55,512
uses your lunch break for free therapy,

503
00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:57,480
and doesn't say thank you.

504
00:19:57,482 --> 00:20:00,350
You want me to take care
of this friend of yours?

505
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:03,350
Yea... It's fine.

506
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,641
So how do you deal with it?

507
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,991
I just realize that
self-worth comes from within.

508
00:20:07,993 --> 00:20:09,426
You can't rely on others

509
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:10,971
to validate you.

510
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:12,539
I don't care what anyone thinks of me.

511
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:14,264
Of course you do, we all do.

512
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:16,299
You know, and that's okay.

513
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:17,534
That's human.

514
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:19,302
I'm a demon.

515
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:21,471
I actually think you're more human

516
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:23,206
than a lot of people I know.

517
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,093
Take that back.

518
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,588
Okay, okay, you're a good friend

519
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:29,879
and a great pers...

520
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:31,014
Demon.

521
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:33,950
You just need to
realize it for yourself.

522
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:36,620
Not because I said it.

523
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:40,590
You're saying I'm awesome.

524
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:44,303
I'm saying that you need
to say that you're awesome.

525
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:47,443
Believe that you're awesome.

526
00:20:52,112 --> 00:20:53,845
Yes, you're awesome.

527
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,561
Hell yeah I am.

528
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:58,241
Thanks, Doc.

529
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:01,411
Do you notice anything

530
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:03,113
out of the ordinary?

531
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:04,447
Did anyone threaten you?

532
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,082
I mean, there was that one girl.

533
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:07,150
What girl?

534
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:08,585
The creepy weirdo.

535
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:10,620
She was always in a corner of the club.

536
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:12,555
She just gave this death stare.

537
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:13,723
Daggers.

538
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:15,820
Okay, can you give me a description?

539
00:21:15,845 --> 00:21:17,804
Well, I can describe her aura.

540
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:21,234
That's okay.

541
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,899
Her name is Suki Price.

542
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:25,735
A number of your exes confirmed
seeing her lurking around Lux,

543
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:28,171
so we ran her description
through the DMV.

544
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:29,906
Are you sure you don't recognize her?

545
00:21:29,908 --> 00:21:31,641
No, which is strange, 'cause I remember

546
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:33,677
the face of everyone I've been with.

547
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,879
Oh, maybe she's mask girl.

548
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:37,380
Halloween?

549
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:39,149
What? No. President's Day.

550
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:40,717
Or maybe, I don't remember

551
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:43,067
'cause it was just another
meaningless encounter.

552
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:45,989
This case not the trip down
memory lane you were hoping for?

553
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:47,624
Oh, it's almost enough to make a man

554
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,426
question the way he's lived his life.

555
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:50,427
Almost.

556
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:52,162
Well, luckily this girl gives me hope.

557
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:54,998
At least one of my former lovers
might be willing to kill for me.

558
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,834
Oh. It's open.

559
00:21:57,836 --> 00:22:01,204
LAPD. Anyone home?

560
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:05,241
Well, this isn't creepy at all.

561
00:22:10,182 --> 00:22:13,049
See? I told you someone cared.

562
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:23,697
Look at this.

563
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:26,387
Multiple chest hair options. Amazing.

564
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,014
I can make a lasting impression.

565
00:22:28,016 --> 00:22:31,284
Yeah, on someone with serious issues.

566
00:22:31,286 --> 00:22:33,720
This woman is clearly deranged,

567
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:35,622
dangerous, and...

568
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:39,031
Why am I on this wall?

569
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:41,361
Well, maybe she can just
sense the inevitable.

570
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:45,064
Suki Price? LAPD.

571
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:48,701
What're you doing in my...

572
00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:50,069
Lucifer!

573
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:51,671
- Okay, hey, hey.
- What...

574
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:54,774
Hey, come out with your hands up.

575
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:02,815
This is one of your exes?

576
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,601
Do you know, I'm really not sure...

577
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:07,292
I... darling, could you do this?

578
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:10,579
And say, "I am not a crook."

579
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:14,093
No, it's definitely
not Sexy Richard Nixon.

580
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:16,162
I'm quite certain we've
not slept together.

581
00:23:16,164 --> 00:23:17,897
Well, I could have told you that.

582
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:19,532
Care to explain the wall?

583
00:23:20,435 --> 00:23:22,402
Oh... I'm just...

584
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:24,066
really into Lucifer.

585
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:25,949
And who could blame you.

586
00:23:25,974 --> 00:23:27,617
You're my perfect man.

587
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:30,543
Like porn and stuffed crust pizza

588
00:23:30,545 --> 00:23:34,113
and my Hello Kitty blankie
all rolled into one.

589
00:23:35,228 --> 00:23:37,483
I've loved you from afar.

590
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:38,418
Right.

591
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,752
I see what's happened here.

592
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,954
Not having sex with me
drove her into a murderous,

593
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:43,122
psychotic rage.

594
00:23:43,124 --> 00:23:45,072
Murder?

595
00:23:45,097 --> 00:23:46,330
What are you talking about?

596
00:23:46,355 --> 00:23:48,305
We're investigating the
deaths of Jana Lawrence

597
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,097
and Raj Daniere. Have you heard of 'em?

598
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:54,307
I have all of Lucifer's
lovers categorized.

599
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,430
Uh, uh...

600
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:57,898
here is the flight attendant section.

601
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,534
Here's Jana with Raj.

602
00:24:00,536 --> 00:24:02,599
So the two of them knew each other?

603
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:04,657
Raj is Jana's GBFFN.

604
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:08,050
Was her GBFFN.

605
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:10,778
A gay best friend for now.

606
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:11,904
Oh.

607
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:14,592
She sometimes crashed on his
couch whenever she was in L.A.

608
00:24:14,617 --> 00:24:17,184
Hmm. And w-what are
these numbers about here?

609
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,708
Date from two days ago.

610
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,878
The last time Lucifer and Jana

611
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,046
hooked up.

612
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:25,714
Right. Much as I admire

613
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:27,349
your dedication to this
creepy stalker business,

614
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:30,319
I have to correct you,
there was no hookup.

615
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:33,512
But I made a commemorative doll.

616
00:24:36,093 --> 00:24:38,494
You're wearing your new suit.

617
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:41,463
Yes, what excellent
detail on the French cuffs.

618
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:43,265
That's what I was doing last night.

619
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,484
Oh, you can ask the pizza delivery man.

620
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:46,735
He helped me with these

621
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:48,170
teeny tiny buttons.

622
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,340
Ask him.

623
00:24:51,342 --> 00:24:54,009
Who's the third person in this photo?

624
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:00,363
Uh, that's a pilot Jana works with.

625
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:02,050
Those three hang out
together all the time.

626
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:04,319
Maybe he knows what happened.

627
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:05,287
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

628
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:06,655
Look, I'm gonna send an officer by

629
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:08,157
to get a full statement from you.

630
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,525
Do not leave town.

631
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:13,562
And abandon Lucifer?

632
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:18,167
Never.

633
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:23,111
Right, good-bye.

634
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:33,215
I've been stung

635
00:25:33,217 --> 00:25:36,185
All this chemistry

636
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:40,222
Has got me falling.

637
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,394
Italian beans.

638
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:48,931
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh...

639
00:25:50,468 --> 00:25:53,035
And you want me to try this because...?

640
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:55,771
This "espresso" concoction
is my favorite thing

641
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:57,072
about humanity so far.

642
00:25:57,074 --> 00:25:58,774
Well, besides sex, but...

643
00:25:59,844 --> 00:26:01,286
You're looking well these days.

644
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:03,322
So confident, so cheery.

645
00:26:03,347 --> 00:26:05,467
I almost didn't recognize you.

646
00:26:05,492 --> 00:26:08,960
Thanks to you, Mom. You
found a way to get us home.

647
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,786
But...

648
00:26:10,788 --> 00:26:12,955
manipulating Lucifer and
Chloe toward each other

649
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:14,289
for our own gain...

650
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:16,058
Your Father is the one
that started all of this.

651
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,861
We are simply bringing it to an end.

652
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:19,971
On our terms.

653
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,196
I've tried to manipulate Lucifer before.

654
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,066
It didn't end well.

655
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:26,201
That's because you lied to him.

656
00:26:26,203 --> 00:26:28,370
Lucifer respects the truth.

657
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:30,005
So use that to get us all home.

658
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:32,975
And then, we can put
all of this behind us.

659
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:38,780
This is delicious.

660
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:40,949
Mm-hmm. Still not as good as sex.

661
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:42,184
Mom!

662
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:43,919
Please.

663
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:47,055
Our pilot's name is Tim Pickman.

664
00:26:47,057 --> 00:26:48,991
drugs and assault.

665
00:26:48,993 --> 00:26:50,359
Used to work for a big airline,

666
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:52,728
now he flies rich dudes on small jets.

667
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,264
His recent routes are...

668
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:57,966
The Caribbean, Mexico City, Ahmedabad.

669
00:26:57,968 --> 00:27:00,402
Yes, all hotspots for drug smugglers.

670
00:27:00,404 --> 00:27:01,770
O-Or so I'm told.

671
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:04,506
Working for a private airline
would be the perfect cover.

672
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:07,409
You have quick travel,
lax customs agents...

673
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:09,177
And if Pickman was smuggling drugs,

674
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,013
maybe Jana and Raj found out about it,

675
00:27:11,015 --> 00:27:13,161
threatened to squeal, so
he shut 'em up permanently.

676
00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:15,027
Yes, murder's handy that way.

677
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:16,685
Okay, where do we find him?

678
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:18,220
Let's see.

679
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,891
FAA reports he filed a
last-minute flight plan.

680
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:25,394
Flying Van Nuys to Caracas,
takes off in less than an hour.

681
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:26,762
Okay, we got to get to the airport.

682
00:27:26,764 --> 00:27:28,163
Fast.

683
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:29,398
Copy that.

684
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:37,749
Lucifer!

685
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:39,374
What are you thinking?!

686
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:41,710
Well, I'm pondering Stalker Girl.

687
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:43,812
I mean, how is it the only
person infatuated with me

688
00:27:43,814 --> 00:27:45,547
is someone who doesn't even know me?

689
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:46,949
No, the driving!

690
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:48,116
You're gonna get us killed!

691
00:27:48,118 --> 00:27:50,348
No, I'm gonna catch
our killer, Detective.

692
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:52,740
Better hold on!

693
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:54,756
Hey.

694
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:56,291
Better hold on.

695
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,229
Lucifer!

696
00:28:07,304 --> 00:28:08,870
You're welcome.

697
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:13,575
Captain Pickman, LAPD!

698
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:19,748
Oh, thank God!

699
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,450
You're a cop.

700
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:23,485
I was afraid you were trying to kill me.

701
00:28:23,487 --> 00:28:24,653
What?

702
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,771
So, care to explain why you
were trying to flee the country?

703
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,705
My two closest friends
just got murdered.

704
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:37,940
I thought I might be next

705
00:28:37,942 --> 00:28:40,209
and I was not about to
stick around to find out.

706
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:41,944
Who would try to kill you, Tim?

707
00:28:41,946 --> 00:28:44,546
I only know him as "Burt."

708
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:47,850
Guy smuggles a lot of
drugs into the country.

709
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,551
So, were you moving product for him?

710
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:50,183
No,

711
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,732
he uses young women like Jana to mule.

712
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,556
He recruits 'em on the
party circuit in Malibu,

713
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:55,762
offers them cash,

714
00:28:55,787 --> 00:28:57,554
free travel, whatever they desire.

715
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:58,894
Right.

716
00:28:58,896 --> 00:29:01,463
And what is it you desire, Tim?

717
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:10,568
I want to build a cat sanctuary.

718
00:29:10,593 --> 00:29:13,260
Wait. Oh, for goodness sake.

719
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,254
Cat?

720
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,813
I got into trouble
using drugs years back.

721
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,879
My life fell apart.

722
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:21,671
- But then I adopted Twinkle...
- Right,

723
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:23,552
skip along, Tim, 'cause
no one really wants to hear

724
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:24,887
about your feline meet cute.

725
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:28,090
Jana tried to get me to smuggle

726
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:29,091
for Burt, too,

727
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:30,325
but I refused.

728
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:31,927
Then why were you running?

729
00:29:33,164 --> 00:29:36,532
On Jana's last flight,
a package went missing.

730
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:37,533
A package?

731
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:39,858
So, what, Burt thought Jana stole it?

732
00:29:39,883 --> 00:29:42,615
And when she didn't have
it, he went after Raj.

733
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,705
And now, me.

734
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:45,407
Is there any way to
get a hold of this guy?

735
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,875
I got a bull's-eye

736
00:29:46,877 --> 00:29:48,058
painted on my back.

737
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,314
Why the hell would I want to?

738
00:29:49,316 --> 00:29:51,116
Hmm.

739
00:29:51,118 --> 00:29:54,052
Detective...

740
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:56,555
in order to lure out our
murderous kingpin from hiding,

741
00:29:56,557 --> 00:29:58,256
all we need to do is
for someone to pretend

742
00:29:58,258 --> 00:30:00,358
to have this mysterious package.

743
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,027
Yes, and it would need to be someone

744
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:03,361
who might have worked with Jana.

745
00:30:03,363 --> 00:30:04,462
Hmm.

746
00:30:04,464 --> 00:30:06,965
Uh, Tim, who else was on the flight?

747
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:08,133
Just me,

748
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:10,335
Andy Kleinberg, my copilot,

749
00:30:10,337 --> 00:30:11,603
and a new flight attendant.

750
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:12,737
A new flight attendant?

751
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:14,773
So Burt may not have
known what she looked like?

752
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:19,544
I'm in.

753
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:21,846
Okay, but you understand what
you're agreeing to, right?

754
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:22,981
Sure.

755
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:25,050
You want me to bounty
hunt this Burt scumbag

756
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:26,952
and pretend to deliver his package.

757
00:30:26,954 --> 00:30:28,787
But we'll need you to
work with us on this one.

758
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:30,272
We'll set up the meet and everything.

759
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:32,357
Do I still get to rough
him up before the cops do?

760
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:36,628
We'll be close by,
but technically, yeah.

761
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,064
More in. You want to know why?

762
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:40,432
Because we're running out of time

763
00:30:40,434 --> 00:30:41,666
and you're our only option?

764
00:30:41,668 --> 00:30:43,335
No.

765
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:45,103
Because I'm awesome.

766
00:30:45,105 --> 00:30:47,239
Because I take risks for my friends

767
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:49,007
and I don't need your thanks.

768
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:52,143
Am I supposed to be
thanking you for something?

769
00:30:52,145 --> 00:30:53,745
No.

770
00:30:53,747 --> 00:30:56,982
Because self-worth comes
from within, bitches.

771
00:30:56,984 --> 00:30:58,672
Now,

772
00:30:58,697 --> 00:31:01,753
if you'll excuse me,

773
00:31:01,755 --> 00:31:04,422
I need to slut this up.

774
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,800
Oh, brother. Hello.

775
00:31:15,802 --> 00:31:18,803
Just getting ready for
a little sting operation.

776
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:20,505
Right.

777
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:22,874
I should've assumed you'd be busy.

778
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:24,442
I can come back.

779
00:31:24,444 --> 00:31:26,311
Well, no, no, that's not a euphemism.

780
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:30,448
I mean an actual police sting operation.

781
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,817
But actually, whilst you're here...

782
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:35,253
Here.

783
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:38,189
Do you think I'm boyfriend material?

784
00:31:38,191 --> 00:31:41,159
Luci, you've never exactly been the type

785
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:43,528
to get emotionally attached.

786
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,596
To anyone.

787
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:47,766
So I've come to realize, but...

788
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:49,834
what does that say about me, brother?

789
00:31:50,737 --> 00:31:53,371
Is this about Chloe?

790
00:31:55,523 --> 00:31:57,957
And why would you think that?

791
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:02,113
Mom, she... told me what happened

792
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:04,082
or what almost happened, apparently.

793
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:05,417
Did she now?

794
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:07,419
So, I suppose you're gonna tell me

795
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:09,321
humans and the divine don't mix.

796
00:32:09,323 --> 00:32:11,256
Luci, listen, I have underestimated you

797
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:12,490
for all of my existence,

798
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:14,859
both in your ability to frustrate me

799
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:16,628
and your capacity for good.

800
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,098
Even though you'll
never admit it, but...

801
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,234
when it comes to Chloe...

802
00:32:23,236 --> 00:32:25,403
perhaps you've been
underestimating yourself.

803
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:29,140
Careful, brother. That sounds
dangerously like a compliment.

804
00:32:29,142 --> 00:32:30,475
Ah, take it how you like.

805
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:32,811
You never listen to my advice, anyway.

806
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:34,746
Just one of your many charms.

807
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:36,348
Liar.

808
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,750
But you're not, Luci.

809
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:41,286
So, if you really want to know

810
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:44,823
if you're a worthy romantic partner...

811
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:47,592
ask yourself.

812
00:32:57,904 --> 00:33:00,372
Can you guys hear me?

813
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,149
Why are you sitting so close?

814
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:13,685
The killer won't show
if this reeks of a setup.

815
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:17,389
Exactly. If we were strangers,
you'd be hitting on me.

816
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:22,193
Looks like we'll be getting

817
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:24,429
that celebratory drink after all.

818
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:26,131
Two vodkas, please.

819
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:29,033
Peacock has landed.

820
00:33:29,035 --> 00:33:30,769
Okay.

821
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:32,170
Any sign of Burt?

822
00:33:32,172 --> 00:33:35,407
Not yet, but I'll stick around
until someone approaches.

823
00:33:40,814 --> 00:33:43,248
What?

824
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,483
I think I just figured
out what's wrong with you.

825
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:49,587
Oh, yeah? And what would that be, Maze?

826
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:51,990
You need to own up to what you did.

827
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:56,127
Yeah. Be proud of it.

828
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:58,430
Uh, Maze, we talked about this

829
00:33:58,432 --> 00:33:59,939
and besides...

830
00:33:59,964 --> 00:34:02,544
Self-worth comes from within, Dan.

831
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:03,735
No, I think I'm good. Thank you.

832
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:04,769
I don't think you are.

833
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:05,904
I think you'd feel a lot better

834
00:34:05,906 --> 00:34:07,138
if you just came clean.

835
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,206
Don't.

836
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,574
If you won't say it, I will.

837
00:34:09,576 --> 00:34:11,643
- Maze...
- For your own good.

838
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:12,610
Don't say another word.

839
00:34:12,612 --> 00:34:13,711
Why?

840
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:16,114
So what if you slept
with Charlotte Richards?

841
00:34:20,854 --> 00:34:22,720
Dan slept with Charlotte?

842
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:25,490
Trust me, you're not half
as disgusted by that as I am.

843
00:34:25,492 --> 00:34:28,626
Is there anyone who hasn't
slept with that woman?

844
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:29,828
Uh...

845
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,162
Which is hard to believe

846
00:34:31,164 --> 00:34:33,231
since you've slept with
everyone else in L.A.

847
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:34,833
Well, everyone except you, Detective.

848
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:36,167
I mean, not that I want to.

849
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:38,069
I mean, of course I want to, but...

850
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:39,871
right now all I'm concerned about

851
00:34:39,873 --> 00:34:41,973
is proving my worth to you.

852
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:44,035
Unless of course you've
changed your mind about the sex.

853
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:46,370
Okay, there will be no sex.

854
00:34:46,395 --> 00:34:48,580
As far as our so-called moment,

855
00:34:48,582 --> 00:34:50,849
I let my emotions get the best
of me the other night, okay?

856
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:51,950
I made a mistake.

857
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:55,053
You and me, it's not happening.

858
00:34:55,055 --> 00:34:56,187
You have to accept, Lucifer,

859
00:34:56,189 --> 00:34:57,755
that we are very different people

860
00:34:57,757 --> 00:34:59,290
with very different priorities.

861
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:02,193
My priority right now is this case.

862
00:35:02,195 --> 00:35:04,496
Okay? So, just...

863
00:35:04,498 --> 00:35:06,798
step outside and get some air.

864
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,433
I don't need air.

865
00:35:08,435 --> 00:35:09,868
Well, I do.

866
00:35:12,138 --> 00:35:14,205
Right.

867
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:15,573
Understood.

868
00:35:35,662 --> 00:35:37,295
A man just entered the bar.

869
00:35:37,297 --> 00:35:40,064
Got you.

870
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:43,601
You are one of the
prettiest flight attendants

871
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:44,736
I've ever seen.

872
00:35:44,738 --> 00:35:46,371
- Oh.
- I'm Burt.

873
00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:48,339
Hi, Burt.

874
00:35:48,341 --> 00:35:50,408
You ready for takeoff?

875
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,880
They're on their way to the hotel room.

876
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,259
Are you ready for the package?

877
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:12,463
Mm-hmm. I think that's
supposed to be my line.

878
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:16,935
I know you killed that flight attendant

879
00:36:16,937 --> 00:36:18,670
and her friend, dirtbag.

880
00:36:21,886 --> 00:36:24,019
No, no, no! My name's Jim!

881
00:36:24,044 --> 00:36:25,243
Some guy gave me a C-note,

882
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:27,178
told me to sit next to
you and say I was Burt.

883
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:30,449
If that's not our
killer then where is he?

884
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:39,157
I believe you have
something that belongs to me.

885
00:36:41,528 --> 00:36:43,962
Burt, I presume.

886
00:36:53,983 --> 00:36:55,382
Can I keep him?

887
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:57,584
Get her off me! She's insane!

888
00:36:57,586 --> 00:36:58,819
Well, you better start talking.

889
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:00,521
Where's the man that paid you?

890
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:03,524
I don't know. He saw some tall
guy with dark hair in a suit.

891
00:37:03,526 --> 00:37:04,691
He took off.

892
00:37:04,693 --> 00:37:05,959
That's Lucifer.

893
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:07,494
Yeah.

894
00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:09,609
Recognized you from the beach party.

895
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:11,664
Of course. Tommy Bahama.

896
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:12,820
It's good that you found me,

897
00:37:12,845 --> 00:37:15,475
'cause I've been meaning to
ask you something since then.

898
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,008
Where'd you get the water slide?

899
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:18,274
I'd love one for Lux.

900
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:19,617
I'm not sure where I'd put it...

901
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:20,707
I want my package.

902
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:22,309
Now.

903
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:26,847
I should've known Jana left it
with you after I saw her at Lux.

904
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:29,441
That's why she was only there
a few minutes... to stash it.

905
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:32,343
No, the reason that she
left so quickly was because

906
00:37:32,345 --> 00:37:34,912
she was unhappy that I
didn't have sex with her.

907
00:37:34,914 --> 00:37:36,881
Yeah, I don't believe you.

908
00:37:36,883 --> 00:37:38,949
No one says no to a girl like that.

909
00:37:38,951 --> 00:37:41,852
I'm finding it hard to believe
myself, trust me, but, uh,

910
00:37:41,854 --> 00:37:45,056
as for your package, Burt...

911
00:37:45,058 --> 00:37:46,590
I don't have it.

912
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:48,092
Liar.

913
00:37:48,094 --> 00:37:49,760
Oh, come now.

914
00:37:49,762 --> 00:37:51,228
Surely a little bit of cocaine

915
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,130
isn't worth all the senseless killing.

916
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:55,333
Cocaine?

917
00:37:55,335 --> 00:37:58,002
What's in that package is
far more valuable than drugs.

918
00:37:58,004 --> 00:37:59,737
- Oh.
- It's my ass on the line,

919
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:01,339
and that stupid bitch Jana...

920
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:09,347
You don't speak of her that way.

921
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:12,116
You promised Jana the world

922
00:38:12,118 --> 00:38:14,819
and everything she could ever desire.

923
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:17,988
Money, drugs, a life of pleasure,

924
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,592
but she deserved better than that...

925
00:38:21,594 --> 00:38:24,562
better than you...

926
00:38:24,564 --> 00:38:26,797
or me.

927
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:31,535
I mean, what did either
of us really give her?

928
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:33,037
Empty pleasure?

929
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,973
Hey, man...

930
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:37,708
we can work something out.

931
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:41,157
I'll find the package.
I'll get paid. We'll...

932
00:38:41,182 --> 00:38:43,261
We're similar in a lot
of ways, aren't we, Burt?

933
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:45,596
Except for one.

934
00:38:46,786 --> 00:38:50,788
You're a bad man and I'm not.

935
00:38:52,825 --> 00:38:54,959
I'm much...

936
00:38:54,961 --> 00:38:57,795
much worse than that.

937
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,153
Lucifer!

938
00:39:08,908 --> 00:39:10,641
There's your killer, detectives.

939
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:12,510
Think you'll find he
feels quite remorseful

940
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:13,778
about the life he's led.

941
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,846
Please... okay, p-please,
just-just arrest me, okay?

942
00:39:15,848 --> 00:39:16,981
Okay, get up. I'm sorry.

943
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:18,616
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Stand up.

944
00:39:18,618 --> 00:39:20,751
I'm sorry.

945
00:39:24,557 --> 00:39:26,457
Hey.

946
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:28,125
About what you heard in the van...

947
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:29,527
Hey, it doesn't matter...

948
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:31,729
except something still bothers me.

949
00:39:31,731 --> 00:39:35,699
Burt went to a lot of trouble
for a single drug deal.

950
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:40,271
Yeah, well... the guy had
a reputation to protect.

951
00:39:40,273 --> 00:39:43,140
You know? One person steals from him,

952
00:39:43,142 --> 00:39:45,109
everyone else thinks they can, too.

953
00:39:45,111 --> 00:39:48,279
All right. But then who has the package?

954
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:56,220
How... how did you find me?

955
00:39:56,222 --> 00:39:58,756
I'm sorry I took it. I was desperate.

956
00:39:58,758 --> 00:40:00,324
I'm broke.

957
00:40:00,326 --> 00:40:02,159
When the stewardess let it slip

958
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:04,495
how much cash she was gonna
make from this delivery, I...

959
00:40:04,497 --> 00:40:06,530
I thought it was drugs.

960
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:09,066
I was gonna sell them.

961
00:40:09,068 --> 00:40:10,734
Then I opened it.

962
00:40:10,736 --> 00:40:12,970
One of them broke.

963
00:40:12,972 --> 00:40:15,873
I spilled a little on myself. Now...

964
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,578
What the hell is happening to me?

965
00:40:44,036 --> 00:40:47,538
Hey, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

966
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,240
I tracked your phone's GPS.

967
00:40:49,242 --> 00:40:52,476
Well... here I am.

968
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,413
Well, we should wrap
up the arrest report,

969
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:59,683
and by that I mean paperwork,
not some celebratory drink

970
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:01,986
that you'll then turn into a moment.

971
00:41:01,988 --> 00:41:04,588
Yes, well...

972
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,557
I've changed my mind
about that, actually.

973
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:09,326
I realized it would
never work out between us.

974
00:41:09,328 --> 00:41:10,694
- Really?
- Yes.

975
00:41:10,696 --> 00:41:16,200
So, from now on, no
more attempts at moments.

976
00:41:16,202 --> 00:41:20,137
I'd be honored to, uh, simply
continue working by your side...

977
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:23,274
...if you'll have me.

978
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:24,408
Of course.

979
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,910
- Good.
- Yeah.

980
00:41:25,912 --> 00:41:27,711
It's not like you to give up, but...

981
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:29,213
Oh, no, I haven't given up.

982
00:41:29,215 --> 00:41:32,349
I had a... an epiphany, of sorts.

983
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:35,686
You deserve someone worthy
of you and that isn't me.

984
00:41:35,688 --> 00:41:37,821
That's not what I've
been saying, Lucifer.

985
00:41:37,823 --> 00:41:40,624
I know. It's what I'm saying.

986
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:44,161
You... deserve someone better

987
00:41:44,163 --> 00:41:46,130
because you, Detective,

988
00:41:46,132 --> 00:41:49,177
are selfless to a nauseating degree.

989
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,470
You always put your daughter first,

990
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:55,272
even though the ungrateful
urchin does nothing

991
00:41:55,274 --> 00:41:56,473
to contribute to the rent.

992
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:58,342
So...

993
00:41:58,344 --> 00:42:00,878
you deserve someone
worthy of that grace.

994
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,014
Someone who knows that every
crime scene breaks your heart,

995
00:42:04,016 --> 00:42:06,317
even though you'd never admit it.

996
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,619
Someone who actually appreciates

997
00:42:08,621 --> 00:42:10,777
your impossibly boring middle name.

998
00:42:10,802 --> 00:42:12,072
Jane.

999
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:15,025
More importantly, Detective,
you deserve someone

1000
00:42:15,027 --> 00:42:17,494
as good as you...

1001
00:42:17,496 --> 00:42:19,597
because...

1002
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,126
well, you're special and I'm...

1003
00:42:25,171 --> 00:42:27,771
...I'm not worth it.

1004
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:36,135
Yeah, you're probably right.

1005
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,245
Detective...

1006
00:42:49,002 --> 00:42:52,172
