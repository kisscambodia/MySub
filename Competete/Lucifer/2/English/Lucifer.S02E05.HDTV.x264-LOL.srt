1
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:02,834
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:04,413
So, we're still good
to be roomies, right?

3
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:05,656
What are you talking about, roomies?

4
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,768
We shook on it.

5
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:09,220
You shall remain right here,

6
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:11,222
on Earth, amongst the creatures

7
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:12,223
you so despise.

8
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:13,808
Existing in this punishment

9
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:16,394
allows me to be closer to my family.

10
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,146
You made a deal to return Mom to Hell.

11
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:21,065
In exchange, Chloe's life was spared.

12
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:22,400
You still haven't delivered

13
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:23,568
on your end of the bargain.

14
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:24,702
If you're so concerned,

15
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:26,571
why don't you just fly Mum back to Hell?

16
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:27,872
Because I can't!

17
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:30,408
What if Dad decides to...

18
00:00:30,493 --> 00:00:31,993
take back his side of the deal?

19
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:16,004
Son of a biscuit!

20
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:17,288
Dylan!

21
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:20,124
Dylan...

22
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:21,175
How many times have I told you

23
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:22,627
to pick up that stupid skateboard!

24
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:24,045
I am not your maid!

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,964
God, why the hell is
your panties in a bunch?

26
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,016
Don't you talk to me like that!
You are grounded, young man!

27
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:29,300
- I'm going camping with Tyler!
- No, you're not.

28
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:30,551
Go to your room! Grounded!

29
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:33,354
Don't waste food!

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,473
Get out of here! You're ruining my life!

31
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:36,691
No, no. Not through there,

32
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:38,693
the dog's in there!

33
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:08,556
It was a random car crash.

34
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:10,425
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

35
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,894
But you didn't see anything
strange or out of the ordinary?

36
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:14,228
Like I told you at the hospital

37
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:16,431
and several times before that, no.

38
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:17,515
What's going on with you?

39
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,350
Well, there's a miniscule,

40
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:22,070
albeit highly unlikely,
chance that your car accident

41
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:25,273
was a result of my father
trying to send me a message.

42
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:27,408
Lucifer, it was a freak accident.

43
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,160
A dog ran into the middle of the road.

44
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:30,695
You had nothing to do with it.

45
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:32,580
Right. Okay.

46
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,033
Well, you're about to be in
another disastrous wreck

47
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:36,117
that is avoidable.

48
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:38,086
- What?
- Living with Maze.

49
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:40,088
Potential for sexy pillow
fights notwithstanding,

50
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:43,758
you and Maze are like
snow pants and elephants.

51
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,427
- You don't mix.
- Maze and I

52
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:48,596
have become friends.

53
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,131
Sort of.

54
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:51,883
And I think it's gonna be fine.

55
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,994
Oh, really?

56
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,721
- With a short adjustment period.
- Mm.

57
00:02:56,773 --> 00:02:58,389
Yeah. What is that?

58
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,992
Decker.

59
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:02,560
Yeah, what's the address?

60
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:03,561
Hi, Lucifer.

61
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:05,063
Ah, um, toys.

62
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:06,564
- In there. Go.
- Yes.

63
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:08,116
- Thank you.
- Can you read this

64
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,233
to me, Mommy?

65
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:10,451
No, Monkey.

66
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:11,986
I just got a new case. You
have to get to school.

67
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:13,871
And besides, that's your bedtime story.

68
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:14,956
I'll read that to you tonight.

69
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,575
No, read it to me now!

70
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:19,127
This... best birth control in the world.

71
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:20,294
Come here.

72
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,299
What's going on, kiddo?

73
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:27,919
Landa says your job's really dangerous.

74
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,388
That cops get hurt all the time.

75
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:31,839
I don't want you to get hurt.

76
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:33,307
Oh, baby.

77
00:03:33,393 --> 00:03:36,394
The car accident was just that...

78
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:37,428
an accident.

79
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,649
And Mommy's job can be dangerous,
but I'm really careful, okay?

80
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:42,767
I'm not gonna get hurt.

81
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,352
I love you, Mom.

82
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:45,937
Oh, I love you so much.

83
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:48,022
I love you.

84
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:50,491
Oh, no, actually, this
is better birth control.

85
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,949
Hey, Ella.

86
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:59,250
Hey.

87
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:01,085
All right, any I.D. on the victim?

88
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,253
Uh, yep.

89
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:03,671
- His name is...
- It's Wesley Cabot!

90
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:05,289
What? How do you know that?

91
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,507
How do I know th...

92
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:08,676
Star of the Body Bags movies.

93
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:10,795
Eighth-degree black belt.

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,047
Absolute icon in the action genre.

95
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:15,049
I adore his work.

96
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,435
It's just a bunch of people
pretending to punch each other.

97
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,804
It's much more
than that, Detective.

98
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,806
It's a chance to escape
your reality for a moment.

99
00:04:21,891 --> 00:04:23,891
Some people need that.

100
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:28,146
Also, ninjas and tons of nudity
in the first three, so...

101
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:30,148
He had a drug problem, right?
Well, only if you consider

102
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:33,401
ingesting millions of dollars'
worth of cocaine a problem.

103
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:34,485
I call it a Tuesday.

104
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:36,237
But, apparently, it's frowned upon.

105
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:38,873
Yeah, so no studios
would hire him anymore.

106
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,241
Hmm.

107
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:42,660
No wonder he resorted to
teaching karate in Hollywood.

108
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:43,711
Yeah.

109
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:45,163
Looks like he was living here.

110
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:46,631
And I thought I fell a long way.

111
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,217
Okay, so body temp's
cooled five degrees.

112
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:51,302
That pegs time of death around 7:00 a.m.

113
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:53,171
Doesn't look like there's
any money missing.

114
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:54,722
No forced entry.

115
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:56,390
It's not a robbery.

116
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:57,391
What's the cause of death?

117
00:04:57,477 --> 00:04:59,727
Dude was hit with a...

118
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:01,312
"nunchuck statue"?

119
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:02,847
That's a first for me.

120
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:07,101
"The Golden Nunchuck Award for
Best Fight Sequence, 1998."

121
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:08,853
So, you think the award
came from the box?

122
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:11,239
Yep. It's got all of
Wesley's Body Bags 4 swag.

123
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,741
Memorabilia, contracts.
Once I get all this

124
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:16,027
back to the precinct,
I'll see what I can find.

125
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:17,578
For the Insta.

126
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:18,746
No!

127
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:19,947
- No?
- Nope.

128
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,499
- Not cool.
- Uh...

129
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:22,700
Oh, hold on.

130
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:24,869
I know who the killer must be.

131
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:26,704
Who?

132
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:29,423
The dreaded ninja Ozaki, from
Body Bags 6: Tokyo Fire.

133
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:31,709
I mean, who else would get
the jump on Wesley Cabot?

134
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:35,046
I will avenge you.

135
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:37,265
Who found the body?

136
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,432
A kid.

137
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:40,134
Said he saw a Hummer driving away.

138
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,385
- Here you go.
- Hmm?

139
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:42,720
I'll see if he saw a plate.

140
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,773
Hey, Lucifer.

141
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:46,774
Yes?

142
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:48,276
- So I was wondering...
- Okay,

143
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:50,278
all right, but, uh, we'll
need to be discreet about it,

144
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:51,312
'cause the detective hates it

145
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:52,563
when I mix business with pleasure.

146
00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:54,398
The, uh, bed in there
looks a little skanky,

147
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:55,900
but I'm up for it if you are.

148
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:57,702
Uh, wow.

149
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,370
Okay. Yeah.

150
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:00,621
- Okay.
- I mean, no!

151
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:01,906
- Oh.
- I was just wondering,

152
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,458
why do you like this
Wesley Cabot guy so much?

153
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:07,545
Well, he rips men's hearts out,

154
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,913
wipes out entire villages,

155
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:10,131
never says thank you,

156
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:11,632
and he's applauded for it.

157
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:14,752
Oh, him... as opposed to you.

158
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:16,220
That's right, because you're the

159
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,221
son of God.

160
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:18,222
Exactly.

161
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:19,473
- Yes.
- I get it.

162
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,392
I mean, Stanislavksy would
be very proud of you.

163
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:24,428
Okay, for the last time,
I am not a method actor.

164
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,813
So method of you to say.

165
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:26,764
Damn, you are good.

166
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:28,766
Hey, can you cry on cue?

167
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,103
Sorry, excuse me.

168
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,622
Hello, brother.

169
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,257
Ah.

170
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:54,875
Uriel!

171
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,377
I thought it was you.

172
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:58,429
Welcome to Earth.

173
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:00,848
Clearly, I got the fashion
sense in the family.

174
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,600
Word of advice: I'd
lose the trench coat,

175
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:03,634
'cause as it stands,

176
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:05,353
it's less cool, brooding angel,

177
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:06,687
more sort of "pedophile chic."

178
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,973
One joke down. One to go.

179
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,142
Why can't you take anything
seriously, Lucifer?

180
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:12,143
What do they say?

181
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:13,644
Laugh like no one's listening?

182
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:15,146
Dance like you're
standing on the corpses

183
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,147
of your enemies?

184
00:07:16,232 --> 00:07:17,898
And there's the other.

185
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,483
Predictable as ever.

186
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,035
What do you want, Uriel?

187
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,153
I came to you tell you

188
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:23,988
that you have 24 hours.

189
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:26,657
I'll bite. 24 hours or what?

190
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:28,326
Either return here with Mom,

191
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:31,162
or I'll finish what I started
with your detective.

192
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:34,799
The car accident.

193
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:35,883
You made a deal with Dad.

194
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:38,669
Time to pay up. So...

195
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:40,671
bring Mom to me,

196
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,638
or I'll take back what Dad gave you.

197
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:55,218

198
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:03,333
Uriel is here?

199
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,242
Pleasant aroma and all.

200
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:06,790
And he's after Chloe?

201
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,791
No.

202
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:09,242
He's after Chloe

203
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:11,878
or that classy bitch you call "Mom."

204
00:08:11,913 --> 00:08:13,617
You made a deal with Daddy.

205
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:14,743
Time to pay up.

206
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,877
Uriel can come after

207
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,579
celestial beings like us, yes,

208
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,164
but angels aren't
allowed to kill humans.

209
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,716
- Chloe should be safe.
- Yes,

210
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:21,750
but remember, dear brother,

211
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,752
that Uriel can play with patterns.

212
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,337
He makes a butterfly flap its wings

213
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,256
and a housewife gets chlamydia.

214
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,176
Or Chloe gets into a seemingly
accidental car wreck.

215
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:33,011
Correct, for ten points.

216
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:34,346
Well, too bad there isn't an easy way

217
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:35,897
to make this all go away.

218
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,150
Oh, wait, there is.

219
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,851
Send your mom back to Hell.

220
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:40,685
A solution

221
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:41,737
which you

222
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,522
will, no doubt, avoid.

223
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:45,440
Well, worry not, my
little sex thug, because

224
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,659
Uriel won't be a problem.

225
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,077
We have a nuclear weapon.

226
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,113
What's that?

227
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,414
You.

228
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,032
Well, Uriel doesn't know that

229
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:55,333
we're working together on this.

230
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,752
We all know he won't listen to me.

231
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,538
But he will if it's someone
from the home team.

232
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,257
So, you will go and convince him

233
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,759
that he needs to go back.

234
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,378
Or, you know, just punch
him in his smug face.

235
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,596
Dealer's choice.

236
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,048
God, it's nice

237
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,217
having a super powerful angel
on your side, isn't it?

238
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:15,687
Good luck with that.

239
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,026
Huh.

240
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,394
Saved your life.

241
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,312
Maybe. You never know.

242
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,397
What are you talking about?

243
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,398
Well, it appears

244
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,616
that I was correct this morning.

245
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,402
You are being targeted by cosmic forces.

246
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,453
But fear not,

247
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,737
it's all being dealt with.

248
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,789
And I'm here.

249
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,707
Now...

250
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,075
what is with everyone

251
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,410
and this car accident? I'm fine.

252
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,628
No, I'm afraid that you're not.

253
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,379
And so, for the next day or so,

254
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,582
I'm gonna need you to be unpredictable.

255
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,217
Whatever you'd normally
do, just, you know...

256
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,918
ah, ah... do the opposite.

257
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,170
Too bad.

258
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,921
I was totally gonna have
sex with you today.

259
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:52,390
Really?

260
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,227
Oh. Well played, Detective.

261
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,596
Yes, but until the threat has passed,

262
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:58,814
just to be safe,

263
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,098
I won't be leaving your side.

264
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,733
So just think of me

265
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,485
as your Guardian Devil.

266
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,270
Okay.

267
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,271
Guys, Wesley Cabot's dead.

268
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:07,439
I can't believe it.

269
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,990
Oh, God. Not you, too.

270
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,276
Oh, man. Body Bags 1 through 6.

271
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:13,111
First in line. I mean,
I even skipped out

272
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,413
on some of our wedding planning
to see Body Bags 6. Remember?

273
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,832
That was the big emergency?

274
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,783
It was totally worth it.
It was a great movie.

275
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:20,452
Yes, it was. Better catch
phrase, wasn't it?

276
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:21,786
"Not on my watch."

277
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,206
Maybe I should get a catch phrase.

278
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,124
You don't need a catch phrase. And you.

279
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,126
Do you have anything
constructive to add?

280
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:30,795
Uh, yep. Yep, I do.

281
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,465
The boy who, uh, found the body

282
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:35,967
remembered the first three plate
numbers of the getaway car.

283
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,435
13 matches.

284
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,854
13. That's a lot of legwork.

285
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,472
Jamie Lee Adrienne.

286
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,107
The, uh, the Playmate?

287
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,275
- The ex-party girl?
- Yeah.

288
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,726
What does she have to
do with Wesley Cabot?

289
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,978
She's his ex-wife. They met
on the set of Body Bags 4.

290
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,780
Apparently, Jamie and
Wesley's divorce proceedings

291
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,282
were very contentious.

292
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,651
Maybe she went to "renegotiate."

293
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:55,787
By "renegotiate", I mean kill him.

294
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,656
- Yeah.
- Uh...

295
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,041
Yeah.

296
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,713
I can't believe Wesley's really gone.

297
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,665
When was the last time you saw Mr.
Cabot?

298
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,885
Um... a few weeks ago.

299
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,886
Maybe.

300
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,254
Interesting.

301
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,056
Then can you explain why a
witness said that they saw you

302
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,342
speeding away from Wesley's
dojo this morning?

303
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:20,896
Welcome to Devil Time.

304
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,514
- What are you doing?
- Trying out my new catch phrase.

305
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,765
"Welcome to Devil Time"?

306
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,183
- What the hell does that mean?
- She knows what it means.

307
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,568
I have no idea what that means.

308
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,070
- Oh.
- Okay, yeah. I...

309
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,739
I was at the dojo this morning.

310
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,691
But it's not what you think.

311
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:35,026
I went because of this...

312
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,411
My life is destroyed.

313
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,079
And it all started with Body Bags 4.

314
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,331
Call me back.

315
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,950
What "started with Body Bags 4"?

316
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,201
I have no idea.

317
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:45,003
That's why I went to go see see Wesley.

318
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,706
But he was already dead and...

319
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:50,041
I panicked and then I ran...

320
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:51,376
But I swear

321
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:52,761
I would've never hurt Wesley.

322
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:56,047
Even though we were divorced,
I really cared about him.

323
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:57,882
Where were you at 7:00 a.m.
this morning?

324
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,551
With Raphael.

325
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,769
My Pilates instructor.

326
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,221
And how does the Weaponizer
feel about all this?

327
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,807
Who the
hell is the Weaponizer?

328
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,776
He's a character played
by Kimo Van Zandt,

329
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,311
Wesley's co-star

330
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,863
and her current husband.

331
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,282
So you used to be married
to an action star,

332
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:16,234
only to divorce him and marry

333
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:18,119
another action star?

334
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,038
Yeah. It was the '90s.

335
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,456
We did a lot of coke.

336
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,074
Well, how did your current husband feel

337
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,409
about you visiting your ex?

338
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,460
Oh, that's easy.

339
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,128
Kimo and Wesley hated each other.

340
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,246
Long-standing feud.

341
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:29,798
God only knows what Kimo would've done

342
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,249
if he knew I went to see him.

343
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,751
Where was Kimo this morning?

344
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:36,171
Uh, at ActionCon in Reno.

345
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,555
Signing autographs.

346
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,057
Where's my money, partner?

347
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,476
I will end you!

348
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,645
Without Body Bags 4,
you are nothing, man!

349
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,564
How does Body Bags 4
figure into all this?

350
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,401
Well, Wesley, our victim, uh,

351
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,353
was the hero of the Body Bags franchise.

352
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,487
Ooh, and in Body Bags 4,

353
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:53,905
newcomer Kimo Van Zandt appeared.

354
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,607
He played this shady CIA operative,

355
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,941
who acted as Wesley's foil

356
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:58,443
and his eventual ambiguous ally, but...

357
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,412
Then Kimo's character got
spun off into his own,

358
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,164
more successful franchise,
The Weaponizer.

359
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,116
Personal fave: Weaponizer
4: The Last Arsenal.

360
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,252
- So good, right?
- At the end, with the whole...

361
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,170
Okay, I so regret asking you guys this.

362
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:12,007
Although, you're oddly adorable.

363
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,292
So, it seems like Kimo has always

364
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,427
had it out for Wesley.

365
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,962
Stole his wife, stole
his film franchise.

366
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,798
So maybe he really did "end"
it for him once and for all.

367
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,016
But Kimo was in Reno.

368
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,884
At ActionCon.

369
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,520
But that convention happens
the last week in August.

370
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,605
- How do you know that?
- My mom used to go to it every year.

371
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,940
- So Jamie's lying.
- Or Kimo's lying to her.

372
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,692
Either way, we gotta find him.

373
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,811
- I'll put out a BOLO.
- Okay.

374
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:35,780
Please, hold on. Um...

375
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,651
Again, I apologize that the
children were late for school.

376
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,037
And, yes, I understand

377
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:45,790
that pants need to be
worn every day, now.

378
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,333
Ooh!

379
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:57,669
Rough day?

380
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:58,837
Oh...

381
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,222
Since returning to my
employment, I have found

382
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,476
the number of daily tasks to
be almost insurmountable.

383
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,678
But hey...

384
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,013
at least you're not here
to take me back to Hell.

385
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:16,020
You are here to take me back to Hell?

386
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:18,073
No, Mom, I'm not. I'm just...

387
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,408
Listen, I was just wondering
if your being here

388
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:22,694
is just postponing the inevitable.

389
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,364
I mean, at some point...

390
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,250
other siblings will come
down here looking for you.

391
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,202
And I'll convince them to let me stay,

392
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,921
just like I did you and Lucifer.

393
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,540
You were gone for a
really long time, Mom.

394
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,211
You might not know your children
as well as you think you do.

395
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,882
You may be right.

396
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:46,768
But, at least for now,

397
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,303
I have you and Lucifer.

398
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,055
My brave boys.

399
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,192
So if I'm here on Earth

400
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,694
for two more years...

401
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,614
or two hours...

402
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,784
I will take every moment that I can get.

403
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:19,834
Yeah, the tip said
that we'd find Kimo here.

404
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,586
I guess we have to just sit tight.

405
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,089
Where did that sandwich come from?

406
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:27,425
The patrol guys give them to
us when we're on stakeouts.

407
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:28,476
I'm starving.

408
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,229
What the hell?

409
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,898
What part of "opposite
day" don't you understand?

410
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,267
It was a random car accident.

411
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:39,103
Well, let's agree... that you're wrong.

412
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,438
What is with you?

413
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,690
Why are you suddenly so
concerned for my well-being?

414
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,946
Oh, m...

415
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:48,947
Kimo Van Zandt.

416
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,665
In the flesh. Here we go.

417
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,252
What the hell?

418
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,789
On the ground, now!

419
00:15:57,841 --> 00:16:00,792
On the ground.

420
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,377
You. Over there.

421
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,132
Dude, no way!

422
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,435
The Weaponizer just tried to jump me?

423
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,643
Why did you attack the
guy in the parking lot?

424
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:23,996
I swear, I wasn't going

425
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:25,437
- to hurt him.
- Was he a terrorist

426
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:27,238
about to plant a bomb?

427
00:16:27,274 --> 00:16:29,324
Leader of a murderous cult, perhaps?

428
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:30,742
He must be someone really evil

429
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:32,577
for the Weaponizer to get involved.

430
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:34,446
He's just some guy

431
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:36,247
in trouble with the Mob.

432
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:37,832
So they've got his family

433
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:40,085
and they're forcing him
to kill the president.

434
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,454
No. He's got gambling debts.

435
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,788
H-Hold on.

436
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:46,341
So you, former A-list, B-list actor,

437
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:48,343
you're now breaking legs for the Mob?

438
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:50,512
It's to pay the bills.

439
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:52,464
I'm broke.

440
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,966
Oh, come now.

441
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:56,468
Look at me.

442
00:16:56,553 --> 00:16:58,970
You're the Weaponizer.

443
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:03,024
What is it your badass-kicking
self truly desires, hmm?

444
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,478
For my wife to be happy.

445
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,197
That's why I've been
willing to take any job.

446
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:11,316
So she won't find out.

447
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:14,653
She's my...

448
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:16,538
lighthouse.

449
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:19,491
What happened to you, man?

450
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:21,159
Your lighthouse?

451
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:22,794
Pathetic.

452
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,462
Was killing Wesley Cabot

453
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:26,965
another case of leg-breaking
gone awry or what?

454
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,299
No!

455
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:29,668
I-I'd never hurt Wesley.

456
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:31,169
- We were friends.
- Huh.

457
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:32,837
- Could've fooled me.
- We had a public rivalry,

458
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:35,173
but-but it was just for business.

459
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:37,676
In reality,
we share everything.

460
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:38,633
The same managers, agents, lawyers...

461
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,572
- Wives?
- I'm not proud

462
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:44,349
of how it went down with
Jamie, but we fell in love.

463
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:46,484
And Wesley forgave me.

464
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,020
We even kept our friendship
secret from Jamie

465
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:50,238
so it wouldn't be weird.

466
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:52,157
Then where were you this
morning at 7:00 a.m.?

467
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:54,359
We know it wasn't ActionCon. I was

468
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:58,029
signing stuff at a small
comic book store.

469
00:17:58,115 --> 00:18:00,999
I lied to Jamie because I
don't want her to know

470
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,250
how bad it's gotten.

471
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:03,918
Detective.

472
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:05,920
Yeah.

473
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:08,673
You should look at this.

474
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:12,877
Your prints were on the murder weapon.

475
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:14,596
Kimo Van Zandt, you're under arrest

476
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:16,431
for the murder of Wesley Cabot.

477
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:19,050
N-No. No!

478
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:21,553
No!

479
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:28,293
I don't think he did it.

480
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:29,894
Why? 'Cause he's the Weaponizer?

481
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:31,896
The Weaponizer once bit a man's ear off

482
00:18:31,948 --> 00:18:33,898
for looking at him funny...
this puddle of whine

483
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,867
doesn't have it in him anymore.
He breaks legs

484
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:38,119
- for the Mob.
- Yes, but he's not a killer.

485
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:40,538
All he cares about is his
well-preserved wife.

486
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:42,707
Maybe he can get a jury to buy that.
I don't.

487
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:44,709
And, personally, I'm happy
the judge set his bail

488
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:45,710
at half a million.

489
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:47,545
Now Dan has time to check his alibi,

490
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:50,081
and...

491
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,584
I thought he was broke.

492
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:53,968
Oh, I paid his bail.

493
00:18:54,054 --> 00:18:55,920
Even in this woeful, pathetic state,

494
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:57,922
the Weaponizer does not
spend one minute in jail.

495
00:18:58,008 --> 00:18:59,140
"Not on my watch."

496
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:00,975
See what I
did there, with the...

497
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:03,094
I literally don't know what
to say to you right now.

498
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:04,429
Mr. Morningstar.

499
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:06,431
- Yes.
- Uh, Ryan Goldburg,

500
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:08,600
uh, Kimo's business manager.

501
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:10,935
I wanted to thank you
for making his bail.

502
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:13,306
Uh, you know, Kimo sure as
hell couldn't pay it himself.

503
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,157
Oh, it's the least I could do
for a true national treasure.

504
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:18,359
So, for someone with so
many hit movies under their belt,

505
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:19,611
why is he so broke?

506
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:22,113
Exotic cars. Private islands.

507
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:24,115
You know what costs more
than an albino tiger?

508
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:26,835
The upkeep on an albino tiger.

509
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,169
He blew through his money.

510
00:19:28,255 --> 00:19:29,204
Didn't listen.

511
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,122
And now there's no more coming in.

512
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,458
- Thanks again.
- Yes.

513
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,126
Such a tragedy.

514
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:37,345
Well, it's always a tragedy
when someone gets killed.

515
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,130
No, I'm talking about his tiger.

516
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:41,015
I would have bought it if I'd known.

517
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:45,887
Why isn't Dan checking the alibi?

518
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:47,639
Dan...

519
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:59,317
I want to talk about Uriel.

520
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,819
Well, what's there to talk about?

521
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:02,821
Punch, taunt, punch, groin stomp.
Repeat.

522
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:04,656
Yeah, listen, Luci, I've been thinking,

523
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,492
there might be a better way to
handle this without violence.

524
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:08,607
What, like hugging him back to Heaven?

525
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:11,045
Like hiding Mom. Hiding Chloe.

526
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:11,996
And wait Uriel out.

527
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:14,499
- What?
- Look, just because he told us his plan

528
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:16,334
doesn't mean that's his plan.

529
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:17,502
It's Uriel.

530
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:20,004
It could be a trap.

531
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,224
Brother, you've been here too long.

532
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,009
It's changed you.

533
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:28,313
- What do you mean?
- Meaning that ever since

534
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:30,231
you've been here, you've
had to restrain yourself.

535
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:33,518
But this is Uriel. You're you.

536
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:36,070
Amenadiel. Firstborn.

537
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:37,772
Unleash yourself.

538
00:20:37,858 --> 00:20:39,824
Enjoy it.

539
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:45,530
Look, you do know that he
was always afraid of you.

540
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:47,761
- Don't mock me, Lucifer.
- I'm not. It's true.

541
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:49,569
All right? Growing up, we...

542
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:52,453
well, we all looked up to you.

543
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:55,506
You were like our very own action star.

544
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:57,425
Even you?

545
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,626
Well, don't get me wrong. You were

546
00:20:58,712 --> 00:21:00,378
a major power-hungry dick about it.

547
00:21:00,463 --> 00:21:02,881
But trust me.

548
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:07,051
Just the sight of you will send
quivers down Uriel's spine.

549
00:21:09,055 --> 00:21:10,688
You're right.

550
00:21:10,724 --> 00:21:12,857
All he needs to see is me

551
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:14,692
in all of my glory.

552
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:18,112
And there's that angelic
ego I'm talking about.

553
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:19,731
Right.

554
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:22,150
You know what to do.

555
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:33,461
Uriel.

556
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:37,715
Amenadiel.

557
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:41,135
It's good to see you, little brother.

558
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:44,589
You're a welcome sight for sore eyes.

559
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:46,891
- I am?
- Of course you are.

560
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:52,263
But, Uri, you must go home.

561
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:54,565
I really do have
everything under control.

562
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:56,150
Are you sure?

563
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:59,821
Lucifer's still on Earth.
Now Mom's here, too.

564
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:02,440
Uh... It almost looks like
you're in over your head.

565
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:04,826
But don't worry.

566
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:06,995
I'm here to help.

567
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,781
Yeah.

568
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:12,784
You really think I need your help?

569
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:14,285
You.

570
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:17,338
Pathetic, small Uriel.

571
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:20,291
Not the eldest son.

572
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,126
Not the young rebel.

573
00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:25,463
But an angel buried somewhere
deep in the middle.

574
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:27,598
Lost in the crowd

575
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:28,716
- of your betters.
- That is not...

576
00:22:28,802 --> 00:22:31,185
If God wants something done,

577
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:34,522
he sends me, Uri.

578
00:22:35,642 --> 00:22:38,142
Me.

579
00:22:38,194 --> 00:22:40,611
Not you.

580
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:42,730
I am Amenadiel.

581
00:22:42,816 --> 00:22:44,148
The fury

582
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,283
and the righteousness of our father.

583
00:22:45,318 --> 00:22:48,653
And you, little brother,
are standing in my way.

584
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:51,956
Okay. You're right.

585
00:22:51,992 --> 00:22:53,992
I'm sorry.

586
00:22:55,295 --> 00:22:57,295
I'll return home.

587
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:03,718
You know what? Something's bothering me.

588
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,838
I knew it.

589
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,840
"Fury of God"

590
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:10,508
doesn't usually talk so much.

591
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:12,226
More a man of action.

592
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:15,313
Amenadiel, at full strength, I
could never beat this easily.

593
00:23:15,348 --> 00:23:17,231
Something's happened to you.

594
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:21,352
I saw this coming, you know.

595
00:23:21,438 --> 00:23:22,520
I mean, not this exactly,

596
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:24,772
because patterns are never that precise,

597
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:26,024
but your pride

598
00:23:26,076 --> 00:23:28,276
was always gonna be your undoing.

599
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:30,078
After all, the bigger they are...

600
00:23:30,163 --> 00:23:34,449
Well, I think even you can
guess what comes next.

601
00:23:39,456 --> 00:23:41,956
I'm glad you came instead of Lucifer.

602
00:23:43,676 --> 00:23:45,710
And I've waited so long for this.

603
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:47,795
Forgive me if I enjoy it.

604
00:23:54,748 --> 00:23:57,528
- So did Kimo's alibi check out?
- Uh, yeah.

605
00:23:57,553 --> 00:23:59,754
Yeah. According to the owner
of the comic book store,

606
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,422
Kimo was there all morning,
signing merchandise.

607
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:04,508
So you had to confiscate all
these toys just to tell me that?

608
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:07,395
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's a visual aid.

609
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,055
Right.

610
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,954
Look, those dolls, they're
selling like hotcakes.

611
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,766
The owner said that ever
since Body Bags started

612
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,601
streaming on Netflix, he
can't keep them in stock.

613
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,603
And that relates to the murder how?

614
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,238
Well, at the scene,

615
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:20,274
Wesley was going over all of
his old Body Bags 4 stuff.

616
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,109
Mm-hmm. Including his old contract,

617
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:23,611
says he's entitled to one percent

618
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,362
of all merchandising revenue.
It's not much.

619
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:28,089
So I had the studio send over
a copy of their contract.

620
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:29,500
- Mm-hmm.
- Look at that.

621
00:24:29,585 --> 00:24:31,419
Says Wesley should be
getting ten percent.

622
00:24:31,454 --> 00:24:33,954
Yeah. I also took a look at
Kimo Van Zandt's contract.

623
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,790
Same thing happened to him.

624
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,125
Kimo and Wesley shared everything.
Wives, agents...

625
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:39,260
business managers.

626
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:40,928
- Ryan Goldburg.
- Ryan Goldburg.

627
00:24:40,963 --> 00:24:42,763
Wesley figured out Ryan's
scam, confronted him,

628
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,765
and then Ryan killed
him to keep him quiet.

629
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:46,300
Yeah. But how did he get Kimo's prints

630
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,302
on the murder weapon so
that he could frame him?

631
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:49,303
I'm gonna ask him.

632
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:50,554
All right. You coming?

633
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,106
No, no. You got this covered.

634
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:53,691
What? You've been attached to me all day

635
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:55,693
and now that we may have
figured out who killed Wesley,

636
00:24:55,778 --> 00:24:56,382
you're just leaving?

637
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:58,219
Yes. Well, by now, the threat
to you should've passed.

638
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:00,614
But just in case, I've some
family business to attend to.

639
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,615
All right?

640
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:03,651
Fine. I'll go alone.

641
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:09,990
It's like, get a room already, right?

642
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,325
What?

643
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:13,661
Too soon?

644
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:16,330
Sorry.

645
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,632
So, um... how-how's the...
the case going?

646
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:19,834
It's fine.

647
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,136
Yeah, it looks like the
money manager did it.

648
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:24,221
Tried to frame Kimo Van Zandt.

649
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:25,556
Don't know how yet.

650
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:28,592
Man, killed by your own weird award.

651
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:30,478
That's gotta suck.

652
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:32,480
It was actually...

653
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:34,849
It was really, really
touching when they got it.

654
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,519
When they got it.

655
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:40,404
There were two awards.

656
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,239
Thanks. What are you talking about?

657
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:43,440
There were two awards,

658
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:44,825
because a fight takes two people.

659
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:46,527
One of the awards was given to Wesley...

660
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,195
- And one to Kimo.
- Someone must've

661
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,446
switched out his award for Wesley's.

662
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:51,165
That's why Kimo's prints were on it.

663
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,199
Jamie Lee Adrienne was at the dojo.

664
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:53,868
Maybe she had access to Kimo's award.

665
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:55,169
Maybe she's working with Ryan.

666
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,337
Okay, you find Jamie,

667
00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:57,755
I'll get the business manager.
His office said

668
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,790
he's having lunch at the Ignacia Hotel.

669
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:05,095
Ah! Right, let me just make myself comfy

670
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,598
because I cannot wait

671
00:26:07,683 --> 00:26:10,217
to hear how you sent Urinal packing.

672
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:13,053
And please
do not skimp on any

673
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,889
of the gory details.

674
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,560
This would never have happened

675
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,729
if you'd listened to me earlier.

676
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:27,568
How is this possible, brother?

677
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,907
I no longer have my powers.

678
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,326
Well, what happened to them?
Oh, I don't know, Luci,

679
00:26:35,411 --> 00:26:36,577
pick a sin.

680
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,913
Is it because I released
a damned soul from Hell?

681
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,749
Slept with a demon? Is it
because I'm working with you?

682
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,584
Or because of Mom?

683
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:48,756
Or am I simply no longer worthy?

684
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:54,511
It's time that I faced
the truth, brother.

685
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:59,266
I've fallen.

686
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,356
Well.

687
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:07,608
Welcome to the club.
Meetings are on Tuesdays.

688
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,860
It's different for me, Luci.

689
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:11,362
It's different.

690
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:13,747
I no longer have my powers.

691
00:27:13,783 --> 00:27:15,199
My very strength...

692
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:16,667
Big deal!

693
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:19,620
It's probably the best thing
that ever happened to you.

694
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:22,590
But right now I haven't got
time to hold your hand,

695
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:24,959
because I need to clear up your mess!

696
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:27,127
- My mess?
- Uriel's still out there.

697
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,712
And the clock is up...

698
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:31,298
which means the detective
is in grave danger.

699
00:27:57,994 --> 00:27:59,660
Are you serious?

700
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:03,464
What? You wear the orange vest,
you can do whatever you want?!

701
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,526
- Stop it!
- Why are you barking now?

702
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:39,800
What is wrong with you?

703
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,090
Oh! I am your mother!

704
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:47,184
- Sort of.
- Did you make one of them your pet?

705
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:48,882
I figured out the husband,

706
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:50,383
then it was the job,

707
00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:52,135
now it's the children.

708
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,137
This is
supposed to be a time out

709
00:28:54,222 --> 00:28:56,640
to
teach you a lesson!

710
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:59,059
I don't think that's how time outs work.

711
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:04,948
Mommy, I'm sorry.

712
00:29:07,986 --> 00:29:10,654
Maybe you're not so bad after all.

713
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:11,905
We need to talk.

714
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,970
What?

715
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:29,339
Detective Decker.

716
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:30,724
What are you doing here?

717
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:32,592
I could ask you two the same thing.

718
00:29:32,678 --> 00:29:34,427
Uh, we're just having
a business meeting.

719
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:35,595
- Yeah.
- Mm.

720
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:37,097
You make out with all your clients?

721
00:29:37,182 --> 00:29:38,732
What's the occasion? You celebrating

722
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:41,851
the successful theft of Wesley
and Kimo's merchandising money?

723
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:44,404
I would never steal from my clients.

724
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:46,940
Oh, you are clever, Ryan.

725
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:49,025
- What is she talking about, Ryan?
- What I'm talking about

726
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:50,410
is how Wesley realized

727
00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:52,862
his action figures were
selling like hotcakes,

728
00:29:52,914 --> 00:29:54,531
did some investigating,

729
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,333
and saw that he was getting robbed.

730
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:58,084
- I think you should go.
- Unfortunately for Wesley,

731
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,453
he shared his concerns
about his business manager

732
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,373
with his ex-wife, who happened
to be sleeping with him.

733
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:05,375
And that voice mail
that you played for us,

734
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,677
that's what started this, and
that's what got him killed.

735
00:30:10,215 --> 00:30:11,348
He did it!

736
00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:12,432
He's the one

737
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:13,883
- who killed Wesley!
- What?!

738
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:15,218
No, it was her idea!

739
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,103
It was her idea to switch
out the Nunchuck Award,

740
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:18,104
cover it in blood...

741
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,938
Don't shoot!

742
00:30:19,024 --> 00:30:20,807
You stole from me,

743
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:21,941
killed Wesley,

744
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,694
then you tried to frame me for it?!

745
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,447
- Kimo...
- I cared about both of you!

746
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:29,366
No, please!

747
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:30,533
Kimo...

748
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:32,202
put the gun down. Please.

749
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:34,120
They murdered Wesley.

750
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:36,956
And they will pay for
that, I promise you.

751
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:40,160
But don't let them ruin your
life, too, Kimo. Please.

752
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:41,411
My life is already ruined.

753
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:42,662
Get out of the way.

754
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:43,713
No. I'll shoot you!

755
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:44,964
I don't care anymore!

756
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,216
Kimo!

757
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:48,418
Lucifer, stay back.

758
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:49,669
Guys, stand down.

759
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:51,671
Detective, you don't know
what you're up against.

760
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:53,923
This was engineered to
put you in harm's way.

761
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:55,842
You must believe me.

762
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:56,926
Lucifer,

763
00:30:57,012 --> 00:30:59,979
I know exactly what I'm up against.

764
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:01,765
It's just a man...

765
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,817
who's in a lot of pain.

766
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:10,774
Kimo, a couple days ago

767
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:13,777
I was in a really bad car accident.

768
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:16,196
And I've spent the last few days

769
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:18,581
trying to convince everybody
that cares about me

770
00:31:18,617 --> 00:31:20,500
that it wasn't a big deal.

771
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:22,585
The truth is...

772
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:25,004
I'm terrified.

773
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,291
I'm scared of how it can all just end...

774
00:31:28,343 --> 00:31:29,793
with no rhyme or reason.

775
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:32,095
And what I want to do right now

776
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,130
is just go home

777
00:31:34,216 --> 00:31:36,349
and read a bedtime story to my daughter.

778
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:40,470
But... you know... that's
not up to me, either.

779
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:43,807
We can't control what happens to us,

780
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:47,310
only how it affects us
and the choices we make.

781
00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:50,447
So, please.

782
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:53,783
Make the right choice, Kimo.

783
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,819
Please put down the gun.

784
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:11,417
Thank you.

785
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:16,089
Well, well done, Detective.

786
00:32:16,174 --> 00:32:17,841
Kimo was about to do a very bad thing.

787
00:32:17,926 --> 00:32:19,976
Oh, well, not on my watch.

788
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:23,096
Very good.

789
00:32:23,181 --> 00:32:25,014
Let me escort you back to the station.

790
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,934
No... I'm-I'm okay.

791
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:30,904
You know, I don't believe in fate.

792
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:33,490
And I don't believe in bad luck.

793
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:37,660
And I appreciate your
concern, but come what may.

794
00:32:37,696 --> 00:32:40,663
I am leaving here... alone.

795
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:43,249
Very well.

796
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:46,703
But just... buckle up,
Detective, please.

797
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:49,873
Right. Now, if you'll excuse me.

798
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:53,259
There's something I need to deal with.

799
00:33:10,612 --> 00:33:11,694
Lucifer.

800
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,813
Mum.

801
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:16,399
I'm letting Uriel take me back to Hell.

802
00:33:17,736 --> 00:33:20,236
Well, there's no need
to overreact, Mother.

803
00:33:20,322 --> 00:33:22,121
Let her go.

804
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:24,407
It's the right move.

805
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:26,075
Right. Of course.

806
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:27,410
Remind me at some point
to give you a refresher

807
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:28,745
on the meaning of loyalty.

808
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,381
It's what's best for everyone.

809
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:34,751
She goes back to Hell,
where she belongs;

810
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,386
Chloe is safe,

811
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:39,589
and I don't have to clean
up your mess anymore.

812
00:33:39,674 --> 00:33:43,760
More importantly, you
get to keep your word.

813
00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:45,144
I am keeping my word.

814
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,764
You're serving out your
sentence here on Earth.

815
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:49,265
You know that's not what
your Father wanted.

816
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:50,600
Do I?!

817
00:33:50,685 --> 00:33:53,736
Everyone thinks they know what He wants.

818
00:33:53,772 --> 00:33:57,273
Amenadiel did when he first
got here, now Uriel does.

819
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,076
Human wars have been
waged because of it.

820
00:34:00,111 --> 00:34:02,195
Dad showed me

821
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,197
an open door.

822
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:06,249
Does that mean I was meant
to take you back to Hell

823
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:08,835
or was he insinuating that
Hell was getting drafty?

824
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,203
Nobody bloody knows,

825
00:34:10,288 --> 00:34:13,206
because the selfish bastard
won't just tell us!

826
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,292
And I'm sick of it.

827
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:17,877
No more.

828
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:20,880
No more.

829
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:24,350
There's my Lightbringer.

830
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:26,436
My Morningstar.

831
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:32,442
Uriel was so small when he was a child.

832
00:34:32,477 --> 00:34:35,778
All he ever wanted was to play
with you and the older kids.

833
00:34:35,814 --> 00:34:37,447
But you all excluded him.

834
00:34:37,482 --> 00:34:38,648
Yes.

835
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
And every time he came back,

836
00:34:40,785 --> 00:34:42,652
pestering us again.

837
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:44,621
Which is strange,

838
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:46,706
considering he knew what
the outcome would be.

839
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:50,493
That's how much he wanted
to be around you, Lucifer.

840
00:34:50,578 --> 00:34:53,329
Uriel is a stubborn boy.

841
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:55,048
When he sets his mind,

842
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,750
it doesn't waver.

843
00:34:57,836 --> 00:35:00,136
He's not going to give up until he has

844
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:02,138
either me or that detective.

845
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:03,923
Mum...

846
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:06,509
I refuse to believe that.

847
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:09,145
There is always another way.

848
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,399
If anyone can find it, it's you.

849
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:47,767
For a brief moment,

850
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:51,554
the pattern faltered.

851
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:54,107
I thought it meant you'd
actually bring Mom.

852
00:35:54,192 --> 00:35:56,893
That somehow, you'd surprise me.
'Cause for once in my life,

853
00:35:56,978 --> 00:35:58,945
I'd like to be surprised, but no.

854
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,731
No, here you are.

855
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:09,072
Are you done hiding behind
our big brother's skirt?

856
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:12,375
Yes, it's just me now.

857
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:15,476
Big, bad Lucifer.

858
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,589
We've already had this
fight before, Lucifer.

859
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:25,992
Right here.

860
00:36:26,032 --> 00:36:27,383
You see, in my head,

861
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:29,509
I've seen everything you do.

862
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:31,878
I've heard every dumb
quip you have to say.

863
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:33,179
Right, let me guess...

864
00:36:33,214 --> 00:36:34,881
in your version, I deliver Mom to you,

865
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:38,217
apologizing, tears
streaming down my face.

866
00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:39,886
Actually, no. In my version,

867
00:36:39,938 --> 00:36:41,604
you refuse to give Mom up

868
00:36:41,689 --> 00:36:44,023
and your human friend dies.

869
00:36:44,058 --> 00:36:45,525
Yes, you've tried that twice now.

870
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,809
Not much luck.

871
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:49,061
Maybe you're not as good
at this as you thought.

872
00:36:49,113 --> 00:36:51,147
Maybe I'm building up to a big finale.

873
00:36:52,817 --> 00:36:54,734
All right.

874
00:36:54,786 --> 00:36:56,819
Uriel...

875
00:36:56,905 --> 00:36:59,405
you don't know what Dad wants.

876
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:01,290
None of us do.

877
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:03,576
- So I think...
- You're right.

878
00:37:03,628 --> 00:37:06,412
I don't know what Dad wants.
None of us do.

879
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:08,714
Right.

880
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,883
Great, well, I'm glad we had this talk.

881
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:13,085
I'll see you at the next family reunion.

882
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:14,420
I'll buy the first round.

883
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:16,506
But I do know what he needs.

884
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:20,092
Mom's out. It's only a matter of time

885
00:37:20,178 --> 00:37:21,844
before she finds her way back to Heaven,

886
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,596
and then he'll forgive her.

887
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:26,098
- He would never do that.
- Why not? You did.

888
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:28,267
She's been here, like, what...
three minutes?

889
00:37:28,353 --> 00:37:29,685
Now you're already defending her.

890
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:31,687
Dad'll do the same thing.

891
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:33,523
He'll let His guard down.

892
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,608
And then she'll destroy Him.

893
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:40,780
I need to make sure that doesn't happen.

894
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:44,200
That's Azrael's Blade.

895
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:45,785
How do you have it?

896
00:37:45,837 --> 00:37:47,453
I borrowed it off the Angel of Death

897
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:48,838
when she wasn't looking.

898
00:37:48,923 --> 00:37:51,290
You're not planning on
taking Mom back to Hell.

899
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:54,293
That weapon will wipe her
out of existence entirely.

900
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:56,212
No Heaven, no Hell, just...

901
00:37:57,849 --> 00:37:58,965
just gone.

902
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,800
Finally, a moment of clarity between us.

903
00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:03,553
You've gone completely insane, brother.

904
00:38:03,638 --> 00:38:05,471
I'm doing what has to be done,

905
00:38:05,523 --> 00:38:07,106
and you've run out of time.

906
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:09,642
See, I don't care about
your deal with Dad.

907
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:12,028
I don't care about what
happens to your little human.

908
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:13,813
But it's obvious you care for her

909
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:16,315
a tad more than you do Mom.

910
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:19,318
Now, all I need to do

911
00:38:19,404 --> 00:38:22,371
is hit this one little key right here.

912
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:25,458
A sequence will begin,
and two days from now...

913
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:28,160
your cute little human will finally die.

914
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:31,881
So, Lucifer,

915
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:34,333
you can either let that happen

916
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:36,218
or you can give me Mom.

917
00:38:36,304 --> 00:38:38,304
Last chance.

918
00:38:39,891 --> 00:38:41,891
You choose.

919
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:45,261
Very well.

920
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:51,567
Well, you didn't see
that coming, did you?

921
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:52,985
Eh?

922
00:38:55,156 --> 00:38:57,823
Actually, I did see it coming.

923
00:39:03,114 --> 00:39:06,198
I mean, I knew you were gonna attack.

924
00:39:06,284 --> 00:39:08,034
I just wasn't sure how.

925
00:39:15,426 --> 00:39:16,876
Patterns are tricky like that.

926
00:39:16,928 --> 00:39:19,095
Takes time to get a real sense of them.

927
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:23,215
I needed to study you a bit.

928
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:28,020
Took much less time than I expected.

929
00:39:28,056 --> 00:39:30,723
Aah!

930
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:51,494
You're lucky I'd never

931
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:53,913
use Azrael's Blade on you, brother.

932
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:00,753
Why don't you pick on a girl?

933
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:02,054
But I have no qualms

934
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:05,257
about using it on a filthy,
scum-sucking demon.

935
00:40:22,777 --> 00:40:24,860
You haven't disappointed, Mazikeen.

936
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:26,946
Your patterns were tough to see.

937
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:31,951
Aah!

938
00:40:34,672 --> 00:40:37,673
But still predictable nonetheless.

939
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,971
Because you made it so difficult,

940
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:55,558
now I'm gonna take out
Mom and the detective.

941
00:40:56,944 --> 00:40:58,444
You can't stop me, brother.

942
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,869
I didn't see that coming.

943
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:22,334
What did he say?

944
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:26,806
I... I couldn't understand.

945
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:29,341
Prick got what he deserved.

946
00:41:34,649 --> 00:41:36,649
He was my brother.

947
00:41:54,085 --> 00:41:56,035
"As the first stars came out,

948
00:41:56,087 --> 00:41:58,621
"Coraline finally allowed
herself to drift into sleep.

949
00:41:58,706 --> 00:42:01,373
"While the gentle upstairs
music of the mouse circus

950
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:03,709
"spilled out onto the warm evening air,

951
00:42:03,795 --> 00:42:07,763
telling the world that the
summer was almost done."

952
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,599
Read it again.

953
00:42:10,685 --> 00:42:13,135
You want me to read it again?

954
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:15,554
Okay, baby.

955
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,223
"Coraline discovered the door

956
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:19,558
"a little while after they
moved into the house...

957
00:42:28,736 --> 00:42:30,369
What happened?

958
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:43,549
Where's Uriel?

959
00:42:50,308 --> 00:42:52,424
Oh...

960
00:42:55,189 --> 00:42:57,406
What have I done?

961
00:42:57,538 --> 00:43:00,017
No... No, no, no.

962
