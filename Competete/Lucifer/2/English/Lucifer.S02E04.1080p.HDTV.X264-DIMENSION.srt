you're taking.

9
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:16,731
It's hard going out on your own.

10
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:17,832
I need to figure out

11
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:19,234
where I fit in in this world,

12
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,503
and to do that,
I need some space.

13
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:22,649
You see, I did make a promise.

14
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:24,539
I told you that
you could stay here

15
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:27,409

to reconcile my deal with Dad,

16
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,643
and now I have.

17
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,779
You shall remain right here,

00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:36,284

00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:13,282
No phones

Oh, why not?

Love these.

71
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,834
And, do you know,
I've never understood these.

72
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:35,336
Are they just decorative,
or are they for juggling?

73
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:36,471
I mean...

74
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,174
Yeah, you seem
very distracted today.

75
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,643
Oi!

76
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:43,311
Oh, nearly.

77
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:44,679
Okay.

78
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,748
Sometimes, when we're in crisis,

79
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:48,716
we create distractions
for ourselves,

80
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,219
also known as
barriers to facing

81
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,288
our deepest fears.

82
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:55,190
Oh, sorry... right.

83
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:57,425
This is the part where you, um,

84
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:00,328
dissect my deep
psychological wounds, eh?

85
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,363
The emotion-charged gong show
of a child of divorce

86
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,599
who may or may not have
broken a deal with his dad

87
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:06,234
by allowing his mum
to stay on Earth.

88
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,703
Mm. Has the visit
with your mom been hard?

89
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:10,605
Piece of cake, actually.

90
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,307
Mum's all sorted; not a problem.

91
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:13,374
Really?

92
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,909
Because the last time
you were here,

93
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,511
you used the word "frightened."

94
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:19,247
And that's not like you.

95
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,049
Well, turns out Mum's a peach.

96
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:23,051
Hmm. And the "deal"
with your dad?

97
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:24,652
To send Mum home?

98
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:26,265
What, you think I'm scared
of Him or something?

99
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,725
I think you're trying to avoid
the unpleasantness of conflict.

100
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:33,561
Hold on.

101
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:34,796
So you're saying

102
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,398
that distraction is a way
to avert your problems.

103
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:37,979
No.

104
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,036
Ergo, the more I distract,
the less I worry.

105
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,469
No, I did not say that.

106
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,304
Well, you didn't need to,
Doctor, I just did,

107
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,906
and it's bloody brilliant.

108
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,574
Right.

109
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,644
Where are you going?

110
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,446
Distraction calls.

111
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,648
This really is a breakthrough;
thank you.

112
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,251
I'm just gonna...
Sure.

113
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:06,794
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>who needs a gun and a badge</i>

114
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,530

115
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,431
Hey, it's a crime scene.
Will you focus?

116
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,401
Well, someone's a
grumpy pants today.

117
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:15,436
Well, sorry,
I got a lot on my mind.

118
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:16,905
Yes, sorry, you have,
haven't you?

119
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,774
D-word, moving out of your
mum's, finding a new place...

120
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:22,076
Yeah, well, I'm a big girl
and I need my space,

121
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:23,444
and it's time.

122
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,713
Not that I have much
with work and Trixie.

123
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:27,048
Stress can be so aging.

124
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,616
You need a distraction

125
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:29,662
from your woes, Detective.

126
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,830
It's a highly effective tool.

127
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,920
Mm-hmm.

128
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:33,388
When was the last
time you had fun?

129
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:35,156
Oh... well...

130
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,257
No, seriously,

131
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:38,126
name three friends
you could call right now

132
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:39,338
for a drink.
And you can't say me,

133
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,029
your child or the man
you're divorcing.

134
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,163
Well, trust me,

135
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,839
Dan is not on my list
of drinking buddies.

136
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,066
Well...

137
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:45,810
Daniel.

138
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:46,669
Hey.

139
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,002
I didn't mean it like that.

140
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,304
She did.

141
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:50,838
What do we have
on the Vic?

142
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,173
Young female.

143
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,374
C.O.D. unknown.

144
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,809
Another fresh-faced ingenue.

145
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:55,526
Truly tragic.

146
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,445
I.D.?

147
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:58,546
No personal belongings,
just a, uh,

148
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:00,648
a triangular-shaped
ink stamp on her hand.

149
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:02,195
Oh, hold on. I might be
able to help with this.

150
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,030
This is something someone might
find at a "night club."

151
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,421
You know,
where humans go to have "fun"?

152
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:08,890
We found an abandoned
vehicle registered to Uber.

153
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:11,059
No sign of the driver.

154
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,996
Password's "Carnal,"
capital "C."

155
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:16,631
Uber I.D.s are usually linked

156
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,500
to the driver's phone,
not the car.

157
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,369
And now that we have
his number,

158
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,870
by the looks of this map,

159
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,939
our guy is on the corner
of Crescent and Third.

160
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:26,107
Impressive.

161
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:27,382
Yeah, it's called
"police work."

162
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,277
Let's solve a murder.

163
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:30,790
I can assist you with that.

164
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:32,447
It's brilliant.

165
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,125
Her name's Daria Mitchell.

166
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,661
We traced her credit card
to a small bank in Nebraska.

167
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:49,163
We know you were
the last one to see her alive.

168
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,965
I didn't touch her!
Well...

169
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:54,302
except to toss her cold, dead
corpse into the bushes and run.

170
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:55,703
I told you.

171
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:58,239
I picked her up on the corner
of Gower and Franklin,

172
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,141
gave her a ride,

173
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:02,010
and then she jumped
out of my moving car.

174
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:03,678
You just left her there to die?

175
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:07,649
By the time I pulled over and
found her, she was already...

176
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:11,319
I'm on new meds.
I wasn't thinking straight.

177
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,921
I just got this job.
I panicked.

178
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,997
Killer cliché : "I panicked,"
closely followed by...

179
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:17,093
T-Talk to the other guy!

180
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:18,940
What other guy?

181
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:21,462
She used
my phone to call somebody.

Her boyfriend, I don't know.

183
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:24,666
She wanted to go
over to his place,

184
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:26,534
he threatened to kill her.

185
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,102
Oh! Excuse me.

186
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:30,505
Oh, it's you.

187
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,074

Did you come here to gloat?

193
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,928
I just came to see how the

194
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:56,564
supreme goddess was acclimating.

195
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,311
Well, I wouldn't plan
a festival of celebration

196
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,867
just yet, my dear.

197
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:01,969

00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,879
Ha. Well, of course
there have been challenges.

202
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:14,349
Nothing I can't handle.

203
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:16,484
I'm still on
a sabbatical from work,

204
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,119
so I spend the bulk of my day

205
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:21,556
at home with the... children.

206
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,024
Factories of filth.

207
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:24,392
Of mire.

208
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:28,162

if I'm being honest.

00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,099
And how's that human husband?

210
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,201
I discovered a trick with him.

211
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:36,003
Whenever he asks a question,
I just have sex with him.

212
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,772
Seems to render him mute.

213
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:40,742
Hmm. Took me a while
to figure that one out.

214
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:43,044
As for the rest of it,

215
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,680
for lack of a better word,
it is absolute...

216
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,515
hell.

217
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,651
Well, if it's so bad,
why don't you just go back?

218
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:52,220
Why?

219
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:53,921
So that you could go back
to torturing me

220
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,022

221
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,425

222
00:07:57,426 --> 00:07:59,962
Yes, these humans
are awful.

223
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:02,196
They breathe through their

250
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,581
I found a poison
in Daria's stomach contents.

251
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,816
It's called mandrake,

252
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:57,285
it's like this
crazy organic hallucinogen,

Mm-hmm!

255
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,690
It would've taken
at least 90 minutes

256
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:03,709
for it to kick in.

257
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:04,660
The Uber driver

258
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:05,838
had back-to-back
rides all night,

259
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:07,728
and he didn't pick up Daria
until 30 minutes

260
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:08,729
before she died.

261
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:09,554
Exactly.

262
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:10,499
He would've barely had time

263
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,600
to torture her with
his subpar jazz and creepy

265
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:16,904

266
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,372
Nada.

00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:21,209

273
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,885

00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:38,159

Yes, your realtor did say
this is a lovely area.

281
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:55,379
I have a realtor?

282
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:56,378
Well, I took the liberty

283
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,990
of calling several on
your behalf, actually.

284
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,447

00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:08,089

We're making artisanal sausage.

00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:07,507

316

321
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:17,672
Is there a waitress
you haven't slept with?

322
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:20,341
My gosh. Is hipster infidelity

323
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:22,110

324
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:23,556
Babe, I don't know
anything about that!

325
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,913
Infidelity or homicide?
Just...

326
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:26,381
Either.

327
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:31,085
Okay, look, I had
a little fling with Daria,

328
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:32,387
but I didn't kill her.

329
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:33,888
We got into a fight
last night when

330
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:35,201
she wanted to come over,
because I was with...

331
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:36,402
So you're saying
your wife is your alibi?

332
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:37,358
Actually, no.

333
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:38,760
I was with another waitress,

334
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:39,995
and Daria found out
about that.

335
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,896
And that's what
we were fighting about.

336
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:42,831
Okay, well, I'll need the name

337
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:44,465
and number of
the other waitress.

338
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:46,779
Yes, and I'd like to talk to you
about your herb garden, Davis,

339
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:49,103
because I was thinking about
taking up rooftop botany.

340
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:50,338
You know...

341
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:53,641
Excuse us.

342
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:56,611
Botany? Realtors?

343
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:59,013
Look, I get it. I know
your mom's in town.

344
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:00,782
We're both going
through some stuff.

345
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:02,550

I'm here, okay?

346
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,226
All right, understood.

347
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,253
No, now.

348
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:06,599
What's going on with you? Why is
it so hard for you to focus?

349
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:07,380
What's up?

350
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:10,325

My hands are
kind of full right now.

354
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:18,900
Right, well, here's the sitch:

355
00:12:18,935 --> 00:12:20,546
The detective is annoying me
with questions

356
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,804
that clearly won't lead
anywhere, so I need a favor.

357
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,305
Favors are your thing, not mine.

358
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,273
All right, then.

00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:26,274
What about a wager?

360
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:27,342
What's in it for me?

361
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:28,509
Whatever you want.

362
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:29,744
Your convertible.

363
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:30,790
Fine. But you need to take

364
00:12:30,814 --> 00:12:32,413
the detective out and have fun.

365
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,015
Three drinks
should do the trick.

366
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,885
Sucker's bet. Easy.

367
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,397
Yes, but you're not allowed
to tie her up

368
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:39,354
and pour booze down her throat.

369
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:40,722
Less easy.

370
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:41,972
Fine.

371
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:42,742
All right. Deal.

372
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:44,059
I said get naked!

373
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,293
Oh, hello.

374
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,528
Want to watch?

375
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,065
Okay, you were the last one
to talk to Daria;

376
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:52,700
you're telling me
you have no idea

377
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:53,968
who she was with
last night?

378
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:56,804
No. She was having
a girls' night.

379
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,742
She was roomies with
another waitress, uh, Naomi.

380
00:13:00,777 --> 00:13:03,211
Maybe she was with her.

381
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:04,545
Do not leave town.

382
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,182
So did Casanova's
alibi check out?

383
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:10,051
Working on it,
but in the meantime,

384
00:13:10,086 --> 00:13:12,787
Daria's roommate, Naomi, might
have an idea of her timeline.

385
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:15,823
Oh, lovely. Then can we go
for grilled polenta?

386
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:18,059
Well, I can't focus
on an empty stomach, Detective.

387
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:21,529
Hey...

388
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:32,340
Oh. Hi.

389
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,608
Hey, uh...

390
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:36,177
I just wanted
to return this.

391
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,478
Oh. Uh...

392
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:39,480
<i>Therapeutic Truth.</i>

393
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:41,215
So much for that, right?

394
00:13:44,154 --> 00:13:46,321
Are you okay?

395
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:51,225
One exhalation yes, two...

396
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:52,657
none of my business?

397
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:53,426
Yeah, listen.

398
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,430
Thanks for your concern,
but, um, I'm fine.

399
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:57,665
No more false pretenses,
remember?

400
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,134
Friendship
means honesty.

401
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,971
You can talk to
me, Amenadiel.

402
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:05,106
Apparently, that <i>is</i>
your real name.

403
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:07,709
It is.

404
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:13,848
This is hard to explain.

405
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:16,117
Uh, it's kind of a, uh...

406
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:17,352
physical problem.

407
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:18,553
Oh?

408
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:21,055
And things aren't working
the way they used to.

409
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,425
Oh.

410
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:26,372
And I-I don't, I don't know
what to do about that.

411
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:29,430
I see. Well, you know,
it's very common.

412
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:30,765
I doubt that.

413
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,066
Generally stress related.

414
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:33,468
It <i>is</i> very stressful.

415
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:34,602
My advice?

416
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:36,437
Don't overthink it.

417
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:39,674
You need to relax.
Try to put it out of your mind.

418
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:41,209
Maybe have a bit of fun.

419
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:42,710
- Fun?
- Yes.

420
00:14:42,746 --> 00:14:45,046
Maybe a cocktail.

421
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:47,582
And before you know it...

422
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:54,922
It doesn't make you any
less of a man, Amenadiel.

423
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,391
Not even a bit.

424
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:05,533
Was everything okay?

425
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:08,269
I haven't seen Daria
or Naomi all week.

426
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:10,104
We feed each other's cats.

427
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,774
Oh, gosh, I detest cats.

428
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:14,809
Want an animal to stare at you
with contempt?

429
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:16,577
Get a cat. Open box
of excrement

430
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:18,513
in your house? Cat.

431
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:19,847
Oh, gosh.
Can you smell that?

432
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:21,783
Foul, incontinent creatures.

433
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:24,752
That's not a cat smell.
That's a dead smell.

434
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,325
Oh, my God! Naomi!

435
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:39,801
She's got the same
triangular stamp as Daria.

436
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:42,036
Same signs of poison.

437
00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:44,238
Well, well. Talk about
a girls' night gone wrong.

438
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:55,076
(♪ "Time for Flight"
by Baby Alpaca, playing ♪ )

439
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,311
Lovely. Why don't we go
up to the penthouse,

440
00:15:59,312 --> 00:16:01,646
and I can show you the original
Stairway to Heaven.

441
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:04,247
Ah, Detective.

442
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:06,116
After 6:00 on a school night?

443
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:07,818
Ella's final
forensic report came in.

444
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:08,853
Right.

445
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:10,320
Um...

446
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:11,621
Sorry. Can this wait?

447
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:12,722
I mean,

448
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:14,257
those deaths were
fiendishly tragic,

449
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:16,660
but I'm pretty certain that
tomorrow, during office hours,

450
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:18,628
our dead girls
will still be dead.

451
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:19,629
I just wanted to run a couple...

452
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:21,031
Good. Saved me a trip.

453
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:22,262
You, me, drinking. Now.

454
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:23,137
I'm in!

455
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,066
What are you doing here?

456
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,298
Lucifer said I should drop by.

457
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:26,476
But we're working.

458
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:27,710
No, <i>you're</i> working.

459
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:28,811
Who the hell is she?

460
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:30,713
Oh, sorry. Hi, I'm Ella!

461
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:32,982
I was about
to give him the rundown

462
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:33,539
on your report.

463
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:34,751
- Do you want to...
- No, go for it.

464
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:36,118
I got to dehydrate. Whew!

465
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:39,121
Okay. Anyhow, first off,
there was tissue damage

466
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:40,956
to Daria's stomach lining,

467
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:42,324
caused by liquid nitrogen,

468
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,326
the stuff that makes
fancy cocktails smoke.

469
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:46,128
It's probably how
she ingested the poison.

470
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:47,174
Well, excellent lead, Detective,

471
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:48,897
but you just ruined
my ménage à trois.

472
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,500
Second, I assumed that Daria
was at a club on Gower,

473
00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:53,669
and we found an abandoned
building on the corner.

474
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:55,704
It looked like they had
recently had a party there.

475
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,705
Fascinating.

476
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:58,373
I'm thinking
it was a rave, so...

477
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:00,120
Any way you could make
some phone calls to help me out?

478
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,888
You know, you seem to have
your finger on the pulse.

479
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:03,912
Not the appendage
I'd hoped to be pulsing by now.

480
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:05,614
I know that hood.

481
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,715
There's a great tiki bar

482
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:08,450
across the street
from that building.

483
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,618
I know the bartender.

484
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,819
Course you do.

485
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:12,554
We could go and
have a drink,

486
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,022
ask about the
dead girls.

487
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:16,425
Yes. That sounds like
a very good lead, Detective.

488
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,926
If you want to
retrace the steps

489
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:19,795
of two hot girls
on a girls' night,

490
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,498
you need to think like two
hot girls on a girls' night.

491
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,032
With your lady parts.

492
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:26,201
And piña coladas
in hand.

493
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:28,470
Oh, my God, I <i>love</i> piña coladas!

494
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,038
Lovely!

495
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,652
So, I was watching
<i>Chinatown,</i> right?

496
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,320
And all of a sudden,
it hits me.

497
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,157
I need to go to L.A.
I mean, do you ever feel like

498
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,792
God is telling you
to do something?

499
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,026
No.

500
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:52,895
Oh. You think Chloe's
gonna drink that?

501
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,029
No.

502
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:58,100
Hey, guys. Do you
recognize this hand stamp?

503
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,536
What about these women?

504
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:02,337
No.

505
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,939
Okay, look. I'm LAPD,

506
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,652
and if there's any info
that you can give me

507
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:07,609
on any...

508
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,945
How <i>not</i> to get laid.

509
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,781
I'm not trying
to get laid, Maze.

510
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:14,283
I don't get it.

511
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:16,051
Well, did you talk
to the bartender?

512
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:18,086
Yeah. He said
something was going on

513
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:19,399
across the street in
the abandoned building.

514
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:21,423
I put a call in for
a warrant to the judge,

515
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,791
and I'm waiting
to hear back.

516
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:24,760
Great. Looks like you have
some time to kill.

517
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:25,694
Have a drink.

518
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,629
No. I'm gonna
call it a night.

519
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:28,597
Hello, ladies.

520
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:31,266
Hi. What are
you doing here?

521
00:18:31,302 --> 00:18:32,601
Maze invited me.

522
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:34,570
- She said it's girls' night.
- Yeah.

523
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:37,372
No. I'm working
a double homicide.

524
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,942
Would it kill you
to just relax for once?

525
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:41,343
All you do is

526
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:43,011
work, work, work.

527
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:44,346
Wow. Like you're one to talk.

528
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:45,659
You're at Lucifer's
beck and call 24/7.

529
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:48,183
It's like you're
his personal concierge.

530
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,919
I'm not his personal
anything, anymore.

531
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:53,789
Hmm. Well, you basically still
live there, and it's not like

532
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:55,624
he's pouring <i>you</i> any drinks.

533
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,727
Least I know how to have fun.

534
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,929
What about pleasure?

535
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,965
Men?

536
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:05,467
When's the last time
you had sex?

537
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:07,214
Hey, why does everything
always have to be

538
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:07,909
about work or sex?

539
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:08,771
Yeah, I agree.

540
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,901
Girls' night, done right,
is about female bonding.

541
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:12,782
Exactly.

542
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:14,729
Really getting
to know each other.

543
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,614
Sharing problems,
origin stories, secrets.

544
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:20,349
- Can't we just drink?
- Fine.

545
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:22,317
I'll start. Um...

546
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:24,653
I worked my way
through med school as

547
00:19:24,688 --> 00:19:26,588
a phone sex operator.

548
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,157
1-800-ProfessorFeelGood.

549
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:31,627
I would totally
call that.

550
00:19:31,662 --> 00:19:32,662
Nice.

551
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:34,396
I'm Ella, by the way.

552
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:35,402
I love that we just
skipped the small talk.

553
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:36,399
Yes.

554
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,767
Um, okay. I'll go next,
I guess. Um...

555
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,202
I used to steal cars.

556
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:42,471
Who's next?

557
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:44,273
I was forged in
the bowels of Hell

558
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,542
to torture the guilty
for all of eternity.

559
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:49,811
Interesting share.

560
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:51,813
Okay, so...

561
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,115
Now, you go, Chloe.

562
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,850
Female trust.

563
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:55,851
Come on.

564
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:57,219
What's on your mind?

565
00:19:57,254 --> 00:19:59,354
What's on my mind...

566
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,256
like, other than the case?

567
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,557
Yeah.

568
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:06,828
Um...

569
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:10,232
A little divorce.

570
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:11,466
- Uh...
- Mm-hmm.

571
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:15,137
Single parenthood...

572
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,440
uh, possible homelessness and...

573
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:22,444
most likely many, many cats
in my future.

574
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:24,413
Or things
that require batteries.

575
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:25,592
Okay, you know,
that's-that's...

576
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:26,949
that's what I'm talking about.

577
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:29,584
You guys,
this is so fun!

578
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,119
- Is it?
- Yes!

579
00:20:31,155 --> 00:20:33,155
Yeah, uh, tequila, stat.

580
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,756
- Yes.
- Keep 'em coming!

581
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,269
This is really
gonna help you feel,

582
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:37,926
you know, anything.

583
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:42,264
Ugh!

584
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,665
Cosmopolitan?

585
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,634
Perhaps this really
<i>is</i> girls' night.

586
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:48,537
There are only two reasons
to drink alone, brother.

587
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:49,938
Either you're a chronic dullard,

588
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:52,107
or you're trying
to avoid your problems.

589
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:53,408
If it's the
latter, I approve.

590
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:55,444
My problems
<i>are</i> your problems.

591
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:57,746
Ooh! Aren't we
the little empath?

592
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:01,283
You think letting Mom stay here
on earth doesn't affect us all?

593
00:21:01,318 --> 00:21:02,217
Why?

594
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:03,430
Because you think Dad is gonna

595
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:05,298
forgive and forget about
the fact that you broke a deal?

596
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:06,855
Haven't broken anything.

597
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,956
I found a loophole.

598
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:09,958
As such, I'm not thinking
about it at all.

599
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:10,926
You should try it.

600
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,928
There will be consequences!

601
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:16,732
I don't get it.

602
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:18,378
If you're so concerned,
why don't you just

603
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,634
fly Mum back to Hell?

604
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,804
Because I can't!

605
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,307
That was a tad dramatic.

606
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:26,274
Why not?

607
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,976
It's complicated.

608
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:31,079
Never fear,
fun brother's here.

609
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,615
I'm gonna show you the magic
of distraction.

610
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,851
But no more girly drinks.
All right?

611
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:37,519
Cosmos are yummy.

612
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:40,296
Oh... Bourbon. Stat.
Keep 'em coming.

And then Lucifer's
all like...

624
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,381
"Hey Chloe,
name three friends

625
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:09,418
that you could go call
and have a drink with."

626
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,897
- So smug, you know?
- Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm.

627
00:22:10,921 --> 00:22:13,355
Well, one...two...three!

628
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,589
So, you're saying,

629
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,625
if I called you guys,

630
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:17,025
you would drop everything

631
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:18,460
and come and have
a drink with me?

632
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:20,996
Mm-hmm. 'Cause that is what
girlfriends do for each other.

633
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:23,265
Yes, especially during
tough times.

634
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,666
Exactly.

635
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,935
I've never had friends
like that.

636
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,936
Like, ever.

637
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,604
Well, you're a lot
more tolerable

638
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,672
when you're drunk,
Decker.

639
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:32,140
Is that true?
Yeah.

640
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:33,341
And then Lucifer's like,

641
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:36,478
"You use work to avoid
having fun."

642
00:22:36,513 --> 00:22:38,146
Oh, yeah.
Well, not anymore, lady.

643
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:39,481
'Cause we're your tribe, now.

644
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:41,950
And we like to party!

645
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,587
I wish I had my knives.
We could have made a blood pact.

646
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:46,933
- Ooh, next time.
- Aww... - Yeah, yeah.

647
00:22:46,957 --> 00:22:48,824
Next time?
That is progress.

648
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,058
To tribes!

649
00:22:50,094 --> 00:22:51,827
To tribes!

650
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:53,462
Sip it.

651
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:56,810
I think we should go back
up there.

652
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,634
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

653
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,203
Mm.

654
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:04,751
Oh, it looks like someone's
made a fourth friend.

655
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:07,142
Oh, you get it, girl!

656
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,610
Oh, no!

657
00:23:08,645 --> 00:23:10,445
- Abort! Chloe!
- Oh... don't do that.

658
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:12,781
I don't
think she...

659
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:14,583
Does she wear contacts?

660
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:15,728
- She's really into him.
- And she's bringing him over.

661
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:16,852
- Is she?
- Look!

662
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:18,720
Same hand stamp

663
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:19,955
as Daria
and Naomi!

664
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,856
Where did you get this?

665
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:22,958
I saw some
hot women, uh,

666
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:25,160
g-going into a party
across the street last night.

667
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,361
- Okay.
- It was just...

668
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:27,474
Do you recognize these women?

669
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:28,396
Did you see
these girls there?

670
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:30,499
What's your deal?

671
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,200
Hey, she's just asking
a few questions.

672
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:34,669
Well, he's taken.
So back off, skank!

673
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:35,971
- I...
- Hey!

674
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:38,473
No one calls my skank a skank.

675
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:39,953
- I'm hurting her.
- No! - Oh, no, no...

676
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:41,977
- No.
- Okay, no. No, no, Maze.

677
00:23:42,012 --> 00:23:42,944
Maze...

678
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,646
Wipe that smile
off her face.

679
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:46,982
Maze, remember...
aggression

680
00:23:47,017 --> 00:23:48,850
is not the answer, okay.

681
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,318
Clearly, this woman is having

682
00:23:50,354 --> 00:23:51,686
some serious
trust issues.

683
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:52,754
Clearly.

684
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:54,689
Or maybe she's just
a raging bitch.

685
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,757

718
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,067
Classic Chloe.

719
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:26,580
Only you would make a point
of remembering

720
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:28,771
the exact amount of time
you can't remember.

721
00:25:28,806 --> 00:25:30,372
Mm. Well,

722
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:33,008
I was lucid enough to
destroy a tiki bar

723
00:25:33,044 --> 00:25:35,544
and get a lead
on our two dead blondes.

724
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:37,680
I found a guy with a hand stamp.

725
00:25:37,715 --> 00:25:39,748
The same club that
Daria and Naomi went to?

726
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:41,950
Not a club.

727
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:46,055
More like a roving,
pop-up sex party.

728
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,756
Secretive,
invite-only,

729
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:50,092
caters to rich jerks
who like to pay for it.

730
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:51,193
So gross.

731
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:52,628
So those two girls
were sex workers?

732
00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:54,563
Looks like it.

733
00:25:54,598 --> 00:25:56,231
But the only way
to know for sure

734
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:58,067
is to get you
into the next shindig.

735
00:25:58,102 --> 00:25:59,935
Which hand stamp guy told me--

736
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,370
right before he passed out--

737
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:03,605
is happening as we speak.

738
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:04,773
Me?

739
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:07,943
Uh-huh. Men only.
And I got you a date.

740
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:10,045
- Nope.
- Yes.

741
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:11,413
- Mm-mm. No way.
- Yes.

742
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:13,193
It's good to have Lucifer
there with you as back up.

743
00:26:13,217 --> 00:26:15,651
So they don't think
you're a cop.

744
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:18,787
I don't look like a cop.

745
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:21,924
Uh-huh.

746
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:25,060
Hey.

747
00:26:25,096 --> 00:26:26,228
Do I look like a cop?

748
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,703
Ah. Finally, you're here. Right.

749
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:35,916
I promise this will be more fun

750
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,973
than light beers
and <i>Bachelor</i> reruns.

751
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:39,308
Your jokes
never get old.

752
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:41,276
Oh, come on, who doesn't
love a sex party?

753
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:42,344
Then again, if you're me,

754
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:44,179
every party's a sex party
of sorts.

755
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:45,547
It's illegal, for starters.

756
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,027
Why do you think they
change the location every night?

757
00:26:47,051 --> 00:26:48,984
No liquor license,
underage girls...

758
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:50,486
Well, the world's
oldest profession

759
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:52,221
seems to be surviving
quite nicely.

760
00:26:52,256 --> 00:26:54,323
Hello, chaps.

761
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:56,592
Yes, my first startup
was a sex club, actually.

762
00:26:56,627 --> 00:26:58,305
Little place called "Eden".
Perhaps you've heard of it?

763
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:01,697
I'm... good.
Thank you.

764
00:27:01,732 --> 00:27:03,866
Best case scenario,
this club exploits women.

765
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:05,812
Worst case? It got those girls
a belly full of poison.

766
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:06,735
Mm.

767
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:08,837
- One other thing.
- Hm?

768
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:11,940
I'm not sure
why he's here.

769
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:14,076
Only dullards drink alone.

770
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:15,711
Yes, he's a tad anxious
these days.

771
00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:17,290
I thought a night out
would do him good.

772
00:27:17,314 --> 00:27:19,014
Right. Well,
we have one mission:

773
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,717
to find out who
knew the dead girls.

774
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:23,285
And remember--
we're undercover, okay?

775
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,054
As if you could look like
anything other than a cop.

776
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,456
I do not look like a cop!

777
00:27:27,491 --> 00:27:28,257
Cop.

778
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:32,628
All right, will you guys
just please,

779
00:27:32,663 --> 00:27:34,196
for God's sake, be chill?

780
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:36,765
And three rules:
no drinking, no touching...

781
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:39,246
...and just keep everything
low-key.

782
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,703
Yes!

783
00:27:41,739 --> 00:27:44,406
Oh, my God.

784
00:27:44,441 --> 00:27:47,009
This is not helping us find out
who knew the dead girls.

785
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:49,344
Agreed. His shimmy is
a tad off-putting.

786
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,646
Come on, Luci!

787
00:27:50,681 --> 00:27:52,581
Come cut a rug
with your big bro!

788
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:53,882
Uh. No, no,
no, no, no.

789
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:55,083
White man's overbite,

790
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,752
that is definitely
where I draw the line.

791
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:58,053
Hold on a second.

792
00:27:58,088 --> 00:27:59,454
Look at the bar.

793
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:02,591
It's liquid nitrogen.

794
00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:03,970
It's the same thing
that caused damage

795
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:05,527
to Daria Mitchell's
stomach lining.

796
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:06,795
Yes.

797
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:09,933
Hey, buddy.

798
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:10,967
Hey.

799
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:12,935
What do you know
about these two girls?

800
00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:18,173
Not so fast,
buddy boy.

801
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:21,176
Seems my martini isn't the
only thing here that's dirty.

802
00:28:21,212 --> 00:28:22,744
Mmm.

803
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,246
A drink to savor,
don't you think?

804
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:25,948
Ah...

805
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:28,217
Want to explain
why you ran?

806
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:30,052
Come on.
You're obviously a cop.

807
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:31,286
Shut it.

808
00:28:31,322 --> 00:28:33,322
I figured you were
here to bust me.

809
00:28:33,357 --> 00:28:35,123
Yes, we are
here to bust you.

810
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,793
For the untimely fate of
two innocent Nebraskan girls.

811
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:39,528
Wait... what?

812
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:40,874
It's funny how
killers go deaf

813
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:42,464
at the moment of reckoning,
isn't it?

814
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:43,699
No, no. I...

815
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:44,766
I'm no killer.

816
00:28:44,802 --> 00:28:47,135
I-I-I keep an eye on
the girls that work here

817
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:49,638
and serve the pervs drinks.

818
00:28:49,673 --> 00:28:50,706
And pot...

819
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:51,945
Maybe a bit of "E."

820
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:53,337
What about mandrake?

821
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:54,444
Who's Mandrake?

822
00:28:54,445 --> 00:28:56,745
Did you put poison in these
two girls' drinks?

823
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,580
No-no. What? No.
I-I remember these girls.

824
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:01,650
Their drinks were clean
when I made 'em.

825
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:03,151
Who was paying for 'em?

826
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:04,698
I don't know, it was some
Hollywood dirtbag

827
00:29:04,722 --> 00:29:05,988
with a gold card.

828
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:08,557
You'll need to be
a little more specific.

829
00:29:08,592 --> 00:29:11,226
It's... Yuri something.

830
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:12,828
He's not here
tonight though.

831
00:29:12,863 --> 00:29:14,329
I guess your two dead girls

832
00:29:14,365 --> 00:29:15,575
and the other blonde must have
really worn him out.

833
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,565
Wait a minute.

834
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,866
There were <i>three</i> blondes?
Yeah.

835
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:19,001
Your two newbies

836
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:20,202
and their hot friend.

837
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:21,336
Right. First name:

838
00:29:21,372 --> 00:29:22,671
"Hot", last name "Friend"?

839
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,206
They don't use
their real names.

840
00:29:25,276 --> 00:29:26,419
She's one of our regulars
though.

841
00:29:26,443 --> 00:29:28,410
You know, life of the party.

842
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:29,489
Oh, she won't be
the life of anything,

843
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:30,445
if we don't get to her

844
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:32,080
before lady killer Yuri
has his way.

845
00:29:32,116 --> 00:29:33,181
If he hasn't already.

846
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:34,449
Thank you.

847
00:29:38,822 --> 00:29:41,556
Oh, silly me.

848
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,626
Come on. Rise and shine,
Crantini.

849
00:29:44,662 --> 00:29:45,662
Time to go.

850
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:46,995
Yeah.
Let's do this.

851
00:29:51,802 --> 00:29:53,046
Gosh, I wish I got that
on video.

852
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,269
Oh, I can get that
on video!

853
00:29:54,305 --> 00:29:55,570
Hold on.
Douche-cam.

854
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:15,693
Must have been some party.

855
00:30:15,728 --> 00:30:17,428
Ah, that's funny.

856
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:19,697
And I'll laugh after we find
this Yuri scumbag.

857
00:30:19,732 --> 00:30:21,599
You have anything
on the third girl?

858
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:23,601
Bartender said she was,
"Blonde, hot,

859
00:30:23,636 --> 00:30:24,646
and had an exposed midriff".

860
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,937
Which describes half
the population of L.A.

861
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:27,905
Well, the chef's wife,

862
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,373
Gisele, fits
that description.

863
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:31,775
Yeah, but when you saw her,
she was healthy.

864
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:33,188
You think she could have
worked with Naomi

865
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:34,545
and Daria
at the sex club?

866
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,347
She knew them

867
00:30:36,382 --> 00:30:37,526
through her husband's
restaurant.

868
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,483
I mean... but
part-time sex worker?

869
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,330
Would that be the first thing
you put on your résumé?

870
00:30:41,354 --> 00:30:43,687
No. But if she was there,

871
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:45,767
she was witness to everything
that went down that night.

872
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:47,925
So, maybe Yuri's after her.

873
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,271
Yeah, well, the tech
got Yuri's info

874
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:51,073
from the credit card
he used at the sex party.

875
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:52,229
Only has a P.O. box.

876
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:53,408
No home address,
but I did get

877
00:30:53,432 --> 00:30:54,732
a cell and a plate number.

878
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:55,699
Okay, good.

879
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:56,879
Lucifer and I
will go find Yuri,

880
00:30:56,903 --> 00:30:58,302
and, uh,

881
00:30:58,337 --> 00:30:59,403
and, um...

882
00:30:59,438 --> 00:31:01,372
...you track down Gisele.

883
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:04,442
Oh...

884
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:05,609
Copy that.

885
00:31:06,512 --> 00:31:08,045
That is...

886
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:11,248
What did Maze win

887
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:13,717
and why does it involve
my tragic drunk face?

888
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:14,952
Just a little wager.

889
00:31:14,987 --> 00:31:16,654
Well, you had a lot
on your mind,

890
00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:18,289
so I decided
to distract you,

891
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:19,690
with "girls' night."

892
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:23,294
Last night was a setup?

893
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:25,362
Yes. Well, you had fun,
didn't you?

894
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:26,597
You should be
thanking me.

895
00:31:29,735 --> 00:31:30,768
What are you doing?

896
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:33,304
Detective...

897
00:31:39,812 --> 00:31:41,645
Uh, hey, Davis
hasn't seen Gisele,

898
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:43,380
and she's, uh,
not answering her cell,

899
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:45,194
so if Yuri has her,
we've got to get there fast.

900
00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:46,483
I'm on my way.

901
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,786
Detective...

902
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:51,222
What did you say to her?

903
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:02,466
LAPD. Get out
of the car, Yuri.

904
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:03,912
Good Lord, you could at least

905
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:05,236
fork out for a room, Yuri.

906
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:06,937
No, no, no, no!

907
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:08,639
Not the Italian leather!

908
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:10,774
Bloody hell!

909
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,110
Yeah, more like karma.

910
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:15,346
We know you were
at the sex club last night,

911
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:17,615
and you're responsible
for the death of two girls.

912
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,250
What do you know
about Gisele?

913
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:21,919
I don't know anyone
named Gisele.

914
00:32:21,954 --> 00:32:23,387
You have it all wrong.

915
00:32:23,422 --> 00:32:25,656
I only went to that club

916
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:28,826
because Crystal
promised me newbies.

917
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:30,828
I paid five grand apiece

918
00:32:30,863 --> 00:32:32,363
for those two
sweethearts.

919
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:33,564
Who's Crystal?

920
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,799
She was with Daria
and Naomi.

921
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:36,878
Then you should
most definitely

922
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:38,010
ask for a refund.

923
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:38,737
I know.

924
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:41,472
Those girls had no idea
that I was their date.

925
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:42,840
You're telling me
Daria and Naomi

926
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,475
had no idea
it was a sex club?

927
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,343
No.

928
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:48,178
When they found out,
they wanted to leave.

929
00:32:48,214 --> 00:32:50,481
Crystal bought them
drinks,

930
00:32:50,516 --> 00:32:53,183
but they drank them
and bailed anyway.

931
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:56,020
I was so upset that
I took the last sip and--

932
00:32:56,055 --> 00:32:57,655
You drank the rest
of the poison.

933
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:02,393
I have been sick
ever since.

934
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:03,327
Oh, God.

935
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:05,496
Oh, no, no, no.
Not again.

936
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,365
Is Gisele Crystal?

937
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:09,745
Oh, you mean the chef's wife?

938
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:11,446
Could she be the one
who killed Daria and Naomi?

939
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,048
Well, Daria was sleeping
with her husband,

940
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:15,072
so if anyone had a bone to pick,
it would be her.

941
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,710
Yuri, do you know
Crystal's real name?

942
00:33:19,745 --> 00:33:22,046
No. But I have a picture.

943
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:24,682
Oh, lovely.
I'll take that.

944
00:33:24,717 --> 00:33:27,418
Right. Ooh, pecker pic.

945
00:33:27,453 --> 00:33:29,053
- Pecker pic.
- Eww!

946
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,587
Oh, hold on.

947
00:33:32,058 --> 00:33:33,624
That's not Gisele.

948
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:35,926
No, and that blonde hair
doesn't look real either.

949
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:38,028
You're right,
it's a wig.

950
00:33:38,064 --> 00:33:40,431
And the girl wearing it
looks real familiar.

951
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:49,073
Oh, it's just rush, rush, rush
in this town, isn't it?

952
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:51,308
Oh, hi, detectives.

953
00:33:51,344 --> 00:33:53,444
I'm just putting
a few things in storage.

954
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,812
I'm going back home.

955
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,558
Right, you can take the girl
out of Nebraska,

956
00:33:56,582 --> 00:33:58,916
but you can't take Nebraska
out of the girl.

957
00:33:58,951 --> 00:33:59,917
Or can you?

958
00:33:59,952 --> 00:34:02,586
I don't feel safe
in L.A. anymore.

959
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:04,722
You wouldn't either
if two of your neighbors

960
00:34:04,757 --> 00:34:05,823
wound up dead.

961
00:34:05,858 --> 00:34:07,257
Don't you just hate that?

962
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:09,293
I'm sorry, I have
a flight at 3:00.

963
00:34:09,328 --> 00:34:10,505
Yes, and I've
just discovered

964
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:12,229
this wonderful thing
called Facebook.

965
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:13,997
Have you heard of it?
I have to go, please.

966
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:15,899
'Cause Facebook's
heard of you.

967
00:34:15,935 --> 00:34:17,534
It knows that you're
a big deal

968
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,635
in your small town.

969
00:34:18,671 --> 00:34:19,837
A ten back home,

970
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:23,107
but in L.A.,
just a five.

971
00:34:23,142 --> 00:34:25,220
Things haven't worked out
for you here, have they, Lily?

972
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:28,779
So much heartache,
struggle, compromise.

973
00:34:28,814 --> 00:34:30,748
It made you
desperate enough

974
00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:32,750
to turn against your own
sorority sisters,

975
00:34:32,785 --> 00:34:33,785
Daria and Naomi.

976
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:36,186
No. Daria and Naomi
were my friends.

977
00:34:36,222 --> 00:34:37,488
Were they?

978
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:39,923
Because we know you were
with them the night they died.

979
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,992
You said you hadn't
seen 'em for a week.

980
00:34:42,027 --> 00:34:43,227
You have no proof
of that.

981
00:34:43,262 --> 00:34:47,164
Except for a photo taken
by your charming buddy Yuri.

982
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,532
Nice wig, by the way.

983
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,667
Really brings out
the murder in your eyes.

984
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:57,841
Seems kitties do have claws.

985
00:35:03,023 --> 00:35:04,534
Please, just let me go.

986
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:06,579
Is this the part where you wish
I had a gun, Detective?

987
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:08,536
Shut up, Lucifer,
I got this.

988
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:10,538
You pretended to be
a friend to those girls.

989
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:12,073
Shame on you.

990
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:13,875
They called <i>me!</i>

991
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,710
They were desperate
for my help.

992
00:35:15,745 --> 00:35:18,579
The best workout class,
where to hike...

993
00:35:18,615 --> 00:35:19,914
this apartment!

994
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:22,150
They asked you for help
and you preyed on them?

995
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:23,718
I was doing them
a favor.

996
00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:25,686
What, by putting mandrake
in their drinks?

997
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:28,089
I thought it was
an organic kind of roofie.

998
00:35:28,124 --> 00:35:29,724
I didn't know that
it would kill them.

999
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,826
I was just trying
to loosen them up.

1000
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:33,428
You were trying to make
an extra buck

1001
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:34,862
by bringing in
a couple newbies.

1002
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:37,965
I won the Dame Judith
acting award in college.

1003
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:41,135
I was the <i>president</i>
of our sorority.

1004
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:43,471
I should have
made it by now!

1005
00:35:43,506 --> 00:35:46,574
L.A. was supposed
to be easy!

1006
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:48,609
Oh, phones...

1007
00:35:48,645 --> 00:35:50,711
They can be
so distracting.

1008
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:58,853
There's a special place in Hell
for women who fake friendships

1009
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:03,825
as a way of manipulating
other women!

1010
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,127
She's right, you know.

1011
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,730
And I think we have
a silver lining, Detective.

1012
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:12,600
What with Lily going away,
and Daria and Naomi dead,

1013
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:14,569
I believe that there's
an apartment vacancy.

1014
00:36:14,604 --> 00:36:17,104
Are you seriously suggesting
that I should move

1015
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,473
into a dead girl's apartment?

1016
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:21,042
No, no, no, the killer's place
is much nicer.

1017
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:24,078
I mean, just look
at this view!

1018
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:50,605
How'd you get
in here?

1019
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,608
Let's just say Samantha
at the front desk

1020
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:56,577
is no longer into men.

1021
00:36:56,613 --> 00:36:58,713
What, you still mad?

1022
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:01,782
What was all that stuff
about being my tribe?

1023
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:03,818
You had fun,
didn't you?

1024
00:37:05,755 --> 00:37:06,832
I don't have time for this.

1025
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:08,890
I have work to do.
You can go.

1026
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:15,963
I wasn't totally
faking it.

1027
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:21,202
Like when I strangled
psycho chick for the win.

1028
00:37:21,237 --> 00:37:22,570
<i>That</i> was genuine.

1029
00:37:22,605 --> 00:37:25,039
Gee, thanks.

1030
00:37:25,074 --> 00:37:28,342
You know, I wouldn't just
kick ass for anyone.

1031
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:30,044
Okay, fine, I would.

1032
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,614
But this time
it was... sweeter.

1033
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,551
This is some twisted
version of an apology?

1034
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:38,519
I don't do apologies.

1035
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:40,354
But I don't want
to kill you anymore.

1036
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:44,425
You're a very,
very deranged person.

1037
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,327
Thanks.

1038
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:49,074
So, we're still good
to be roomies, right?

1039
00:37:49,098 --> 00:37:50,442
What are you
talking about, <i>roomies?</i>

1040
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:51,466
We shook on it.

1041
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,501
Post-karaoke,
pre-potbelly dude.

1042
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,902
What?

1043
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:56,437
I told you I was
in between places.

1044
00:37:56,472 --> 00:37:58,083
You said that you were
looking for someone

1045
00:37:58,107 --> 00:37:59,407
to share expenses.

1046
00:37:59,442 --> 00:38:00,608
Don't you remember?

1047
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,912
The missing half hour.

1048
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:08,182
Look... I've got money.

1049
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:10,885
I like your kid,
and you dress like crap,

1050
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,087
so I won't be stealing
any of your clothes.

1051
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:15,122
What, you got
a better plan?

1052
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:20,494
You said you wanted
fun, Decker.

1053
00:38:22,098 --> 00:38:23,230
Fun.

1054
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:26,000
Oh, my...

1055
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:30,171
Roommates?

1056
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:31,439
You and Detective Decker?

1057
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:34,008
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1058
00:38:34,043 --> 00:38:36,410
And have I mentioned "no,"
and also, "no"?

1059
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:37,956
You're not my boss anymore.

1060
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,780
Well, that may be.

1061
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:40,781
But I can't have the women
in my life teaming up.

1062
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:42,083
I'll be outnumbered.

1063
00:38:42,118 --> 00:38:43,729
Dad forbid you manage
to have sex with her

1064
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:45,152
before I do.

1065
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:47,688
Oh, actually, can I interest you
in another wager?

1066
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:49,857
No. Done deal.
Pay up.

1067
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:52,827
Fine,
the convertible's yours.

1068
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:53,794
I'm over that.

1069
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,663
Well, the hot,
new bartender.

1070
00:38:55,698 --> 00:38:56,897
Been there, done that.

1071
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:58,332
Well, spit it out
then, Maze.

1072
00:38:58,368 --> 00:38:59,634
What is it you want?

1073
00:39:03,873 --> 00:39:06,707
I want a drink.

1074
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:08,342
What, that's it?

1075
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:10,077
Fine. Pick any bottle,
pull two glasses.

1076
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:14,148
No, I want you
to pour <i>me</i> a drink.

1077
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:17,018
All right.

1078
00:39:27,997 --> 00:39:30,331
To newly defined
relationships.

1079
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:32,033
Cheers.

1080
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:38,472
Oh... please...

1081
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:40,408
don't drink
in front of me.

1082
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:42,543
Bad case of the distractions,
brother?

1083
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:44,812
Well, I better go.

1084
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:47,181
I'll let you deal
with the lightweight.

1085
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:50,418
Judging from your
behavior last night,

1086
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:52,586
that lunatic dancing,
I fear that my advice

1087
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:54,555
may have created a whole
new set of problems.

1088
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,591
No more turning
a "blind eye," Lucifer.

1089
00:39:57,627 --> 00:39:59,293
Listen...

1090
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:04,131
We both know that Dad
is not the kind

1091
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,433
to forgive and forget.

1092
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:08,402
No distraction on earth
is gonna change that.

1093
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:10,137
I said that I would
punish Mom,

1094
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:12,273
and I'm doing so
here on earth.

1095
00:40:12,308 --> 00:40:14,108
Deal maintained,
loophole achieved.

1096
00:40:14,143 --> 00:40:15,676
What if He doesn't
feel that way?

1097
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:18,913
There will be real
consequences, Luci,

1098
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:20,214
for all of us.

1099
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:22,249
Especially me.

1100
00:40:22,285 --> 00:40:23,784
You know, I liked
you better drunk.

1101
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,987
Tell me something, brother,
what deal <i>did</i> you make?

1102
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:29,290
What was worth writing
Father, of all people,

1103
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:30,325
a blank check?

1104
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,893
Not a what.
A who.

1105
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:43,237
You made a deal
for Chloe's <i>life?</i>

1106
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:44,638
Don't look at me like that!

1107
00:40:44,674 --> 00:40:46,774
At the time, it made
a certain amount of sense.

1108
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:48,075
Don't you understand?

1109
00:40:49,412 --> 00:40:51,245
You made a deal
to return Mom to Hell.

1110
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,048
In exchange,
Chloe's life was spared.

1111
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,783
Well, that's one
interpretation.

1112
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:58,085
Despite whatever loopholes
you think you found,

1113
00:40:58,121 --> 00:41:00,554
and the lies that
you have told yourself,

1114
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,224
you still haven't delivered
on your end of the bargain.

1115
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:06,393
Luci, what if Dad
decides to

1116
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:08,662
take back His side
of the deal?

1117
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:15,202
One silly human soul?

1118
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:18,105
I can't imagine Dad would
take much interest in that.

1119
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:20,574
<i>Yes, two adult women</i>
<i>and a child.</i>

1120
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,476
Just bring over a deposit,

1121
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:23,677
and the apartment's yours.

1122
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:26,814
Really? Oh, yeah,
I will, uh...

1123
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:28,649
Great, I'll drop off
a check right away.

1124
00:41:28,684 --> 00:41:30,184
Okay, thank you.

1125
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:31,222
Of course.
