1
00:00:01,704 --> 00:00:03,343
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:04,960
You stalked your father's murderer

3
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:06,132
right before he was killed.

4
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:07,300
I know this looks bad.

5
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:09,101
Whoever killed Joe
Fields killed my father.

6
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:10,503
What, you think
the warden did it?

7
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:12,138
This man killed my father.

8
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:13,112
You tore

9
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:14,659
apart my family.

10
00:00:14,684 --> 00:00:16,309
I can get you whatever you want.

11
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:17,877
All I want is for you to know

12
00:00:17,883 --> 00:00:19,722
that John Decker's kid got you.

13
00:00:19,747 --> 00:00:21,547
His name is Boris Sokolov.
He connects criminals,

14
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:22,882
but he always keeps his own hands clean.

15
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:24,831
People call me Human Lie Detector.

16
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:26,643
So, you point me in the right direction

17
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:28,721
or I'm gonna make
your life a living hell.

18
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:31,123
Mom, this is Lucifer. Lucifer, Mom.

19
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:32,198
Mama Decker.

20
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:34,427
You shall remain right here

21
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:37,096
on Earth amongst the
creatures you so despise.

22
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:39,999
You're going to send me into
the life of Charlotte Richards?

23
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,301
I thought I'd dive into my employment.

24
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:44,303
I was pretty surprised
when you called me.

25
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,042
You are fairly attractive.

26
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:48,708
The only place I've ever felt

27
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:50,764
wanted or respected...

28
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,611
Is here with humanity?!

29
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:54,513
This is my home!

30
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:55,781
Deal with it, Mother!

31
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:57,516
You seem attached

32
00:00:57,522 --> 00:01:00,086
to these creatures and
I can't figure out why.

33
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:03,259
Let me at least buy you
dinner tonight to celebrate.

34
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:31,666
Excuse me.

35
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,497
- Yeah.
- I'll get it for you.

36
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,053
Thank you.

37
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:38,290
You can't kill her, Mom.

38
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:39,859
Well, of course I can.

39
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:41,660
I just press this button.

40
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,429
Mom, please...

41
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:44,463
give me the detonator.

42
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,166
No. This little bug is the reason

43
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:48,768
that Lucifer doesn't want to go home.

44
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:50,625
Squash her, problem solved.

45
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,069
Are you really gonna make
me force it away from you?

46
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:56,108
Trust me, you don't want to do that.

47
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:57,943
But I can't let you kill Chloe, Mom.

48
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:01,447
Since when can you...

49
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:02,815
I tried to warn you.

50
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,317
Apparently, paltry human flesh can't

51
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:07,386
contain my divinity.

52
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:09,325
Oh, here we go.

53
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,525
Bomb's in the car.

54
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:14,063
So exciting.

55
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,066
Mom, stop!

56
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:23,502
I am trying to help you.

57
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:25,471
I know Lucifer better
than he knows himself

58
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:26,739
and if you kill Chloe,

59
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:29,074
he won't rest until he
finds out who did it

60
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,709
and when he does, Mom,

61
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,311
he will hate you forever.

62
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:33,913
Come on.

63
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,216
One little human can't mean
more to him than his family.

64
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:39,285
He killed Uriel to protect her.

65
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,687
Well...

66
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:43,656
what's so damn special about this one?

67
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:45,191
That I don't know.

68
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,659
But, Mom, the bottom line is

69
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:48,661
if we want Luci to go home with us,

70
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:51,397
then we need to make sure
that it's his decision

71
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:52,702
to leave Chloe behind.

72
00:02:56,107 --> 00:02:58,938
Well, that was anticlimactic.

73
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:02,241
So, I need to find

74
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:03,242
a more subtle way

75
00:03:03,248 --> 00:03:05,878
to end Lucifer's silly crush.

76
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,848
Tell me everything.

77
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,049
Well, there's...

78
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:11,667
nothing to say, really.

79
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,366
You had a date...

80
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,487
with Chloe.

81
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:17,022
That's a big deal, Lucifer.

82
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:19,325
I need to hear about it.

83
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,594
You know, as your therapist.

84
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,197
Well, for one, I wouldn't say
it was a big deal and...

85
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:27,399
it wasn't a date, just dinner...

86
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:29,368
more like a snack,
actually, between friends.

87
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:30,436
Oh, how was the food?

88
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:32,208
I've heard their branzino is amazing.

89
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:34,240
Well, yeah, it's...

90
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:35,508
hard to say, really.

91
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:37,109
Too caught up in the moment to notice?

92
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:38,882
Caught up, in-in a way, yes.

93
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:42,047
You chickened out, didn't you?

94
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:44,083
What?

95
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:45,518
I'm the Devil, Doctor.

96
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:47,219
I don't chicken out.

97
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:48,621
I just simply thought that she should

98
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:50,155
enjoy the food without any...

99
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,790
distractions.

100
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,592
Listen, you know, I get it.

101
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:55,628
Our last breakthrough spooked you

102
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:56,829
and now you're running scared.

103
00:03:56,835 --> 00:03:59,632
I don't "run scared"
any more than I "chicken."

104
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:01,467
Not literally.

105
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,902
But you're avoiding the truth.

106
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:03,936
Also known as lying.

107
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:06,138
That I know I don't do... ever.

108
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:07,139
But yet...

109
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:09,241
you are lying, Lucifer...

110
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:11,714
...to yourself.

111
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,092
I owe you an explanation.

112
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:29,595
Really? Why?

113
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,030
Was it for...

114
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:33,265
leaving me all alone at a
restaurant so the busboy

115
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:35,120
could give me pitiful glances all night?

116
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:36,702
I know what your explanation
is and I don't want

117
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,604
to know her name, especially not today.

118
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,439
Actually, Detective, that isn't
what I was going to say, I...

119
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:42,274
Look, Lucifer, I don't
have time for this.

120
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,809
I was just on my way out.

121
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,411
Besides, this is my fault.

122
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:48,280
I should've known how selfish
and thoughtless you can be.

123
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,315
Lucifer.

124
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:51,750
How thoughtful.

125
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:52,885
Penelope.

126
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:54,720
You are the sweetest

127
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:57,423
to come support us on
such a difficult day.

128
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:58,524
Oh. I bet you

129
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,525
an arm and a leg, Mom,

130
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,060
that he has no idea what today is.

131
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:03,162
Well, that's rather unwise
of you to wager your lovely

132
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,630
extremities, Detective.

133
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:06,031
Particularly as I'm perfectly aware

134
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:07,132
of what today is, actually.

135
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:09,101
It's a very difficult day...

136
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,135
because...

137
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,037
- Today.
- Today is...

138
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:13,706
- The first day.
- The first day...

139
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:15,441
of the of...

140
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,576
trial of the trial of...

141
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:19,582
- my dad's killer.
- My dad's killer!

142
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,547
Nietzsche? No, wait.

143
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,115
Your dad's killer. Yes, no, I knew that.

144
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:25,084
I knew that. That's why
I'm here, to support you.

145
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,152
Not talk about myself
'cause that would be selfish.

146
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:28,220
- Yeah.
- So...

147
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:29,254
consider me

148
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,356
an emotional jockstrap

149
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:32,424
for the Decker family jewels.

150
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,129
Hey.

151
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:40,246
Hmm, someone's chirpy
for a Monday morning.

152
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:42,234
Yes, I am.

153
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,235
Why?

154
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:44,303
What's going on?

155
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,305
What, do I need an excuse to be happy?

156
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:48,707
Hmm, I mean, you're whistling.

157
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:50,976
You've been... working out lately.

158
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:52,077
Mm.

159
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,947
Musk-scented aftershave.

160
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:56,515
Did you...

161
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:57,516
get laid?

162
00:05:58,456 --> 00:05:59,551
No.

163
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:01,320
Oh, no, no.

164
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:03,255
Don't waste your poker face on me, buddy.

165
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,028
I know that grin.

166
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:07,393
I'm still in shock.

167
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,293
I knew it.

168
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,809
- She's gorgeous.
- Yeah, well,

169
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,563
- it's not like you're Quasimodo.
- No, no, no, no.

170
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,032
Trust me, she is way out of my league.

171
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,099
I mean, she is

172
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:15,734
goddess-like.

173
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,202
And she came back for seconds.

174
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,476
Then maybe she's the one who
sent you the mystery package.

175
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,575
A mystery package?

176
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:25,481
Mm-hmm.

177
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:30,620
I don't recognize the return address.

178
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,455
Oh, jeez.

179
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:38,490
God!

180
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:43,399
Wish I could say it was my first.

181
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,168
That's Boris.

182
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:51,174
Chloe's gonna lose it.

183
00:06:56,214 --> 00:06:58,644
So poised.

184
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,280
The detective obviously
gets her strength from you.

185
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:02,715
This?

186
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,183
It's just acting.

187
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:07,553
Sadly, I've had... practice.

188
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:11,090
I played this role before, 16 years ago.

189
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,529
Well, maybe it's like butt stuff.

190
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:16,065
Easier the second time around.

191
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,300
The severed
head of Boris Sokolov

192
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:22,468
just arrived at the precinct.

193
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:24,169
That's horrible!

194
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:25,237
Who's Boris?

195
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:26,672
He's the prosecution's key witness.

196
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,107
He's our key witness.

197
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:30,442
He was the only person
that could connect Perry

198
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:31,877
to the Russian gang. I mean, without him,

199
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:33,645
the entire case could fall apart.

200
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:34,780
Oh, God.

201
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:37,116
How very convenient for Mr. Perry.

202
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:46,998
This is the worst thing
that could be happening right now.

203
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,820
What are you up to now, Mother?

204
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:20,816
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

205
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:30,817
I had no idea Charlotte Richards

206
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:32,218
was defending Perry.

207
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:34,254
Wishing we hadn't saved
her life about now.

208
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,689
Well, not to worry, Detective.

209
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:37,123
I hear Charlotte is a changed woman

210
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:38,692
since her disappearance, so...

211
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:40,961
maybe she's not the shark she once was.

212
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:42,862
At least not in the courtroom.

213
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,197
All rise.

214
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:45,791
Court is now in session.

215
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,434
The Honorable Judge Estrada presiding.

216
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,669
Given the sudden death

217
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:51,454
of the State's number one witness,

218
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,274
I assume the defense is
moving for a dismissal?

219
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,177
A motion for dismissal?

220
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:58,578
Why would I want that, Your Honor?

221
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:00,613
Looks like Jaws

222
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:01,881
has been harpooned.

223
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:02,949
My apologies.

224
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:04,718
I'm a little... out of practice.

225
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,353
Um...

226
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,288
Oh, I see.

227
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:09,689
You're saying that with Boris dead,

228
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:12,492
the State doesn't have
enough evidence to proceed?

229
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,361
So, if I don't move for dismissal,

230
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:17,063
then he'll probably make a
complete fool of himself?

231
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:18,231
Your Honor, our case was

232
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:20,266
and still is unshakable.

233
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:21,634
The State has plenty

234
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,437
of other evidence that'll
prove 16 years ago,

235
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:25,605
the defendant, Perry Smith,

236
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:27,374
murdered Officer John Decker

237
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,709
and paid Joe Fields to go
to prison for that crime.

238
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:31,444
Oh, and when Fields
wanted out of their deal,

239
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,379
Perry also killed him.

240
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:33,813
Your Honor, with all due respect,

241
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:34,848
granting a dismissal

242
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:36,116
would be ludicrous.

243
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:37,571
Boris Sokolov's death,

244
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:40,253
while undoubtedly tragic,

245
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,789
changes nothing.

246
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:45,091
Well, the defense agrees.

247
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:46,359
What?

248
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:48,962
His death doesn't change a single thing.

249
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:51,564
With or without Mr. Sokolov's testimony,

250
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,266
my client should never have been charged

251
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:54,670
with these crimes.

252
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:56,436
Well...

253
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:59,005
seeing as both parties agree,

254
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:00,640
the trial will proceed immediately.

255
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:01,641
Actually, Your Honor,

256
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:03,209
the State would like to, uh,

257
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:04,277
request a continuance.

258
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:06,346
In light of the death of our key witness,

259
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:09,282
our office needs time to, uh, reexamine

260
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:10,617
its strategy.

261
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:11,818
But I'm confused, Your Honor.

262
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,553
Didn't we just hear the prosecution say

263
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,822
their case was "unshakable"?

264
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:17,490
We did.

265
00:10:17,496 --> 00:10:18,625
Request denied.

266
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:22,232
Session will resume after lunch.

267
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:28,935
What the hell are you doing, Mother?

268
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:30,203
Oh, calm down, Lucifer.

269
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,571
This isn't pleasant for me, either.

270
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,773
Oh, yes, I can see
you're suffering terribly.

271
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,042
I was good up there, wasn't I?

272
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:38,478
Not sure why humans spend
so much time in law school.

273
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:39,479
Two nights seemed plenty.

274
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:40,947
Mum.

275
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:43,716
I had to find a way to open your eyes.

276
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:45,718
You need to see that this
Chloe you so adore

277
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:46,686
isn't worthy of you.

278
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:49,222
I admit I enjoy working
with her, but adore,

279
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:50,390
that's a bit much.

280
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,659
Oh, please. You've
sacrificed more for her

281
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:54,651
than you ever have for anyone else.

282
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:57,606
Have you forgotten?
You killed your brother,

283
00:10:57,612 --> 00:10:58,908
my son, to protect her.

284
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:02,445
Do you think there's anything
even remotely similar

285
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:03,446
that she would do for you?

286
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:05,514
I suppose...

287
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,916
I don't know.

288
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:08,984
Well, if all goes according
to plan in that courtroom,

289
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,286
you will know.

290
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:11,887
Know that she doesn't deserve you,

291
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:13,289
because she doesn't care about you

292
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:14,957
like you care about her.

293
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:17,093
You need to see that you're
not meant to be together.

294
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:19,061
You belong with your family.

295
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,830
Which is why I have to do this.

296
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:22,702
Do what, Mum?

297
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,203
What sort of evil plan
are you concocting?

298
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:29,605
And please don't tell me
it began by killing Boris.

299
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,674
Oh, actually, that was just
a happy twist of fate.

300
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,942
I was gonna blow Chloe up,

301
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:34,276
but Amenadiel talked me out of it.

302
00:11:34,282 --> 00:11:36,278
You what?!

303
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:38,892
Mother, I swear,
if you hurt her, I will rip...

304
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,588
Well, looks like your brother was right.

305
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:46,059
Just promise me that you won't touch her.

306
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,597
I'm not going to hurt anyone.

307
00:11:56,304 --> 00:11:57,933
Lucifer, you promise me,

308
00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:01,036
whatever that was,
that it doesn't affect the trial.

309
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:03,105
First of all, Detective,
there is no "that."

310
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:07,977
And secondly, rest assured,
everything will be okay.

311
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:09,582
I've got this.

312
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:19,488
You looking for Boris' forensics report?

313
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:21,490
Uh-huh.

314
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:22,691
Hasn't come in yet.

315
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:24,427
Ella should have it any minute now.

316
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,563
I know this isn't my case,
but I'm freaking out, Dan.

317
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:29,198
I can't let Perry get
away with everything.

318
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:30,499
You won't.

319
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:32,501
You didn't see Charlotte
Richards in court today.

320
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:33,803
Char...?

321
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:34,804
I'm sorry. Uh,

322
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,972
Charlotte Richards is,
uh, defending Perry?

323
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:38,073
Yeah.

324
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,009
Really? She's that good?

325
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:41,911
Yes, she's the best.

326
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:43,913
Which is why it would be
helpful if we could...

327
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,981
Well, if you could tie
Perry to Boris' murder.

328
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:48,551
Okay, well, motive and M.O. line up.

329
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:49,985
Boris' tongue was cut out.

330
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:53,355
So the killer was sending
a really clear message...

331
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:55,057
Loose lips get their head clipped.

332
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:58,060
Perry did this so Boris
couldn't testify, I know it.

333
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:00,496
But hasn't he been behind
bars since you arrested him?

334
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:01,831
Yeah, but he could have
orchestrated it in prison.

335
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:02,865
It's also his M.O.

336
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:04,900
Exactly, and if Perry is
good at anything,

337
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:06,602
it's making other people
pay for his crimes.

338
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,571
Okay, well, whoever
Perry hired to do this

339
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:09,705
was one sharp dude.

340
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:12,408
The cut on Boris' neck is
extremely precise.

341
00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:15,377
I'm thinking industrial-size
professional slicer.

342
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:19,181
Listen, I'm gonna do
everything I can to find him.

343
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:21,217
Even if I have to interview the owner

344
00:13:21,223 --> 00:13:22,718
of every single meat slicer in L.A.

345
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:24,553
You won't have to.

346
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,556
There was also non-human DNA on Boris.

347
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:29,425
Swine, to be exact.

348
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:31,961
A unique cross-bred
for its delicious meat.

349
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:34,501
And there's only one place that sells it.

350
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:39,301
Ah!

351
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:40,506
Hi.

352
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:42,638
That's so sweet of you,
but you don't have to stick around.

353
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:44,073
- Trials can be so boring.
- Well,

354
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,207
not this one.

355
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:46,141
What do you mean?

356
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:47,209
Mr. Morningstar,

357
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:48,878
we're ready for you.

358
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:50,980
Wonderful. Lovely. Right.

359
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:54,487
Off I go to shield you from
that Quid Pro Ho, Detective.

360
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:56,752
Lucifer, what are you doing?

361
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:58,988
Well, I figured there's no reason for us

362
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:02,262
to lose our heads just
because Boris lost his.

363
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:06,896
I swear to tell the truth,
he whole truth,

364
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:09,665
and nothing but the truth,

365
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:11,383
so help me Dad.

366
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:20,985
Mr. Morningstar,

367
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:23,921
you were there when Boris was arrested.

368
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:26,023
Right? Working with Detective Espinoza.

369
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:27,892
That is correct.

370
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:29,761
Except I call him Detective Douche.

371
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:32,634
But that's another story.

372
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,733
So would you please describe to us

373
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:36,868
what happened?

374
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:38,136
Yes, I'd love to, actually.

375
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:39,303
May-may I have the floor?

376
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:40,271
By all means.

377
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:42,006
Thank you.

378
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:44,041
I'm going to need...

379
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:46,010
Hello.

380
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,278
May I borrow your scarf?

381
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:49,647
Your Honor, is this necessary?

382
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:51,949
Well, you want the full story, don't you?

383
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:53,918
I mean, the Devil's in the details.

384
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:55,957
Thank you ever so much.

385
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,024
Right. Myself and Detective Douche...

386
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,459
Sorry, Detective Espinoza...

387
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:03,194
Were asked by the LAPD

388
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,929
to perform a sting operation.

389
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:05,930
Not the singer.

390
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:08,866
So we had to go undercover

391
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:10,201
at Boris' bathhouse.

392
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,369
Guns of steel...

393
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,371
Got up there...

394
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:15,006
Walked over like he's constantly got

395
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:16,340
a gun between his legs...

396
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:19,377
Boris looked me in the eye, and he said,

397
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:21,479
"People call me human lie detector."

398
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:22,647
He was going to kill...

399
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:25,116
Shook my hand like some
kind of Roman warrior...

400
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:28,219
...and it was sealed,
and I handed over the investigation

401
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:30,588
to Detective Decker.

402
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:32,056
Thank you.

403
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:41,566
I got a question.

404
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,668
Do you ever get the feeling
like you've been used?

405
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:46,470
You mean, by... Oh, I don't know...

406
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:50,341
The woman who's defending the
killer of your ex-wife's dad?

407
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:51,409
What?

408
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:53,477
Charlotte Richards is the gorgeous lady

409
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:54,445
you slept with, right?

410
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:56,447
How the hell did you know that?

411
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:59,050
Well, I saw a long, honey-blonde hair

412
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:00,351
on your coat the other day.

413
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:02,653
It was curlier than Chloe's. And then,

414
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:04,455
I spotted a smudge of lipstick

415
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:05,857
on your cuff... Burgundy shade.

416
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:09,560
Bold, but not too sexy. Lawyer color.

417
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:10,628
Really?

418
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:13,731
No. I just saw your butt pucker

419
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:16,100
when Chloe mentioned her
name in the lab this morning.

420
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:17,835
God.

421
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,737
Why are you so worried?

422
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:21,539
I mean, you didn't tell her
anything about the case

423
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,407
that she could use in court, right?

424
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:26,477
- I don't think so, but...
- There you go.

425
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:27,778
Mezcal cocktails, man.

426
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:29,881
Oof. Those sneak up on you.

427
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,983
She did keep wanting to
talk about our exes,

428
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:34,185
and all I thought was, you know what,
she's so easy to talk to.

429
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:35,319
She's so sympathetic.

430
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:36,687
God, I'm such an idiot.

431
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,789
- Hey...
- No, her taking Perry's case

432
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:40,291
right after we...

433
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:41,859
It can't be a coincidence.

434
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:43,895
Why not?

435
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,230
- Maybe she really just likes you.
- Yeah.

436
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:47,954
- 44.
- Hi. We'll take

437
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:50,538
the headless body of a dude
named Boris, please.

438
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,972
I was going to call you guys.

439
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:56,741
I was just... scared.

440
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:59,677
A few days ago, this guy approached me.

441
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:01,012
Big creepy dude.

442
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:03,047
He demanded the keys to use
the equipment after hours.

443
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:05,383
No questions asked, unless I wanted

444
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:06,651
to end up in the sausage myself.

445
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,686
- Do you know his name?
- No.

446
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,755
Asian, big.

447
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,294
Very scary.

448
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,897
But the scar on his neck
it's very distinctive.

449
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:20,197
Thank you, Mr. Morningstar.

450
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:22,533
What a, uh, vivid picture.

451
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:25,336
It's almost as if Boris
himself just testified.

452
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:27,638
Except a more handsome version.

453
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:29,640
Oh, stop it, Judy.

454
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,143
Thank you.

455
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:33,444
Right actually, to that,

456
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,779
I would like to add one
more thing, if I may...

457
00:17:34,785 --> 00:17:37,515
I think we've had enough, Your Honor.

458
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,417
Shh! Please...

459
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:41,519
continue Luc...

460
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,955
Mr. Morningstar.

461
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:46,424
Thank you, my darling.

462
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,794
Yes, I'd just like to
say, for the record,

463
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,497
the LAPD, and Detective Decker,
in particular,

464
00:17:53,503 --> 00:17:56,133
acted impeccably on this case.

465
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:59,370
This whole courtroom,
nay, the entire city

466
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:01,973
can rest assured that someone as honest,

467
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:05,476
trustworthy,
and reliable as Detective Decker

468
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:07,812
is out there protecting them.

469
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:12,416
She is... truly good.

470
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:13,751
And I don't mean in bed.

471
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:15,386
I wouldn't know.

472
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:16,858
That's how good she is.

473
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,024
Thank you.

474
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,025
Miss Richards?

475
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:23,665
Your witness.

476
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:28,670
I have no questions at this time.

477
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:42,747
Hey!

478
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:43,781
That's Chloe's car.

479
00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:44,882
What are you looking for?

480
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:45,987
Hey.

481
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:48,753
I was, um...

482
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,754
You.

483
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,622
I was looking for you.

484
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:53,124
Really?

485
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,662
Yeah, I've missed you.

486
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:59,030
It's true, I still think about you, Maze.

487
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:02,837
Every day. And every
time that I see you, it's...

488
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:06,641
I miss you, too.

489
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:16,147
It's like fireworks, isn't it?

490
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:20,317
But are you sure that's the kind

491
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:21,723
you're looking for?

492
00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:27,780
Or was it this?

493
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:35,766
One... tell your mother no one
is hurting Chloe on my watch.

494
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:37,101
And, two...

495
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:38,740
Don't ever lie to me like that again.

496
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:58,623
And what did Boris have to say

497
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:00,625
when you interrogated him?

498
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:02,794
He confessed that he
routinely provided fall guys

499
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,597
for the Russian gang that runs the prison

500
00:20:05,603 --> 00:20:07,554
where the defendants worked
since the late '90s.

501
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:09,468
And is there anything else

502
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,471
that is remarkable about this prison?

503
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,239
It is the very prison whose corruption

504
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,540
John Decker was investigating

505
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:17,242
when he was murdered 16 years ago.

506
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:18,410
Holy cow.

507
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,650
It's all so coincidental, isn't it?

508
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:25,250
Just like the odd timing of Boris' murder.

509
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:27,519
I withdraw that, Your Honor.

510
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:28,754
No further questions.

511
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,926
Thank you, Detective.

512
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,795
I have no questions for this witness.

513
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:38,534
The prosecution
rests, Your Honor.

514
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:41,700
Your turn to shine, Ms. Richards.

515
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:44,036
As its first witness,

516
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,942
the defense would like to
recall Lucifer Morningstar.

517
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,183
Oh, it's fine.

518
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,116
Just one small question, Mr. Morningstar.

519
00:20:58,122 --> 00:21:00,018
And please remember that you're still

520
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:01,620
under oath.

521
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:03,488
Who was first on the Fields crime scene?

522
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:06,958
First on the scene was
the detective, I believe.

523
00:21:06,964 --> 00:21:08,983
I'm sorry, which detective?

524
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:10,310
Detective Decker.

525
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,241
Are you sure? How do you know?

526
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:13,799
Quite sure. Yeah, she told me.

527
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,167
It's kind of strange, isn't it,

528
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,968
for the man accused
of killing John Decker

529
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,337
to be found dead by
Decker's own daughter,

530
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:20,272
Chloe Decker?

531
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,873
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?

532
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:22,941
I'm getting to that.

533
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:24,810
Would you please read who,

534
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,145
according to the official police report,

535
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,984
was the first officer on the scene?

536
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:32,517
What's wrong?

537
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:33,752
I'll tell you later.

538
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:36,254
Well, it says Detective Espinoza.

539
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,357
I thought you said Chloe Decker
was an impeccable detective.

540
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:40,425
Objection, Your Honor!

541
00:21:40,431 --> 00:21:41,760
No, I-I'd like to answer that.

542
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:43,728
She is. That's why she

543
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,764
took herself off the
investigation immediately.

544
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,567
But not until after she'd
found her dad's killer dead?

545
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,001
Objection!

546
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,970
What's he objecting to... Air quotes?

547
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:54,773
I'm simply stating that if
what we just heard is true,

548
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:57,109
then there's a very
plausible alternative story

549
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,177
to the one that the State is presenting.

550
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:01,780
Chloe Decker had motive, opportunity,

551
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:04,449
and the LAPD to protect
her and help her frame

552
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:06,918
an innocent man for
her personal vendetta.

553
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:08,153
With all due respect, Your Honor,

554
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,222
Chloe Decker is not on trial here.

555
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,224
And my client shouldn't be, either.

556
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,859
Because it appears he is the victim

557
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,731
of the LAPD's incompetence.

558
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:20,198
Unless, of course, the report is right,

559
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:23,806
and it is you that is lying,
Mr. Morningstar?

560
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:27,572
What you're implying is preposterous.

561
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:29,812
The Detective would never hurt anyone.

562
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:35,313
But yes.

563
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:37,182
What I said is the truth.

564
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:39,484
Under oath or otherwise.

565
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,956
I don't lie.

566
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:47,939
Detective?

567
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:48,922
Please.

568
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:50,644
Trust me, you do not
want to talk to me right now.

569
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:52,330
You're right, I don't. You look scary.

570
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:55,233
But look, I apologize for
my controversial testimony,

571
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,635
but I was clearly bamboozled.

572
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:00,572
You didn't expect me to lie
on the stand, did you?

573
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:02,407
It's not about your answers.

574
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:04,276
It's about Charlotte's questions.

575
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,411
She wouldn't have even asked
them unless she already knew

576
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,947
I was first on scene.

577
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:10,415
Let's see. Who could've told her?

578
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:11,616
Detective, I didn't.

579
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:13,351
You say that, but you also said

580
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:16,588
your relationship with Charlotte
wouldn't affect this trial.

581
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:18,727
It just did.

582
00:23:21,265 --> 00:23:23,161
Detective!

583
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,903
Charlotte?

584
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:34,273
How could you do this to me?

585
00:23:34,298 --> 00:23:36,107
What exactly?

586
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:37,709
I've done several things to you.

587
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,644
Did you sleep with me to
get intel on this case?

588
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,714
Of course, but it's not like you
didn't get anything out of it.

589
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,950
"Mind altering," I believe you called it.

590
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,252
Yeah, literally, apparently.

591
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:50,722
Because I don't remember telling
you anything about this case.

592
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:53,491
- Did you roofie me or something?
- I didn't need to.

593
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:56,595
I've learned sex puts your
gender into a mild coma.

594
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,997
Offered the perfect window
to go through your phone.

595
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,165
So, maybe...

596
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:02,734
next time, you should put your phone away

597
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,069
before we have the sex.

598
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,003
"Next time"?

599
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,004
Mm-hmm.

600
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,343
Are you insane?

601
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,046
You tell me.

602
00:24:19,023 --> 00:24:21,019
I wish I could say
that I'm surprised

603
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,554
Maze blew up your car.

604
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,356
She is...

605
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,690
Maze.

606
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:26,858
I know, right?

607
00:24:26,864 --> 00:24:28,593
Slightest provocation,

608
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,312
- and she turns into a little...
- Hellion?

609
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:32,397
Exactly.

610
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:33,798
Let me ask you though...

611
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:36,935
Why do you think that she reacted so...

612
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:38,470
passionately?

613
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:41,072
Because she's a complete maniac
fueled by rage and violence.

614
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:44,943
Now, as your friend,
not your... therapist,

615
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:48,780
you feel you did nothing
at all to anger her?

616
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:50,649
Well, s...

617
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,884
Maybe not nothing.

618
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,754
I may have obscured the truth a bit.

619
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,355
- Otherwise known as lying.
- Linda,

620
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,958
I had no choice.
You have to understand that.

621
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,726
Oh, I do. Oh, I do.
You were... you were dealing

622
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:03,595
with matters of great importance.

623
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:06,131
So important, you feel justified

624
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,932
to act any way you see fit.

625
00:25:07,938 --> 00:25:11,269
Even if that means hurting
people you care about.

626
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:13,809
You "did what you had to do."

627
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:18,343
That's, uh...

628
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:20,516
that's what I did to you.

629
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:24,416
I treated Maze the same
way that I treated you.

630
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,685
Yeah, except I'm just your friend.

631
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,120
And Maze is...

632
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:31,456
well, more.

633
00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:33,024
So, it's way worse.

634
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,660
And as my friend,

635
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:37,529
your advice is?

636
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,130
Apologize your ass off.

637
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:41,099
Or next time, she might blow that up.

638
00:25:42,973 --> 00:25:45,303
Maybe you don't understand.

639
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:48,206
Mommy Dearest tried to kill Chloe.

640
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:50,175
Oh, I understand. She told me.

641
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,744
- She did?
- Yes. We're past that.

642
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,237
What I don't understand, though,

643
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,014
is how the detective
can think I'm the one

644
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,050
who leaked sensitive
information to my mum.

645
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:00,385
How could she?

646
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:02,387
Yeah, Chloe's the bad guy.

647
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:03,955
Mm.

648
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:06,641
If only I knew who really gave
Mom that information.

649
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,930
Right. If only.

650
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:14,332
Oh! Good. You came.

651
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:16,401
Yes, he did.

652
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:17,936
Thanks for coming, Dan.

653
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:19,437
Anything up lately?

654
00:26:19,443 --> 00:26:20,772
I don't know. You tell me.

655
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:22,607
Lucifer called me here.

656
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:24,743
Yes. Well, I was thinking,
as my testimony didn't go

657
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,645
quite as planned, that it
might help fix things to prove

658
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:29,647
that Perry was behind Boris' killing.

659
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:31,449
- Already working on it, man.
- Fantastic!

660
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:33,151
Well then, please tell me
you have some scintillating

661
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:35,720
cop-speak on how to
accomplish that tiny task.

662
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:39,324
Well, uh, the guy who chopped
Boris's head off had this scar.

663
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,458
It's actually a brand.

664
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:42,427
Signature of the Alhambra Triads,

665
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:44,362
they're a Chinese crime syndicate.

666
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:45,897
Lots of them were in the
prison that Perry ran.

667
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,032
Triads hate the Russians, so

668
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:49,701
makes sense to pit them
against each other.

669
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:52,137
Yeah. You should
definitely probe this angle.

670
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,339
Mm.

671
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:57,108
Rumors are they use a Chinese
cultural center as a front.

672
00:26:57,114 --> 00:26:59,544
Right. Well, let's start
there then, shall we?

673
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,446
These guys

674
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:02,747
are notoriously violent,
so let's try to get

675
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:04,149
in and out as quickly
as possible, all right?

676
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,717
Oh, speaking of "in and out,"

677
00:27:05,723 --> 00:27:08,920
this case really seems to be
touching you, Dan.

678
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:10,822
You know, in a very personal way.

679
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:12,924
All right. Shh. Yeah.
It's personal, obviously.

680
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,392
Just try to keep it down, all right?

681
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:16,094
Well, it's almost like you want to take

682
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,096
Charlotte Richards down yourself.

683
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:21,299
Like, way down, and give her a hard time.

684
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:22,534
What are you trying to say, Maze?

685
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,202
Yes, what are you driving at, Maze?

686
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,303
"Driving at."

687
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:26,504
Good one.

688
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,906
N-No. I'm just...

689
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:32,310
really impressed with how
much Dan wants to penetrate

690
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:34,145
this thing from every

691
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:35,613
position.

692
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:37,282
You know?

693
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,417
- Oh, yeah.
- Know what?

694
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:41,319
I bet that's what she said, didn't she?

695
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:43,221
Oh, yeah!

696
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:45,757
Oh, Dan!

697
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,158
- Big boy.
- All right, all right!

698
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:48,893
Fine.

699
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:51,062
Yes. It's my fault.

700
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:53,331
I leaked the information to Charlotte.

701
00:27:53,337 --> 00:27:54,699
Among other things.

702
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:57,176
I'm why she knew Chloe
was first at the scene.

703
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:59,871
She must have looked at my
text messages after we...

704
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:00,839
You what?

705
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,707
Made... love.

706
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:05,280
You slept with my... M-arlotte?

707
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:07,846
You bastard!

708
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,384
Whoa!

709
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:16,955
Oh, now look what you've done.

710
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,794
Wha...?

711
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,406
Da-da... Don't be a Dan.

712
00:28:28,412 --> 00:28:30,509
I'll deal with this.

713
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:31,543
Right.

714
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:33,582
Which one of you chaps is in charge?

715
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,581
Oh, very well.

716
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,519
You speak Chinese?

717
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:42,751
- What...?
- I'm the Devil.

718
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:44,576
Of course I speak Chinese.
I speak everything.

719
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:52,030
...Lucifer Morningstar.

720
00:28:59,477 --> 00:29:01,577
Lovely.

721
00:29:03,681 --> 00:29:05,303
Furen Li Chunhua.

722
00:29:08,586 --> 00:29:09,848
...Daniel.

723
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:11,249
What's he saying over there?

724
00:29:11,255 --> 00:29:12,484
No idea.

725
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,820
Xie xie.

726
00:29:14,826 --> 00:29:18,256
Okeydokes. I think I've
brokered a fair deal.

727
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:20,659
Madame Li is gonna give us
the man who killed Boris.

728
00:29:20,665 --> 00:29:22,527
All we have to do is defeat Kang.

729
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,033
And who the hell is Kang?

730
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:35,607
And who's supposed to fight him?

731
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:36,908
- Aww, hell no.
- No, no.

732
00:29:36,914 --> 00:29:39,477
Much as I'd like to see
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Douche,

733
00:29:39,483 --> 00:29:41,713
I'd actually like to win this.
I was pointing at Maze.

734
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,082
Why not?

735
00:29:44,088 --> 00:29:46,117
Okay, sure.

736
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:47,452
She's terrifying.

737
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:48,620
But what happens if we lose?

738
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:49,821
They kill us.

739
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:50,822
Well, you.

740
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:52,190
'Cause I'm immortal.

741
00:29:52,196 --> 00:29:53,358
Right. Shall we?

742
00:29:57,869 --> 00:29:59,331
Choose your weapon.

743
00:29:59,337 --> 00:30:00,970
I choose those.

744
00:30:07,678 --> 00:30:09,778
You done?

745
00:30:40,444 --> 00:30:41,610
Hoo-ah.

746
00:30:48,286 --> 00:30:49,714
She likes that move.

747
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:12,771
Down, girl.

748
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:14,239
- Are you serious?
- Well,

749
00:31:14,245 --> 00:31:16,078
I mean, you did get two new toys.

750
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:21,947
Well, that sucked.

751
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:23,218
Hmm?

752
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:25,617
But a deal's a deal.

753
00:31:25,623 --> 00:31:27,485
- Indeed.
- The one you seek

754
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:30,121
was banished for working
outside the family.

755
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:32,261
We don't break bread with strangers.

756
00:31:34,881 --> 00:31:36,280
You'll find him at this address.

757
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:39,264
Xie Xie.

758
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,166
No problem.

759
00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:44,873
See? Easy peasy, Chinese-y.

760
00:31:45,776 --> 00:31:47,439
Dan's got a lead

761
00:31:47,445 --> 00:31:49,808
on Boris' killer,
and it may implicate Perry.

762
00:31:49,814 --> 00:31:51,977
So, if he is responsible,
it might not matter

763
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:53,912
what happens in this trial.

764
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:56,081
Well, that's great, 'cause we
are getting our asses kicked.

765
00:31:56,087 --> 00:31:57,482
Well. I have to testify next.

766
00:31:57,488 --> 00:31:59,017
I just hope I don't make things worse.

767
00:31:59,023 --> 00:32:00,719
Oh, you'll do great, honey. You're a pro.

768
00:32:00,725 --> 00:32:02,988
Right, Mom. A real pro.

769
00:32:02,994 --> 00:32:04,723
Like when I followed the prison van.

770
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:07,325
Mom, what if I'm the reason
Dad's killer goes free?

771
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:08,460
Don't you dare.

772
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:10,762
No father in the world was
more proud of his daughter

773
00:32:10,768 --> 00:32:11,796
than your dad.

774
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:14,232
And nothing you could do in that courtroom

775
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:16,501
or anywhere will ever change that.

776
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:19,971
I just miss him.

777
00:32:19,977 --> 00:32:22,974
I want him to get the
justice he deserves.

778
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,577
Justice is what we all want, dear.

779
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:27,345
For your father,

780
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:29,084
and for my client.

781
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,985
You're a mother.

782
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:35,220
Aren't you?

783
00:32:35,226 --> 00:32:36,321
Yes.

784
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:38,460
Then shame on you.

785
00:32:43,901 --> 00:32:46,635
We need to talk.

786
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:52,871
Man, he better be here.

787
00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:54,339
If we can convince him to give up Perry,

788
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:57,075
I won't feel so bad about
having slept with Charl...

789
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:58,610
La la la la! No more talk

790
00:32:58,616 --> 00:33:00,845
of that disgusting offense, please.

791
00:33:00,851 --> 00:33:03,748
I thought you said you
hadn't slept with her.

792
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:06,551
I haven't, wouldn't ever.

793
00:33:06,557 --> 00:33:08,186
I'm just upset for the detective.

794
00:33:08,192 --> 00:33:09,254
What, you think I'm not?

795
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,488
I would do anything to right this.

796
00:33:10,494 --> 00:33:12,728
I know you would.

797
00:33:18,803 --> 00:33:21,970
LAPD! Put your hands where I can see 'em!

798
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:27,309
Whoa!

799
00:33:29,246 --> 00:33:31,776
Well, looks like we found Boris,

800
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:33,545
at the head of the table, ironically.

801
00:33:33,551 --> 00:33:36,414
And that's Da Young.
I'd say we were right.

802
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,283
Perry hired him to go
behind the Triad's back

803
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:40,585
to kill Boris, knowing that
they'd punish him for it.

804
00:33:40,591 --> 00:33:43,221
Clever Perry,
killed two birds with one stone.

805
00:33:43,227 --> 00:33:45,661
Three, if you count the chicken.

806
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,897
You've got a lot of nerve.

807
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:55,338
Yes, I've been told.

808
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:56,472
And legs for days.

809
00:33:56,478 --> 00:33:58,975
Now, listen, you're losing bad.

810
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:00,643
Without Boris, the prosecution's evidence

811
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:02,178
is mostly circumstantial.

812
00:34:02,184 --> 00:34:03,646
And, unfortunately for you,

813
00:34:03,652 --> 00:34:05,214
Lucifer's testimony basically handed me

814
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,782
a non-guilty verdict.

815
00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:08,684
This trial is over.

816
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,419
Maybe.

817
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,989
But the investigation into that monster

818
00:34:12,995 --> 00:34:15,658
that you call a client is ongoing.

819
00:34:15,664 --> 00:34:17,093
So one way or another,

820
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,862
he wi...

821
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:21,631
Hmm.

822
00:34:21,637 --> 00:34:22,736
Bad news?

823
00:34:23,705 --> 00:34:25,238
I may have a solution.

824
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,839
My client isn't fully
aware we're winning.

825
00:34:29,845 --> 00:34:31,307
However, he is more than aware

826
00:34:31,313 --> 00:34:32,742
that he's facing the death penalty.

827
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:35,845
And we both know he's a coward.

828
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,613
I could use the possibility

829
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,349
of a lethal injection to
get him to plead guilty.

830
00:34:40,355 --> 00:34:41,550
You're supposed to be on his side.

831
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:42,518
Why are you doing this?

832
00:34:42,524 --> 00:34:44,954
Well, there is one condition.

833
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,660
You'd have to betray Lucifer.

834
00:34:48,664 --> 00:34:50,192
So...

835
00:34:50,198 --> 00:34:52,928
you want Perry to go to jail,

836
00:34:52,934 --> 00:34:54,830
call Lucifer a liar.

837
00:34:54,836 --> 00:34:56,832
"A liar"?

838
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:00,803
If there's one thing he cares
about more than anything,

839
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,376
it's his honor.

840
00:35:04,713 --> 00:35:06,146
See you in court.

841
00:35:09,017 --> 00:35:10,279
Detective Decker,

842
00:35:10,304 --> 00:35:12,643
Lucifer Morningstar is
your partner, correct?

843
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:13,482
Yes.

844
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:16,619
He's a civilian consultant for the LAPD.

845
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:17,753
We work cases together.

846
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:19,922
And how is he qualified for this role?

847
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:23,626
He is very, uh, intuitive.

848
00:35:23,632 --> 00:35:26,729
He, um, understands people's desires.

849
00:35:26,735 --> 00:35:28,297
And in addition to that,

850
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:30,070
I assume he studied law enforcement?

851
00:35:32,441 --> 00:35:34,303
Not to my knowledge, no.

852
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:36,246
Oh, okay.

853
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:37,907
But he has a professional background,

854
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:40,142
which is somehow relevant
to law enforcement?

855
00:35:40,148 --> 00:35:41,243
He owns a nightclub.

856
00:35:41,249 --> 00:35:43,179
Okay, but then,

857
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,647
I'm sure his previous job

858
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:45,881
was more relevant to his role

859
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:47,850
as a civilian consultant for the LAPD?

860
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,752
- Right?
- Mm.

861
00:35:49,758 --> 00:35:52,121
Well, if you believe his claims

862
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:53,789
that he used to run Hell...

863
00:35:56,898 --> 00:36:00,930
...then yes, he's accustomed
to punishing bad guys.

864
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,566
It's true.

865
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:05,267
I'm confused, Detective.

866
00:36:05,273 --> 00:36:09,171
Are you suggesting your
partner is delusional,

867
00:36:09,177 --> 00:36:10,744
or just lying?

868
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:19,615
Lucifer Morningstar is many things,

869
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:21,917
but he is not a liar.

870
00:36:21,923 --> 00:36:25,588
Everything that Mr. Morningstar said

871
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:28,257
on this stand is absolutely true.

872
00:36:28,263 --> 00:36:31,193
I was the first person
on that crime scene.

873
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,963
And, yes, I shouldn't have
been anywhere near it.

874
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:36,832
But I...

875
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:39,568
let my emotions

876
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:41,741
get the best of me.

877
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:48,047
Lucifer is the...

878
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,515
...best partner

879
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:54,483
I have ever had.

880
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:58,954
And I can only hope that
he can count on me

881
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,506
as much as I count on him.

882
00:37:02,531 --> 00:37:04,693
Your Honor,
we request the jury be instructed

883
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:08,397
to disregard Detective
Decker's entire testimony.

884
00:37:08,403 --> 00:37:10,837
We'll take a ten-minute recess.

885
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:29,118
Harry, are you surprised

886
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:30,386
by that "not guilty" verdict?

887
00:37:30,392 --> 00:37:32,455
No. I'm never surprised
to see justice served.

888
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:33,989
I believe in our legal system.

889
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:35,424
And now I can finally return to my family

890
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,159
a free man, so, if you'll excuse me.

891
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,756
I'm sorry to bother you, um, I was, um...

892
00:38:07,762 --> 00:38:10,025
I'm looking for Maze.

893
00:38:10,031 --> 00:38:11,260
Do you know what apartment she lives in?

894
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:14,634
Oh, yes, but she's not home.

895
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:18,133
Why, did you get in a fight?

896
00:38:19,785 --> 00:38:21,403
I'm sorry, it's none of my business.

897
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:26,242
It's just, my husband...

898
00:38:26,248 --> 00:38:28,911
always gave me flowers after an argument.

899
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:31,985
Are you all right?

900
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:42,391
I used to believe

901
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:44,493
everything happens for a reason.

902
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:47,730
But now, I'm not so sure.

903
00:38:49,404 --> 00:38:50,703
Me, neither.

904
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,170
But I do know that no
matter how bad things get,

905
00:38:55,176 --> 00:38:57,940
the true test is how we choose to respond

906
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:01,243
to the pain we suffer.

907
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:03,012
Or inflict.

908
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:05,581
That's well said.

909
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:07,587
Maze is a lucky girl.

910
00:39:09,257 --> 00:39:11,020
Hope she forgives you.

911
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:13,693
Ha! Huh.

912
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:20,629
I'm sorry, you... you
look really familiar.

913
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:22,865
I'm Chloe's mom?

914
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:24,370
Have we met?

915
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:30,706
No, I don't believe we have.

916
00:39:30,712 --> 00:39:33,580
I never forget a face.

917
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:39,048
If you'll excuse me, I have to go.

918
00:39:39,054 --> 00:39:40,787
Oh.

919
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:52,494
Good night, Rosie.

920
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,507
Perry Smith.

921
00:40:03,745 --> 00:40:06,412
I know you had Boris killed.

922
00:40:07,716 --> 00:40:09,445
I also know you're responsible

923
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:11,547
for the murder of Jill Fields

924
00:40:11,553 --> 00:40:12,781
and John Decker.

925
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:16,218
Aw, such a shame there's
no evidence, right?

926
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:19,054
The system kind of needs proof.

927
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,156
Yeah.

928
00:40:21,162 --> 00:40:23,759
You clean your mess, we got nada.

929
00:40:23,765 --> 00:40:26,028
But you know who's okay with nada?

930
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:27,867
Or shall I say nichego?

931
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:30,699
Yeah, that's right.

932
00:40:30,705 --> 00:40:32,086
You see, the Russians,

933
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:33,902
they don't like it when one of their own

934
00:40:33,908 --> 00:40:36,639
is taken out without permission.

935
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:38,674
But who knows?

936
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,313
Maybe they won't hear about it.

937
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:48,050
Whoa.

938
00:40:48,056 --> 00:40:50,023
Aah!

939
00:40:51,926 --> 00:40:53,622
My pleasure, Meesha.

940
00:40:53,628 --> 00:40:55,428
Dozvidanya.

941
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:09,405
I didn't think you had it in you.

942
00:41:09,411 --> 00:41:12,074
I'm impressed.

943
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,175
Drive.

944
00:41:37,138 --> 00:41:39,702
You were right.

945
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:42,204
You are nothing like Father.

946
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,808
Oh? What changed your mind?

947
00:41:45,814 --> 00:41:47,543
If I tell you this, you have to come

948
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,278
completely clean with me, Mother.

949
00:41:49,284 --> 00:41:52,719
No more secrets, Mom. No more lies.

950
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:56,923
Okay.

951
00:41:58,293 --> 00:41:59,955
What happened?

952
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:03,659
35 years ago, Father,

953
00:42:03,665 --> 00:42:04,927
He asked me to come down here

954
00:42:04,933 --> 00:42:07,162
to bless a couple who was
unable to have a child.

955
00:42:07,168 --> 00:42:09,531
He had never asked me to
do anything of this sort,

956
00:42:09,537 --> 00:42:12,267
and He never did again.

957
00:42:12,273 --> 00:42:13,573
Today...

958
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,043
I met the mother again.

959
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,076
And I found out what the result

960
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:22,882
of that miracle was.

961
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:26,448
Or, rather, who.

962
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,653
- Oh, hey.
- Detective.

963
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:33,889
- Sorry, I thought...
- What are you doing here?

964
00:42:33,895 --> 00:42:35,524
Are you on your way out?

965
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,292
I am, yes.

966
00:42:37,298 --> 00:42:38,727
- Oh...
- To see you, actually.

967
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:41,029
Oh.

968
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:43,999
I believe I owe you dinner.

969
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:48,403
Now we know why
Chloe's so special.

970
00:42:48,409 --> 00:42:50,973
Don't we?

971
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:53,375
Your Father put her here.

972
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:55,414
In Lucifer's path.

973
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:58,914
You know what this means?

974
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,918
It means... that I was a pawn.

975
00:43:06,528 --> 00:43:07,589
Say when.

976
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:08,891
When!

977
00:43:08,897 --> 00:43:10,492
When.

978
00:43:10,498 --> 00:43:11,894
I hope you know it takes months

979
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,995
to get a reservation at this place.

980
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:15,264
Oh, yeah. The fries are amazing.

981
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:17,136
Oh, thank you. I made them myself.

982
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,137
It means Chloe's not an obstacle.

983
00:43:22,143 --> 00:43:25,174
She's how you'll get your wings back.

984
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,076
She's how we'll get it all back.

985
00:43:31,948 --> 00:43:33,448
Detective?

986
00:43:33,454 --> 00:43:37,019
What you said today in the courtroom...

987
00:43:37,025 --> 00:43:38,654
It was the truth.

988
00:43:48,403 --> 00:43:51,233
We're going home, son.

989
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:55,204
And Chloe is the Key.

990
