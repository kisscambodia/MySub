00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:20,274
Are you okay?

182
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:21,984
- CHLOE: Yeah, I'm fine.
- LUCIFER: Fine?

183
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,444
You should be ecstatic.

184
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,321
(laughs): Your father's
killer just got

185
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,948
the ultimate punishment.

186
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:30,410
Who was first
on the scene?

187
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:31,369
It was me.

188
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,247
I made the call.

189
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:38,376
DAN:
<i>You followed him?</i>

190
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,086
Yeah. I know this looks bad.

191
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:41,671
You stalked your
father's murderer

192
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,839
right before
he was killed.

193
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,882
That was a terrible move,
Detective.

194
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,259
It was, right?

195
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:48,886
What were you planning to do,
Chloe?

196
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,096
Crash the christening?

197
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:51,431
I don't know, Dan!

198
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,557
I was angry.

199
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:53,891
The guy killed my father.

200
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,226
He had the nerve

201
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,103
to smile at me.
Do you have any idea

202
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,062
what that feels like?

203
00:07:58,938 --> 00:07:59,647
No.

204
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:01,107
No, I don't.

205
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,110
But you still shouldn't
have followed him.

206
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,446
No one actually thinks
that you did this,

207
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:07,738
but you know what
it looks like, right?

208
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:09,490
Yes, I do.

209
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:10,950
That's why I'm gonna step away
from the case.

210
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,910
It's a massive
conflict of interest.

211
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,829
Don't worry, Chloe.
I'm gonna stay on this.

212
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,164
Yes, Detective Dan and I

213
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:18,082
won't rest until
we catch the killer.

214
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,168
I don't think that it's
a good idea for Lucifer

215
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,252
to be part of this case.

216
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:22,545
I agree.

217
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,922
I mean, the last thing this
case needs is a loose canon.

218
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:26,924
She needs someone like you.
A reliable,

219
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:29,051
helpful, boring
detective.

220
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,595
Now, the good news is
that's me as well now.

221
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:31,721
So, the Dans are on the case.

222
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,389
Can't you take
anything seriously, man?

223
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,599
I assure you

224
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:36,350
- LUCIFER: I'm taking this
very seriously.
- DAN: Oh, really?

225
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,852
- DAN: Well, you're doing a great job
of showing that.
- CHLOE: Guys.

226
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,689
It would mean a lot to me
if you worked together on this.

227
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,107
Hmm.

228
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:44,275
Of course, Chloe.

229
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:47,320
Okay, so...
whoa,

230
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,362
this looks heavy.

231
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,282
Like waiting-for-STD-results
heavy.

232
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:52,617
(whispering):
I can come back later.

233
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:54,243
Oh, no, it's fine.
What is it?

234
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,370
Okay, so, I went through
all the prints from the van.

235
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,414
Okay? And all of them cleared
as prison personnel

236
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,541
except for an ex-con

237
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,959
named Rodney Lam.

238
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,753
And get this...

239
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:06,422
he served time
with Joe Fields.

240
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:08,716
We're on it.

241
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:09,717
We're on it.

242
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:11,844
Nice.

243
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,471
You working on a new role?

244
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:14,472
Hmm?

245
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,681
(scoffs)

246
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,523
You're wearing that
to an interview?

247
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:24,690
What's the job?

248
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:26,108
Preschool aide.

249
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,277
Do you like little kids?

250
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:29,779
(chuckles)

251
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,989
I've dealt with filthy,
screaming humans before.

252
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,741
At least these are smaller.

253
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,618
I'm not sure this is you.

254
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,496
BEATRICE:
Ms. Perez says we should
choose jobs we love doing.

255
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:39,830
So, what about you, Maze?

256
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,541
What do you love to do?

257
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:45,336
I don't know.

258
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:46,379
Well...

259
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,672
just be yourself.

260
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,716
Thanks, little human.

261
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:55,304
So good.

262
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:57,723
Well, the secret ingredient
is the Hawaiian bread.

263
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,434
And then you just cut a hole
in the middle for the egg.

264
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,978
Can we have this for every meal?

265
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,397
You know, this one used to be
my favorite, too.

266
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:07,400
Grandpa used to bring me
this sandwich every Thursday

267
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,151
after acting class.

268
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,696
Why don't you ever
talk about Grandpa?

269
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,781
Mm...

270
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,243
...I guess 'cause I miss him.

271
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,914
Do you think he would've
brought me sandwiches?

272
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,000
Mm-hmm.

273
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,085
I think he would've loved that,
monkey.

274
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,462
(knocking at door)

275
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,047
Come on. It's time
for your homework.

276
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:34,927
Can I help you?

277
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,053
Chloe Decker?

278
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,931
You're gonna pay
for what you've done.

279
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,776
Okay, take it easy.

280
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,613
My father was a good man.

281
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,407
He didn't deserve
to get gunned down

282
00:10:56,616 --> 00:10:57,742
like an animal.

283
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,913
All he wanted was
to meet my daughter.

284
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:04,999
You're Tina Fields.

285
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,418
You killed my father.

286
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:09,045
- I didn't...
- Thought you were
getting revenge,

287
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,339
but you murdered
an innocent man.

288
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,049
Tina, think about
your baby.

289
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,593
If you pull that trigger,
you'll never hold her again.

290
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,845
BEATRICE:
Mommy? Who's here?

291
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,847
It's nothing, honey.
Stay in your room!

292
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,225
I didn't kill
your father.

293
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:24,602
You have to believe me.

294
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,730
Mommy, is everything okay?

295
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:30,149
Yeah, honey.
Everything's fine, monkey.

296
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:31,275
Go back in your room.

297
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,277
Mommy just needs
to help another mommy.

298
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:35,613
- Okay?
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

299
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,573
I was just so angry.

300
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,742
I never wanted
to believe

301
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,410
my dad killed a cop.

302
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,830
And then today,
when I got the video...

303
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:45,790
What video?

304
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,459
His lawyers sent this to me.

305
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,587
Said I was to receive it
upon the event of his death.

306
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,186
Ah.

307
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:08,187
Sorry, not sorry.

308
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:09,689
I had to stop
for a costume change.

309
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,899
- DAN: Nice jacket.
- LUCIFER: Thank you.

310
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,276
Oh, man,
what the hell?

311
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,570
Are you here to work, or
are you here to play games?

312
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,948
I'll have you know
I take the School of Dan

313
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,908
quite seriously,
even if it does involve

314
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:22,201
skinny-fit jeans.

315
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,120
Any news on our suspect?

316
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:25,955
His name is Rodney Lam.

317
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,748
A CI told me that he's
obsessed with this place.

318
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:28,791
He eats here
all the time.

319
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,084
So if he shows up,

320
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,002
let's try to see him
before he sees us.

321
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,963
Oh, I get it now.

322
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,298
So your boring attire
is like camo

323
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,925
for the average Joe.

324
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:39,677
Blend in, catch
the baddie off guard.

325
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,011
Afterwards they'll forget
you're even there.

326
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,471
That is very clever,
Daniel.

327
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:45,474
This guy has a serious
history of violence.

328
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,184
All right?
He might have a gun.

329
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:49,311
He might take a hostage.
Who knows what he could do?

330
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,397
So he wouldn't, say,
be openly eating

331
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,525
a nacho burrito dog,
sitting on that car?

332
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:57,403
You watch my six.

333
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,696
Absolutely.

334
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,701
Rodney Lam. LAPD.

335
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,369
No sudden moves.
You're under arrest.

336
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:06,620
Rodney?

337
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,957
Maybe we blend in so well
he doesn't even see us.

338
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,876
Rodney Lam!

339
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,379
Good call, Rodney.

340
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:17,339
Nice and easy.

341
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,633
Oh.

342
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,635
I just wanted
one last meal.

343
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:22,803
You want a bite?

344
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,306
Aah! No, thank you, we're not
doing carbs, are we?

345
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,853
(clears throat)

346
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:34,899
Baby...

347
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:38,068
it's Daddy.

348
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:42,364
If, uh, you're watching this,

349
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:44,950
that means I'm dead.

350
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,578
Now, I know it sucks.

351
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,663
I don't know if you'll
get this tomorrow

352
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,875
or, uh, 30 years from now,

353
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,170
but I want you
to know the truth.

354
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,049
I didn't kill that cop.

355
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,302
I'm sorry for...

356
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,056
missing all your birthdays
and graduation--

357
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:07,932
your life.

358
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,392
But Daddy wants you
to know, baby...

359
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:13,729
I love you.

360
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,316
See? He's innocent.

361
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,693
Tina, I can tell your dad
loves you very much,

362
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,238
but... this video
doesn't prove anything.

363
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,573
His lawyers had this tape
for 16 years.

364
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,575
He made them promise
to give it to me when he died.

365
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,035
That has to mean something.

366
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,913
16 years.

367
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,795
He recorded this the day
my father was killed.

368
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:40,631
(camera beeps)

369
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:46,428
CHLOE:
Three minutes before he died.

370
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:47,763
What part of town is this?

371
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:50,182
It's our old apartment
in Venice.

372
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,102
My father was killed
across the city in Koreatown.

373
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,479
CHLOE: There's no way your
father could have recorded this

374
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:56,730
and gotten
to the crime scene in time.

375
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,441
So it's true.
He didn't do it.

376
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,528
Which means whoever did
kill my father

377
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,280
got away with this
and is still out there.

378
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,949
(breathes deeply, exhales)

379
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:08,492
RODNEY:
<i>I did it.</i>

380
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,077
I killed Joe Fields.

381
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,454
He disrespected me in the yard.

382
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,957
So when I heard that he was getting
some sort of temporary leave,

383
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,126
I knew that it was my chance
to make things right.

384
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,169
Well, there you have it.

385
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,838
Looks like our
douching paid off.

386
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,298
The detective will
be pleased.

387
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,092
And, you know, you
make it look so easy.

388
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,804
Where did you say you
stopped that van again?

389
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:30,097
Spring and College.

390
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,265
We found it at Hill.

391
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:32,766
That's what I meant.

392
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,227
Then you went and you emptied
the clip into the driver, right?

393
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,186
Hell yeah.

394
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,980
The driver died from
a single shot to the neck.

395
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,566
Dan One, why are you spoiling
a perfectly good confession?

396
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,192
You're lying, Rodney.

397
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,195
You don't know the facts
because you didn't do it.

398
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,740
Oh, I see what
you did there.

399
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,617
Gosh, that's why
you're Dan One.

400
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:53,412
Why are you confessing
to a crime you didn't commit?

401
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,627
Where are you going?

402
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,171
Well, just slow your
roll for a second.

403
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,881
I think, for the sake
of the detective,

404
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,133
I'm gonna take a time-out
from my Dansformation.

405
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:08,177
(inhales, exhales
dramatically)

406
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,888
(chuckling):
Oh, God.

407
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,266
Rodney, what do you
want out of life, hmm?

408
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,023
To be a good provider
and take care of my family.

409
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:23,025
So you confess to a crime
you didn't commit.

410
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,860
That's quite counterintuitive.

411
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,278
Unless you got paid
to do it.

412
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,531
You've been locked up
for most of your life.

413
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,408
That's all you know.

414
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,619
Now you're free,
you've got mouths to feed,

415
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:34,745
No way to earn.

416
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:39,166
Out here I'm no one, guys.

417
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,918
And if we don't
arrest you,

418
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,878
you don't get
any money.

419
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,548
But if he really wants
back in the slammer,

420
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,051
then false confession's
a criminal offense, correct?

421
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,261
- Definitely an
obstruction of justice.
- Mm.

422
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:52,930
Could get you
a few years.

423
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,390
LUCIFER: We could get you
a narcoleptic lawyer

424
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,432
and a merciless judge.

425
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:57,101
Who knows? With
your prior history,

426
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,394
they might throw
the book at you.

427
00:16:58,602 --> 00:16:59,395
Hmm?

428
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,646
All right.

429
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:03,774
Here's how it went down.

430
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,610
I put word out
that I needed money,

431
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:08,946
I was desperate.

432
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,907
And some people came
to me with an offer.

433
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,911
(banging on door)

434
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,454
Linda, you there?

435
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,084
I need a character reference.

436
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,506
Linda?

437
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,049
(doorknob rattles)

438
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,637
(footfalls departing)

439
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,770
(gasps)

440
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,022
Wha...?

441
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,233
Can you teleport?

442
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,194
(laughs)
What? No.

443
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,988
You left your window open.

444
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:54,783
Hey, are you okay?

445
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,119
Wait.

446
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,080
You know, don't you?

447
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,000
He showed you.

448
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,752
I saw his face.

449
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,214
Well, you're taking it
really well, actually.

450
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:14,344
Linda, you're not
afraid of <i>me,</i> are you?

451
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,096
Of course I am.

452
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,183
You're a demon.

453
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,522
He told me.

454
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,026
I thought it was
a sexual metaphor.

455
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,070
Well, you're not wrong there.

456
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,864
But you really are one.

457
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:37,659
Aren't you?

458
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,330
Yeah... I am.

459
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,043
Is that really so bad?

460
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:49,797
Please go.

461
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,719
(door creaks)

462
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,362
LUCIFER:
Ah, Detective...

463
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,280
CHLOE: Joe Fields
didn't kill my father.

464
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:16,657
- DAN: Wait, what?
- CHLOE: He's a fall guy.

465
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,534
He made a false confession
in exchange

466
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,202
for regular payments
to his daughter.

467
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,787
All these years
she didn't touch the money.

468
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,539
She probably thought
it was stolen.

469
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,374
I have the account number
that made the transfers.

470
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,751
Well, we just met a chap
who did the same thing.

471
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,044
What?

472
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,130
Rodney got paid
to make a false confession.

473
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:32,714
Money was transferred
into his wife's account

474
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,508
right after we
arrested him.

475
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,052
This is the same account
that paid Rodney Lam's wife.

476
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:38,595
CHLOE:
That's no coincidence.

477
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,098
So whoever killed Joe Fields
killed my father...

478
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:43,725
and is still out there.

479
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,187
Hey, don't blame yourself.

480
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:48,856
You were just a kid
back then.

481
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,357
Yeah, well, I'm not anymore.

482
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,822
(indistinct police
radio chatter)

483
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,532
COP:
Hey, rookie!

484
00:19:59,032 --> 00:19:59,867
You're late!

485
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:01,743
I thought I was early.

486
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,704
Your FTO's been looking
all over for you.

487
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,289
What, you want to get
written up your first day?

488
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,915
No, I-I honestly thought...

489
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,458
Knock it off, McMillan.

490
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,127
Get back to work.

491
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,087
You gotta watch out
for this guy.

492
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,339
He gave me hell
on my first day, too.

493
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

494
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,510
I'm Dan Espinoza.

495
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,637
- Chloe Decker.
- Nice to meet you.

496
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,097
Can I help you
with those?

497
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:23,891
Sure.

498
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,685
Come on, I'll
show you around.

499
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,854
The most important place, first,

500
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:29,855
is the kitchen.

501
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,815
We got bagels over here
if you want them.

502
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,901
Interrogation's
that way...

503
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:35,861
and the lab is thataway.

504
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,866
Are you John Decker's
daughter?

505
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,245
I-I'm so sorry.

506
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,539
He's kind of
a legend around here.

507
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,832
It was a little
before my time,

508
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,500
but he sounded like
a great guy.

509
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:52,586
The best.

510
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,424
Um... bagel?

511
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,810
(blowing faux fanfare)

512
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,021
Never fear,
Luci-Dan is here.

513
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,356
Or is it Douche-ifer?

514
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,066
Actually, it's got more
of a ring to it, hasn't it?

515
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,151
Why are you two
dressed the same?

516
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:17,527
Don't ask.

517
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:18,737
The bank account traces back

518
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,197
to a bathhouse on Pico.

519
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,658
It's a dummy front
for a Russian syndicate in L.A.

520
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:25,577
So the real killer is somehow
connected to the Russian mob?

521
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,162
We have a suspect.

522
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,289
His name is Boris Sokolov.
Owns the bathhouse.

523
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,250
Connects criminals
but keeps his own hands clean.

524
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,335
- DAN: No one has ever been
able to get to him.
- LUCIFER: Yet.

525
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,504
Detective Dan and I
won't rest until we get

526
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,130
to the bottom of this,
I promise you.

527
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:43,220
(sighs)

528
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,765
(American accent): Wow. Look who
bought a ticket to the gun show!

529
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,225
Divorce becomes you, Detective.

530
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,476
I do not sound like that.

531
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:50,727
Of course we do.

532
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,604
We sound like two
totally normal dudes.

533
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,314
Will you cut it
with the "we" stuff?

534
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:56,441
I need you to stop playing
around and take this seriously.

535
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:57,567
You got it, partner.

536
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:58,860
This is gonna be epic.

537
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,279
- Lucifer, I'm not kidding.
- (sighs)

538
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,072
(regular accent):
Very well.

539
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,365
So, what's the plan?

540
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,076
Well, you are exactly
the kind of person

541
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,370
that Boris would deal with,
so I need you to approach him,

542
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:09,913
- and try make a deal with him.
- All right.

543
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:12,291
Tell him I need a fall guy
for a murder I'm gonna commit?

544
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,292
- Exactly.
- Hmm.

545
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,209
But like I said before,

546
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,544
he spooks really easily.
So, don't go...

547
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:16,753
Boris!

548
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:18,755
Like that.

549
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,092
Hello there.

550
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:23,885
Uh, I'd like to talk with you,

551
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,137
if I may.

552
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:28,140
I don't know you.

553
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,057
You don't.

554
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,851
So, let's fix that, shall we?

555
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,102
The name's Dan.

556
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:33,645
♪♪

557
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,359
- Deputy Warden's here for you.
- Oh.

558
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,653
Joe Fields' personal effects.

559
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:43,947
We usually turn those over
to the next of kin

560
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,199
within 72 hours, but, uh...

561
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:47,784
I thought it might help you,
Detective.

562
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:48,994
Thank you.

563
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,916
This is great.
Thank you.

564
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,502
Well, if there's anything else
I can do to help,

565
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:58,545
please, let me know.

566
00:22:58,879 --> 00:22:59,838
(quietly):
Thanks.

567
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:09,556
I know.

568
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,600
Joe Fields isn't my case.

569
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:13,852
I'll just...
I'll leave it for Dan.

570
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:17,272
Well, I mean,
nothing is stopping <i>me</i> from

571
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,316
helping out
with the Joe Fields case,

572
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,902
While you tackle
your dad's, right?

573
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,154
I mean, if it's
the same killer...

574
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:25,489
divide and conquer.

575
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,074
You don't have to do that.

576
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,367
I kind of already started.

577
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,952
Uh, right over here. Thanks.

578
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,999
Last six months
of your dad's paperwork.

579
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,169
You know, incident reports,
booking slips, arrest records.

580
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,588
I mean, half of it's on
microfiche and, like, papyrus,

581
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,757
but I don't know, I thought it
would help, you know,

582
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,760
to figure out what your dad was
working on when he was killed.

583
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,220
See?

584
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,055
I knew you were a hugger.

585
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,434
So. What do you got so far?

586
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,186
It was a clever cover-up.

587
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:59,731
But what kind of robber
would be so well connected?

588
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,565
You know?

589
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,235
They gave Joe Fields
everything he needed

590
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:04,694
to pose as my father's killer.

591
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:05,862
I mean, he confessed.

592
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:08,198
And he had the gun
that was used in the shooting.

593
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:10,200
Ballistics confirmed
that it was the murder weapon.

594
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,953
Well, yeah.
No wonder it was case closed.

595
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,455
Yeah. I-I... These
prints are un-I.D.'d

596
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:16,623
from the scene,

597
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:18,166
but they could be the killer's.

598
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,793
And did they ping anyone
in the database?

599
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:21,211
No. Dead end.

600
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:22,838
All right.

601
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:24,506
Maybe I can dig a little deeper.

602
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,303
So, tell me.

603
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,098
Why would I help you two?

604
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,975
Because we're just
two regular fellows

605
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,351
who need your help, Boris.

606
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:37,769
I don't believe you.

607
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:39,229
Mr. Sokolov...

608
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,648
People call me
human lie detector

609
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,151
because I look
in my clients' eyes,

610
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,153
and I can know
if they're telling the truth.

611
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,113
Well, I respect that, Boris.

612
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,615
I have a trick myself,
that's quite similar, actually.

613
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,033
And you're right.

614
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,161
We haven't told you
the whole truth.

615
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,913
So, here goes.

616
00:24:58,832 --> 00:24:59,875
I want someone dead.

617
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:01,585
Who?

618
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,587
Lucifer Morningstar.

619
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:08,049
And what has this person
done to deserve death?

620
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,801
Well, he hurts people.

621
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,013
And not just his enemies,

622
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,140
those close to him, as well.

623
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,351
In fact, I think he hurts
them most of all.

624
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,230
He's right.

625
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,150
The guy's violent,
he's a total loose cannon.

626
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:28,153
Yes. Believe me,
when I say, Boris,

627
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,864
that the world would be
a better place without him.

628
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,701
You both have true hatred
for this man.

629
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:36,661
Apparently so.

630
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,789
Do we have a deal?

631
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,751
(sniffs)

632
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:43,793
(grunts)

633
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:50,008
Go and take care
of this Lucifer person.

634
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,844
I'll find you your patsy.

635
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:56,932
Lovely.

636
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,071
I hear you won't talk.

637
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,325
Okay.

638
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,995
We have hard evidence
linking your bank account

639
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:20,163
to two different murders.

640
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:21,540
What do you have
to say about that?

641
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,460
I heard you're a
human lie detector,

642
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:26,419
is that true?

643
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:29,756
(clears throat)

644
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,717
One of those murders
was my father.

645
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:34,761
It's why I'm not on the case

646
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,472
and it's why I'm not supposed to
be in this room talking to you.

647
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,849
But I'm not a cop
right now, Boris.

648
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,228
I'm a daughter.

649
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,523
(inhales)
And I'm not gonna let this go.

650
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:49,859
So, you point me in
the right direction...

651
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,946
or I swear to God, I'm gonna
make your life a living hell.

652
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,199
I believe you.

653
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:58,618
His name was John Decker.

654
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,540
I admit to nothing

655
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,626
but I did once hear

656
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:08,545
about a John Decker.

657
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,547
And as I recall,

658
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:14,259
he was sniffing somewhere
he didn't belong.

659
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,845
What do you mean?
My father was a beat cop

660
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,054
at a robbery gone wrong.

661
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,406
Hey, man.

662
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,451
I just want to say
nice work earlier.

663
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:40,910
- Was it?
- Yeah.

664
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:42,537
We got Boris.

665
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,415
And I don't know how
you lied to him like that.

666
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:46,791
Well, it's simple.
I didn't lie.

667
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,335
Well...
(sighs)

668
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,462
Well, then you have
some serious issues, bro.

669
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,546
Obviously. I mean,

670
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,298
why do you think I'm doing
all this Dan-ing?

671
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:54,549
(chuckles)
Yet,

672
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:56,217
you know, I'm still no closer

673
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,552
to figuring out your secret.

674
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:58,762
Because I don't have a secret.

675
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,305
Well, you must.

676
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,390
One that explains how
you're able to be so...

677
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,225
you know, frustratingly you.

678
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:05,518
- You see, man...
- Hmm?

679
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:06,770
I try to compliment
you, and...

680
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,229
(quietly):
Hey.

681
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,149
I think my father's death
was a hit.

682
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,485
I-It sounds like he stumbled
onto something huge,

683
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,070
and-and someone
took him out for it.

684
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,529
Chloe, do you want me
to help you with this?

685
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,990
No. I-I... I got it
on this end. But thank you.

686
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,452
Well.
(chuckles)

687
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:24,162
Where to now, Twinsy? Hmm?

688
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,125
♪♪

689
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,967
- Wow.
- (sighs)

690
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:39,260
What's the job this time?

691
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,762
Topless maids.

692
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,931
But apparently, I still
have to do some cleaning.

693
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:43,807
(scoffs)

694
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:45,975
Screw that.

695
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,520
- You okay?
- No. I just...

696
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,773
I can't find the right job.

697
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,318
My only friend
stopped talking to me.

698
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:56,653
"Only"?

699
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,530
(soft laughter)

700
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,574
What's all of this?

701
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,119
My dad's stuff from storage.
After he died,

702
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,579
the department boxed up his desk
and sent it to us.

703
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:07,831
You find anything?

704
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:09,874
Not yet.

705
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,961
One of the cases he assisted on
got him killed, and I have to

706
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,796
figure out which one
it is, but...

707
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,715
It's funny, he always talked
about how he didn't

708
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,216
want to be a detective,

709
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:21,177
how it was too much work,
and yet... here he was

710
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,138
doing all this detective work.

711
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,056
Guess the apple doesn't

Joe Fields.

849
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,082
Wha... why doesn't he fit?

850
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,417
Well, you said
that he smiled at you

851
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,293
when he was released.

852
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,336
Yeah, I forgot about that.

853
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,839
So, why would an
innocent man smile

854
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,175
at the daughter of a man
he took the fall for killing?

855
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:55,553
He wouldn't.

856
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:57,805
What are you looking for?

857
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:00,183
The prints that Ella found
on Fields' transport van.

858
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:01,768
But those only
gave us Rodney Lam.

859
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,144
But there were other prints.

860
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,396
But they cleared
as prison personnel.

861
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,482
Like Deputy Warden Perry Smith.

862
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,524
These are his prints.

863
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:09,692
What, you think
the warden did it?

864
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:12,987
Well, deputy wardens
are desk jockeys, bureaucrats.

865
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:14,530
So his prints shouldn't
have been there.

866
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:17,075
Yes. What if Fields
wasn't smiling at me?

867
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:19,702
<i>What if he was smiling
at the person next to me?</i>

868
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:20,828
<i>The warden?</i>

869
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:22,830
So you think that
Joe Fields and the warden

870
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,373
- had some kind of deal?
- Yes.

871
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:26,793
What, Fields serves
16 years as a fall guy

872
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:27,919
and then suddenly has
a change of heart?

873
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:30,963
Well, he had a grandkid.
Maybe he got sick of the deal,

874
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,173
told the warden he wanted out?

875
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,591
And the warden said yes,

876
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,551
but only as a ploy
to kill Fields.

877
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:36,552
Right.

00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,501
Good-bye!

892
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,962
I guess I'll just clean up.

893
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,298
I'm dressed for it, apparently.

894
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:16,300
(siren wailing)

895
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:20,346
(indistinct radio chatter)

896
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,057
It looks like
the cavalry's arrived.

897
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:24,392
Dan, what's happening?

898
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,978
I'm so sorry, Chloe.
The warden gave us the slip.

899
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:28,437
What?

900
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:38,698
LUCIFER:
<i>Are you okay, Detective?</i>

901
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,992
This whole time, my father's
killer's been out there.

902
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,035
And today I let him get away.

903
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:45,246
So, no, I feel like a failure.

904
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,665
What-- you are
nothing of the sort.

905
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,542
Detective,

906
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,128
for the first time
in 16 years,

907
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,463
you know who the real killer is.

908
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,425
It seems to me that
justice is in your sights.

909
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,218
You're right.

910
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,887
I put out a BOLO.

911
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:03,681
FBI and DHS are
looking at airports,

912
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,434
- border crossings.
- Well, I've still no
idea what that means,

913
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:07,268
but it sounds good.

914
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,061
It means I'm gonna get
the son of a bitch.

915
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,397
Right. Well...

916
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:14,650
in the meantime, since
your offspring's with Dan...

917
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:16,611
- What?
- I'm simply suggesting

918
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:18,779
that you open a bottle
of wine, or three,

919
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:22,200
- for yourself, and
just have a nice...
- (muffled grunting)

920
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,127
- (man groans loudly)
- Shut up!

921
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:34,128
(coughing)

922
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:36,380
LUCIFER (laughing):
Well...

923
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:38,633
Bravo, Maze.

924
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:42,595
How did you get...

925
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:43,971
I was bored.

926
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,640
Had nothing to do.

927
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:50,102
So, I tracked down
the scumbag myself.

928
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:52,563
It just... felt right.

929
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:00,363
It's gonna feel good
to call this in.

930
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:01,697
LUCIFER:
What? No, hold on, Detective.

931
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:02,907
You have a choice
to make here.

932
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:04,242
Yes.

933
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,285
So much punishment.

934
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:08,162
Mm. Order
off-menu for once.

935
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:09,872
Maze and I certainly
won't judge.

936
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:17,922
You took my father away.

937
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:22,510
(crying):
You tore apart my family.

938
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,638
(tape rips, groans)

939
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:28,391
(chuckles)

940
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:31,894
I tried to get him to drop it.
But he wouldn't take the hint.

941
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:34,814
That's all you have to say?

942
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:36,732
After everything you've done?

943
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,568
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I-I'm sorry.

944
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:41,529
I'll give you all the players
in my operation.

945
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:42,989
I'll give you money.

946
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,035
(shuddered breathing)

947
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:54,792
Oh.

948
00:38:57,628 --> 00:39:00,006
We'll see how you do
in the prison that you ran.

949
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:05,594
I'll bet your inmates
will treat you real nice.

950
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:09,849
No. No, please, please.

951
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:11,684
I can get you
whatever you want.

952
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:16,188
All I want is for you to know
that John Decker's kid got you.

953
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:27,241
(knocks on door)

954
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:28,868
MAZE (through door):
Linda.

955
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,246
I know you're in there.

956
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,666
I have something to show you.

957
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,505
My first check.

958
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:44,342
I got paid.

959
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,177
As a bounty hunter!

960
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:49,055
LAPD paid me this finder's fee

961
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:51,390
to track down
some human scumbag.

962
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,226
Hunting humans is a job.

963
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:55,936
Who knew?

964
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:05,154
First thing I wanted to do
was to celebrate with my friend.

965
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:08,949
That's you, Linda.

966
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:36,435
Okay.

967
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:38,729
I just...

968
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,482
wanted you to know.

969
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,159
(door unlocks)

970
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,958
Maze, how can we be friends?

971
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:02,086
You're a...

972
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:04,296
you're a demon.

973
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,675
Lucifer's the Devil.

974
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,720
How am I supposed
to get over that?

975
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,933
He's still the same old Lucifer.

976
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:18,644
You're still
Dr. Linda Martin.

977
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:20,563
And I'm still Maze.

978
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,481
What's changed?

979
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:26,986
Come on.

980
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:32,032
Let Mazikeen Smith
buy you a drink.

981
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:33,826
(chuckles)

982
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,830
Maybe I'll devour your soul
or something.

00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:55,973
- Mmm. Yummy.
- Lucif...

988
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:58,184
Mmm. Why should
the child go first?

989
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,644
I'm far larger.
And hungrier.

990
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:03,689
It's okay, Mommy.
He must've really wanted it.

991
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:04,815
(Lucifer scoffs, Chloe giggles)

992
00:42:05,316 --> 00:42:06,150
Is she always so...

993
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:07,610
her?

994
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:08,819
Baby, it's time to get dressed.

995
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:11,030
(yells)

996
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,573
What are you doing?

997
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:13,532
(scoffs)

998
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:15,493
- Bye, Lucifer!
- Yes.

999
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:23,083
(exhales):
Yes.

1000
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,088
I don't care much for my dad.

1001
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:33,260
But... you clearly...
care about yours.

1002
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:36,055
Which is why you followed
in his footsteps, I suppose.

1003
00:42:36,764 --> 00:42:37,389
Hmm.

1004
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:38,807
(sighs)

1005
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:41,268
So, w-what I'm
trying to say is...

1006
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:45,356
I think he would
be proud of you.

1007
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:50,110
Oh. My apologies, Detective.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1008
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:51,904
No, no, it's...

1009
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:56,659
Wh... Then why are
you... crying?

1010
00:42:58,285 --> 00:42:59,370
(sighs)

1011
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:02,164
Just... Oh, just shut up.

1012
00:43:02,373 --> 00:43:03,290
