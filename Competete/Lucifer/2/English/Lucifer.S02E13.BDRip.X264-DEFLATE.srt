2
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:04,255
Uriel didn't just die.

3
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:05,507
<i>I killed him.</i>

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:07,884
Where's Uriel?

5
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:09,302
Oh.

6
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:11,513
You look really familiar.
Have we met?

7
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:14,099
35 years ago,Father asked
me to come down here

8
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:16,309
<i>to bless a couple who
was unable to have a child.</i>

9
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:17,852
MOM:
<i>God put her in Lucifer's path.</i>

10
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,312
Why are you so upset?

11
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:21,773
Because I just don't
know if it's real.

12
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:23,858
<i>Why is it that sometimes
I'm immortal,</i>

13
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,111
<i>and other times
I'm all too human?</i>

14
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:27,779
<i>Appears you make me vulnerable.</i>

15
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,365
What's in that package is
far more valuable than drugs.

00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:40,125
Freeze!

21
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:43,128
ELLA:
<i>We are talking designer poison, here.</i>

22
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:44,254
So, how do we get an antidote?

23
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:45,964
Well, that right there
is the tricky part.

24
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,216
<i>Designer poisons need
designer antidotes.</i>

25
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:49,259
LUCIFER:
Detective!

26
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,014
It won't stop.

27
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:03,606

00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,737
The bleeding stopped. You don't
have to drive like a maniac.

30
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,405
You've forgotten you've
been poisoned, Detective,

31
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:11,698
or has it already
reached your brain?

32
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:14,159
Maybe it's just a nosebleed.
I mean, I-I...

33
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,785
How could the professor
have injected me?

34
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:17,829
I didn't get one
of his flu shots.

35
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:19,039
What about when
you went after him?

36
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:20,582
Well, I don't know.

37
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,044
I tackled him to the ground,
we-we struggled for a bit,

38
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,796
and, God, I guess
if he injected me somehow,

39
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,465
it would have to be just...

40
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,968
- LUCIFER: Ugh.
- CHLOE: Oh, God.

41
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:34,304
Everything's gonna be fine
once we get to the hospital.

42
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:35,263
Okay?

43
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:39,017
We can't go to the hospital.

44
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:40,101
What?

45
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,436
Lucifer, going to the hospital

46
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,105
didn't help any
of the other victims.

47
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,858
The only thing that's
gonna save my life

48
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,401
is finding the antidote.

49
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,154
Otherwise, I'm...

50
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:55,158
All right. All right, very well.

51
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:58,703
(tires screech)

52
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,251
No judgments, guys, okay?

53
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,504
You said come right away,
so I came right away.

54
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:10,006
You're lucky I remembered
to put on pants...

55
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:12,175
eventually.
So, what's up?

56
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,010
- LUCIFER: Well, um...
- CHLOE: Well, we're worried

57
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:16,805
that someone else, um,
out there might be poisoned.

58
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:17,972
Oh, I doubt it.

59
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,517
I asked every hospital
in the area to report anything

60
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,477
even resembling a poisoning.

61
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:24,187
So far, haven't heard a peep.

62
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,898
Well, just to be sure,
let's, uh, let's go over

63
00:02:27,107 --> 00:02:28,691
what you found at
the professor's lab, okay?

64
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,818
Check it out.

65
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:31,152
(whispering):
Uh, Detective.

66
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:32,654
We should tell her.

67
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,364
(whispering):
No, we can't.

68
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,616
She'll freak out. It'll get
in the way of the investigation.

69
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:38,201
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

70
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,869
ELLA: Are you guys done
having your whisper fight?

71
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,957
Uh, just make out already
and get it over with. Yeesh.

72
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,376
So... I did find

73
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,002
this syringe on the scene.

74
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:51,548
It had a tiny bit of poison
left in it, so, yeah, in theory,

75
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:52,882
someone out there
may have been dosed.

76
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:55,552
- LUCIFER: Hmm.
- CHLOE: Okay, but the
other poisons

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,011
had corresponding
antidotes, yeah?

78
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,222
- ELLA: Mm-hmm.
- CHLOE: Did you find anything
to match this one?

79
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,431
I did.

80
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,854
Problem is, dude destroyed
whatever was inside.

81
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,064
Dick move, right?

82
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:09,732
I mean, that's why I'm glad no
one's reported to any hospitals,

83
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,484
'cause without the antidote,

84
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:13,695
ugh, they'd end up
just like the other victims.

85
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:16,656
You know, first
a bloody nose and then

86
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:19,367
- fainting spells,
followed by seizures...
- LUCIFER: We get the point.

87
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,120
...and then their guts
slowly start boiling,

88
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:23,746
like, literally boiling.

89
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,832
- It's so gross and nasty,
and 24 hours later...
- (exhales)

90
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,418
- ...bam, just like that,
dead as a doornail.
- LUCIFER: Got it. Thank you. Yes.

91
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,086
- You've painting quite
the picture, Miss Lopez.
- CHLOE: Right.

92
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:32,297
Yeah, let's go
over everything else

93
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,799
- from the professor's lab. Okay?
- LUCIFER: Mm.

94
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:36,092
Just to see if we've
missed anything.

95
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,468
- CHLOE: Okay?
- ELLA: Sure.

96
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:42,807
Okay. So...
Here we go.

97
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,438
I got your text.
What's so urgent?

98
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:50,648
Uh... this way.

99
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:52,025
Somewhere we can
speak in private.

100
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,409
(grunts)

101
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,370
Was this part
of Father's plan?

102
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:05,580
Hmm?

103
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:06,581
Answer me, brother,

104
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,750
before I rip your spine out
and beat you to death with it.

105
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,001
What are you talking about?

106
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,544
How long...

107
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,631
how long have you
been manipulating me?

108
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,174
Mom told you about Chloe?

109
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,634
Oh, that she did.

110
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,678
And that you put
the detective in my path.

111
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,472
No, I didn't.

112
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,307
Father did.

113
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,936
I was just another pawn
in His game.

114
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:29,187
I had no idea.

115
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:30,647
And the detective?

116
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:34,317
Is she simply another pawn
as well or is she...

117
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:36,986
Is she?

118
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,947
She doesn't know anything.

119
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,291
Listen.

120
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,961
Luci, we've been
played like puppets.

121
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,880
Father has manipulated us both.

122
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,800
Don't you dare
compare our situations.

123
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:04,305
All that I have ever wanted
to do for all of my existence

124
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:05,807
was make Father proud.

125
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:09,644
I thought I was doing
great works in His name.

126
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,855
Instead, the very first
of His angels

127
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,441
was busy making you
a little girlfriend.

128
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,861
Oh. Well, my heart
bleeds for you.

129
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,655
We're on the same side here,
brother.

130
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:21,739
Are we?

131
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,994
Then be honest with me, brother.

132
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,246
How deep does
Father's plan go?

133
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:31,207
Is the detective's poisoning
part of it?

134
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:32,792
Poisoning?

135
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:35,795
I don't know
what you're talking about.

136
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:38,381
You really don't know?

137
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:39,549
No.

138
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,592
Then you...

139
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:45,638
...you can't help her.

140
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:48,808
(sighs)

141
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:51,602
I'm sorry.

142
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,230
(door opens)

143
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:57,275
There you are. I've been looking
all over for you.

144
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,027
Amenadiel.

145
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,445
Give us a minute.

146
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,239
I... have an idea.
I need to talk to you.

147
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:09,245
Okay, so the professor's
been using this Burt guy

148
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:11,122
(whispering):
to smuggle in the poisons.

149
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,123
What, so you think that Burt

150
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:13,416
might have smuggled
the antidotes as well?

151
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,251
- CHLOE: Yes.
- LUCIFER: All right.

152
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,461
Point me to his prison cell.

153
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,796
Perhaps some toilet wine
waterboarding or...

154
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,340
(whispering):
Well, he's already out on bail,

155
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,133
but the good news is,
he does have an ankle bracelet

156
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:23,301
so he can't get far.

157

Weren't you at that beach party?

Yeah. Yeah, I wa...
I-I'm stalking you.

Unfortunately, yes, but he
did provide me with a lead.

What about it?

356
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,149
We need to know the amounts

357
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,651
of each ingredient he used.

358
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,985
If we get it wrong,
it could be lethal.

359
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,112
The professor kept the
formula all to himself.

360
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,989
He liked to
brag about

361
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,116
how the only place it
existed was in his head.

362
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,701
You'd... you'd have to ask him.

363
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,078
Yeah, well, we can't do that.

364
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,371
He's dead.

365
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,248
Oh.

366
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,250
Um...

367
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,377
you still want
the painting though, right?

368
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:38,754
Uh...

369
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:49,974
Amenadiel told me
about your detective.

370
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,102
I'm sorry, son.

371
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,229
(scoffs)

372
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,940
I can't even
go in there.

373
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,486
I'd have to tell her how
monumentally screwed she is.

374
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,572
(laughs)
Or... or lie.

375
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:07,449
And we both know
I can't do that.

376
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,369
Well, if it's
any consolation,

377
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:11,579
you of all people
should know

378
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,373
that the man that did this
is right where he belongs:

379
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,292
suffering in Hell.

380
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,129
You're right.
That... that's it.

381
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,590
Well, I'm glad I was
able to comfort you.

382
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,008
No, no, Mum,
you figured it out.

383
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,551
How I'm gonna
save the detective.

384
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,845
Um, I'm not sure
I understand.

385
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,306
I'm gonna pop down to Hell and
have a chat with the professor.

386
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,974
What? How?

387
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,350
Well, it's simple.
(chuckles)

388
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,396
- All I need to do is die.
- (Mom gasps)

389
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,278
The plan is simple:

390
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,988
you kill me, I
go down to Hell,

391
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,531
interrogate
the professor,

392
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,366
get the formula
and then you bring me back.

393
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,411
Well, come on! Who's in?

394
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,164
This is a terrible idea.
I absolutely forbid it.

395
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,458
MAZE: I hate to agree
with Her Highness,

396
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,626
but she's right.

397
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,002
You'd be on your own.

398
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,128
We both know

399
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:02,630
I can't go down with you.

400
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,632
Well, I went down and
came back once before,

401
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,507
it wasn't a problem.

402
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,384
That's because Father
brought you back.

403
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,637
MAZE: And you didn't
go through any of the doors.

404
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,389
Once you do,
you could be trapped... forever.

405
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:13,891
Well, that won't
happen, will it?

406
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,809
I'm the Lord of Hell,
for crying out loud.

407
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,519
You <i>were</i> the Lord of Hell.

408
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,812
You've been away

409
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,356
quite a long time.

410
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,274
You can't be certain
that this will work.

411
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:23,192
(scoffs)

412
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,944
(chuckles, sighs)

413
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:26,737
What do you think?

414
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,532
I think...

415
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:35,537
that I followed
about half of that.

416
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,834
Do you guys do this a lot?

417
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:44,213
Like, celestial
planning sessions?

418
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,173
AMENADIEL: Oh,
apparently not. Otherwise,

419
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:48,008
we would have had a meeting
about carelessly revealing

420
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,385
our true nature
to a human.

421
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:50,594
- LUCIFER: Oh...
- AMENADIEL: Which...

422
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,472
she has apparently known about
for a while and kept from me.

423
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:54,932
Yeah, well,
turnabout's fair play.

424
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,933
Hmm.

425
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,559
LINDA: Okay,
wrapping my brain

426
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:58,769
around this...

427
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,437
Lucifer, what makes you so sure

428
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,355
you'd go to Hell?

429
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:02,523
In case you've
missed it, doctor,

430
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,983
I've been banned from Heaven.

431
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,275
There's nowhere else
for me to go.

432
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,569
And you're sure there's
no other way to get there?

433
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,988
I mean--
(scoffs)

434
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,322
I mean, dying?

435
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,241
Well, if anyone
has a better suggestion,

436
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,784
by all means,
speak up now.

437
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:15,536
Quite frankly,
I'd prefer to Uber there.

438
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,287
But...

439
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,332
look, I am doing this
with or without you.

440
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,834
Well, I'm sorry.

441
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,671
Having spent millennia
in that terrible place,

442
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,007
I can't be part
of you going back.

443
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,717
Not even
for a moment.

444
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:31,468
Fine.

445
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,304
(sighs)
Amenadiel?

446
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:36,807
Are you coming?

447
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,644
No, Mom, I'm gonna help.

448
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,106
Chloe, she doesn't deserve this.

449
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,733
MAZE: This is
the craziest plan

450
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:46,942
I've ever heard.

451
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:49,111
I'm in.

452
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,614
Doctor, surely you
have some sensible advice.

453
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,158
Um, he's the Devil.

454
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,618
Nothing's really been sensible

455
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,037
since I found that out.

456
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,457
I will not help you
get trapped down there.

457
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,626
Not for some
insignificant human's life.

458
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,879
(footfalls receding)

459
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:08,839
LUCIFER:
Okay.

460
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,550
Now that party pooper's gone,
let's get started, shall we?

461
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:12,885
So, um,

462
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,472
what's my part in all of this?

463
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,682
Well, you went to medical
school, correct?

464
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,769
Many... many, many, many
years ago.

465
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,354
Good. So you'll be the one
bringing me back from the dead.

466
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,274
Okay, who wants
to kill me?

467
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:30,444
(scoffs)

468
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,200
LUCIFER: Ah, Daniel,
there you are. Have you gathered

469
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,659
the ingredients
for the antidote yet?

470
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,245
What? No, I've just been
spending time with Chloe.

471
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:43,165
Besides, those ingredients are
useless without the formula.

472
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,374
Well, you might
want to hop on it,

473
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,751
because I'm about
to get the formula.

474
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,252
What? How?

475
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,796
Fairly certain
you don't want to know.

476
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,590
Well, you--
you do what you have to.

477
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,342
Ella and I will
get those ingredients.

478
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,301
Right.

479
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:06,939
LINDA:
<i>This is crazy.</i>

480
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,023
I can't do this.

481
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,024
Yeah,
and neither can I.

482
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,235
These scrubs
are so boxy.

483
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:12,861
Even I can't
pull 'em off.

484
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,573
Scratch that.

485
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,450
I can pull off
anything.

486
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,952
Yes, you're right.
We can do this.

487
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,161
We can do this, right?

488
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:22,579
We have to.

489
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,665
- MAZE: Chloe's life depends on it.
- LINDA: This is it.

490
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,917
This is the room
directly below Chloe's.

491
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:29,128
LUCIFER:
<i>Make sure no one</i>

492
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,420
moves the detective.

493
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:31,588
I'll be in the
room below,

494
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,465
but she needs to remain
in there for this to work.

495
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,384
Because being close to her
makes you vulnerable.

496
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,511
Well, killable, in
this case, but yes.

497
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,930
So I keep her here
until you're dead?

498
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,391
No, no, no.
The entire time.

499
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,851
Even after you've
already been killed?

500
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,894
Well, who knows what happens
if I become invulnerable

501
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,062
when I'm already dead.

502
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:48,230
There's a good chance

503
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,606
the doctor won't be able
to revive me.

504
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,525
And we don't want me
to stay dead, do we?

505
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,652
That was a rhetorical question.

506
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:54,736
- Right.
- Right.

507
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,071
And you trust
me with this?

508
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:57,990
Brother,

509
00:19:58,574 --> 00:19:59,324
you're the most
stubborn,

510
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,868
bullheaded person I know.

511
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,870
If anyone can prevent
the detective

512
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,288
from being moved, it's you.

513
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:06,540
Luci?

514
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,959
What? What?

515
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:10,752
Good luck.

516
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:11,879
Don't worry,
brother.

517
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,464
It feels like a good day to die.

518
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:22,556
♪♪

519
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:24,474
DAN:
Ella?

520
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,602
You got a package
from CDC.

521
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,270
How many more ingredients
do we need?

522
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,355
Well, based off the list
from that middleman dude,

523
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:31,815
we've gathered all but one:

524
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,442
a chemical called ZX3.

525
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,360
Super rare, super illegal.

526
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:36,195
How rare?

527
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,029
Let's put it this way:

528
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,198
all my legal contacts
are out of this stuff.

529
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,699
Wait, you have illegal contacts?

530
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,118
You don't? Whatever.

531
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:46,496
Some street racers secretly add
drops of ZX3 to their fuel

532
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:47,831
for a super shady
advantage.

533
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,832
How do you know that?

534
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,167
I used to steal cars.

535
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,086
It's not fun if you don't
drive 'em really, really fast.

536
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,005
Anyway,

537
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,966
I know where some black
market ZX3 is locked up:

538
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,676
a chop shop in NoHo.

539
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,304
Problem is, I'm not sure I can
get the owner to hand it over.

540
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:03,805
And we don't have time
for a warrant.

541
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,141
Well, desperate times...

542
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,392
Call for a little B&E.

543
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,894
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.

544
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:11,980
(monitor beeping)
Right, so one zap

545
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,857
of this doohickey
will stop my heart?

546
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:16,443
Uh, the defibrillator
wasn't made for that, but yes.

547
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,154
Not what I thought I'd
be doing with my day.

548
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:20,948
I'm gonna give you
60 seconds,

549
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,741
then restart your heart
to bring you back.

550
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,118
60 seconds? I've had orgasms
that last longer.

551
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,329
Time moves much slower
down there. Remember?

552
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,705
Yes, but we only get one shot
at this.

553
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,499
What if you yank me out
before I get the formula?

554
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,918
60 seconds is already cutting
it closer than I'd like.

555
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,045
The brain only lasts
three minutes after death.

556
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:36,672
- (sighs)
- Or so I read.

557
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,216
Just now.
Like, on the ride over.

558
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:41,593
Why am I doing this again?

559
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:42,678
Because you care about

560
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,680
saving the detective's life
almost as much as I do.

561
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:45,514
Now, come on!

562
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,557
I also care about
your life, Lucifer!

563
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:53,021
Okay, ice to slow your
brain cells from dying,

564
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,564
and painkillers to,
well, kill the pain.

565
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,358
Got it covered, thanks.

566
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:57,985
LINDA: Okay, Maze,
just like I showed you.

567
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,653
Yeah, got it.

568
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,738
(exhales)

569
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,326
- Okay.
- You ready?

570
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,458
- MAZE: I can't! You do it.
- LINDA: No, no, no, no.

571
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,377
No, the deal was you kill him,
I bring him back.

572
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,337
- MAZE: But you're the doctor!
- LINDA: And you're the
demon from Hell!

573
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:18,630
Goodness sake.

574
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,757
- (thump, then flatline)
- Whoa!

575
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,051
Oh, my God.

576
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,053
He's dead.

577
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,473
He's really dead.

578
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,365
(echoing footsteps)

579
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,002
Who are you?

580
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,462
I'm Amenadiel.

581
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,130
I'm Lucifer's brother.

582
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,800
He, uh, asked me to watch over
your mom.

583
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,178
Like a guardian angel?

584
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,512
(chuckles)

585
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,681
I like your necklace.

586
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,016
Thanks.

587
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,018
I, um, I like yours too.

588
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,648
A bad man did this
to my mommy.

589
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,236
Why are there bad people
in the world?

590
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,406
I really don't know.

591
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:30,744
There might be bad people in
the world, but you know what?

592
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:32,913
There's a lot more
good people in it.

593
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,122
Really?

594
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,165
Yeah.

595
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,751
Like all the good people
helping out your mom.

596
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,213
Like you?

597
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,006
Well, I'm, uh...

598
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,592
I'm trying to be good.

599
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,095
I think you're good.

600
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:58,563
♪♪

601
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,836
(softly):
Yes.

602
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,170
About bloody time.

603
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,555

Help!

- Hey, hey, man, I'm tra--
I think I'm stuck.

607
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:41,481
Hey, can you help me?
I think my arm's stuck.

608
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,482
Just take my...

609
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:43,442
What?!

610
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,609
Hey, man, I'm trapped!

611
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,403
You can't leave me here!

612
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:49,156
Hey! Help!

613
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,163
- MAN: Coward.
- CARLISLE: No.
- WOMAN: Killer.

614
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,497
- CARLISLE: No.
- WOMAN: Murderer.

615
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,374
- (crowd yelling indistinctly)
- WOMAN: Monster.
- CARLISLE: No...

616
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,876
- WOMAN: Killer.
- MAN: Coward!

617
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,211
- No, you don't understand.
- (crowd yelling louder)

618
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,838
I had no choice.

619
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,800
Leave me alone!

620
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,011
- CARLISLE: Please!
- MAN: Coward!

621
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,554
No!

622
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,723
Professor Jason Carlisle.

623
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:16,808
Remember me?

624
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,978
It keeps happening.
Over and over.

625
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,271
It's like I'm in Hell!

626
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,606
There's no "like"
about it.

627
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:25,650
What is this?

628
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,904
This is a torture
of your own making.

629
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,322
Fueled by guilt.

630
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,032
With a little bit of flair
thrown in for fun.

631
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,116
Please.

632
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,118
I need to get out of here.

633
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:36,244
How do I get out?

634
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,496
Well, it's quite simple,

635
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,164
you can't.

636
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,167
- CARLISLE: What?
- LUCIFER: Not until you no longer
believe you deserve it.

637
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,836
And I have never seen anyone
pull themselves out of here.

638
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,254
Oh, God, no, no, no.

639
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,465
- CARLISLE: No, no...
- LUCIFER: However,

640
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,926
perhaps making some
amends for your misdeeds

641
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:51,927
might do the trick.

642
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,053
Anything. Please.

643
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:54,596
How do I make amends?

644
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:58,099
Well, before you so rudely
ended your own life,

645
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,476
you poisoned a detective.

646
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:01,686
Someone who I care about
very much.

647
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:03,855
There's still time
to save her.

648
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,733
So, if you give me the formula
to her antidote,

649
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,236
perhaps your guilt
might be alleviated.

650
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:10,570
Yeah?

651
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:13,156
(panting)

652
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,325
Tick tock, Professor!

653
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,746
There.

654
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:20,789
The formula.

655
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,249
Does that make us good?

656
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:23,959
(soft chuckle)

657
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:26,503
You tell me.

658
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:32,050
(sighs)

659
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,468
I didn't think so.

660
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:37,389
No.

661
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:38,932
No, please!

662
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,225
No!

663
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,018
<i>No! No!</i>

664
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,199
Where's a resurrection
when you need one?

665
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,371
Could really use my flask
right about now.

666
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,042
(distorted piano playing)

667
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,724
(door creaks)

668
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,977
(eerie piano version of
"Killing Me Softly" playing)

669
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,778
(plays off-key note)

670
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,034
I never could play as
well as you, brother.

671
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,169
Uriel...

672
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:50,503
I...

673
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,005
I know.

674
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,049
It's a lot to take in,
isn't it?

675
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:55,967
I don't...

676
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,720
(laughs)

677
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,307
I-I don't understand,
Azrael's blade,

678
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,309
it should've destroyed you,
not sent you to Hell.

679
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,977
You don't deserve
to be here, brother.

680
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,312
You're right, I don't.

681
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,272
But you do.

682
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:13,443
(gasps)

683
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,488
You think it's
that easy to let go?

684
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,615
Think again, brother.

685
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:20,950
(knife unsheaths)

686
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,956
(Lucifer yells, Uriel grunts)

687
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,167
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, what's happening?

688
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:30,585
What's happening?

689
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:32,879
I need to save
the detective.

690
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:36,049
But you just can't
help yourself, can you?

691
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:38,176
(Lucifer whimpers,
knife unsheaths)

692
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,262
You have to believe me,

693
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:43,264
I didn't want this.

694
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:44,849
And yet...

695
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,187
(yells)

696
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,355
(flatline)

697
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,732
- MAZE: 60 seconds!
- LINDA: Clear!

698
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,735
(thump, flatline continues)

699
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,906
I thought you said
this would work, Linda!

700
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,324
Shh! Clear!

701
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,080
No, no, no!

702
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,498
What was I thinking?

703
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,835
This was always
a terrible idea.

704
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:18,591
You know, we are not
cat burglars.

705
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,009
We are totally
gonna get caught.

706
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:21,553
"Cat burglars"?

707
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,555
What are you,
an old-timey desperado?

708
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,640
I'm just saying we're a
little out of our element.

709
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:26,933
Speak for yourself.

710
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:28,643
Yeah, I noticed.

711
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,311
Where'd you learn to
pick a lock like that?

712
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,563
My grandma.

713
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:32,814
Wow.

714
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:34,399
And what exactly
are we looking for again?

715
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,151
MAN:
Hey!
(rifle cocks)

716
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,861
You picked the wrong
place to rob.

717
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,281
(yells)
I'm sorry.

718
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:43,783
I'm sorry, I can't
make it stop.

719
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:44,909
"It?"

720
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,162
As if you had
no part in it.

721
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,538
I don't! I didn't.

722
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:50,165
I-I don't want this!

723
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:51,249
Look at you.

724
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,625
So pitiful.

725
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,044
Stuck in the very Hell
you once ruled.

726
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,255
Trapped by
your own guilt.

727
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,299
And while we're pointing out
how lame you are,

728
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,926
you didn't even follow up on
that thing I told you.

729
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,513
What I whispered in
your ear before I died.

730
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,474
What?

731
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,684
<i>"The peace is here"?</i>

732
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,895
The peace is here.

733
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:14,689
I... I thought that
was just nonsense.

734
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:18,026
The... the final ramblings
of a dying brain. I...

735
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:22,322
Unless you're saying you found
peace in that moment, brother.

736
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,656
Oh, Luci, Luci, Luci.

737
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,325
You should know
better than that.

738
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,035
I'm all about patterns,

739
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:28,536
predicting the future.

740
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,580
My last words were a clue.

741
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:32,248
A clue? A clue to what?

742
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,125
Well, you're the one who has
to figure that out, aren't you?

743
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,293
After all,

744
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:36,836
I'm just in your head.

745
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:40,924
I'm just a manifestation of
your own guilty conscience.

746
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,510
- Speaking of...

- Ouch.
- (panting)

749
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:50,892
No.
(panting)

750
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,851
I hope you didn't leave any

751
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,270
- unfinished business
up on Earth...
- LUCIFER: What?

752
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,855
...'cause you're never
getting out of here.

753
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,235
(monitor alarm beeping rapidly)

754
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:04,864
- What's happening?
- (door opens)

755
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,033
Doctor just paged us.
She's in V-tach.

756
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,284
I don't know.

757
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,453
- NURSE 1: Let's go wait
outside, okay?
- NURSE 2: Crash cart's on its way.

758
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,330
It's okay, I'm gonna
stay with your mom.

759
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,499
Go with the nurse.

760
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,543
(nurses talking indistinctly)

761
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,714
DOCTOR:
Go ahead and turn her
on her side.

00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:23,758
Crash cart

763
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:26,177
NURSE 2:
She's seizing.

764
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,220
MAZE:
<i>This isn't right.</i>

765
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,138
- Something's wrong in Hell.
- (flatline)

766
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:30,390
What?

767
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,432
He's stuck.

768
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:32,642
Trapped in one of
those cells.

769
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,102
That's why we can't
revive him.

770
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,020
Okay, so then what do we
have to do to bust him out?

771
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:38,231
Someone needs to go down there
and pull him out.

772
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,400
I'd go, but I can't.

773
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:41,526
Why not?

774
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:43,486
Demons don't have a soul.

775
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:45,029
If I die,

776
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:46,781
I just... die.

777
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,284
Okay, that's definitely
a discussion topic

778
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,786
for another time, but right now,
every second counts.

779
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,955
And I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

780
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,083
- what if I go?
- MAZE: What?

781
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:59,711
You? What makes you think
you'd go to Hell and not Heaven?

782
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:01,337
There are things
you don't know about me.

783
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:03,715
- MAZE: No. No way.
- LINDA: But Maze...

784
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:04,841
MOM:
Send me.

785
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:06,509
MAZE:
Well.

786
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:08,219
Look who decided
to show up.

787
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:09,554
I'll go down and get him.

788
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,139
You said
you'd never go back.

789
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,266
Yes, I have a paralyzing
fear of the place.

790
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:15,518
But I would face a thousand
Hells to save my son.

791
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:17,228
Ever since I escaped,

792
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:19,689
Hell's been constantly
trying to pull me back.

793
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:22,567
It's only my resistance
that allows me

794
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:23,735
to fight its pull.

795
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,403
So, I just...

796
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,113
won't resist.

797
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:30,617
So, how do we do this?

798
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:31,701
It appears

799
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,411
that we need to attach
these little wires

Then why didn't you
just ask him for the ZX3?

'Cause after I moved out here

839

he totally ghosted me!

00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:00,159
ever since I returned,
I've been...

886
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:03,746
I've been manipulating you.

887
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,791
Stoking your anger
against your Father in hopes

888
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:10,044
of using you against Him.

889
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,589
But...

890
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,385
...but I've just
made things worse.

891
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:22,223
I pushed you and
that human closer,

892
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,851
knowing it
would crush you

893
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,103
when you learned the truth.

894
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,605
And now
look at us.

895
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:31,524
Stuck in this prison

896
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,526
while Chloe is dying.

897
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:36,737
Chloe.

898
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:40,199
No. I killed Uriel because
I had to. To save you.

899
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:41,868
To save the detective.

900
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:44,328
And I need to save her now.

901
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,581
Mum. Mum?
We need to leave.

902
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,001
Mum?

903
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:52,378
Why would we leave?

904
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,672
Uriel is right here.

905
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,300
We can stay.

906
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,510
Be a happy family.

907
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:02,889
I've missed you so much, Mother.

908
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:04,182
Mum?

909
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:06,058
Mum.

910
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:08,060
Mum!

911
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,563
Come on. You pulled
me out of my guilt,

912
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:12,356
there's no time to get
stuck in yours. Come on.

913
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:14,233
- LUCIFER: Come on!
- URIEL: Please, don't abandon me.

914
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:17,612
- URIEL: Not again. Please.
- LUCIFER: Mum. Mum.

Well.

Look who's back.

956
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:19,817
You didn't die
after all.

957
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:21,360
That makes one of us.

958
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:27,825
I heard you saved me.

959
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:29,827
Well...

960
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:31,537
much as I'd like to take
all the credit,

961
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:33,748
this one was a... a team effort.

962
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:40,004
You know, this whole
poisoning thing has just...

963
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:42,965
...really put a pause
on everything

964
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,593
that's been going on
with you and I, so...

965
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:49,180
should we just pick up
where we left off?

966
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,227
I think, right now,
you just need to focus

967
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,771
on feeling better, Detective.

968
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:00,399
Would you have someone
bring Trixie in?

969
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:01,984
Yes. Yes, of course.

970
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:03,736
And we'll talk.

971
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:05,821
We'll talk later, yeah?

972
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:15,414
(door opens)

973
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:17,375
(sighs)

974
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:23,881
MOM:
How is the detective?

975
00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:25,841
She'll be fine.

976
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:27,551
And...

977
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:29,595
what about the two of you?

978
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:30,805
(laughs)

979
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:32,598
Well, it was never real, was it?

980
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,725
Lucifer, I am so sorry.

981
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,727
Father brought her
into existence

982
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:38,229
just to put her in my path.

983
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:39,271
Yes.

984
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,315
The whole thing's
been a sham, Mum.

985
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:42,775
Long con.

986
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,610
And I fell for it.

987
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:46,278
You can't blame yourself.

988
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:50,241
This is all His doing. And
He should be punished for it.

989
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,284
Oh, make no mistake,
I plan on that.

990
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:55,037
I mean, how can I trust
anything, anyone,

991
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,415
now that I know He might be
behind it all?

992
00:40:58,124 --> 00:40:59,041
Well, you can trust me.

993
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,209
Can I, Mum?

994
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:01,877
- MOM: Yeah.
- LUCIFER: You're as bad as He is.

995
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:03,462
Worse, maybe.

996
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:05,881
At least He doesn't
pretend to love me.

997
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,174
Lucifer.

998
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:09,176
I <i>do</i> love you.

999
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:10,469
(laughs)

1000
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:12,304
I went back to Hell for you.

1001
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:14,598
I helped save the
detective, for you.

1002
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:16,517
Doesn't that count for anything?

1003
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,936
It's too little too late,
Mother.

1004
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:23,566
You set out to break
my heart. Well...

1005
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,276
mission accomplished.

1006
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:27,069
- MOM: Lucifer...
- LUCIFER: No.

1007

No more manipulations.

1008
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:34,743
This feud that you have
with Father, I refuse

1009
