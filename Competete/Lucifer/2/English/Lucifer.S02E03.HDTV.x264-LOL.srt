1
00:00:00,414 --> 00:00:03,957
- Previously on Lucifer...
- Someone's escaped from Hell.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,815
- Who escaped Hell?
- Mom.

3
00:00:05,816 --> 00:00:07,072
If she's not coming to kill me,

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,953
then I don't know what she's doing.

5
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:10,459
Aren't you glad to see me?

6
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:12,161
I apologize for my human form.

7
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,245
Chloe, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:15,164
You don't get to be sorry.

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,077
I've been demoted.

10
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:17,833
I'm reassigned to assist on cases.

11
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:19,813
I need to figure out
where I fit in in this world.

12
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:21,003
I need some space.

13
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,005
Things have been
very trying for me.

14
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:24,368
 Lucifer made a deal with

15
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:25,702
your ex to take you back to Hell.

16
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,309
And he doesn't break deals.

17
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:29,011
I want what your father took from me.

18
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,262
All right, you can stay,

19
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,715
just until I figure out what I need to do.

20
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:41,023
I want to say I'm sorry...

21
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:43,275
for all my sins.

22
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:47,162
For anything I have ever
done that hurt people.

23
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:50,783
I was stupid.

24
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,786
And I am sorry.

25
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:56,922
I am so sorry.

26
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:04,713
All I want now is forgiveness.

27
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:10,102
I just want to take it all back.

28
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,236
Please.

29
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,023
No! Just let me take it back!

30
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:17,142
No, no, no, no! No...!

31
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:27,036
There's no need for squeals.

32
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:29,371
We'll stop this torture any time you like.

33
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:31,407
Just say the word.

34
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,375
Don't you dare stop.

35
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:38,664
What happens if he stops?

36
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:40,416
Well, Lucifer, don't be shy.

37
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:41,884
Introduce me to your friend.

38
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:43,836
Lucifer, you brought a surprise.

39
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:46,088
I most certainly did
not bring any surprises.

40
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,389
Oh, she's beautiful.

41
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:48,474
That's my mum

42
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,808
you're talking about.

43
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:55,431
This just got too weird.

44
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:03,439
Listen, Mum, I know I chose

45
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,858
not to return you to Hell, yet...

46
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,471
- Which I appreciate.
- But that doesn't mean

47
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:10,496
you can just waltz in
here and accost my guests.

48
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,580
I apologize.

49
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:14,199
It's just that all these human rules

50
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,086
and customs are so confusing.

51
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:19,955
Remember, I'm still getting
used to this earthly skin sack.

52
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,757
Yes, yes, you used to be a goddess.

53
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,676
I know, but things are different now.

54
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,044
And I will figure it out.

55
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:27,262
Now that we're together again,

56
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:28,881
I just want to be part of your lives.

57
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:30,599
Not this part!

58
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:33,218
Out of bounds.

59
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:37,690
Wait. What do you mean by "lives"?

60
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,392
I want to see Amenadiel.

61
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,778
What?

62
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:44,697
It's time.

63
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,282
I am not going to live

64
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:49,284
in fear of my own son.

65
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,036
We may have had our differences...

66
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:52,955
He literally carried you to Hell.

67
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,289
But I created him.

68
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:56,375
Certainly that has to
count for something.

69
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,976
It doesn't. Bummer, right?

70
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,222
One look at you, and he'll take you

71
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,496
right back where you came from.

72
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:03,549
I'm surprised he hasn't come
sniffing around already.

73
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,168
Well, what am I supposed to do,
just sit here and hide?

74
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,253
See a movie, go to a museum.

75
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:11,056
Catch up on what's happened over
the past few thousand years.

76
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,100
You'd be surprised.

77
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:13,954
Yes. I suppose a lot has changed.

78
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:15,288
I mean, who would've predicted you would've

79
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,179
taken on this human job?

80
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,932
I'm a punisher, Mother.
It's what I've always done.

81
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:22,151
The only thing that changed was the locale.

82
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:31,243
I know what you're thinking,

83
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,445
but I was assisting on a
stakeout that went long,

84
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,614
and I'm really sorry, but I promise you,

85
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,416
I will make it up to you, okay?

86
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,002
How?

87
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:45,090
Double fudge, your favorite.

88
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,927
You're lucky I like you.

89
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,349
Hey.

90
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:55,851
Hey.

91
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:57,970
Thank you for letting me
do the pickup here at work.

92
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,556
I've just been running around
a lot since the demotion.

93
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,057
You know, helping out

94
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,225
on everyone else's cases.

95
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,027
Yeah. It's fine, it's fine.

96
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:07,446
Are we still going on
our family camping trip?

97
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,781
Oh, uh...

98
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:12,568
We're still ler... working
out the logistics of that.

99
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,703
Of the trip.

100
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,825
Look, I know that
you're still mad at me.

101
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,794
I deserve it.

102
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,963
But this stuff between us is
starting to affect Trixie.

103
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,416
So I think that we need to talk later.

104
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,303
Yeah, yeah. We should.

105
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,421
You're right.

106
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:33,672
Uh, Decker.

107
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:36,475
Okay, yeah. Two seconds.

108
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,665
I was stupid.

109
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,515
And I'm sorry.

110
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,769
Victim's name was Nicholas Sands, 35.

111
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:50,856
Worked as an exec at the
Internet startup called Wobble.

112
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,708
Wobble?

113
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:54,910
Please tell me that's a
pornography site.

114
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:57,746
Oh, no, no. Wobble's like a
next gen Facebook, you know?

115
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:00,032
People post updates, photos, links.

116
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,895
Mine's mostly slo-mo videos
of me doing cannonballs

117
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,337
onto inflatable pool toys.
You should check it out.

118
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,589
I'll pass, but thank you.

119
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,591
Nick's confession was
posted to his Wobble account

120
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:11,043
six hours ago,
right around the time of death.

121
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:14,880
Which means whoever did this
wanted us to find that video.

122
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,599
So we could see how weepy
this chap was before he died.

123
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,585
Now, that is cruel.

124
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,887
Ella, do we know how the fire started?

125
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:23,689
Any chemicals we can trace?

126
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,225
So far, all we've got is paraffin oil.

127
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:29,111
Which is highly flammable,
but also, like, everywhere.

128
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:32,114
Even in crayons, so color at your own risk.

129
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:34,233
Doesn't help us narrow the suspects.

130
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:35,534
Yeah, but this might.

131
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,152
Okay, so based on the burn pattern,

132
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,321
which is pretty gnarly in this case,

133
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,823
it looks like the highest
concentration of accelerant

134
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:43,408
was placed, well...

135
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,877
here.

136
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:50,315
Goodness gracious,

137
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,516
great balls of fire.

138
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:52,946
- Lucifer.
- I mean, I've heard of hot pants,

139
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,314
but this really brings new meaning

140
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:56,233
- to the term "fire crotch," doesn't it?
- Lucifer.

141
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:57,422
Wait. I have more.

142
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,390
Smokey Bobinson.

143
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,758
Weekend at Burnie's.

144
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,810
His burning bush?

145
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,978
Oh. Very good.

146
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:04,980
That was actually me, by the way,

147
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:06,598
- so don't tell anyone.
- Hey, guys?

148
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,933
Dead body.

149
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:09,768
Can you please take this seriously?

150
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,404
I assure you, Detective,
I'm taking this very seriously.

151
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,739
Look at this.

152
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,241
Our killer was clearly
punishing his victim.

153
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:18,911
And?

154
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,829
And punishing is my job.

155
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:22,281
So if there's someone out there

156
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:24,416
stealing my jam, I need to find out who.

157
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:29,204
It's game bloody on.

158
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:35,398
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

159
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:44,341
Do not touch the charred crotch.

160
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:48,095
Is a sentence I never
thought I'd say out loud.

161
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,264
It's vicious work.

162
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:52,015
I mean, I reserve this kind of treatment

163
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:54,218
for the truly terrible in Hell.

164
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,019
Pedophiles, Nazis.

165
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:57,938
People who put their
seats back on a plane.

166
00:06:57,973 --> 00:07:01,775
Uh-huh. Seeing as the nature
of the crime is so specific,

167
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:04,278
we need to figure out
who had a personal grudge

168
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:07,364
- against the victim.
- Hmm.

169
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,735
Uh, by the way,
you've skipped a spot, there.

170
00:07:11,737 --> 00:07:13,370
Oh.

171
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:14,621
Yeah, it's not like you

172
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:17,040
to miss a step in the
clothing department.

173
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:18,603
Yes, well, I had to rush out this morning.

174
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:20,305
I've got an unexpected
houseguest I can't get rid of.

175
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,713
Oh, right. New lady friend
that you can't shake.

176
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,581
A rather old one, actually.

177
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:29,586
Yeah, I know how...
complicated exes can be.

178
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:31,171
What? She's not an ex.

179
00:07:31,223 --> 00:07:32,973
You should see this, Detective.

180
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:34,258
Thanks.

181
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,592
What is it?

182
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:38,345
E-mails from Nick's supervisor at Wobble.

183
00:07:38,397 --> 00:07:40,264
A woman by the name of Leila Simms.

184
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:41,409
Let me guess, something riveting

185
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,066
about the latest quarterly report?

186
00:07:43,102 --> 00:07:43,934
"How could you?

187
00:07:43,986 --> 00:07:45,569
"I should have known better.

188
00:07:45,604 --> 00:07:47,237
You won't get away with this."

189
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:49,740
"I'll burn you starting
with your man parts"?

190
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,609
No.

191
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:54,945
- Still, that's a pretty good lead.
- Yep.

192
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,118
Do not... touch...

193
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,253
the charred crotch.

194
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,960
And Nick was so... sweet and charming.

195
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:11,678
How could someone do such a thing?

196
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:13,630
So, Leila, you were his supervisor.

197
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:15,632
How well did you know him?

198
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:17,017
We dated briefly, a while ago.

199
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:18,218
Oh.

200
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,357
Would you say things sort of flamed out,

201
00:08:23,392 --> 00:08:24,808
or did they end in more of

202
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,059
a blaze of glory?

203
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,811
Lucifer. You're right, far too subtle.

204
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:29,813
Why did you torture the
poor young man to death?

205
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:32,032
Torture him?

206
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:34,868
Oh, God.

207
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:36,820
You think I had something
to do with this?

208
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:38,488
Well, we know about the angry e-mails.

209
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,957
I was pissed off.

210
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:42,492
He shared pictures of us together.

211
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:43,710
Mm, mid-coitus?

212
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:45,390
If so, we'll have to
confiscate those immediately.

213
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:46,880
No.

214
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:47,916
Just of us

215
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:48,967
at-at dinner.

216
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:50,500
But I'm his boss,

217
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:52,169
and inter-office romance
is frowned upon here.

218
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:53,387
Well, it hardly seems worthy

219
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:55,973
of lighting a man's johnson on fire.

220
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,226
Wait.

221
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:00,978
Is that how he died?

222
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:03,730
There's something you should see.

223
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:09,853
Ray, can you come in here, please?

224
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:13,023
Ray, I'm gonna need
you to pull up the video

225
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:15,108
of Tommy at the company retreat.

226
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,660
The video of Tommy?

227
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:18,278
Ray's head of our H.R.

228
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,080
Being protective is part of his job.

229
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,665
Do it, Ray.

230
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:26,036
Nick was a charmer, but
he had a tendency

231
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:28,088
to be a little harsh with interns.

232
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:30,374
Aka, he could be a real dick.

233
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:33,260
As you'll see.

234
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:40,217
Aah! Aah!

235
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,135
My balls! Get it off!

236
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:49,610
Come on, that is quite funny.

237
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:51,561
Nick posted the video
shortly after the retreat,

238
00:09:51,563 --> 00:09:53,864
and even though it was
quickly taken down,

239
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,065
everyone saw it.

240
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,901
Tommy was a laughingstock.

241
00:09:57,953 --> 00:09:59,403
He quit pretty soon after.

242
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:01,371
Certainly looks like motive.

243
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:03,790
Huh.

244
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,546
What can you tell me
about Nick Sand's death?

245
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,815
Just that the bastard
finally got what he deserved.

246
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,635
Okay. And why did he deserve it?

247
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,037
As soon as I took the job at Wobble,

248
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:18,972
Nick made it his personal mission

249
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:20,924
to make my life hell.

250
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,243
Sabotaging my work, terrorizing me,

251
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,462
making me the butt of all of his jokes.

252
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:27,848
Or the balls, in this case?

253
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:30,367
That stupid video was

254
00:10:30,402 --> 00:10:32,252
my breaking point.

255
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:35,188
Everyone saw it. Everyone laughed at me!

256
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,024
No one's laughing now, Tommy.

257
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:39,776
So after everything that happened, what,

258
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,312
you-you wanted to make him feel your pain?

259
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:44,381
He deserved what happened to him.

260
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,867
Yeah, but you're not
answering the question.

261
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:50,921
Did you kill Nick?

262
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:53,685
I understand
punishment all too well, Tommy,

263
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:57,260
and Nick deserved to be punished.

264
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,046
He did, didn't he?

265
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:01,076
Mm. He took your
dignity, and so you had to

266
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,466
take your revenge.

267
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:05,886
There was no other way to get
your proverbial balls back.

268
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:07,471
So tell me...

269
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:10,524
...did you desire...

270
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,892
I killed him.

271
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:14,227
Oh.

272
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,645
Well, that took

273
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:18,115
all the fun out of it.

274
00:11:19,902 --> 00:11:21,818
That did not go how I expected.

275
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,371
Oh, come now, Detective.
He obviously wanted people

276
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:26,039
to know that he got his revenge.

277
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:28,075
Now our would-be punisher's
brought to justice,

278
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,461
and the field is mine again...

279
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:34,081
What on earth is she doing here?

280
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,716
Charlotte Richards.

281
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:37,751
The defense attorney we saved, remember?

282
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:40,470
She must be back here
defending some scumbag.

283
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:43,590
But why are they all being so... chummy?

284
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:46,426
Well, she used to be a cop,
and, oh, yeah,

285
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:48,178
'cause she's a knockout.

286
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,430
Personally,
I'm surprised that you haven't tried...

287
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:52,599
Pardon me, pardon me. Excuse us.

288
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:55,752
Charlotte, hello. Do you mind
if we have a quick word?

289
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,540
What are you
doing here, Mother?

290
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:02,187
I thought we agreed you'd
do something constructive

291
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:04,594
with your time, like mall
walking or a studio tour,

292
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,012
perhaps, but...

293
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:07,931
How did you even find your way here?

294
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:09,549
Well, it wasn't difficult.

295
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:13,353
I simply smiled at a male
human and asked him to take me.

296
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,700
Need I remind you that Charlotte
Richards has a husband out there

297
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:17,641
who's wondering where she popped off to.

298
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,893
And you have a son who wants
to take you back to Hell.

299
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:21,956
So drawing attention to
yourself in a police station

300
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,365
in this little... getup, not a good idea.

301
00:12:25,401 --> 00:12:27,534
But I had to see it for myself.

302
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:30,036
My boy, working, toiling,

303
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:31,872
amidst humanity's muck.

304
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:33,657
Well, I hope it's everything
you imagined and more.

305
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,443
Now go see Cabaret.
I'm sure you'll find it riveting.

306
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:37,828
I just don't understand.

307
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:40,197
Of all the things that you
could do with your talents,

308
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:42,199
law enforcement?

309
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,501
Have you considered I might
enjoy exploring humanity?

310
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:47,838
They eat, darling.

311
00:12:47,873 --> 00:12:49,172
All they do is eat.

312
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,591
And then afterwards,
the food comes out changed

313
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:54,461
and not for the better.

314
00:12:56,215 --> 00:12:57,798
Detective.

315
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:00,217
I didn't realize

316
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:02,052
you and Charlotte knew each other so well.

317
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:05,472
Oh, we do and we don't.
It's a long story, really.

318
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:07,224
Right, shall we go somewhere

319
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:08,892
to, uh, celebrate solving the case?

320
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:10,694
No. Not yet.

321
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:12,562
Tommy was humiliated.

322
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:14,397
Makes sense why he'd want to kill Nick.

323
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,199
But something just doesn't sit right.

324
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:18,785
Detective, you, of all people,
should know how good it feels

325
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:20,620
to punish someone who's wronged you.

326
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:22,155
- How so?
- Oh, come now.

327
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:25,125
You may not be roasting
Dan's chestnuts... yet...

328
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,627
but a shoulder shrug here,
a dismissive look there

329
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:29,579
- could be just as effective.
- Okay, fine.

330
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:31,810
Maybe I've been a little hard on
Dan lately, but he deserves it.

331
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,416
And I'm sure you found it very satisfying.

332
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:34,417
But have you considered

333
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:35,719
for just one moment

334
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:39,422
how your fighting affects
those caught in the middle?

335
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:40,924
You mean Trixie?

336
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:42,592
What? No, I mean me.

337
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:44,394
Think how terribly bored I am by it all.

338
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:46,980
Ah, look, there he is. Now's your chance

339
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:49,566
to stop with your "will they,
won't they" nonsense.

340
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,517
It's not that simple.

341
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:51,518
I'm avoiding a difficult conversation.

342
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,652
Well, I...

343
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:54,771
Hi.

344
00:13:54,773 --> 00:13:56,323
There's something you got to see.

345
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:58,303
Another apology video dropped
along with another body.

346
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:00,494
I know it was wrong!

347
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,747
I shouldn't have posted that video!

348
00:14:03,782 --> 00:14:06,449
She didn't deserve to
be humiliated like that.

349
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:08,952
I'm sorry.

350
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:35,862
Two murders.

351
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:37,197
Same M.O.

352
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:39,649
But Tommy was already in custody
when this guy was killed.

353
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:41,318
There's no way he did this.

354
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,119
Tommy wanted his dignity back.

355
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:44,621
Whoever did this

356
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:47,340
clearly had a much
grander objective in mind.

357
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:49,486
Ladies and gentlemen,

358
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:51,457
it looks like we're
tracking a serial killer.

359
00:14:57,472 --> 00:14:59,439
Victim's Adam Wiser, 29,

360
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:01,557
worked as an assistant at a local bank.

361
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,169
Time of death was two hours ago,
but apparently he's been missing

362
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,445
for almost two days.

363
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,613
Ooh, that's a long time on a sex rack.

364
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:10,033
Not a record, but quite impressive.

365
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:11,651
Ella, we know the cause of death?

366
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,820
Well, he's got broken ribs,
a ruptured spleen

367
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:17,440
and possible cranial bleeding,
which would all totally suck.

368
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,292
And yet, this dude asphyxiated.

369
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:21,744
He was choked with an apple?

370
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,463
No.

371
00:15:23,498 --> 00:15:26,399
More like an orchard.

372
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:28,418
We're gonna have to cut
him open to get the rest.

373
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,719
That's messed up.

374
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:32,338
Certainly brings new meaning
to the term "deep throat."

375
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,840
Why not just kill the guy?

376
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,925
Why all the pomp and circumstance?

377
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,344
Well, our punisher's
clearly sending a message.

378
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,096
Perhaps if we find the
video that Apple Boy

379
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,932
is apologizing for,
we'll know what that message is.

380
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,234
- Hold this.
- What are you doing?

381
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,684
The original video was filmed
on Nick's phone, right?

382
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,322
What if Adam's doing the same thing?

383
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:01,701
Be careful, Detective.

384
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:03,119
Might be a booby trap.

385
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,931
The video's already cued up.

386
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:18,851
Look at this.

387
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,564
Notice anything familiar?

388
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:33,366
The ball gag's amaranth.

389
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:35,685
Just like the apple.

390
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,154
What, so our killer's paying
homage to a bloody sex tape?

391
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,623
He's recreating the
crimes he's punishing for.

392
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:42,492
First lighting Nick's groin
on fire, now this.

393
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,609
He's upping his game.

394
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:44,922
Yeah, but what's with the outfit?

395
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:46,986
I mean, other than giving
me super creepy flashbacks

396
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:49,749
to Catholic school, it doesn't add up.

397
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,918
And the woman is not
wearing one in the video.

398
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,138
She certainly looks too
old to be in school.

399
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:57,723
Unless she teaches at one.

400
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,231
Her name's Sarah Aiken, 27.

401
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:07,233
Third grade teacher. Cute.

402
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:09,986
Not hot, but extra
points for proclivities.

403
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,521
When she broke things off with Adam,

404
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,940
he uploaded his revenge porn to Wobble.

405
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,943
Some teachers caught wind of it,
and she was fired.

406
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,779
Well, maybe she took out both
Nick and our loathsome ex.

407
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:21,197
You know, no harm, no foul.

408
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,283
And no dice because she had
no connection to Nick.

409
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,703
And shortly after she lost
her job, she killed herself.

410
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,756
What, so our poor, sexy teacher's dead,

411
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,792
and our apple-chomping
schoolboy's responsible?

412
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,094
And the only other connection
we were able to find

413
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,880
is that both victims posted
their illicit videos to Wobble.

414
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,017
So, maybe some sicko saw both videos

415
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:43,302
- and decided to take action.
- "Sicko"?

416
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,855
Sounds to me like someone's
doing our job for us.

417
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,441
We don't exact vengeance, Lucifer.

418
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:49,942
Well, maybe we should.

419
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:51,060
As far as I'm concerned,

420
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,196
these little wankers got
exactly what they deserved.

421
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:54,280
See you later.

422
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:56,032
Hey, where are you going?

423
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:57,533
We have to find out who did this.

424
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:58,796
Well, I thought someone out there

425
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,703
was stealing my job,
but far be it for me

426
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,738
to stand in the way of excellent work.

427
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,157
I'm off for a drink.

428
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:11,080
No.

429
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,633
Honestly, I'm impressed.

430
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:16,135
It's hard going out on your own.

431
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:19,005
Changing old habits.

432
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,673
I admire the steps you're taking.

433
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:22,592
Well, don't admire too much.

434
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,477
I'm still coming to Lux.

435
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:26,395
Hmm, yes.

436
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,980
Baby steps are fine.

437
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,100
Plus, the view here is... nice.

438
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:37,273
The real key is to avoid setbacks.

439
00:18:39,277 --> 00:18:43,496
Setbacks that are tall,
blond and have a special place

440
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:44,614
in Hell? Mm.

441
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,781
Hi, Maze.

442
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:48,951
Hi, human.

443
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:53,923
I need to get rid of that bitch.

444
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,509
Now I know why you're still here.

445
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:59,095
Why?

446
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,014
You and Lucifer are very close.

447
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,518
It's normal that you be
jealous of a new girlfriend.

448
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:08,771
- I'm not jealous.
- Ah. Mm-hmm.

449
00:19:08,806 --> 00:19:11,057
And she's not his girlfriend.

450
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,276
She's just toxic.

451
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:15,144
Lucifer doesn't see it, but I do.

452
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,563
Oh, so you want to protect him?

453
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:20,233
I want her to get what she deserves.

454
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,868
Which, at the very
least, is a head-butt.

455
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:23,903
I'll be right back.

456
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:24,870
Okay, okay.

457
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:26,989
Okay, maybe...

458
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,991
we should start with our words.

459
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,544
Perhaps as Lucifer's friend,
you can talk to him.

460
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:33,913
Express how you feel.

461
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,715
He won't listen.

462
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,502
But maybe someone else will.

463
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:41,804
Where are you going?

464
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,589
Taking your advice.

465
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,224
Hey, Man Bun.

466
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,509
Take care of my friend.

467
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,681
Why do I even try?

468
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,267
Because you're an incredible woman.

469
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,068
Oh.

470
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:57,570
Thanks.

471
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,358
So, I reached out to Wobble
to cross-reference who saw

472
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,976
both Nick and Adam's videos.

473
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:06,195
- And?
- They lawyered up.

474
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,531
Hid behind privacy laws,
and without a warrant,

475
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,017
Wobble won't let us anywhere
near their viewership data.

476
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:15,121
Okay, pull the warrant,
and I'm on my way there.

477
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:18,291
No problem.

478
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,959
Dan.

479
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,344
Um...

480
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:23,129
So I've been thinking about the trip,

481
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,797
and, um...

482
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,183
I don't think it's fair to put Trixie

483
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:29,769
in the middle of our problems, you know?

484
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:31,804
So you want to skip it.

485
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,473
No, I want to spare
us all heartache and...

486
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:36,809
I just feel like if we go on the trip

487
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,894
and, you know, we
pretend everything's fine,

488
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,946
then we're just lying to her.

489
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:43,699
Yeah.

490
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:45,267
All right.

491
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,687
Excuse me.

492
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:17,934
Excuse me. Mom.

493
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:18,901
Oh.

494
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:20,344
What do you think you're doing?

495
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:22,104
I'm taking your lead, son.

496
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,654
Learning about your beloved humanity.

497
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:25,157
By dancing at my club?

498
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:26,220
Well, I saw all the people

499
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,411
on the tables smiling
and I wanted to discover

500
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:29,912
what they were so happy about.

501
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:33,416
Oh, is it possible it's
the money that I pay them?

502
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:35,084
It's possible.

503
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,703
But I have to admit that
when I started dancing,

504
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:41,207
rubbing up against the other humans,

505
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,353
I got a tingling sensation...

506
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:44,009
Okay, that's enough.

507
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:46,262
Excuse me, excuse me, thank you.

508
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:47,430
I don't understand.

509
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:48,992
I thought you'd be pleased by my effort.

510
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,933
Disturbed is more like it.

511
00:21:50,968 --> 00:21:53,686
Are you actually trying
to systematically disrupt

512
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:55,504
- every part of my life?
- No.

513
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,057
I'm trying to learn about
every part of your life.

514
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,442
Oh, right.

515
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:00,976
How's that going for you so far?

516
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,112
Well, quite illuminating, actually.

517
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:07,116
I understand now why you
have this provocative club.

518
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,734
I understand why you amused yourself

519
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,786
with that curvaceous savage.

520
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:12,705
But what I don't understand...

521
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,073
Is my human job. Yes, I know.

522
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,126
I'm a
civilian consultant.

523
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,879
But why do you still punish people?

524
00:22:19,914 --> 00:22:21,664
It's what I've always done.

525
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:22,915
That's not true.

526
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,501
That's who your father wanted you to be.

527
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,555
Are you still trying to win him over?

528
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,257
Careful, Mother.

529
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,224
Why?

530
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,393
Are you going to punish me?

531
00:22:51,886 --> 00:22:53,040
I'm sorry, Detective.

532
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:55,252
I looked into the two videos in question,

533
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:57,275
and unfortunately, there was no overlap.

534
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:58,598
Doesn't make any sense.

535
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:00,717
I'll need a list of
everyone who saw the videos.

536
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:03,887
Sadly, we don't track people,
just I.P. addresses.

537
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:07,140
Maybe I'm looking
at this the wrong way.

538
00:23:07,192 --> 00:23:09,977
Can you take me through how
your video process works?

539
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:12,646
Well, our users can
upload anything they want.

540
00:23:12,698 --> 00:23:14,658
And if we find that the
content's inappropriate...

541
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,784
uh, anything from animal
cruelty to beheadings...

542
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,369
it gets taken down.

543
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:20,704
By who?

544
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:22,155
Our content moderators.

545
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:23,457
Huh.

546
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:25,409
Most of them only last a few months.

547
00:23:25,411 --> 00:23:26,576
Frankly, most people

548
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:28,662
can't stomach something
so dark or upsetting.

549
00:23:28,714 --> 00:23:30,213
Right.

550
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:32,716
God, that has got to smart.

551
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:37,054
Can I see that again?

552
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,755
Lucifer?

553
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:40,724
Oh, Detective. You're here.

554
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,225
Did you know that this room

555
00:23:42,261 --> 00:23:44,094
collects all the best
parts of the Internet?

556
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:45,874
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, yeah.

557
00:23:45,898 --> 00:23:47,731
But you got to see this... a-a naked man

558
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:49,649
thinks he can jump on
the back of a rhino.

559
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:51,902
You'll never
guess what he lands on.

560
00:23:51,937 --> 00:23:54,187
Actually, you probably will.

561
00:23:54,223 --> 00:23:56,023
What? You've seen it already?

562
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:01,244
What are you doing here?

563
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,877
Trying to catch our killer.

564
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:04,660
- Duh.
- I thought you didn't care

565
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:06,529
whether this sicko was
brought to justice.

566
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:09,842
Oh, I don't. But then I realized
that our killer may have the answer

567
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:12,178
to a question that I'm,
you know, struggling with.

568
00:24:12,213 --> 00:24:13,212
Mm.

569
00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:14,714
Why does he punish?

570
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:15,932
That's it?

571
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:18,217
First you want to teach
this vigilante a lesson,

572
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:19,920
and now you want to
have a talk with him?

573
00:24:19,945 --> 00:24:22,533
Yes. And lucky for me, I found
out where you were headed.

574
00:24:22,557 --> 00:24:24,774
I mean,
these videos are enthralling.

575
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:26,253
No, I-I can't.
I can't watch these.

576
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:27,837
Oh, I've seen worse.

577
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:30,062
But never so many collected
in one single room.

578
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:32,198
You know, if I ever go back to Hell,

579
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:34,200
I am getting me one of these.

580
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:36,202
Selfish bastards get to see everything.

581
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:41,374
Yeah.

582
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,993
They do.

583
00:24:44,045 --> 00:24:45,878
I know where the overlap is.

584
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:26,702
Amenadiel, I know you're in there.

585
00:25:29,257 --> 00:25:31,040
Open up!

586
00:25:36,948 --> 00:25:38,881
Hey.

587
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,904
What are you hiding?

588
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:46,722
Nothing.

589
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:53,879
Oh.

590
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:58,901
I see what's going on with you.

591
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:02,538
- You do?
- Sure.

592
00:26:02,574 --> 00:26:05,524
Humans say that rebound sex
is important after a breakup.

593
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,444
You don't have to hide
that you're getting some.

594
00:26:09,964 --> 00:26:11,464
I'm not.

595
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:15,668
Right.

596
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,137
Of course. I didn't want
you to feel awkward.

597
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:20,056
Silly me.

598
00:26:25,096 --> 00:26:26,796
So what are you doing here?

599
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:30,483
I have a problem.

600
00:26:30,518 --> 00:26:31,651
I need your help.

601
00:26:31,686 --> 00:26:34,186
There's a new...

602
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:36,772
woman in Lucifer's life.

603
00:26:36,824 --> 00:26:39,358
I want her gone,
but he won't listen to me.

604
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,577
And why do you care? I thought you were

605
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:43,279
stepping away from both of us.

606
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:44,580
I am.

607
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:48,868
- But before I do, I need you...
- I'll talk to him.

608
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,286
Yeah.

609
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:55,708
Well, that was easy.

610
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,043
I'm his big brother, Maze.

611
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:59,629
I really should start looking
out for him more often.

612
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:03,466
Okay.

613
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:05,301
Thank you.

614
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:08,638
All right. Thanks.

615
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,189
Dan's working with Wobble to trace

616
00:27:10,224 --> 00:27:11,785
what moderator may
have pulled both videos.

617
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:13,120
Hopefully, we'll have an answer soon.

618
00:27:13,144 --> 00:27:14,744
Then why are you so sure the killer's

619
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:16,078
one of these misanthropes?

620
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:17,445
Well, serial killers

621
00:27:17,446 --> 00:27:19,093
usually start with someone they know.

622
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:20,866
If the killer worked here,
they knew Nick,

623
00:27:20,902 --> 00:27:22,416
saw how much the prank hurt Tommy.

624
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,125
So you think seeing
someone they recognized

625
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:26,816
in one of these twisted
videos finally made them snap?

626
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:29,236
Maybe it awakened something in them.

627
00:27:29,288 --> 00:27:32,539
Something that was always there,
just fighting to get out.

628
00:27:32,574 --> 00:27:35,325
But...

629
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:38,295
they were just trying to do a job.

630
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,829
Job no one else wanted.

631
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:41,915
Well, maybe they chose that for a reason.

632
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:45,085
No one chooses to be a
sin-eater, Detective.

633
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,388
No one wants to be custodian

634
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:51,224
of the world's filth. Why would they?

635
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,477
Absorbing the worst humanity has
to offer, day in and day out.

636
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:56,012
Changes you.

637
00:27:56,064 --> 00:27:57,681
So you think it's the job's fault

638
00:27:57,733 --> 00:27:58,853
that they started to punish?

639
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,100
People don't arrive broken.

640
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:03,103
They start with passion and yearning

641
00:28:03,155 --> 00:28:06,690
till something comes along that
disabuses them of those notions.

642
00:28:06,742 --> 00:28:08,642
Hmm.

643
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:13,196
Which means... that none
of these people did it.

644
00:28:13,248 --> 00:28:14,531
Okay. I'm not following.

645
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:16,116
Well, look at Tim there,

646
00:28:16,168 --> 00:28:19,002
with the photos of his ugly children.

647
00:28:19,037 --> 00:28:21,454
Ivan and his flowerpots.

648
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:23,373
Poor Andrea's still
hoping Destiny's Child

649
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:24,758
get back together.

650
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:25,759
Don't you see?

651
00:28:25,794 --> 00:28:28,511
These people still have hope.

652
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,015
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

653
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,634
- Who's had this job the longest?
- Um...

654
00:28:34,686 --> 00:28:35,885
maybe me.

655
00:28:35,887 --> 00:28:37,470
I've been at it two whole months.

656
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:39,189
- Huh.
- Oh. Anyone else?

657
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:40,390
No.

658
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:42,108
Other than Leila, of course.

659
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:44,527
- Leila, your boss?
- Yeah. She started as a moderator

660
00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:46,529
before the company blew up.

661
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:48,281
She was the first of us.

662
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:49,399
Thanks.

663
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:52,902
Leila knew Nick,
she had access to the videos.

664
00:28:52,904 --> 00:28:54,321
If she's behind this...

665
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:57,874
She's known what we've been
doing every step of the way.

666
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:00,744
Dan, I need you to see if
you can trace the videos

667
00:29:00,746 --> 00:29:03,496
to one person in particular now.

668
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:06,182
We're looking at Leila Simms.

669
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:13,673
I can't believe we had the
killer right under our nose.

670
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:16,843
And she's gone.

671
00:29:16,895 --> 00:29:19,857
Touché, Leila. Touché.

672
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:30,142
Luci?

673
00:29:30,892 --> 00:29:33,344
Luci, you home?

674
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,962
He's not here.

675
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,797
He left in quite the hurry before.

676
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:47,768
Think it was something I said.

677
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,459
I'm sorry. Are you his latest, uh...?

678
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:55,108
Trust me, I'm not his latest anything.

679
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:56,893
All right.

680
00:29:56,946 --> 00:29:59,062
So, what are you doing here, then?

681
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:00,781
I'm having a bit of

682
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:03,800
an existential crisis, I suppose.

683
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:06,486
I've been known to be a good listener.

684
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,739
Okay.

685
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,407
Uh...

686
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:12,659
I'm having some trouble with my kids.

687
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:14,795
Needed to get away from
them for a little bit?

688
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,414
No, the opposite, actually.

689
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,132
I'm trying to get closer to them,

690
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:21,501
but I'm not having much luck.

691
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:26,173
Tell me.

692
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:28,025
Are you a good son?

693
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,345
I try to be.

694
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:34,047
Well, then perhaps you can explain.

695
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,233
Would a good son

696
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:40,320
blindly take his father's
side in a divorce?

697
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,156
Would a good son

698
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:45,692
send his mother to Hell?

699
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:48,779
And would a good son

700
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:51,999
stand here right before me,

701
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:56,219
without a care in the world,
plotting to send me back?

702
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,674
Mom?

703
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:06,213
I thought I would come to
Earth to be with my sons.

704
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:10,183
Instead, Lucifer is obsessed
with his human job,

705
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:12,069
and you're still your
father's loyal soldier.

706
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:16,306
I'm tired of fighting for things
that I'm never gonna have.

707
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:19,559
So just take me back, Amenadiel.

708
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,561
I'm ready.

709
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,121
No matter what happens,

710
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:35,292
I will always... love you.

711
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,910
Always.

712
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:42,215
Leila took down both videos,

713
00:31:42,251 --> 00:31:43,834
killed Nick and Adam, and then led us

714
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:45,836
by the nose until she had time to escape.

715
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:47,387
Why didn't I realize it was her?

716
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:49,389
Because as a punisher, she's quite adept

717
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:50,841
at avoiding her own medicine.

718
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:52,442
Quite impressed, really.

719
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,347
Hey, Dan.

720
00:31:57,399 --> 00:31:59,683
Yeah, I just saw it.
I'm already working on a trace.

721
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,068
"Judgment Day"? Oh.

722
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:03,403
People should really be careful
how they use that phrase.

723
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:06,022
It isn't actually due for
another couple of years.

724
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,858
She's gonna kill herself live on the air.

725
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,694
What? Well, that won't do at all.

726
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,946
How am I supposed to talk
to her if she's dead?

727
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,948
Glad you have your priorities in order.

728
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,284
Thought we were dealing with
someone smart and clever,

729
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,535
who tortured with a brutal sense of irony,

730
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:19,920
but killing herself

731
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:21,588
whilst humiliating her company...

732
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:23,590
Doesn't fit the pattern.

733
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:27,010
Hey, Sharon, can you pull up the
video of Leila driving again?

734
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,129
Yeah. Sure.

735
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,650
Pause it there.

736
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:33,328
What are you looking for, Detective?

737
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:36,019
Zoom in to the edge of the seat.

738
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,554
Can you go in tighter?

739
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,778
Well, I know images can be deceiving,

740
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:47,230
but that looks an awful lot
like a gun, doesn't it?

741
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:49,566
Leila's not our killer.

742
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,568
She's in danger.

743
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,014
You understand this sicko pretty well.

744
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,738
Where do you think he's going?

745
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,741
Well, somewhere linked to
her sins, I suppose.

746
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,042
We barely know Leila.

747
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,797
Who knows what the killer
thinks she's done?

748
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:02,273
Well, she runs the company that hosts

749
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:04,798
humanity's worst depravities,
but we know she's not there.

750
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,383
Hey, Dan, how's the trace coming?

751
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,113
The I.P. just keeps pinging
back to Wobble's main server.

752
00:33:08,137 --> 00:33:10,337
It's got to be a mistake.

753
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,477
Unless it's not a mistake at all.

754
00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:23,850
You know, if you take
away the blinky lights

755
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,435
and add some lost souls,

756
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:27,988
this place bares a striking
resemblance to Hell.

757
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:30,774
Shh. Listen.

758
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:34,377
My name is... Leila Simms.

759
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:39,616
I'm one of the co-founders of Wobble.

760
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:42,953
I wanted to apologize to
anybody who's watching

761
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:45,956
for... for creating a forum...

762
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:50,844
...where evil and hate sought a refuge.

763
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:53,847
And there's Queen Wobble herself.

764
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:55,966
Yeah, but where's the killer?

765
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:58,552
And tonight I go down with the ship.

766
00:34:00,355 --> 00:34:02,572
Right alongside all of those awful sins

767
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:06,376
that-that I helped give a voice to.

768
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,979
Please, please.

769
00:34:09,031 --> 00:34:11,198
P-Please, please.

770
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:13,783
D-Don't make me do this.

771
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,702
Please.

772
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,559
There's Ray, the HR rep.

773
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:26,079
Oh, goodness me, I should have known.

774
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,164
Halitosis... first sign of evil.

775
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,633
He had all the access he needed

776
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,402
to find his targets and frame Leila.

777
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:41,411
What are you waiting for? Shoot him.

778
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,096
If he drops that lighter, he'll kill her.

779
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:44,989
I don't have a shot.

780
00:34:58,323 --> 00:35:01,825
Okay, Detective, this
next part will be much easier

781
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:04,327
if you're not here, so I'm gonna
politely ask you to leave, okay?

782
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:05,495
I'm not going anywhere.

783
00:35:05,547 --> 00:35:07,497
We're gonna figure this out.
Just give me a second.

784
00:35:12,888 --> 00:35:14,754
All right, no rush.

785
00:35:14,806 --> 00:35:17,007
Whilst you're pondering,
I'm gonna go and have a word

786
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:18,341
with our killer.

787
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:19,509
That's a great idea.

788
00:35:20,846 --> 00:35:22,512
Sorry, say that again.

789
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:26,683
I never meant to cause anybody any pain.

790
00:35:27,853 --> 00:35:30,020
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

791
00:35:30,022 --> 00:35:32,355
Yeah.

792
00:35:32,407 --> 00:35:35,025
Hello, Raymond.

793
00:35:35,027 --> 00:35:37,360
Hate to, uh, blow up your spot,

794
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:39,307
but I have a question to
ask you before you complete

795
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:40,797
this twisted little mise-en-scene.

796
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:42,098
Stay back.

797
00:35:42,134 --> 00:35:44,451
I swear I will drop this,
and she is dead.

798
00:35:44,503 --> 00:35:46,002
Oh, gosh, there's the halitosis.

799
00:35:46,038 --> 00:35:47,370
It travels, doesn't it?

800
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:49,456
You should really get that
looked at, but first,

801
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:53,510
indulge me this one simple query.

802
00:35:53,545 --> 00:35:54,878
Why?

803
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:58,932
What?

804
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:01,901
Why are you a punisher?

805
00:36:01,937 --> 00:36:03,887
I understand the longing for justice

806
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:06,890
or the joy of sweet revenge,

807
00:36:06,942 --> 00:36:09,059
but no one's forcing you to do this,

808
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,928
so why would you take it upon yourself?

809
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:16,282
Because I couldn't take it anymore.

810
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:18,001
All that evil

811
00:36:18,036 --> 00:36:19,235
is constantly spreading.

812
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:20,737
I had to do something.

813
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,257
I had to punish them.

814
00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:27,243
You're wrong.

815
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:28,878
You didn't have to do anything.

816
00:36:28,914 --> 00:36:30,430
You wanted to punish them.

817
00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:32,082
No, that's not true.

818
00:36:32,134 --> 00:36:34,300
Yes, it started with Nick...
that was impulsive.

819
00:36:34,336 --> 00:36:36,252
But then you got a taste for blood,

820
00:36:36,254 --> 00:36:37,921
and it felt good, didn't it?

821
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:39,139
I was doing my part.

822
00:36:39,174 --> 00:36:40,340
You had big plans

823
00:36:40,392 --> 00:36:41,424
to go on a vengeance quest

824
00:36:41,426 --> 00:36:43,059
until we came nipping at your heels,

825
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:45,562
at which point poor Leila took the fall.

826
00:36:45,597 --> 00:36:46,930
- An innocent!
- No, you're wrong.

827
00:36:46,982 --> 00:36:48,148
And then what, you'd stop?

828
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:50,734
Get away scot-free?

829
00:36:52,938 --> 00:36:56,690
We both know you can't
stop because you love it!

830
00:36:56,742 --> 00:36:58,858
Just like the people you punished.

831
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,460
I don't! I...

832
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,783
I do.

833
00:37:09,538 --> 00:37:13,456
I-I like seeing them beg for forgiveness.

834
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:15,592
You see, the difference between us

835
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:18,545
is that you became
part of the problem, Ray.

836
00:37:18,597 --> 00:37:21,431
Someone deserving punishment.

837
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:24,934
You're right.

838
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:28,638
I do.

839
00:37:30,142 --> 00:37:31,775
We all do.

840
00:37:33,145 --> 00:37:35,445
No, wait!

841
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:56,299
Man, you really don't shut up.

842
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:58,134
Congratulations, Detective.

843
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,837
I suppose you could say I
look quite extinguished.

844
00:38:01,757 --> 00:38:02,722
Right.

845
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:04,774
Shall we get you untied?

846
00:38:07,846 --> 00:38:10,563
Burning the midnight oil?

847
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:13,099
Ha, ha, what can I say?

848
00:38:13,151 --> 00:38:15,318
Being everybody's bitch really sucks.

849
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:17,353
Yeah, well, it won't last forever.

850
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:20,490
So I've had some time to think,

851
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:24,244
and, um... I realize that

852
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:26,162
I've been really harsh lately.

853
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:27,163
It's okay...

854
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:29,415
No, let me finish, please.

855
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:32,335
I've been really hard
on you for a while now.

856
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:35,088
And I've been...

857
00:38:35,123 --> 00:38:37,290
so upset and so angry.

858
00:38:37,342 --> 00:38:41,361
And... I did, I felt really betrayed.

859
00:38:41,396 --> 00:38:43,179
I know.

860
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:45,265
But I realize you've...

861
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,550
you've been working so
hard to make it right,

862
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,887
and I feel like, for the sake of Trixie,

863
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:52,572
that we should go on the trip.

864
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:54,307
You know, we should go,

865
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:57,310
like we always have.

866
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:00,563
I can't do that.

867
00:39:00,565 --> 00:39:02,866
Wh... What do you mean?

868
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,837
You were right before.

869
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,090
We shouldn't lie to our daughter.

870
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:13,243
Okay.

871
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,164
Look, I-I'm always gonna be Trixie's dad.

872
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:22,468
And I'm always gonna
be part of your lives.

873
00:39:22,504 --> 00:39:26,089
But we've been living in
the past for too long.

874
00:39:29,728 --> 00:39:31,427
We're no, we're no good for Trixie

875
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:33,346
if we're no good for each other.

876
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:39,936
But I think we both know the truth.

877
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:47,744
It's time we get a divorce.

878
00:40:06,298 --> 00:40:08,214
Hello, Luci.

879
00:40:11,803 --> 00:40:13,803
Tell me you didn't do it.

880
00:40:13,855 --> 00:40:15,271
Do what?

881
00:40:15,307 --> 00:40:16,556
Don't play stupid with me.

882
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:18,291
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

883
00:40:19,644 --> 00:40:21,194
Easy, Lucifer.

884
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:22,695
Your brother didn't send me to Hell,

885
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:24,480
if that's what you're worried about.

886
00:40:24,482 --> 00:40:27,650
But you were so adamant.

887
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:29,235
I told you, Lucifer,

888
00:40:29,287 --> 00:40:32,071
a mother's love counts
for more than you think.

889
00:40:32,123 --> 00:40:34,207
My time on Earth has helped me to realize

890
00:40:34,242 --> 00:40:36,993
that Father has a tendency to overreact.

891
00:40:36,995 --> 00:40:39,495
So you're going against Dad?

892
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:42,966
Things change, brother.

893
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:44,584
Do they?

894
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:48,304
Well, I for one am
grateful that we're all just

895
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,674
in the same room, together,
as a family again.

896
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:54,227
Yes, not so fast, Mother.

897
00:40:54,262 --> 00:40:56,012
You see, I did make a promise,

898
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,864
and I am a man of my word.

899
00:40:57,899 --> 00:40:59,699
I told you that you could stay here

900
00:40:59,734 --> 00:41:01,067
until I figured out how to

901
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:03,069
reconcile my deal with Dad,

902
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:05,021
and now I have.

903
00:41:05,073 --> 00:41:06,522
So you're going to punish me anyway?

904
00:41:06,524 --> 00:41:08,524
I am, indeed. And not because

905
00:41:08,526 --> 00:41:11,411
I've been brainwashed by Dad or
I'm trying to prove anything.

906
00:41:11,446 --> 00:41:15,365
I punish because I'm good at it.

907
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:17,500
I like giving people their due.

908
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,336
Makes me happy.

909
00:41:20,372 --> 00:41:24,040
I suppose I can't ask for a better reason.

910
00:41:25,877 --> 00:41:28,328
Which brings me to your sentence.

911
00:41:30,048 --> 00:41:32,215
Mother...

912
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:35,351
you shall remain right here on Earth

913
00:41:35,387 --> 00:41:38,438
amongst the creatures you so despise...

914
00:41:38,473 --> 00:41:39,656
as one of them.

915
00:41:39,691 --> 00:41:41,691
Wait.

916
00:41:41,726 --> 00:41:43,059
You're going to send me

917
00:41:43,061 --> 00:41:45,395
into the life of Charlotte Richards?

918
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:47,146
Mm-hmm.

919
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:49,210
- Well, how's that supposed to work?
- Not my problem.

920
00:41:49,234 --> 00:41:50,733
And what if I refuse?

921
00:41:50,785 --> 00:41:53,403
You can't fight this, you're human now.

922
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:54,654
But that husband...

923
00:41:54,706 --> 00:41:55,872
And there's children, right?

924
00:41:55,907 --> 00:41:57,290
They're going to need things.

925
00:41:57,325 --> 00:41:59,158
Oh, I'm counting on it.

926
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:01,411
But if you truly want to be with your sons,

927
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:04,547
then that's the price that you have to pay.

928
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:16,893
So be it.

929
00:42:34,696 --> 00:42:36,446
Your money or your life, bitch.

930
00:42:36,448 --> 00:42:38,414
I-I choose money.

931
00:42:39,284 --> 00:42:41,417
Does anyone choose life?

932
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:43,586
- That doesn't very...
- Come here!

933
00:42:43,621 --> 00:42:45,621
I'll give you what you
want! Just hold on.

934
00:42:45,673 --> 00:42:47,707
I said, hold on!

935
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:25,916
