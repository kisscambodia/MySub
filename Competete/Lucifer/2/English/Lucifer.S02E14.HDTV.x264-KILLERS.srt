1
00:00:01,646 --> 00:00:04,338
- <i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- That's Azrael's blade.

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:05,863
That's one angry-ass snake.

3
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,789
I want my family back.

4
00:00:07,835 --> 00:00:09,915
Mom and I are gonna
find a way to get back

5
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:10,749
to the Silver City.

6
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:11,891
One way or another.

7
00:00:11,926 --> 00:00:13,491
Something is wrong.

8
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:15,436
It won't stop.

9
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,284
The only thing that's gonna save my life

10
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:19,062
is finding the antidote.

11
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:20,967
The plan is simple:

12
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:24,139
you kill me, I go down to
Hell interrogate the professor,

13
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:26,301
get the formula, and
then you bring me back.

14
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:28,770
Well, you didn't die after all.

15
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:30,531
I heard you saved me.

16
00:00:30,578 --> 00:00:32,007
This is your Father's doing.

17
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,672
Chloe is his doing,

18
00:00:33,726 --> 00:00:35,297
he put her in your path.

19
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,845
So none of it was real?

20
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:37,912
Don't!

21
00:00:37,948 --> 00:00:38,880
I mean, how can I trust

22
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,248
anything, anyone

23
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:42,072
now that I know He
might be behind it all?

24
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,073
Well, you can trust me.

25
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:43,985
Can I, Mum?

26
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:45,186
You're as bad as He is.

27
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:47,257
I am tired of being a pawn.

28
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:48,350
I'm done.

29
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:51,047
Lucifer? You here?

30
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:11,312
How dare he walk out on me.

31
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:12,347
I'm a goddess.

32
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:13,848
Yes, you are.

33
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:16,317
I think I deserve a modicum of respect.

34
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:17,819
I respect you.

35
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:21,923
Then why did my son abandon me?

36
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,326
Wait, we're talking about your son?

37
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:27,335
Do you know that I went to Hell for him?

38
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:29,931
I even helped save his
scrawny, little human,

39
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:32,233
who I much prefer dead.

40
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:34,108
This is getting weird.

41
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:36,080
Yeah. It's been two weeks and no word.

42
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:38,583
I mean, a mother has needs,

43
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,051
don't you agree?

44
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:41,919
Okay, uh...

45
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:43,089
I got to go.

46
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,285
You're a terrible kisser.

47
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:51,972
Must suck to be on
the outs with Lucifer.

48
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:54,465
He hates it when people manipulate him.

49
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:55,368
I didn't.

50
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:58,202
At least not like his Father.

51
00:01:58,238 --> 00:02:00,972
True, but you're here.

52
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:02,940
And the big guy's not.

53
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:04,208
I bet Lucifer is

54
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:06,877
plotting his revenge as we speak.

55
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,658
Love the vibe you got going here.

56
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:22,026
It's very Godfather.

57
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:24,962
You even look a bit like Brando.

58
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:28,499
Circa the barefoot,
stress-eating years.

59
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:29,800
This is a big move, man.

60
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:31,936
Are you sure about this?

61
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:33,170
Oh, yes.

62
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:34,639
Now hand it over.

63
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:36,407
It's not gonna go cheap.

64
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:43,883
Worth every penny.

65
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:49,221
It's your funeral.

66
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:04,535
Still no sign of Lucifer?

67
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,770
I went by his place.

68
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:07,672
It's completely packed up.

69
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,674
No e-mails, no calls, nothing.

70
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,741
He's gone.

71
00:03:10,777 --> 00:03:12,343
Just... it is what it is.

72
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:14,612
You know, Chloe, you don't
have to pretend with me.

73
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:16,047
I know you're upset.

74
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,630
I mean, he's your partner,
he should've told you

75
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,531
he was leaving.

76
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:20,384
Whatever. It's been two weeks.

77
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,185
I'm over it.

78
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:22,520
Please just change the subject.

79
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:24,655
Man, I miss Lucifer.

80
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:25,890
He was the best hugger.

81
00:03:25,926 --> 00:03:27,358
I mean, squirmer on the outside,

82
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:29,760
but warm and fuzzy on the inside.

83
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,295
Ella.

84
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,263
Do you mind?

85
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,097
Oh.

86
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:34,865
Sorry, Decker.

87
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,569
Guess he hasn't called you either.

88
00:03:45,345 --> 00:03:47,345
So we got Ash Corrigan.

89
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:50,414
27. Cause of death, blunt trauma,

90
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,922
by something that left
small circular gashes

91
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:53,884
around the wound.

92
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,242
M.E.'s gonna make me some
molds so I can track down

93
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:58,146
- the murder weapon.
- Well, it doesn't look like a robbery.

94
00:03:58,148 --> 00:04:00,958
I mean, guy's wallet and
ID hasn't been touched.

95
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:01,959
His car's still here.

96
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:03,864
I'm thinking Ash was a club-goer.

97
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,196
Got into a bar fight,

98
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:06,831
then everything went to head out here.

99
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:08,065
Hmm.

100
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:09,667
I think he played in a band.

101
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:11,435
Calloused fingers.

102
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:12,636
Guitar player.

103
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,637
Good catch.

104
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:15,172
Well, yeah.

105
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,275
And this.

106
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:21,145
Looks like the band
lost their front man.

107
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:26,225
I can't believe he's gone.

108
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,285
We were in such a good place.

109
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:29,754
The album was selling, man.

110
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:31,765
Tour was gonna be huge.

111
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,534
This blows so hard.

112
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,835
What's gonna happen to us?

113
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:36,303
Come on, dude, Ash is dead.

114
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,005
He's just saying what
we're all thinking.

115
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,940
The band's over. We're screwed.

116
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:42,376
So Ash was staying here?

117
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:44,466
He was just crashing on
the couch last couple weeks.

118
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:45,512
You guys weren't worried

119
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:46,647
when he didn't come home last night?

120
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:49,049
We just figured that he
hooked up with someone.

121
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,092
I hoped, anyway.

122
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,019
He's been in a funk since his divorce.

123
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:53,053
It was bad.

124
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:53,789
How bad?

125
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:58,058
You should talk to Courtney.

126
00:04:58,094 --> 00:04:59,126
Ash's ex.

127
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:01,461
She's, um... very passionate.

128
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:04,331
They fought non-stop,
even got violent once.

129
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,146
So the band was right,
the ex-wife was violent.

130
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:17,572
Look at these.

131
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:20,180
She was arrested for
domestic abuse two years ago.

132
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:21,682
I mean, charges were dropped, but...

133
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:23,118
Detective!

134
00:05:33,663 --> 00:05:34,561
You're okay.

135
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:36,997
What? Yes, of course I'm okay.

136
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,266
Don't be so silly.

137
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:43,384
Lucifer, I was really,
really worried about you.

138
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:45,315
Shh! Hold that thought.

139
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:47,252
I have news.

140
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:50,220
What...

141
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:51,755
Wow.

142
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,556
You just... you go AWOL for two weeks,

143
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:56,192
and then you have the nerve
to come here and shush me?

144
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:57,116
Yeah.

145
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:59,116
You have some serious
explaining to do, man.

146
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:01,331
Yes, I know that,
Daniel, and I'm about to.

147
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:02,632
Shall we all have a sit down?

148
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:03,733
No. Spill it.

149
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,301
I'm dying to know where you've been.

150
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:06,832
Lucifer?

151
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:14,878
Lucifer?

152
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:16,679
Uh...

153
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:18,381
Candy, darling,

154
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,183
I told you to wait in the car.

155
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:22,018
But it's so stuffy in there.

156
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:23,219
But it's a convertible.

157
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,135
Plus I wanted to show
your police friends

158
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:28,024
just how generous my honey is.

159
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,429
He paid that sketchy diamond guy

160
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:34,464
a ginormous pile of cash for it.

161
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,432
Well, mm.

162
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:38,735
Lucifer, who is this?

163
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:40,103
Right.

164
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,438
Meet Candy Morningstar.

165
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:43,908
My wife.

166
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,713
Wow.

167
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:58,845
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

168
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:01,928
It's not how I'd hoped to announce it.

169
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,437
I know it might be a tad surprising.

170
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,280
No, why would I be surprised?

171
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:07,156
That you disappeared
after I almost died,

172
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:09,258
and then waltzed back
in married to a stripper?

173
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:11,186
Exotic dancer, but, yes, I can explain.

174
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,061
No.

175
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,262
No need.

176
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:14,463
I'm happy for you.

177
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:15,431
Really.

178
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:16,599
Do you mind?

179
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,100
Sorry.

180
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:19,101
Am I bugging you?

181
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,169
I'm totally bugging you.

182
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:21,670
No, I love that sound.

183
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:23,305
- Oh.
- Look, Detective,

184
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:24,774
I had some family issues.

185
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,009
And I-I went to Vegas
to blow off some steam.

186
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:28,944
One thing led to another, and...

187
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,480
Look, I am sorry, I should've
told you that I needed...

188
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:32,381
time off.

189
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:35,217
This isn't about vacation hours,

190
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:37,388
this isn't about time
cards, Lucifer, this...

191
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,023
How could you just...?

192
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,760
I thought we were...

193
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,630
I thought we were friends.

194
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,532
Friends? Yes.

195
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,067
Friends, that's exactly what we are.

196
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,169
Just friends.

197
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:55,371
- Right.
- Right.

198
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:56,505
So it's all sorted then,

199
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,907
- we'll go back to the way it was.
- Great.

200
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:58,908
You know, before...

201
00:07:58,944 --> 00:07:59,909
Yes, I get it!

202
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:02,478
- Hey.
- What?

203
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:04,448
I have Ash's ex-wife in interrogation.

204
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,617
Great.

205
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,919
I...

206
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,821
That's classy, dude.

207
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,622
Real classy.

208
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:16,227
Thank you?

209
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:18,961
You think they like me?

210
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,163
Oh, what's not to like?

211
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,535
"Violent psycho bitch."

212
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:29,605
"Sid and Nancy, except she's Sid."

213
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:34,009
"All she wanted was
to crush Ash's soul."

214
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:35,444
So, Courtney,

215
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,013
care to explain why all of
your ex-husband's bandmates

216
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,582
think you're capable of murder?

217
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:42,151
I had nothing to do with this.

218
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,186
Where were you the night of Ash's death?

219
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,188
The same place I am every night: work.

220
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,248
I have employees who can vouch for it.

221
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:49,049
What do you do?

222
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:50,793
Run an online clothing company.

223
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:52,661
Built it from scratch.
Worked my ass off.

224
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:55,698
You want to know what
Ash would say about work?

225
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,199
"The world will provide."

226
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:58,667
But you know who did?

227
00:08:58,703 --> 00:08:59,693
Me.

228
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:02,258
Someone had to be responsible.

229
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:04,694
The band, they thought I was uncool,

230
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,232
but it was Ash, he was
the selfish, childish one.

231
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:11,267
I completely understand.

232
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:13,369
I was with an immature partner,

233
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:14,537
and it was maddening.

234
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:15,838
It's crazy-making.

235
00:09:15,874 --> 00:09:16,908
Yeah, wanted to kill him.

236
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:19,577
I didn't say that.

237
00:09:20,946 --> 00:09:22,445
Ouch. Shade.

238
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:24,673
I wouldn't take it too personally.

239
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:27,550
Yeah, right.

240
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:29,354
I'm sure it's not me
she's talking about.

241
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:32,689
Well, who else would
she be talking about?

242
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:34,290
So, you want to explain

243
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:35,992
the domestic abuse charge?

244
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:37,927
Look, we fought.

245
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,829
I'm not proud of that.

246
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:42,398
But I've paid for my
mistakes, literally.

247
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:43,533
What do you mean?

248
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:45,702
Ash took everything when we divorced.

249
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:48,338
I agreed to sit down
with a divorce mediator,

250
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:50,740
and the guy was completely
biased against me.

251
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:52,342
I think him and Ash

252
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:54,977
set up some sort of shady side deal.

253
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:56,412
He's the real criminal.

254
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:59,048
But if Ash got this
hefty divorce settlement,

255
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:01,050
then why was he couch-surfing?

256
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:02,018
Where'd the money go?

257
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:04,863
Maybe the mediator took it?

258
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,783
Like I said, the guy's a crook.

259
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:15,631
I got him.

260
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,400
Someone tagged Lucifer at The Grove.

261
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:18,501
You're kidding.

262
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:21,204
Someone named "Cottoncandy86"?

263
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,638
That's an unfortunate name.

264
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:25,074
No, Mom, it's an Internet... never mind.

265
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,245
It looks like they were getting
frozen yogurt to celebrate...

266
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,546
newlywed life?

267
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:33,416
#mrslucifer, #hottiehubby?

268
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:35,051
Are you speaking in tongues?

269
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:36,052
Mom!

270
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:37,353
Look.

271
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:40,056
He and cottoncandy86 are married.

272
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:41,277
- What?!
- He specifically

273
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,894
told me to watch over Chloe.

274
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:44,461
After everything that
we did to save her,

275
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:46,688
I don't... I don't understand.

276
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:48,831
Betrothing himself to that?

277
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,666
He wouldn't.

278
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:53,403
Perhaps Mazikeen was right.

279
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:55,506
Lucifer's concocting a plan.

280
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:04,313
Well, Courtney's story checked out.

281
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:06,282
She was working late with two employees

282
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:07,410
at the time Ash was killed.

283
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:08,919
Courtney's been pointing pretty hard

284
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:11,020
at their divorce
mediator, but I don't know.

285
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:12,288
Seems like a stretch.

286
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:14,390
Yeah, agreed, but I did
check it out anyways.

287
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:15,559
This guy named Anthony Annan.

288
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:16,793
He's got a clean record, and nothing

289
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:18,461
but Courtney's word points to him.

290
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,509
Uh, Detective, a word?

291
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:21,798
You're still here? Shouldn't you be

292
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,566
on some honeymoon far, far away?

293
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:25,635
Oh, look, it's Mannequin Hair.

294
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:27,970
- Who?
- I don't know his name,

295
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:29,705
but he's in the other photo, too.

296
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:32,141
- Is that weird?
- What other photo?

297
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:33,209
The one of the dead dude.

298
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:35,233
See? Right there.

299
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:36,613
Mannequin Hair is in the crowd

300
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:38,614
behind the yellow tape.

301
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,816
She's right, it's him.

302
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:41,217
Unbelievable.

303
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:43,186
It's highly unlikely for
Ash's divorce mediator

304
00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:45,077
to be lurking at the
scene of his murder, yes?

305
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:45,855
Yeah, very.

306
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:47,449
I'll track him down. Nice.

307
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:49,125
Well done, Candy.

308
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,176
Well, I don't get a
lot of names at my job,

309
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:53,229
so I'm super good with faces.

310
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:55,164
- And other things.
- Ah.

311
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,253
This is fun, isn't it? Isn't this fun?

312
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:59,802
Hmm? Murder, suspects, clues.

313
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:01,471
Gosh, it feels good to be back.

314
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:03,710
Right, I'm going to call Candy a cab,

315
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:06,479
and then you and I can get
down to brass tacks, yes?

316
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,286
Actually, come to think of it,

317
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:09,405
who watches over Trixie?

318
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:10,575
Do you want to go splitsies on a nanny?

319
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:12,276
Besides, I hear this
case involves a band,

320
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:13,144
so, lucky for you

321
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,080
I bring my much-needed
musical expertise.

322
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:17,581
Did you know he plays piano?

323
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:19,583
Like, better than Elton Tom.

324
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:21,275
I know plenty about music, thank you.

325
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,242
Do you, now, Detective?

326
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:24,725
Right, what's your favorite band, then?

327
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,999
- Hmm?
- Hey...

328
00:12:27,035 --> 00:12:29,434
Oh, full of '90s jams, I see.

329
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,637
The Bangles, N'Sync,

330
00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:33,272
Right Said Fred?

331
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:35,141
- Give me the phone back.
- I mean, seriously, Detective,

332
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:36,409
your music queue alone is enough

333
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:38,076
to disqualify you from this case.

334
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:40,612
You're not the one who's
on this case, Lucifer.

335
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:43,749
What? But what about our partnership?

336
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:46,652
Our partnership ended
when you ghosted me

337
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:48,186
and the entire department.

338
00:12:48,222 --> 00:12:50,555
You can't just march back
in here like nothing's wrong.

339
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:53,160
You can't just grab what
you want when you want.

340
00:12:55,706 --> 00:12:58,098
I'll just put that down there, then.

341
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:05,795
You let me down, Lucifer.

342
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:09,541
I mean, what good is a partner

343
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:11,044
if I can't depend on you?

344
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,846
I don't need you anymore.

345
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:17,683
Well, surely you don't mean that. I do.

346
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,318
You can go.

347
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:20,921
Both of you.

348
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:25,359
Right.

349
00:13:27,324 --> 00:13:31,142
I haven't seen you in a while, Lucifer.

350
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,680
Uh, I know you've been through Hell.

351
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:37,248
I suppose we can discuss
that another time.

352
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:40,318
Oh, no, no, there's no
need for censoring, Doctor.

353
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:42,720
Candy and I have no secrets.

354
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,958
Isn't that the key to
a successful marriage?

355
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:50,194
And how are you coping
since your... travels?

356
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,164
Any warning signs of lasting trauma?

357
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,299
Denial?

358
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:57,168
Rash decisions?

359
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,891
Um... no, no.

360
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,539
I think I've thought through
everything quite carefully.

361
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,975
He's a thinker, this one!

362
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,945
And, uh... and what
about Detective Decker?

363
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:09,080
I thought you two had become...

364
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,616
close.

365
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:13,785
Well, everything I felt for her

366
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:16,955
was smoke and mirrors,
courtesy of dear old Dad.

367
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:19,057
I mean, He clearly expected me to zig,

368
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:20,558
and so I zagged.

369
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:24,762
And does Chloe know
that you've zagged Candy?

370
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,130
Yes.

371
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,231
She just fired me.

372
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,399
- Shocking.
- I know.

373
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,370
But if you felt so manipulated...

374
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:34,505
why return to Chloe at all?

375
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,608
Well, I mean, I tried to leave,

376
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:41,179
but I just felt that I missed...

377
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,513
my work.

378
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,083
Look, anyway, baby, bathwater,

379
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,152
the detective and I are
quite the crime-fighting duo.

380
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,486
I mean, you wouldn't break up

381
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,154
- Batman and Robin, now, would you?
- No.

382
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,789
We have a job to do.

383
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,024
So if she could just see sense...

384
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:55,727
I was fired once.

385
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:57,228
But you know what I did?

386
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,864
I just kept showing up
and made myself expandable.

387
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,933
Oh, uh, do you mean indispensable?

388
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,802
No. Expandable. I got a boob job,

389
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,972
and it totally expanded my horizons.

390
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,706
Because then, I could do something

391
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,375
none of the other girls could do.

392
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,376
You wanna see?

393
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:12,910
- Ooh, yes.
- No.

394
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,746
No?

395
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:16,714
But you know, the part
about showing up...

396
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,318
that's not, actually, bad advice.

397
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:21,486
It's called "acting as if."

398
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:25,289
Yes. Yes, well done, Candy.

399
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,676
I think I know exactly how
to get back on the case.

400
00:15:27,723 --> 00:15:29,795
Oh, gosh, I wish I'd
talked to you earlier.

401
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:30,809
Saved myself a trip.

402
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,598
Have a candy, Candy.

403
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,070
Bad news, Chloe.

404
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,472
Ash's mediator won't talk.

405
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,776
Well, because he's a lawyer.

406
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,295
Yep, not without a warrant.

407
00:15:47,298 --> 00:15:49,747
Okay, will do.

408
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,315
I know you're there.

409
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,884
I'm a cop, Lucifer.

410
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,586
You think I don't know
when I'm being followed?

411
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,955
All right, fair enough.

412
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,391
Look, I'm simply here
to help with the case.

413
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:03,094
What, you mean the case
that Chloe kicked you off of?

414
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,697
I'm just... I'm trying
to put things back

415
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,233
the way they were, Dan.

416
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:12,236
Yeah, I've been there.

417
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:17,041
Right. And I have a brilliant idea.

418
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,843
You expect me to let you go undercover

419
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,178
with your stripper wife?

420
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:21,747
Right. First of all,
she's an exotic dancer.

421
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:22,880
"Stripper" is pejorative.

422
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,383
Well, far be it from me
to disrespect your bride.

423
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,718
Thank you. And secondly,

424
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:28,820
Candy is a natural at
getting men to talk.

425
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:31,355
Oh, I bet she is.

426
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,757
Awesome.

427
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:35,326
Lucifer has outdone himself.

428
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:38,329
Thanks.

429
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,931
Mm-hmm.

430
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,366
But, Detective, the mediator

431
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,090
won't talk to you without a warrant.

432
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:46,462
Which is why I so wisely made
an appointment for Candy and I

433
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,339
this afternoon, see?

434
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,407
You need me.

435
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,175
Let me think about that. No.

436
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,044
Uh, Detective, if I didn't know better,

437
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,713
I'd say you were prejudiced
against exotic dancers.

438
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,415
Okay, we're done here.

439
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,549
- Good-bye.
- But...

440
00:16:58,585 --> 00:16:59,884
Come on, Candy.

441
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,719
Well, look, if you change your mind

442
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,688
and wish to take me up
on this splendid lead,

443
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:05,423
then, you know, you can always text me,

444
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,381
or I'm on Wobble now as well.

445
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:10,263
You can get Candy on Cottoncandy86.

446
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,377
It was a marvelous idea.
I'm sure she'll come around.

447
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:27,545
So it's true.

448
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,447
You're back.

449
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,850
Oh, invading my
privacy, as usual, I see.

450
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:35,361
Your brother and I were worried sick.

451
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:38,289
You could have at least called.

452
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:41,325
Oh, my gosh, are you Lucifer's sister?

453
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,393
Oh!

454
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,061
Oh, Lucifer, don't be rude.

455
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,497
Who is your top-heavy friend?

456
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:50,535
Candy, darling, this is my mother.

457
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,838
Mum, this is Candy, my wife.

458
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:56,007
I'm sorry that we didn't
invite you to the wedding.

459
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:57,041
We just decided

460
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,579
no enemies.

461
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,382
Well, lovely to meet you.

462
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,617
You're Lucifer's mom?

463
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:10,603
Oh, my gosh, you look amazing!

464
00:18:10,658 --> 00:18:12,523
I should start using sunscreen.

465
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,025
A shame he kept you hidden.

466
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:16,128
I hate secrets.

467
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,998
Do you like shopping?

468
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,133
Do I?

469
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:26,804
I want to hear all
about you and Lucifer.

470
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,608
You two must have so many plans.

471
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:32,476
So...

472
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:36,816
what do we think of Candy?

473
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:42,755
Well, I think she's perfect for Lucifer.

474
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:46,290
Her bra size equals her IQ, huh?

475
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,927
That's generous.

476
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,199
See that vein popping
out the side of your neck?

477
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:58,669
Same thing happens when I
throw the dishes in the trash

478
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:02,039
instead of washing them.

479
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,541
You're mad.

480
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:06,677
I'm an idiot.

481
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:10,648
Look, I know Lucifer
better than anyone, okay,

482
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:12,449
and he does this sometimes.

483
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:15,653
Disappears, does
stupid, impulsive things.

484
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:19,123
But he always comes back around, Chloe.

485
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,993
Yeah, but this time I don't want him to.

486
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:25,730
I'm serious, I am done. I'm done.

487
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:28,299
But he did get you an
in with that mediator.

488
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,735
That's a good thing, right?

489
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:31,869
Yeah, well, I don't care.

490
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,105
There's no way I'm letting him

491
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,309
and his exotic-dancer wife
on my case, or any case.

492
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:40,945
Maybe you and Lucifer need a mediator.

493
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:46,632
Just saying.

494
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:58,963
So, Mrs. Morningstar...

495
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:02,268
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you can call me Candy.

496
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:08,303
Candy.

497
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:10,476
Why do you want to divorce Lucifer?

498
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:12,292
Um...

499
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:15,829
Well, I just feel like we're
supposed to have a partnership,

500
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:19,806
and it just totally feels
like it's not working anymore.

501
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:22,169
Mm-hmm. And you two
have been married for...

502
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:24,538
- Five days.
- Ever!

503
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:26,006
- Forever.
- Five days.

504
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:27,618
- Five days.
- It feels like it.

505
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,009
But we've been through
a lot in that time,

506
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:30,578
and I say that we work
brilliantly together,

507
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,511
don't we, sweetie?

508
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:33,113
Well...

509
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,515
if you're talking
about the bedroom, yeah.

510
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:36,837
I mean, thank God

511
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,819
this bod is made for pure sex,

512
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:40,120
because, clearly,

513
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,721
it's all he cares about.

514
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:44,157
I'm tired.

515
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:45,458
Eh...

516
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,300
Would you say that's the,
uh, the crux of your issue?

517
00:20:48,303 --> 00:20:49,784
Oh, the crux of the issue?

518
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:51,265
Oh, no, no, no, that would he Lucifer

519
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:53,366
disappearing, and then popping back up

520
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:56,403
with zero explanation and
a ditzy bimbo on his arm.

521
00:20:56,455 --> 00:21:00,223
He's cheated on you in
five days of marriage?

522
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:02,309
No, of course I didn't. I've
been completely faithful.

523
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:04,544
I take the vows of
marriage very seriously.

524
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,581
And that's why you chose an
idiotic, bedazzled tweener

525
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:08,891
as your partner.

526
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:09,593
I'm sorry, Candy,

527
00:21:09,595 --> 00:21:11,161
there's no name calling in here.

528
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:13,698
Even if it's to yourself.

529
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,965
Lucifer,

530
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:17,600
would you like to respond?

531
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:22,338
This is gonna be hard for
you to understand, but...

532
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:24,605
I've been through Hell recently.

533
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:27,076
Both figuratively and literally.

534
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:29,178
True torment, my
greatest fears realized.

535
00:21:29,214 --> 00:21:31,781
Lucifer, I am the one who almost died.

536
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:35,586
Yes, I know. That is
what I'm talking about.

537
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,021
Wow.

538
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:42,091
I almost believe you care.

539
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:44,395
Have you ever known me to lie?

540
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,134
I don't know.

541
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,270
I don't know.

542
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:56,474
Why don't we take five?

543
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:07,985
Are you okay, Mrs. Morningstar?

544
00:22:11,723 --> 00:22:15,546
Yeah, I'm... yeah, thank you. I am.

545
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,032
Um...

546
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:23,466
I, uh, I had heard
through a friend that...

547
00:22:23,502 --> 00:22:29,372
you were open to a
little extra negotiation.

548
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:33,042
Um, I'm not sure what you mean by that.

549
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:36,112
Um, well, my husband, you see,

550
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,914
has a lot of money.

551
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,116
And so, if you were to...

552
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,919
swing things my way,

553
00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:46,289
then I'd make it worth your while.

554
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,959
Wow...

555
00:22:50,963 --> 00:22:53,229
You're really something.

556
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:55,731
But that would be crossing a line.

557
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:57,592
And I can't do things like that.

558
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:58,694
Why not?

559
00:22:58,734 --> 00:23:00,436
You did with Ash Corrigan.

560
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:02,105
You two are in on this together?

561
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:04,408
- No, we're...
- Oh, yes.

562
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:08,079
LAPD.

563
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:12,648
We know about your side
deal with Ash Corrigan.

564
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,059
Didn't pilfer enough
money from Ash's ex?

565
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:17,286
Had to go and kill Ash to
get the rest of the spoils?

566
00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:20,556
Whoa. I would never, ever hurt Ash.

567
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:22,859
Then what did you want
to accomplish, Anthony?

568
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:24,861
Hmm? Come on.

569
00:23:24,897 --> 00:23:26,262
Tell me.

570
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:28,267
What did you desire?

571
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,501
I wanted...

572
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:34,270
Yes?

573
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:37,940
I wanted the Heavy Woolies
to be the hugest band ever.

574
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:40,676
But... oh.

575
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,578
Um...

576
00:23:42,614 --> 00:23:44,787
Okay, yeah, yes, I
helped Ash in the divorce

577
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,363
and I got him all of Courtney's money.

578
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:48,634
But there was no side deal,
'cause I did it for free.

579
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:51,745
I did it for the band.

580
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,156
I did it for the music.

581
00:23:53,192 --> 00:23:54,223
So,

582
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:55,124
you're a fan?

583
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,660
No, no, no. I was the manager.

584
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,363
At least, Ash promised me...

585
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,643
maybe I could be the manager someday.

586
00:24:02,684 --> 00:24:04,683
The point is, I helped them a lot.

587
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:07,538
Ash and I came up with a plan.

588
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,873
Buy all the albums himself

589
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,176
using his ex-wife's
money to inflate sales.

590
00:24:13,212 --> 00:24:15,144
Talk about self-promotion.

591
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,073
All they needed was a little nudge.

592
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,689
And it worked.

593
00:24:18,732 --> 00:24:20,265
I mean, we got on the charts

594
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:22,221
and we started getting radio play,

595
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:24,020
we were gonna be booked
for this big tour.

596
00:24:24,022 --> 00:24:26,255
I mean, we were gonna make it so big.

597
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:29,158
We have a photo linking
you to the crime scene.

598
00:24:29,194 --> 00:24:30,326
Why were you there?

599
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:31,761
I was looking for them after the gig,

600
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,896
'cause Ash and Marla,
they were fighting.

601
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,838
The bassist? Why were they fighting?

602
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:36,987
When weren't they fighting?

603
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,323
I thought that Ash was gonna
kick Marla out of the band

604
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:41,464
that night after the
gig, so I went down there

605
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:42,834
to see how it went down.

606
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:46,642
That's when I saw the
police standing there,

607
00:24:46,678 --> 00:24:48,811
across the street.

608
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:50,709
Over his dead body.

609
00:24:52,503 --> 00:24:55,238
It was the night the music died.

610
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:02,546
Perhaps Marla didn't want
to be the fifth Beatle.

611
00:25:03,883 --> 00:25:05,816
Looks like we have a new suspect.

612
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:08,250
Oh, well, if that's the case,
then you're welcome, Detective.

613
00:25:08,252 --> 00:25:09,751
It's nice to be needed.

614
00:25:09,787 --> 00:25:11,019
Look, go home.

615
00:25:11,055 --> 00:25:12,654
Trust me.

616
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,424
Candy needs you more than I do.

617
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:24,699
Mine's bigger, right?

618
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:28,003
Yes. Does that mean anything?

619
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,071
Just how much Lucifer loves me.

620
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:33,174
Ah, so these small ones are for
couples who don't really care.

621
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,276
Exactly.

622
00:25:34,312 --> 00:25:35,577
Tell me more

623
00:25:35,613 --> 00:25:36,778
about you and Lucifer.

624
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:39,382
What comes next for you two lovebirds?

625
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,550
Did he say anything

626
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:44,853
about... oh, I don't know... matricide?

627
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:47,989
No, I think the mattress in
the penthouse is pretty new.

628
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:49,758
Oh, come on, Candy.

629
00:25:49,794 --> 00:25:52,896
I know you two have some kind of plan.

630
00:25:54,365 --> 00:25:56,865
Well, you're right about that.

631
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:58,333
So many plans.

632
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:00,804
Tell me everything.

633
00:26:03,407 --> 00:26:06,408
Someday...

634
00:26:06,444 --> 00:26:08,109
I want to open my own juice bar.

635
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:09,311
Or a tanning salon.

636
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:11,046
Or a combo juice bar

637
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:12,380
and tanning salon.

638
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:13,615
You're speaking

639
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:16,384
and yet I don't
understand a single word.

640
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,620
I get that a lot.

641
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:20,355
Why don't you talk and I'll listen?

642
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:21,398
I'm a good listener.

643
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:22,591
Like right now? I know exactly

644
00:26:22,593 --> 00:26:23,792
what you're trying to say.

645
00:26:23,828 --> 00:26:25,460
- But I didn't...
- You want what's best

646
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:26,995
for your son and you'll do anything

647
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:28,096
to make sure he's happy.

648
00:26:28,132 --> 00:26:31,766
I want you to know,
I got Lucifer's back.

649
00:26:31,802 --> 00:26:32,934
And yours.

650
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,169
Because...

651
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:36,539
you're my mom now, too.

652
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:40,176
We're family.

653
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:43,912
She's a sinister

654
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:44,946
genius.

655
00:26:44,982 --> 00:26:46,738
Mother, come on now.

656
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:49,818
Here I thought this "Candy"
was an insipid dullard.

657
00:26:49,854 --> 00:26:52,821
But she may be the
most formidable opponent

658
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:54,557
I've ever faced.

659
00:26:55,393 --> 00:26:57,121
I came away with nothing!

660
00:26:57,176 --> 00:26:59,127
Not a single crumb of information

661
00:26:59,163 --> 00:27:00,629
about Lucifer's real agenda.

662
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:02,831
What if there is no
hidden agenda, Mom? Oh...

663
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:04,499
What if this Candy's

664
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,101
exactly who she seems?

665
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:07,902
Then...

666
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:10,171
I don't understand what Lucifer's doing.

667
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:12,540
- Whatever he wants, as usual.
- So he really just married

668
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:15,276
this preening mouth breather
because he likes her?

669
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:16,778
Please.

670
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:20,550
Only a deeply damaged soul
would make such a poor choice.

671
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:26,388
Unless...

672
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:28,925
he really is that far gone.

673
00:27:30,428 --> 00:27:32,127
Then that would mean that my son

674
00:27:32,163 --> 00:27:34,763
is really, truly broken.

675
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,698
And I'm the one that broke him.

676
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:37,799
Mom...

677
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:39,000
don't.

678
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:40,335
I manipulated him.

679
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:43,306
I pushed him too hard.

680
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:46,776
I did this.

681
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:52,215
I'm a terrible mother.

682
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:59,394
Public intoxication, vandalism.

683
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:01,322
Okay, Marla does have a few priors.

684
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:03,793
But all par for the course
for a wannabe rock star.

685
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:06,796
How'd you get the lead?

686
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:09,024
I got in to see the mediator.

687
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,998
Lucifer did a thing.

688
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:13,702
Yes, I knew you guys
would patch things up.

689
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:14,969
Nope.

690
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:16,078
Not even close.

691
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:17,305
Not even close.

692
00:28:17,308 --> 00:28:19,236
Well, it sounds like
he's trying to help.

693
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:20,504
Why are you rooting for him?

694
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,605
I'm not rooting for him.

695
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:22,555
Okay, anyhow,

696
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:25,142
to me, Marla reads like a
troublemaker, not a killer.

697
00:28:25,178 --> 00:28:28,979
Oh, unless you count
crimes against fashion.

698
00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:30,213
Yikes.

699
00:28:30,216 --> 00:28:32,582
Hey, guys.

700
00:28:32,618 --> 00:28:35,820
Remember those marks on Ash's head?

701
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:39,790
You think they came from
the knobs on Marla's bass?

702
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,758
I mean, I still have
to do further tests,

703
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:43,693
but it sure looks like Tetris to me.

704
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:45,095
Okay, maybe Marla's our girl.

705
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:47,465
We got to find her and
find that instrument.

706
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,606
Yeah, I spoke to her roommate.

707
00:28:56,642 --> 00:28:58,775
She said Marla's here somewhere.

708
00:28:58,811 --> 00:28:59,576
Yeah.

709
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,378
Okay, bye.

710
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,150
Excuse me?

711
00:29:06,153 --> 00:29:07,387
Do you recognize this woman?

712
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:15,192
Yo, my friends, we got
a special guest tonight.

713
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:17,060
Ladies and gentlemen,

714
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:19,462
Lucifer Morningstar!

715
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,963
Hello, Los Angeles.

716
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:35,193
Hello.

717
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:37,630
Oh, you're too kind. You're too kind.

718
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:39,964
Hello.

719
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,834
This next song is for
a, uh, a special someone.

720
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,771
A woman who says she
doesn't need me anymore.

721
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:48,812
Yeah.

722
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,238
Well, I say she's wrong.

723
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:54,078
And I'm gonna prove just

That's right, rock a sweet '90s jam.

someone very special.

742
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:01,779
And her name...

743
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:03,781
is Marla. Has anyone seen Marla?

744
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:05,283
We're looking for someone called Marla.

745
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:07,385
I know she's here tonight.

746
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:08,691
She's the bass player.

747
00:31:08,694 --> 00:31:10,221
Ah, there she is!

748
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:12,391
Marla! Will you bring
her up to the front?

749
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:17,895
Come on. Marla, everybody.

750
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:22,922
See? You need me.

751
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,342
That better not be Marla's bass.

752
00:31:31,378 --> 00:31:32,643
It's already been processed.

753
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:34,876

Okay,

758
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,119
it was wiped down pretty good, but...

759
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:46,955
I found traces of Ash's
blood on the tuning knobs.

760
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:48,490
What, so Marla's the killer?

761
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:50,358
Murder solved!

762
00:31:50,394 --> 00:31:51,760
And I believe that proves

763
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:53,963
just how much the department needs me.

764
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:55,900
Including you.

765
00:31:59,403 --> 00:32:02,404
Uh, we got a stalker,
which is normally bad,

766
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,905
but makes me very happy right now

767
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:05,909
'cause I was getting very uncomfortable.

768
00:32:08,646 --> 00:32:11,714
What on Earth does he want?

769
00:32:12,817 --> 00:32:14,783
You know I watched over Chloe for weeks

770
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:16,217
after you disappeared, right?

771
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:18,119
Angel or creeper, brother?

772
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:19,354
It's a fine line.

773
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,456
You asked me to guard her,
so I did. Like an idiot!

774
00:32:21,492 --> 00:32:23,825
You see, because I thought
that she meant something to you.

775
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:26,227
We both know she's special.

776
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:28,830
Oh. That she is.

777
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,965
A whoopee cushion sent from Dad.

778
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:33,328
I'm sure he's having a right
old laugh at the moment.

779
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:37,172
Right. So that means it's okay
to turn your back on Chloe?

780
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,240
Just ignore her feelings?

781
00:32:39,276 --> 00:32:40,942
Feelings she had no control over.

782
00:32:40,978 --> 00:32:42,310
Feelings that aren't real.

783
00:32:42,313 --> 00:32:43,411
But she doesn't know that.

784
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:45,950
Which is why I had to save her from...

785
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:50,487
From you.

786
00:32:53,698 --> 00:32:55,824
You're not ignoring Chloe,
you're protecting her

787
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:57,325
because she had no choice.

788
00:32:57,361 --> 00:32:59,828
So I gave it back to her.

789
00:32:59,864 --> 00:33:02,665
By holding up a shield made of Candy.

790
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:07,068
I'm sorry, Lucifer.

791
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:14,042
You should at least
explain some of this to Mom.

792
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:15,777
She's upset.

793
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:17,879
Good.

794
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:21,149
She died and went to Hell for you, Luci.

795
00:33:21,185 --> 00:33:23,080
For you.

796
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,615
She faced her greatest fears

797
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:25,783
all because she loves you.

798
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:28,189
- Oh, come on.
- Yes, she hurt you.

799
00:33:28,225 --> 00:33:31,543
But she was just doing what
she thought was best for you.

800
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:33,179
And from what you just told me,

801
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:35,330
I'm quite sure you can relate to that.

802
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:37,734
Come on.

803
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:41,971
What more does it take?

804
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,716
You really told Lucifer where I was?

805
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:56,885
Since when do you guys talk?

806
00:33:56,921 --> 00:33:59,587
Since he helped me save your life.

807
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:01,356
I didn't kill Ash.

808
00:34:01,392 --> 00:34:02,724
Innocent people don't run.

809
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,326
Or get a dead guy's
blood on their guitars.

810
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:06,522
Whoa, what?

811
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:08,496
Ash's blood was all over your bass.

812
00:34:08,532 --> 00:34:09,852
I don't know anything about that.

813
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:11,601
I-I ran because of these.

814
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:17,005
What, you're making fake IDs?

815
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,230
That's how I make rent, okay?

816
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:20,576
How come you didn't tell us Ash wanted

817
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:22,143
to kick you out of the band?

818
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:24,479
You didn't know that?

819
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:27,682
S-Sure, we... bumped heads.

820
00:34:27,718 --> 00:34:31,649
He... he was gonna kick me out?

821
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,889
Look, even if I'd known,
I wouldn't have hurt him.

822
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:36,024
You have proof?

823
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,091
Um... yeah, yeah.

824
00:34:37,127 --> 00:34:38,826
This kid, Hunter, from Silver Lake.

825
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:41,393
He's like 16, maybe less?

826
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:43,965
I, uh, made him an ID that said he's 27.

827
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,301
Anyway, he hung around me all night.

828
00:34:46,337 --> 00:34:47,402
Actually, check Wobble.

829
00:34:47,438 --> 00:34:49,284
He was live posting
stuff of us all night.

830
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,442
His ID is HunterSTomstoned.

831
00:34:54,245 --> 00:34:55,510
I'm legal!

832
00:34:57,248 --> 00:34:59,080
There's a bunch more.

833
00:34:59,116 --> 00:35:01,103
Looks like they cover the time of death.

834
00:35:01,106 --> 00:35:02,504
Like I said, I didn't do it.

835
00:35:02,507 --> 00:35:04,920
Then how did Ash's blood
get all over your bass?

836
00:35:04,922 --> 00:35:07,490
Hold on, look at this.

837
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:11,192
That's Doug, our drummer.

838
00:35:11,228 --> 00:35:12,491
He loaded our gear.

839
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:14,964
Doug had the bass last.

840
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:23,171
You know what? I should just stay here.

841
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:26,741
Finish up Marla's
arrest report, but, um...

842
00:35:26,777 --> 00:35:30,278
maybe your consultant is free.

843
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:37,285
Doug Kennedy, LAPD.

844
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:40,955
Ugh. Typical youth of today,
leaving the door unlocked.

845
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:45,827
Uh, sorry, I...

846
00:35:45,863 --> 00:35:47,762
It's Candy.

847
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:48,865
Just...

848
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:53,234
Candy, darling, I can't talk now.

849
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,902
About to catch a killer.

850
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:00,109
Gonna have to call you back!

851
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:05,544
Let him go, Doug.

852
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,846
You stay back!

853
00:36:06,882 --> 00:36:08,581
J-Just stay back!

854
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:10,282
This is all Ash's fault!

855
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:11,484
We were gonna make it big,

856
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,819
and then Ash said he
was gonna going solo.

857
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,688
He was gonna bail on all of us.

858
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:17,723
I went to smack him
and I freaking lost it!

859
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,995
You're making this worse, Doug.

860
00:36:19,998 --> 00:36:21,326
Let him go.

861
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,690
No. If you care about your
partner, you drop your gun, now!

862
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:26,198
Oh, Go... You may as well just
yank the sucker, then, Dougie,

863
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:28,801
'cause I'm useless to her, you see?

864
00:36:28,837 --> 00:36:31,403
What? That's not true, Lucifer.

865
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,939
Isn't it? I mean, you
said as much yourself.

866
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:36,375
W-Wait, what the hell's going on?

867
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:38,777
The detective doesn't need me anymore.

868
00:36:38,813 --> 00:36:40,579
So come on.

869
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,981
Do your worst.

870
00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:43,516
Don't listen to him, Doug.

871
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:45,784
No, go on! Go on, go on.
Yank like it's your last wank.

872
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,154
Or better still, you
shoot, Detective. Come on.

873
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,458
Two birds, one bullet,
what do you say? Huh?

874
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,099
You okay?

875
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,233
I think so.

876
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:03,002
Yeah, that's because you shot me!

877
00:37:03,038 --> 00:37:06,447
Doug Kennedy, you're under arrest.

878
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,984
There's not a scratch, Detective.

879
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,619
Impressive marksmanship.

880
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:13,555
Actually, I was aiming for you.

881
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,733
Oh, my God! Is Lucifer okay?

882
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:26,468
We were on the phone when
he got cut off, and...

883
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,237
He's in the other room,
giving a statement.

884
00:37:29,273 --> 00:37:30,438
Don't worry. He's fine.

885
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:31,740
Did you save him?

886
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,442
Thank you! Oh!

887
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:37,345
Oh. All... All righty. That's...

888
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:40,015
His job is way too dangerous.

889
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,716
I begged him to quit, but no.

890
00:37:41,752 --> 00:37:43,552
My hubby's all about his work.

891
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:44,845
He is?

892
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,856
Oh, my God, it's "Detective
this," and "Detective that."

893
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:50,155
Working with you means so much to him.

894
00:37:50,158 --> 00:37:52,127
Well, he's got a strange
way of showing it.

895
00:37:52,163 --> 00:37:53,195
Well, duh.

896
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:54,896
Dude's totally messed up.

897
00:37:54,932 --> 00:37:57,332
But then, you probably
already know that, huh?

898
00:37:57,368 --> 00:37:59,835
'Cause you're kind of the reason why?

899
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:00,635
What? Uh...

900
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:01,703
Didn't you two just go

901
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,972
through a super bananas situation?

902
00:38:04,008 --> 00:38:05,740
With like, poison?

903
00:38:05,776 --> 00:38:07,509
He kept saying how he almost lost you,

904
00:38:07,545 --> 00:38:09,511
and it was hell and stuff.

905
00:38:09,547 --> 00:38:11,379
Yeah, i-it was bananas.

906
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:15,250
It, it, I... went
through a lot, and, um...

907
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:17,619
And I... I guess he did, too.

908
00:38:17,655 --> 00:38:19,321
Great. Statement given...

909
00:38:19,357 --> 00:38:21,590
Candy. Oh!

910
00:38:21,626 --> 00:38:22,824
Ow.

911
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,251
Uh, Candy darling,

912
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:27,629
the detective's not a big fan of PDA.

913
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:29,197
It's fine.

914
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:31,334
I'm just glad she's here for you.

915
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:34,636
See you tomorrow at the precinct.

916
00:38:34,672 --> 00:38:37,340
Detective.

917
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,910
Don't be late.

918
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,327
_

919
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:55,624
Amenadiel seems to
think I owe you a chat.

920
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,794
So I'll start by saying
I do not forgive you.

921
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,564
I deserve that.

922
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,832
Hmm.

923
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:07,736
However, you did make
quite a sacrifice for me.

924
00:39:07,772 --> 00:39:11,172
Despite your callous manipulations,

925
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:14,209
maybe you were
well-intentioned somewhere,

926
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:16,745
deep, deep down.

927
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:18,947
Perhaps that counts for something.

928
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:22,083
I'm glad you think so, son.

929
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:23,351
Besides,

930
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:25,954
I'm far more pissed off at Dad.

931
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,723
I mean, you just tried to
speed up feelings I already had,

932
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:31,059
whereas he...

933
00:39:31,095 --> 00:39:32,594
Well.

934
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,332
He made all those feelings a lie.

935
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,466
Anyway.

936
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:41,371
Nice catching up. I'll
see you in a few millennia.

937
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:45,907
Lucifer, wait.

938
00:39:45,943 --> 00:39:48,576
I appreciate your honesty.

939
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:53,548
And now, I'd like to be honest with you.

940
00:39:53,584 --> 00:39:55,617
Oh. This'll be a hoot.

941
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:58,053
Since I escaped Hell, all
I've wanted is to get back

942
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:01,022
to the Silver City,
to reunite our family.

943
00:40:01,058 --> 00:40:03,928
You're still fantasizing
about heavenly rebellion?

944
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:05,627
Just let it go, Mum.

945
00:40:05,663 --> 00:40:08,296
Been there, done that, big fall.

946
00:40:08,332 --> 00:40:09,597
But that's just it.

947
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:11,900
Why do you think you lost that fight?

948
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:14,002
Oh, I don't know, let's
have a think, shall we?

949
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:15,236
Not enough cardio?

950
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:17,806
The fact that dear old
Dad's slightly almighty?

951
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:20,241
Because I was young,
woefully foolish and...

952
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:21,687
Unarmed?

953
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,346
You know that if you had
possessed the Flaming Sword,

954
00:40:24,348 --> 00:40:26,648
the weapon that guarded Eden,

955
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:28,626
the weapon that can
cut through anything,

956
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,352
even the Gates of Heaven itself,

957
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:32,787
well, you would've won that rebellion.

958
00:40:32,823 --> 00:40:34,322
Why are you dwelling in the past?

959
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:35,857
The fact is, I didn't have the sword,

960
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,860
and Dad destroyed it soon after, so...

961
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,596
What if I told you that
the sword was right here,

962
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:42,964
on Earth?

963
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:45,248
And it's already in your possession.

964
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:46,236
What?

965
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,471
The Flaming Sword is Azrael's blade.

966
00:40:49,507 --> 00:40:52,842
We have everything we need to go home.

967
00:41:03,788 --> 00:41:08,156
Well, the Oscar goes
to Candy Morningstar.

968
00:41:08,192 --> 00:41:09,524
You think they bought it?

969
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,614
Yes, my mother doesn't
know what hit her.

970
00:41:11,617 --> 00:41:12,949
So, thank you.

971
00:41:12,952 --> 00:41:15,972
For helping me peek inside
that scheming head of hers.

972
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:18,676
Well, it's the least I could do.

973
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,444
After what you did for me in Vegas?

974
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,413
You saved my life.

975
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:24,849
Pretty sure I'm gonna owe
you for the rest of it.

976
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:26,450
Let's call it even, shall we?

977
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:27,752
Yeah.

978
00:41:27,788 --> 00:41:29,320
Oh, that reminds me

979
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:30,588
Oh, no, no, no.

980
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,589
You keep that.

981
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,857
I hear divorce

982
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:34,425
is quite expensive these days.

983
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:35,726
In fact,

984
00:41:35,762 --> 00:41:38,362
why don't you add this
one to the, uh, pot?

985
00:41:38,398 --> 00:41:40,298
Thank you.

986
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:41,999
I'll put them both to good use.

987
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:45,603
'Cause, you know, I
totally have so many plans.

988
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:46,906
Oh, God.

989
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:50,374
Well, to making plans.

990
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,044
Yeah.

991
00:41:54,114 --> 00:41:56,048
All right.

992
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:02,855
Lucifer.

993
00:42:03,783 --> 00:42:06,123
I get why you had me con your family.

994
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,860
But what is going on with
you and Detective Decker?

995
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,099
It's none of my business,

996
00:42:15,135 --> 00:42:18,971
but... I wouldn't screw that one up.

997
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:28,846
I'm trying not to.

998
00:42:43,273 --> 00:42:46,564
