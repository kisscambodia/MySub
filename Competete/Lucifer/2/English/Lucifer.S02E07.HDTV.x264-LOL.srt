1
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:02,778
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,436
Seriously. Tell me, what
do you actually want?

3
00:00:04,461 --> 00:00:06,680
My father was a cop. He was a great cop.

4
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:07,849
I really do want to help people.

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,616
She starred in Hot Tub High School.

6
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:12,054
And two weeks later, her father died.

7
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,169
You were right before.

8
00:00:13,238 --> 00:00:15,039
We've been living in
the past for too long.

9
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:16,496
It's time we get a divorce.

10
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:18,842
I need to figure out where
I fit in in this world.

11
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,592
So, we're still good
to be roomies, right?

12
00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:24,044
I need you to be honest
with me about who you are.

13
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:25,265
No more lies.

14
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:26,553
Very well.

15
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:46,672
Sloths move faster, Petey.

16
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:49,024
Snails. The humble tortoise.

17
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,930
- You can't rush perfection.
- This is true.

18
00:00:52,307 --> 00:00:54,782
Hawaiian bread. Just
the way you like it.

19
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:58,211
- Thanks, Petey.
- No, thank you, Officer Decker.

20
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:02,916
Before I forget... for you and Grace.

21
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:07,354
- Hot Tub High School?
- Opens Friday.

22
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:09,336
My little monkey's gonna be a star.

23
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,924
- We wouldn't miss it.
- Do me a favor.

24
00:01:10,993 --> 00:01:13,071
I hear there's some funny
business about 15 minutes in...

25
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:14,844
- Oh, you mean that scene where...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:16,830
Let's not finish that thought.

27
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:19,204
Just tell her it was a good movie.

28
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,508
- Kids these days.
- Yeah, I know.

29
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,561
But, hey... I'm proud of her.

30
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:30,063
You okay, Petey?

31
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:35,115
Hey, listen...

32
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:40,979
Hand over the cash.

33
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:42,278
- Yes, don't shoot.
- Come on.

34
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,043
- Here, here, here you go, don't shoot.
- Hurry up.

35
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,961
Empty the whole thing.
Come on, let's go, let's go.

36
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:04,678
No, Warden, you listen to me.

37
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:06,446
This man killed my father.

38
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,660
He cannot be released.

39
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:19,340
Detective!

40
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,715
- I have a bone to pick with you.
- Not a good time, Lucifer.

41
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,396
Agreed. It's a horrible time.

42
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:26,199
Dr. Linda just canceled my session.

43
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:29,969
She won't take my calls. I
think I... truly scared her off.

44
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:31,705
Something happened with your shrink?

45
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,474
Yes... and it's all your fault.

46
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:36,343
I mean, you're the one who
suggested I open up to her.

47
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:38,211
Well, smashing advice, Detective.

48
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:39,874
I don't have time for this right now.

49
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:41,351
What, do we have a case?

50
00:02:41,376 --> 00:02:42,959
I'm dealing with my own issues.

51
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:44,312
Oh! Even better.

52
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:46,243
- Let's solve those, shall we?
- Lucifer, stop!

53
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,391
I'm sorry, but there is no way
that you can help me right now.

54
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,060
You're just... you're too you.

55
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:55,577
Oh.

56
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,851
Yes, you're right, Detective.

57
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:01,334
Being me seems to be
a problem, doesn't it?

58
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:04,335
Everywhere I go, someone gets hurt.

59
00:03:04,648 --> 00:03:07,140
Well, clearly, I need
to be Not-Me instead.

60
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:09,943
Someone... better, more helpful.

61
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:12,226
- More boring.
- Okay...

62
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:14,981
got you a hot, soy latte, extra foam.

63
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,827
Thank you.

64
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:18,523
You okay, Chloe?

65
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:21,054
Mm-hmm. All good.

66
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:23,077
Just on my way out.

67
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:27,026
Something's seriously bothering her.

68
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:28,335
Hmm?

69
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,171
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

70
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:33,991
But you did.

71
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,540
This isn't right, Warden.

72
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:46,646
Joe Fields is a convicted
murderer, a cop killer.

73
00:03:46,715 --> 00:03:48,448
You're letting him off on family leave?

74
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,383
Detective, I understand how you feel.

75
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:54,450
Oh, respectfully, there is no
way you understand how I feel.

76
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:55,789
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:59,225
I know it's your father we're talking
about, but... this wasn't my call.

78
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:02,601
Fields has been a model
prisoner for over a decade.

79
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:04,935
He lobbied the Prisoner's
Rights Board and they said yes.

80
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,583
What's he gonna do with his leave?

81
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:08,054
Go destroy another family?

82
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,640
It's for his
granddaughter's christening.

83
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,982
My dad never got to go to his
granddaughter's christening.

84
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:13,606
Where is the justice in that?

85
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:15,175
I'm sorry, Detective.

86
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:16,788
I wish there was something we could do.

87
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:31,024
- Uh... Decker.
- Ah, Detective!

88
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:33,293
I think I may have found a
way to make myself useful.

89
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:35,344
What? It's not a good time, Lucifer.

90
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:37,806
What if I told you I
wasn't Lucifer anymore?

91
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:38,875
What?

92
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,283
I've decided to try and walk
a mile in another man's shoes.

93
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:44,241
See the world from a
different perspective.

94
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:47,340
I'm going to learn how to Douche.

95
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,447
I... may have to rephrase that one.

96
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:51,711
But do I have your permission
to follow Daniel and...

97
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:53,658
Yeah, do whatever. I got to go.

98
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:57,603
Hello?

99
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:02,973
- I'll take that as a yes.
- Yeah, I'm just following up on...

100
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:08,892
Uh, yeah.

101
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:42,328
Joe Fields.

102
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:44,003
Come out.

103
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:46,599
You're not gonna get away with this.

104
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,253
Joe Fields...

00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:06,808

106
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,422
I still don't get it, man.

107
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:16,145
Why the hell are you following
me around all of a sudden?

108
00:06:16,214 --> 00:06:18,548
Because I want to learn what
it's like to be you, Daniel.

109
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:20,265
Your approach to life intrigues me.

110
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:22,519
This from the guy who
punched me in the face?

111
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:23,695
That was last week.

112
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,383
Anyway, the detective
already agreed to it.

113
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:27,531
You're the department bottom,
so you have to do as she says.

114
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:29,025
What's this really about?

115
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,594
Look, people like you.

116
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:34,953
They find you helpful, like duct
tape or a trusty socket wrench.

117
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:37,289
I want you to teach me your secret.

118
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,459
I want you to show me how to be a tool.

119
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,430
You should stay out of the way.

120
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:45,174
Follow my lead. I call all
the shots, you understand?

121
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:47,944
This feels like something that
you would agree to, so yes.

122
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:52,018
What do we got?

123
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:54,684
Three gunshot victims,
shot execution style.

124
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,852
The van driver got a
single bullet to the neck,

125
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:58,344
guard got one to the head.

126
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,937
The prisoner got a
double tap to the chest.

127
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,992
Prisoner's name is Joe Fields.

128
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:05,226
- Wait a minute, the Joe Fields? As in...
- Yeah.

129
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:07,117
The guy that killed my father.

130
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,733
They targeted him while he was
vulnerable. This was a hit, Dan.

131
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:12,235
W-Wait a second.

132
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:16,039
The guy who killed your dad was just
murdered and you caught the case?

133
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:17,928
Yeah.

134
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:19,509
That is totally messed up.

135
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:21,611
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you okay?

136
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,446
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Fine?

137
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:24,847
You should be ecstatic.

138
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,817
Your father's killer just
got the ultimate punishment.

139
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,969
- Who was first on the scene?
- It was me.

140
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,930
I made the call.

141
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:41,497
- You followed him?
- Yeah. I know this looks bad.

142
00:07:41,522 --> 00:07:44,125
You stalked your father's murderer
right before he was killed.

143
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,302
That was a terrible move, Detective.

144
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:47,804
It was, right?

145
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:50,340
What were you planning to do, Chloe?

146
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,507
Crash the christening?

147
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:53,799
I don't know, Dan! I was angry.

148
00:07:53,824 --> 00:07:55,311
The guy killed my father.

149
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,706
He had the nerve to smile at me.

150
00:07:57,731 --> 00:07:59,449
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

151
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:01,217
No.

152
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:02,713
No, I don't.

153
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:05,392
But you still shouldn't
have followed him.

154
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:07,694
No one actually thinks
that you did this,

155
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,557
- but you know what it looks like, right?
- Yes, I do.

156
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,219
That's why I'm gonna
step away from the case.

157
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:14,251
It's a massive conflict of interest.

158
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,109
Don't worry, Chloe.
I'm gonna stay on this.

159
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:19,438
Yes, Detective Dan and I won't
rest until we catch the killer.

160
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:22,235
I don't think that it's a good idea
for Lucifer to be part of this case.

161
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,560
I agree.

162
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:26,230
I mean, the last thing this
case needs is a loose canon.

163
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:30,290
She needs someone like you. A
reliable, helpful, boring detective.

164
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,012
Now, the good news is that's me as
well now. So, the Dans are on the case.

165
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:34,728
Can't you take anything seriously, man?

166
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:37,194
I assure you I'm taking
this very seriously.

167
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,616
Oh, really? You're doing a
great job of showing that.

168
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:39,641
Guys.

169
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:42,980
It would mean a lot to me if
you worked together on this.

170
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:44,349
Hmm.

171
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:45,818
Of course, Chloe.

172
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:47,185
Okay, so...

173
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:49,925
whoa, this looks heavy.

174
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,546
Like waiting-for-STD-results heavy.

175
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:55,404
- I can come back later.
- Oh, no, it's fine. What is it?

176
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:57,584
Okay, so, I went through
all the prints from the van.

177
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:59,793
Okay? And all of them
cleared as prison personnel

178
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:03,290
except for an ex-con named Rodney Lam.

179
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:05,058
And get this...

180
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:08,032
he served time with Joe Fields.

181
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:10,997
- We're on it.
- We're on it.

182
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,133
Nice.

183
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,734
You working on a new role?

184
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,735
Hmm?

185
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,756
You're wearing that to an interview?

186
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,012
What's the job?

187
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,544
Preschool aide.

188
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:29,749
Do you like little kids?

189
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:33,253
I've dealt with filthy,
screaming humans before.

190
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:34,979
At least these are smaller.

191
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:36,890
I'm not sure this is you.

192
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,759
Ms. Perez says we should
choose jobs we love doing.

193
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:41,161
So, what about you, Maze?

194
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:43,101
What do you love to do?

195
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:46,633
I don't know.

196
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:49,069
Well... just be yourself.

197
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:52,409
Thanks, little human.

198
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,376
So good.

199
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:58,945
Well, the secret ingredient
is the Hawaiian bread.

200
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:01,715
And then you just cut a hole
in the middle for the egg.

201
00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:03,083
Can we have this for every meal?

202
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:05,619
You know, this one used
to be my favorite, too.

203
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:10,482
Grandpa used to bring me this sandwich
every Thursday after acting class.

204
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:13,551
Why don't you ever talk about Grandpa?

205
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:14,802
Mm...

206
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:18,598
I guess 'cause I miss him.

207
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:23,603
Do you think he would've
brought me sandwiches?

208
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,419
Mm-hmm.

209
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:27,580
I think he would've loved that, monkey.

210
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:31,933
Come on. It's time for your homework.

211
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:37,484
- Can I help you?
- Chloe Decker?

212
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:40,261
You're gonna pay for what you've done.

213
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,650
Okay, take it easy.

214
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,520
My father was a good man.

215
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,602
He didn't deserve to get
gunned down like an animal.

216
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:04,938
All he wanted was to meet my daughter.

217
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:07,079
You're Tina Fields.

218
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,367
You killed my father.

219
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,135
- I didn't...
- Thought you were getting revenge,

220
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,337
but you murdered an innocent man.

221
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,227
Tina, think about your baby.

222
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:17,575
If you pull that trigger,
you'll never hold her again.

223
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,508
Mommy? Who's here?

224
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:22,046
It's nothing, honey. Stay in your room!

225
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:25,238
I didn't kill your father.

226
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:27,346
You have to believe me.

227
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:29,666
Mommy, is everything okay?

228
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:32,058
Yeah, honey. Everything's fine, monkey.

229
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,157
Go back in your room.

230
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,026
Mommy just needs to help another mommy.

231
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,528
- Okay?
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

232
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:39,815
I was just so angry.

233
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,467
I never wanted to believe
my dad killed a cop.

234
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:46,724
And then today, when I got the video...

235
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:47,996
What video?

236
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:50,527
His lawyers sent this to me.

237
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:53,660
Said I was to receive it
upon the event of his death.

238
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:11,788
Ah. Sorry, not sorry. I had
to stop for a costume change.

239
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:13,976
Nice jacket. Thank you.

240
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,334
Oh, man, what the hell?

241
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,336
Are you here to work, or
are you here to play games?

242
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,845
I'll have you know I take the
School of Dan quite seriously,

243
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,196
even if it does involve
skinny-fit jeans.

244
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,344
Any news on our suspect?

245
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:27,868
His name is Rodney Lam.

246
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:30,581
A CI told me that he's obsessed with
this place. He eats here all the time.

247
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,008
So if he shows up,

248
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:34,032
let's try to see him before he sees us.

249
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,886
Oh, I get it now.

250
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,789
So your boring attire is
like camo for the average Joe.

251
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:41,736
Blend in, catch the baddie off guard.

252
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,027
Afterwards they'll
forget you're even there.

253
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,797
That is very clever, Daniel.

254
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:47,367
This guy has a serious
history of violence.

255
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:49,000
All right? He might have a gun.

256
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,268
He might take a hostage.
Who knows what he could do?

257
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:56,479
So he wouldn't, say, be openly eating a
nacho burrito dog, sitting on that car?

258
00:12:58,213 --> 00:13:00,645
- You watch my six.
- Absolutely.

259
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:07,338
Rodney Lam. LAPD. No sudden
moves. You're under arrest.

260
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:08,686
Rodney?

261
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:12,018
Maybe we blend in so well
he doesn't even see us.

262
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,058
Rodney Lam!

263
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,573
Good call, Rodney.

264
00:13:17,744 --> 00:13:19,565
Nice and easy.

265
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:21,323
Oh.

266
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:23,565
I just wanted one last meal.

267
00:13:23,682 --> 00:13:24,935
You want a bite? Aah!

268
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,526
No, thank you, we're
not doing carbs, are we?

269
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:36,823
Baby...

270
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:39,846
it's Daddy.

271
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,331
If, uh, you're watching this,

272
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:47,182
that means I'm dead.

273
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:49,403
Now, I know it sucks.

274
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:51,829
I don't know if you'll get this tomorrow

275
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:54,717
or, uh, 30 years from now,

276
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:58,143
but I want you to know the truth.

277
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:02,073
I didn't kill that cop.

278
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,486
I'm sorry for...

279
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:09,737
missing all your birthdays
and graduation... your life.

280
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:12,315
But Daddy wants you to know, baby...

281
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:15,433
I love you.

282
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:19,126
See? He's innocent.

283
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,642
Tina, I can tell your
dad loves you very much,

284
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:24,071
but... this video
doesn't prove anything.

285
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,431
His lawyers had this tape for 16 years.

286
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:28,409
He made them promise to
give it to me when he died.

287
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:30,136
That has to mean something.

288
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:32,807
16 years.

289
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,768
He recorded this the
day my father was killed.

290
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:49,463
Three minutes before he died.
What part of town is this?

291
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:51,899
It's our old apartment in Venice.

292
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,256
My father was killed across
the city in Korea town.

293
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:57,248
There's no way your father
could have recorded this

294
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,662
and gotten to the crime scene in time.

295
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:01,391
So it's true. He didn't do it.

296
00:15:02,562 --> 00:15:04,420
Which means whoever did kill my father

297
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,225
got away with this
and is still out there.

298
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,319
I did it.

299
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,453
I killed Joe Fields.

300
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:14,358
He disrespected me in the yard.

301
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:16,905
So when I heard that he was getting
some sort of temporary leave,

302
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,926
I knew that it was my
chance to make things right.

303
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:21,123
Well, there you have it.

304
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:24,391
Looks like our douching paid off.
The detective will be pleased.

305
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:27,398
And, you know, you make it look so easy.

306
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,787
Where did you say you
stopped that van again?

307
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:33,389
- Spring and College.
- We found it at Hill.

308
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:34,508
That's what I meant.

309
00:15:34,544 --> 00:15:37,016
Then you went and you emptied
the clip into the driver, right?

310
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:38,131
Hell yeah.

311
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:39,889
The driver died from a
single shot to the neck.

312
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:42,459
Dan One, why are you spoiling
a perfectly good confession?

313
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,383
You're lying, Rodney.

314
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:47,045
You don't know the facts
because you didn't do it.

315
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,557
Oh, I see what you did there.

316
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,070
Gosh, that's why you're Dan One.

317
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:55,796
Why are you confessing to
a crime you didn't commit?

318
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,756
Where are you going?

319
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:04,281
Well, just slow your roll for a second.

320
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:05,819
I think, for the sake of the detective,

321
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:08,257
I'm gonna take a time-out
from my Dansformation.

322
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:12,875
Oh, God.

323
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:16,422
Rodney, what do you
want out of life, hmm?

324
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:22,961
To be a good provider and
take care of my family.

325
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:25,062
So you confess to a
crime you didn't commit.

326
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:26,627
That's quite counter-intuitive.

327
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,295
Unless you got paid to do it.

328
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,698
You've been locked up
for most of your life.

329
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:33,364
That's all you know.

330
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:35,335
Now you're free, you've
got mouths to feed,

331
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:36,737
No way to earn.

332
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:40,974
Out here I'm no one, guys.

333
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,914
And if we don't arrest you,

334
00:16:43,158 --> 00:16:45,297
you don't get any money.

335
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,482
But if he really wants
back in the slammer,

336
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:50,984
then false confession's a
criminal offense, correct?

337
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:53,406
- Definitely an obstruction of justice.
- Mm.

338
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:54,855
Could get you a few years.

339
00:16:54,924 --> 00:16:57,191
We could get you a narcoleptic
lawyer and a merciless judge.

340
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,059
Who knows? With your prior history,

341
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:00,427
they might throw the book at you.

342
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:02,666
- Hmm?
- All right.

343
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,766
Here's how it went down.

344
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,580
I put word out that I needed money,

345
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:11,025
I was desperate.

346
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,014
And some people came
to me with an offer.

347
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:19,666
Linda, you there?

348
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:24,017
I need a character reference.

349
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:29,523
Linda?

350
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:45,138
Wha...?

351
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:48,141
Can you teleport?

352
00:17:49,297 --> 00:17:51,178
What? No.

353
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:52,880
You left your window open.

354
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:56,633
Hey, are you okay?

355
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,148
Wait.

356
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,041
You know, don't you?

357
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:04,902
He showed you.

358
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,727
I saw his face.

359
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:11,289
Well, you're taking it
really well, actually.

360
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:16,136
Linda, you're not afraid of me, are you?

361
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:18,273
Of course I am.

362
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:21,469
You're a demon.

363
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:28,250
He told me.

364
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:31,414
I thought it was a sexual metaphor.

365
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:33,211
Well, you're not wrong there.

366
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:35,852
But you really are one.

367
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:40,103
Aren't you?

368
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:43,430
Yeah... I am.

369
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:48,101
Is that really so bad?

370
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:51,905
Please go.

371
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:15,295
Ah, Detective...

372
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,264
Joe Fields didn't kill my father.

373
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,632
- Wait, what?
- He's a fall guy.

374
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:22,135
He made a false confession in exchange
for regular payments to his daughter.

375
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,770
All these years she
didn't touch the money.

376
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,505
She probably thought it was stolen.

377
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:27,307
I have the account number
that made the transfers.

378
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,943
Well, we just met a chap
who did the same thing.

379
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:31,044
What?

380
00:19:31,113 --> 00:19:33,113
Rodney got paid to
make a false confession.

381
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:36,450
Money was transferred into his wife's
account right after we arrested him.

382
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:39,052
This is the same account
that paid Rodney Lam's wife.

383
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:40,479
That's no coincidence.

384
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:43,390
So whoever killed Joe
Fields killed my father...

385
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:45,726
and is still out there.

386
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:48,995
Hey, don't blame yourself.

387
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:52,315
- You were just a kid back then.
- Yeah, well, I'm not anymore.

388
00:19:59,777 --> 00:20:01,472
Hey, rookie!

389
00:20:01,497 --> 00:20:02,958
You're late!

390
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,511
I thought I was early.

391
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,527
Your FTO's been looking
all over for you.

392
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,222
What, you want to get
written up your first day?

393
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:11,136
- No, I-I honestly thought...
- Knock it off, McMillan.

394
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:13,101
Get back to work.

395
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:17,066
You gotta watch out for this guy.
He gave me hell on my first day, too.

396
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,652
- Hi.
- Hi.

397
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,276
I'm Dan Espinoza.

398
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,644
- Chloe Decker.
- Nice to meet you.

399
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:25,152
Can I help you with those?

400
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,881
Sure.

401
00:20:27,754 --> 00:20:29,751
Come on, I'll show you around.

402
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,629
The most important place,
first, is the kitchen.

403
00:20:32,654 --> 00:20:34,856
We got bagels over
here if you want them.

404
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:36,785
Interrogation's that way...

405
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,926
and the lab is that way.

406
00:20:41,898 --> 00:20:43,832
Are you John Decker's daughter?

407
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:48,265
I-I'm so sorry.

408
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,367
He's kind of a legend around here.

409
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:53,422
It was a little before my time,
but he sounded like a great guy.

410
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,547
The best.

411
00:20:57,777 --> 00:21:00,508
Um... bagel?

412
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:14,195
Never fear, Luci-Dan is here.

413
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,975
Or is it Douche-ifer? Actually, it's
got more of a ring to it, hasn't it?

414
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,353
- Why are you two dressed the same?
- Don't ask.

415
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,924
The bank account traces
back to a bathhouse on Pico.

416
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,316
It's a dummy front for a
Russian syndicate in L.A.

417
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:28,689
So the real killer is somehow
connected to the Russian mob?

418
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:32,013
We have a suspect. His name is
Boris Sokolov. Owns the bathhouse.

419
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,947
Connects criminals but
keeps his own hands clean.

420
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:35,369
No one has ever been able to get to him.

421
00:21:35,408 --> 00:21:36,408
Yet.

422
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:37,845
Detective Dan and I won't rest

423
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:40,291
until we get to the bottom
of this, I promise you.

424
00:21:46,363 --> 00:21:49,597
Wow. Look who bought a
ticket to the gun show!

425
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,932
Divorce becomes you, Detective.

426
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:52,534
I do not sound like that.

427
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:53,601
Of course we do.

428
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,579
We sound like two totally normal dudes.

429
00:21:55,604 --> 00:21:56,970
Will you cut it with the "we" stuff?

430
00:21:56,995 --> 00:21:59,470
I need you to stop playing
around and take this seriously.

431
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:01,609
You got it, partner.
This is gonna be epic.

432
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:03,311
Lucifer, I'm not kidding.

433
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,701
Very well.

434
00:22:04,726 --> 00:22:06,443
So, what's the plan?

435
00:22:07,263 --> 00:22:09,850
Well, you are exactly the kind of
person that Boris would deal with,

436
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,271
so I need you to approach him,
and try make a deal with him.

437
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:14,842
All right. Tell him I need a fall
guy for a murder I'm gonna commit?

438
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,028
- Exactly.
- Hmm.

439
00:22:16,053 --> 00:22:18,428
But like I said before, he spooks
really easily. So, don't go...

440
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:19,794
Boris!

441
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:21,740
Like that.

442
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:25,066
Hello there.

443
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,982
Uh, I'd like to talk with you, if I may.

444
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:31,942
- I don't know you.
- You don't.

445
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,834
So, let's fix that, shall we?

446
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:35,357
The name's Dan.

447
00:22:39,974 --> 00:22:42,381
- Deputy Warden's here for you.
- Oh.

448
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,192
Joe Fields' personal effects.

449
00:22:45,217 --> 00:22:49,049
We usually turn those over to the
next of kin within 72 hours, but, uh...

450
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:50,550
I thought it might help you, Detective.

451
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,068
Thank you.

452
00:22:56,012 --> 00:22:57,928
This is great. Thank you.

453
00:22:58,138 --> 00:23:01,194
Well, if there's anything else I
can do to help, please, let me know.

454
00:23:01,411 --> 00:23:02,732
Thanks.

455
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:12,472
I know.

456
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,236
Joe Fields isn't my case.

457
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:16,751
I'll just... I'll leave it for Dan.

458
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:19,486
Well, I mean, nothing is stopping me

459
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:22,048
from helping out with
the Joe Fields case,

460
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:24,818
while you tackle your dad's, right?

461
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:28,255
I mean, if it's the same
killer... divide and conquer.

462
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,719
- You don't have to do that.
- I kind of already started.

463
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,061
Uh, right over here. Thanks.

464
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:38,698
Last six months of your dad's paperwork.

465
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:41,922
You know, incident reports,
booking slips, arrest records.

466
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:44,405
I mean, half of it's on
microfiche and, like, papyrus,

467
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,616
but I don't know, I thought
it would help, you know,

468
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:49,741
to figure out what your dad was
working on when he was killed.

469
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:51,144
See?

470
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,913
I knew you were a hugger.

471
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:57,217
So. What do you got so far?

472
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:58,944
It was a clever cover-up.

473
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:03,281
But what kind of robber would
be so well connected? You know?

474
00:24:03,306 --> 00:24:05,926
They gave Joe Fields
everything he needed

475
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:07,327
to pose as my father's killer.

476
00:24:07,396 --> 00:24:08,476
I mean, he confessed.

477
00:24:08,501 --> 00:24:11,138
And he had the gun that
was used in the shooting.

478
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,066
Ballistics confirmed that
it was the murder weapon.

479
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:15,869
Well, yeah. No wonder
it was case closed.

480
00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:19,445
Yeah. I-I... These prints
are un-I.D.'d from the scene,

481
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,941
but they could be the killer's.

482
00:24:20,966 --> 00:24:22,742
And did they ping
anyone in the database?

483
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:23,910
No. Dead end.

484
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:25,846
All right.

485
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,719
Maybe I can dig a little deeper.

486
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,253
So, tell me.

487
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:35,822
Why would I help you two?

488
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,126
Because we're just two regular
fellows who need your help, Boris.

489
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:40,760
I don't believe you.

490
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:44,090
- Mr. Sokolov...
- People call me human lie detector

491
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:47,100
because I look in my clients' eyes,

492
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:48,934
and I can know if
they're telling the truth.

493
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:51,004
Well, I respect that, Boris.

494
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,406
I have a trick myself, that's
quite similar, actually.

495
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:54,902
And you're right.

496
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:59,786
We haven't told you the whole
truth. So... here it goes.

497
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,018
I want someone dead.

498
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,418
Who?

499
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:06,726
Lucifer Morningstar.

500
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:10,848
And what has this person
done to deserve death?

501
00:25:10,873 --> 00:25:12,592
Well, he hurts people.

502
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:15,595
And not just his enemies,

503
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:18,085
those close to him, as well.

504
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,432
In fact, I think he
hurts them most of all.

505
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,066
He's right.

506
00:25:25,113 --> 00:25:27,874
The guy's violent, he's
a total loose cannon.

507
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,723
Yes. Believe me, when I say, Boris,

508
00:25:30,748 --> 00:25:33,747
that the world would be a
better place without him.

509
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:37,785
You both have true hatred for this man.

510
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:39,746
Apparently so.

511
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:42,915
Do we have a deal?

512
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:53,391
Go and take care of this Lucifer person.

513
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:55,743
I'll find you your patsy.

514
00:25:58,594 --> 00:26:00,026
Lovely.

515
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:14,120
I hear you won't talk.

516
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:18,225
Okay.

517
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:22,928
We have hard evidence linking your
bank account to two different murders.

518
00:26:22,953 --> 00:26:24,670
What do you have to say about that?

519
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:29,336
I heard you're a human
lie detector, is that true?

520
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,842
One of those murders was my father.

521
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:37,544
It's why I'm not on the case

522
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:40,475
and it's why I'm not supposed to
be in this room talking to you.

523
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:43,314
But I'm not a cop right now, Boris.

524
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:46,201
I'm a daughter.

525
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:50,139
And I'm not gonna let this go.

526
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:52,603
So, you point me in
the right direction...

527
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:55,951
or I swear to God, I'm gonna
make your life a living hell.

528
00:26:57,803 --> 00:26:59,636
I believe you.

529
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:01,928
His name was John Decker.

530
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:06,686
I admit to nothing

531
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,576
but I did once hear

532
00:27:09,645 --> 00:27:11,211
about a John Decker.

533
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,342
And as I recall,

534
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,998
he was sniffing somewhere
he didn't belong.

535
00:27:17,023 --> 00:27:21,021
What do you mean? My father was a
beat cop at a robbery gone wrong.

536
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,339
Hey, man.

537
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:42,767
I just want to say nice work earlier.

538
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,367
Was it? Yeah.

539
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:46,157
We got Boris.

540
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:48,705
And I don't know how you
lied to him like that.

541
00:27:48,774 --> 00:27:51,474
- Well, it's simple. I didn't lie.
- Well...

542
00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:53,743
Well, then you have
some serious issues, bro.

543
00:27:53,812 --> 00:27:56,751
Obviously. I mean, why do you
think I'm doing all this Dan-ing?

544
00:27:56,776 --> 00:28:00,917
Yet, you know, I'm still no
closer to figuring out your secret.

545
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:03,320
- Because I don't have a secret.
- Well, you must.

546
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:05,722
One that explains how
you're able to be so...

547
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:07,587
you know, frustratingly you.

548
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:08,720
- You see, man...
- Hmm?

549
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:10,407
I try to compliment you, and...

550
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:11,800
Hey.

551
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:14,368
I think my father's death was a hit.

552
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,822
I-It sounds like he
stumbled onto something huge,

553
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,525
and-and someone took him out for it.

554
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,861
Chloe, do you want me
to help you with this?

555
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:22,729
No. I-I... I got it on
this end. But thank you.

556
00:28:24,308 --> 00:28:25,874
Well.

557
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:27,932
Where to now, Twinsy? Hmm?

558
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:41,316
Wow.

559
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:44,097
- What's the job this time?
- Topless Maids.

560
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:46,963
But apparently, I still
have to do some cleaning.

561
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:49,222
Screw that.

562
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:51,979
- You okay?
- No. I just...

563
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:55,472
I can't find the right job.

564
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,675
My only friend stopped talking to me.

565
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:00,076
"Only"?

566
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:05,026
What's all of this?

567
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:06,854
My dad's stuff from storage.

568
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:10,236
After he died, the department
boxed up his desk and sent it to us.

569
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:11,472
You find anything?

570
00:29:11,768 --> 00:29:13,165
Not yet.

571
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,659
One of the cases he
assisted on got him killed,

572
00:29:15,684 --> 00:29:18,009
and I have to figure out
which one it is, but...

573
00:29:18,034 --> 00:29:21,517
It's funny, he always talked about
how he didn't want to be a detective,

574
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:23,886
how it was too much work, and yet...

575
00:29:23,911 --> 00:29:26,469
here he was doing all
this detective work.

576
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:28,722
Guess the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

577
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:31,141
Hmm.

578
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:33,009
I tried a bunch of stuff, but...

579
00:29:33,078 --> 00:29:35,970
after my dad died, this just felt right.

580
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:41,151
Yeah, but like... how do
you know what feels right?

581
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:43,320
Mm...

582
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:45,078
You just know.

583
00:30:11,283 --> 00:30:13,316
No secret, indeed.

584
00:30:13,385 --> 00:30:16,019
So, what's behind door
number one, Daniel?

585
00:30:25,051 --> 00:30:27,051
Oh, no, no. Not this.

586
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:33,403
Better a snuff movie, a human centipede,

587
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,106
clown porn, but not improv!

588
00:30:36,174 --> 00:30:38,208
Hey, thanks for picking me up, man.

589
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:39,442
What's your name?

590
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:41,765
Lucifer... Morningstar.

591
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:44,180
Wait, I'm hitchhiking with the Devil?

592
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:46,241
Oh, yes indeed.

593
00:30:46,266 --> 00:30:48,685
I didn't expect the Devil
to be driving around L.A.

594
00:30:48,754 --> 00:30:50,555
Oh, yes, I live here, actually.

595
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,688
I do whatever I want.

596
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:54,391
Oh, like what?

597
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,926
Drink, mostly. And insult people.

598
00:30:56,995 --> 00:30:58,138
You ponce.

599
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:02,966
- You got a girlfriend?
- Yes. Lovely.

600
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:05,587
- Can I borrow her?
- But she's the love of my life.

601
00:31:05,612 --> 00:31:06,680
Perfect.

602
00:31:08,055 --> 00:31:11,304
- Let's make it a threesome.
- That is not me!

603
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:14,016
- Relax, you'll get your turn.
- What's your problem, huh?

604
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,913
You gotta sign up, pal.

605
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:19,416
Good scene, man. You crushed it.

606
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:21,001
You too, pal.

607
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:22,758
Detective Douche!

608
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:26,532
How dare you subject me to
this pathetic caricature?

609
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:29,242
You have the nerve to stand there
and accuse me of making fun of you,

610
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:30,827
after everything you've
done in the last couple days.

611
00:31:30,852 --> 00:31:32,226
Hell, ever since we first met.

612
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:34,993
- Detective Douche, I...
- Dan! My name is Dan.

613
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:38,735
Or Detective Espinoza.

614
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:40,126
Right.

615
00:31:40,352 --> 00:31:41,805
Dan.

616
00:31:41,873 --> 00:31:45,923
I only did it because you're
everything that I'm not.

617
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:48,545
Boring, helpful.

618
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:51,163
- Your life is simple.
- Oh.

619
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:52,773
- My life?
- Yes.

620
00:31:52,818 --> 00:31:54,717
Come on, man. You're
rich. You're handsome.

621
00:31:54,786 --> 00:31:56,753
You drive fancy cars,
you date hot girls.

622
00:31:56,822 --> 00:31:59,189
You have no kids, you
have no responsibilities.

623
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:01,090
How much more simple can life get?

624
00:32:01,115 --> 00:32:02,512
Afraid you don't know the whole story.

625
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:04,761
Well, fine. Tell me.

626
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,067
You see, that's just it, Dan.

627
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,321
The last person I opened up to, I hurt.

628
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:17,098
A lot.

629
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:22,151
Let alone how I've hurt
my own flesh and blood.

630
00:32:28,818 --> 00:32:31,145
It's all I seem to be able to do.

631
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:37,935
Welcome to the club.

632
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:43,485
You think Chloe divorced me
because I'm a perfect guy?

633
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:50,273
I did a lot of things that
I'm not... proud of, man.

634
00:32:50,342 --> 00:32:52,575
And I'm just trying
to work through them.

635
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,110
What, through mime?

636
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,178
What do you do, stuff your feelings
in a box and throw away the key?

637
00:32:57,203 --> 00:32:58,882
It's not mime.

638
00:32:59,226 --> 00:33:00,817
It's improv.

639
00:33:00,852 --> 00:33:05,088
And I started the class after the
divorce because I needed a distraction.

640
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:09,758
Perspective.

641
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,523
A way to step out of my own skin
for a bit. I don't know, I...

642
00:33:16,484 --> 00:33:18,902
I'm not a spontaneous guy.

643
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,544
I don't live in the moment like you do.

644
00:33:21,806 --> 00:33:26,145
So, you were trying to
learn how not to Douche.

645
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:30,410
Yeah, I guess that's one way to put it.

646
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:37,973
Don't tell Chloe.

647
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,924
All right?

648
00:33:44,785 --> 00:33:45,907
Oh.

649
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,106
Oh, it's you. Hello, Detective.

650
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:53,069
- I got your message.
- Oh, hi.

651
00:33:53,138 --> 00:33:55,239
Feeling back to your old self?

652
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:58,160
I suppose. So I doubt
I'll be of much help.

653
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,911
Ooh. On second thoughts, it looks
like I came at just the right time.

654
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,910
I've have nothing to say to you.

655
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:05,782
Thanks to you, I lost my friend.

656
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,317
Friend? What friend?

657
00:34:07,352 --> 00:34:08,351
The doctor.

658
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:09,852
I was just working through some stuff.

659
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:13,271
- I didn't think that showing...
- See, that's the problem.

660
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,522
I wish for just one second

661
00:34:15,547 --> 00:34:18,492
you would think about
someone other than yourself.

662
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,463
And there we have it, ladies.

663
00:34:20,532 --> 00:34:21,798
My wake of destruction.

664
00:34:21,866 --> 00:34:23,666
Anyone else you need harmed, hmm?

665
00:34:23,702 --> 00:34:26,069
Okay, Lucifer? Enough.

666
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:28,685
I'm close to something, I can feel it.

667
00:34:29,008 --> 00:34:30,303
Help.

668
00:34:30,662 --> 00:34:32,178
Fine.

669
00:34:35,592 --> 00:34:38,060
Actually, there is something
that's been bugging me, Detective.

670
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:40,530
Do you mind if I play the me's
advocate for just a second?

671
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:41,662
Go ahead.

672
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:44,115
Well, there's one part of this
puzzle that just doesn't fit.

673
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,357
Joe Fields.

674
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:46,439
Wha... why doesn't he fit?

675
00:34:46,507 --> 00:34:48,741
Well, you said that he smiled
at you when he was released.

676
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:50,918
Yeah, I forgot about that.

677
00:34:50,943 --> 00:34:54,113
So, why would an innocent man
smile at the daughter of a man

678
00:34:54,138 --> 00:34:55,928
he took the fall for killing?

679
00:34:57,756 --> 00:34:59,396
He wouldn't.

680
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:01,197
What are you looking for?

681
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:03,553
The prints that Ella found
on Fields' transport van.

682
00:35:03,578 --> 00:35:05,193
But those only gave us Rodney Lam.

683
00:35:05,218 --> 00:35:06,659
But there were other prints.

684
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:08,894
But they cleared as prison personnel.

685
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:10,763
Like Deputy Warden Perry Smith.

686
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:13,265
- These are his prints.
- What, you think the warden did it?

687
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:16,326
Well, deputy wardens are
desk jockeys, bureaucrats.

688
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,938
So his prints shouldn't have been there.

689
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:20,660
Yes. What if Fields
wasn't smiling at me?

690
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,215
What if he was smiling at the
person next to me? The warden?

691
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,295
So you think that Joe Fields and
the warden had some kind of deal?

692
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,521
- Yes.
- What, Fields serves 16 years...

693
00:35:29,553 --> 00:35:31,325
as a fall guy and then
suddenly has a change of heart?

694
00:35:31,387 --> 00:35:34,154
Well, he had a grandkid.
Maybe he got sick of the deal,

695
00:35:34,223 --> 00:35:35,556
told the warden he wanted out?

696
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:38,895
And the warden said yes, but
only as a ploy to kill Fields.

697
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,927
Right.

698
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:45,666
Deputy Warden Perry Smith

699
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:48,302
worked in the prison
system for 20 years.

700
00:35:48,371 --> 00:35:51,171
Started as a guard. He's our guy.

701
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,773
Let's go.

702
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:54,742
Right, well, wouldn't
Dan be more helpful?

703
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,404
What?

704
00:35:58,154 --> 00:36:00,180
If I'm gonna take this guy down,

705
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:02,649
I need my partner

706
00:36:02,818 --> 00:36:05,452
and that's you. Lucifer Morningstar.

707
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:08,484
Right.

708
00:36:10,493 --> 00:36:12,226
Good-bye!

709
00:36:12,294 --> 00:36:14,461
I guess I'll just clean up.

710
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:17,731
I'm dressed for it, apparently.

711
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,440
It looks like the cavalry's arrived.

712
00:36:26,509 --> 00:36:29,042
- Dan, what's happening?
- I'm so sorry, Chloe.

713
00:36:29,111 --> 00:36:31,578
- The warden gave us the slip.
- What?

714
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,466
Are you okay, Detective?

715
00:36:42,502 --> 00:36:45,229
This whole time, my father's
killer's been out there.

716
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,206
And today I let him get away.

717
00:36:47,261 --> 00:36:49,267
So, no, I feel like a failure.

718
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:51,987
What... you are nothing of the sort.

719
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:53,600
Detective,

720
00:36:54,472 --> 00:36:58,495
for the first time in 16 years,
you know who the real killer is.

721
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:01,574
It seems to me that
justice is in your sights.

722
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,323
You're right.

723
00:37:03,745 --> 00:37:04,978
I put out a BOLO.

724
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:08,331
FBI and DHS are looking at
airports, border crossings.

725
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,351
Well, I've still no idea what
that means, but it sounds good.

726
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:13,186
It means I'm gonna
get the son of a bitch.

727
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:15,288
Right. Well...

728
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:18,534
in the meantime, since
your offspring's with Dan...

729
00:37:18,597 --> 00:37:19,683
What?

730
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:22,695
I'm simply suggesting that you
open a bottle of wine, or three,

731
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,198
for yourself, and just have a nice...

732
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:36,617
Shut up!

733
00:37:38,313 --> 00:37:40,414
Well...

734
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,195
Bravo, Maze.

735
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,087
- How did you get...
- I was bored.

736
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:49,689
Had nothing to do.

737
00:37:49,724 --> 00:37:54,574
So, I tracked down the scumbag myself.

738
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:57,099
It just... felt right.

739
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:04,170
It's gonna feel good to call this in.

740
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,838
What? No, hold on, Detective.

741
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:08,374
- You have a choice to make here.
- Yes.

742
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:10,109
So much punishment.

743
00:38:10,178 --> 00:38:12,045
Mm. Order off-menu for once.

744
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:14,216
Maze and I certainly won't judge.

745
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:22,130
You took my father away.

746
00:38:23,094 --> 00:38:26,106
You tore apart my family.

747
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,233
I tried to get him to drop it.

748
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:36,419
But he wouldn't take the hint.

749
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:38,971
That's all you have to say?

750
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,840
After everything you've done?

751
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:43,643
No, no, no. No, no, no. I-I'm sorry.

752
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,809
I'll give you all the
players in my operation.

753
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:47,249
I'll give you money.

754
00:38:56,677 --> 00:38:57,911
Oh.

755
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,684
We'll see how you do in
the prison that you ran.

756
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:09,677
I'll bet your inmates
will treat you real nice.

757
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:13,933
No. No, please, please.

758
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:15,825
I can get you whatever you want.

759
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:20,731
All I want is for you to know
that John Decker's kid got you.

760
00:39:31,593 --> 00:39:33,098
Linda.

761
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:36,348
I know you're in there.

762
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:39,823
I have something to show you.

763
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:45,784
My first check.

764
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:48,441
I got paid.

765
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,721
As a bounty hunter!

766
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:55,481
LAPD paid me this finder's fee
to track down some human scumbag.

767
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,562
Hunting humans is a job.

768
00:39:58,587 --> 00:40:00,420
Who knew?

769
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,406
First thing I wanted to do was
to celebrate with my friend.

770
00:40:11,056 --> 00:40:12,889
That's you, Linda.

771
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,664
Okay.

772
00:40:41,453 --> 00:40:42,656
I just...

773
00:40:43,676 --> 00:40:45,226
wanted you to know.

774
00:41:00,515 --> 00:41:03,149
Maze, how can we be friends?

775
00:41:05,148 --> 00:41:06,453
You're a...

776
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:08,530
you're a demon.

777
00:41:09,476 --> 00:41:12,069
Lucifer's the Devil.

778
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:15,985
How am I supposed to get over that?

779
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:20,523
He's still the same old Lucifer.

780
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,802
You're still Dr. Linda Martin.

781
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:24,704
And I'm still Maze.

782
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:26,852
What's changed?

783
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:31,859
Come on.

784
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:35,882
Let Mazikeen Smith buy you a drink.

785
00:41:39,787 --> 00:41:42,054
Maybe I'll devour
your soul or something.

786
00:41:57,338 --> 00:41:59,470
- Here you go, monkey.
- Mmm. Yummy.

787
00:41:59,495 --> 00:42:00,752
- Lucif...
- Mmm.

788
00:42:00,777 --> 00:42:02,348
Why should the child go first?

789
00:42:02,377 --> 00:42:04,577
I'm far larger. And hungrier.

790
00:42:04,646 --> 00:42:05,678
It's okay, Mommy.

791
00:42:05,747 --> 00:42:07,713
He must've really wanted it.

792
00:42:08,816 --> 00:42:11,595
Is she always so... her?

793
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,126
Baby, it's time to get dressed.

794
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:17,523
What are you doing?

795
00:42:17,592 --> 00:42:19,725
- Bye, Lucifer!
- Yes.

796
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:27,073
Yes.

797
00:42:30,385 --> 00:42:32,596
I don't care much for my dad.

798
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:37,310
But... you clearly... care about yours.

799
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:40,604
Which is why you followed
in his footsteps, I suppose.

800
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:42,581
Hmm.

801
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,440
So, w-what I'm trying to say is...

802
00:42:47,797 --> 00:42:49,799
I think he would be proud of you.

803
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:54,060
Oh. My apologies, Detective.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

804
00:42:54,128 --> 00:42:55,606
No, no, it's...

805
00:42:56,973 --> 00:43:00,640
Wh... Then why are you... crying?

806
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:07,340
- Just... Oh, just shut up.
- What...

807
00:43:20,784 --> 00:43:24,802
