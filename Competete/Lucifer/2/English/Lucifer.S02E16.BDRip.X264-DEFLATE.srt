00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:03,838
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
Everything I felt for her

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:06,007
was smoke and mirrors,
courtesy of Dad.

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:07,842
DAN:
<i>Did you sleep with me</i>
t <i>o get Intel on this case?</i>

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,928
- MOM: <i>Of course.</i>
- What are you doing here?

5
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,514
You don't let your girl
go into enemy territory alone.

6
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:14,516
The piece is here.

7
00:00:14,683 --> 00:00:16,184
My last words were a clue.

8
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:17,727
A clue?
A clue to what?

9
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:19,479
Well, you're the one who has
to figure that out, aren't you?

10
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:20,939
LUCIFER:
<i>And you really think</i>
t <i>hat this is</i>

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:21,940
the Flaming Sword?

12
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:23,316
It's so not flaming.

13
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,110
That's because only you,

14
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:27,404
my Lightbringer,
can ignite it.

15
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:30,198
That's it.
It's all I've got.

16
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:32,200
Okay. Then we'll fix it.
There's plenty of time.

17
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,910
MOM:
<i>Just not for me.</i>

18
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:36,579
I do intend to use
the Flaming Sword

19
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:37,998
<i>to cut through
the Gates of Heaven.</i>

20
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:38,873
<i>Once I do that,</i>

21
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:39,708
I plan on

22
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,042
kicking Mom into Heaven

23
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:43,294
and slamming the gates
on her backside.

24
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:44,629
Won't God destroy her?

25
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:46,589
Hopefully, they
tear each other apart.

26
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,133
Then they'll both get
what they deserve.

27
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:57,642
I'm not the Devil,
I'm just a man who's delusional.

28
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:01,813
I made it all up.
I made it all... up.

29
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,481
(chuckles)

30
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:08,403
I'm doing great.

31
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,322
Great.

32
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,242
Great is...good...

33
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,578
Okay, good talk.

34
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:17,829
Same time next week?

35
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:19,998
Uh, sorry, it's just that...

36
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:22,417
some of the things
that you said

37
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:23,918
in our last session

38
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:26,796
raised some
issues for me.

39
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:29,340
- Do tell.
- So this secret plan

40
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:30,884
to cut through the
Gates of Heaven...

41
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,595
Well, actually, we've hit
a bit of a snag with that.

42
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:35,305
The Flaming Sword's kaput.

43
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,182
Now, we can't work out
what's wrong with it,

44
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,601
and until we can, we're in
a bit of a holding pattern.

45
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,644
- Ah, that's a relief.
- Well, why would you say that?

46
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:44,355
God and His ex having
a fight to the death?

47
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,859
Sounds kind of bad for,
you know, humanity.

48
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:49,194
Oh, you'll probably be fine.

49
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:50,487
<i>Probably?</i>

50
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:52,947
That's not exactly
reassuring.

51
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:54,866
What does Maze
think of your plan?

52
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:56,284
Well, I don't know.
I haven't told her.

53
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,244
Hence the secret part
of the secret plan.

54
00:01:58,453 --> 00:01:59,954
- She's your best friend.
- Yes, well,

55
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,790
as much as I love
my little sex thug,

56
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:04,375
Maze can do things that she
thinks are in my best interest

57
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:07,337
that turn out to be,
well, disastrous.

58
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:08,421
And I can't afford that.

59
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:10,673
- Hmm.
- But the good news is

60
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:13,301
she's busy focusing
on her new bestie right now.

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,677
The detective.

62
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:16,554
They're practically
inseparable.

63
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,021
Hey, roomie.

64
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,398
- Where you going?
- Maze, hey.

65
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,692
Um, I'm on my way to work.
I'm running late.

66
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,694
Oh, no, but you haven't
had breakfast, come on.

67
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:35,323
♪ Mm! ♪

68
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,491
No, I'm...
(hard toast clanks on plate)

69
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,119
Oh, yeah, no,
I'm not hungry.

70
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:40,703
Yeah, I know, the whole

71
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,580
boring domestic thing--
not my jam.

72
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:43,623
I should stick to managing

73
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,458
the social part
of our friendship.

74
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,460
- You want to kick
someone's ass?
- Maze,

75
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,296
I feel like, you know, we've
been hanging out a lot lately.

76
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,131
And I think

77
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:55,135
perhaps we should expand
our circle of friends.

78
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:56,427
I got you, Decker.

79
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,720
Yeah? You do?

80
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,472
I smell what you're
stepping in.

81
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:02,892
(snaps fingers)
Trust me.

82
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,019
CHLOE:
<i>You know,
you should give a Maze a call.</i>

83
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,604
Hasn't it been a while
since you two hung out?

84
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,940
Tired of tripping over
her sex toys, are you?

85
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,400
I didn't say that.

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,652
I just think it would
do her, and me, some good

87
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,529
if she wasn't around
all the time.

88
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,156
Well, here's the thing.
Maze is like one of those

89
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:18,408
little baby birds that
imprints on whatever's near.

90
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,244
Sadly, that's you.
You are the new me.

91
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:24,122
I don't want to be you.
I just want some space.

92
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:26,791
Oh. Eventually
Maze will find her place,

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,960
but until then, what's
the worst that could happen?

94
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,670
Murder. Confirmed.

95
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:33,298
Blunt-force trauma
to the back of the head.

96
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:37,302
The victim got hit
with this backgammon board.

97
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,636
Not very sportsmanlike.

98
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:41,014
Hmm-mm.
He was an orderly.

99
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,433
Toby Mulligan, 32.

100
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:45,643
- Body was found here.
- Okay.

101
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,353
They interview the staff
or the patients yet?

102
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,856
No, not yet. It's a
psychiatric hospital,

103
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,733
so the staff didn't want
the patients wigging out

104
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,151
over the dead body.

105
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,611
They've been busy
moving everyone

106
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:55,278
to a different floor.

107
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:57,155
I love the mentally ill.

108
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:59,532
I mean, who isn't amused by
someone who thinks they're Elvis

109
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,910
or Napoleon or
Wesley Snipes?

110
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:02,911
Who found the body?

111
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,329
- DAN: God.
- Ah! See?!

112
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,331
God Johnson, he's a patient.
He's right in there.

113
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,875
DAN: The guy actually
thinks he's God.

114
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,043
He changed his name
and everything.

115
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,795
- Oh. You two should have
a lot to talk about.
- Yes.

116
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,464
I would like to have a chat
with the Almighty.

117
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:16,216
Cool your jets, man, all right?
There's a whole bunch

118
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,051
of bureaucratic hoops
to jump through

119
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,177
to set up an interview.

120
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,095
The hospital administrator
has all the info.

121
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,860
Well, hello, God.

122
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,779
Hello, my son.

123
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:39,280
(laughs, stops short)

124
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,282
Right, yes, I suppose that
would be the standard way

125
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:42,825
to greet your children.

126
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:44,160
Nice touch.

127
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,287
What can I do for you?

128
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:49,207
Well, it's what I can do
for you that's exciting.

129
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,502
See, I can reveal the truth
about the Supreme Being

130
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,170
you've chosen to impersonate.

131
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:55,964
I bet you wanted
to be God because

132
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:58,633
He's benevolent,
all-powerful, yada yada.

133
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,762
But in actual
fact, He's a dick.

134
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,724
Look, if you want
to be angry with me,

135
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,352
you just go right on ahead.

136
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,981
I can be anything
you need me to be.

137
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:16,943
Right, enough of this
idle chit-chat.

138
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:20,071
Time to tell me what
the charade's really about.

139
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,364
What do you desire?

140
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:22,240
Hmm?

141
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:24,242
To avoid a vengeful ex-wife?

142
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,995
Years of back taxes?
What's your game?

143
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,916
Is this a staring contest?

144
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,960
'Cause, you know,
I'm pretty good at those.

145
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,379
How is this possible?

146
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,632
Oh, right, yes,
I bet you're on

147
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:41,551
some really amazing
drugs, aren't you?

148
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,761
If so, share-zies.

149
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,472
You're not supposed
to be in here.

150
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,765
Oh, never mind.

151
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm done with this
fraud, anyway.

152
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:52,353
It was real good
seeing you, Samael.

153
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:55,356
What did you say?

154
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,361
Dad?

155
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:02,530
♪♪

156
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:13,166
- Has Dad ever visited
Earth before?
- Not that I'm aware of.

157
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,001
And besides, why would
He do so now?

158
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,753
Mm. I don't know,
maybe because

159
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,171
we're plotting
to overthrow Him.

160
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,506
Even so, Luci, that's
not the way Dad operates.

161
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,091
- (sighs)
- If He has a problem,

162
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,760
He sends an emissary,
like me,

163
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,054
or maybe a burning bush.

164
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:30,266
So how does this God Johnson
know Samael, hmm?

165
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:31,267
My name.

166
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:33,353
Oh, wait, I know.

167
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,645
- You do?
- The Internet!

168
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:36,981
It's truly amazing
what you can find online.

169
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,399
Have you seen that video
with the cat

170
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:39,275
that jumps inside the box?

171
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:40,526
Very funny, but
I didn't even

172
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,653
introduce myself
as Lucifer.

173
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,240
And there's something
strange about...

174
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:47,450
I can't explain it.

175
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,659
Because it's just crazy talk

176
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,578
coming from
a mentally ill human.

177
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,415
- Well, there might be
another reason.
- Right.

178
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:55,375
What's that?

179
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,751
Well, Earth is
His favorite toy.

180
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,253
Maybe He got fed up of
looking at it from afar.

181
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,798
I mean, it's not an
entirely awful place.

182
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,549
Even you have to admit that.

183
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,885
Now you're the one sounding
crazy, Luci, because Earth--

184
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,554
Earth is nothing
compared to Heaven.

185
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,932
Oh, come now, brother.

186
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,059
I think you've grown to
like the place, haven't you?

187
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,186
- (scoffs)
- Come on, be honest.

188
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,021
When we return to Heaven,
there must be something

189
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,815
that you're gonna miss, eh?

190
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,442
Or someone, maybe?

191
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:25,363
Someone in tight leather pants
with a penchant for knives?

192
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,532
I'm referring to Maze,
of course.

193
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:31,911
ELLA:
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

194
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,871
Is it really so crazy?

195
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:36,124
I mean, what if God
<i>was</i> one of us?

196
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,334
Just a slob,
like one of us.

197
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:39,794
Exactly.
Or just a...

198
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,129
A stranger on a bus.

199
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,131
My father would never use
public transport.

200
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,757
That song is completely
unrealistic.

201
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,259
- What song?
- LUCIFER:
The song I hate

202
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,969
almost as much as I hate
these hypocrites,

203
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,554
like God Johnson.

204
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,639
Hypocrite?
Hmm, I don't know.

205
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:53,599
I see some similarities
between the two of you.

206
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:55,685
That man is not my father.

207
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,479
Well, good thing, 'cause
he might be our killer.

208
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,274
<i>Whaaat?</i> Oh, my God, Ella,
how do you know that?

209
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,316
I'll tell you how
I know that,

210
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,568
because our victim
was bald.

211
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,320
It's very hard to
get prints off a body,

212
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,865
so I whipped out
the ultraviolet

213
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:12,743
alternate light source,
and...boom, complete set

214
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:14,036
on the victim's noggin.

215
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:15,913
They match one Earl Johnson,

216
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,291
wealthy oil magnate
from Odessa, Texas.

217
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,586
Huh. It says here his wife
committed him a few months ago

218
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,463
after he gave
all of his money away

219
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,923
and started calling
himself "God."

220
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:28,801
Mr. Johnson never said that
he touched the victim's body.

221
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,928
Left out the killing
part as well.

222
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:33,514
And proving he's the killer
is the perfect way

223
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:35,433
to expose his
false idolatry.

224
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,684
Right, shall we?

225
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,019
No, we shan't.

226
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,146
Because you spoke to him
without permission,

227
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,190
I had to apply
for a special hearing

228
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:43,524
just to interview him.

229
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:44,650
That'll take at least
a few days,

230
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,402
so thank you for that.

231
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,661
Hello, there.

232
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:57,538
I'd like a suite
for the evening, please.

233
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:58,915
Preferably one with a view.

234
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:00,208
Are you joking?

235
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,084
This is a psychiatric
hospital.

236
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:03,836
Apologies,
I'm skipping ahead.

237
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:08,049
Uh, I am the one and only
Lucifer Morningstar.

238
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:12,136
The Devil.
Dark Lord?

239
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,680
Oh, for goodness sake,
Beelzebub!

240
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,934
Look, I clearly need to be
committed right away.

241
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,936
Yeah, we're at
near capacity, pal.

242
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:22,939
So unless you're a danger
to yourself or others...

243
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,691
- How's that?
- Great.

244
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,984
Lovely.

245
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:31,572

246
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:35,159

249
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,249
Who stole my pudding again?

250
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:42,542
Huh?

251
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:44,043
Markowitz?

252
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,379
Want a taste?

253
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:52,134
Don't you have
better things to do

254
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,302
than to raid our fridge?

255
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,555
I was about to leave
this place altogether,

256
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,598
but I hit an
unexpected snag.

257
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,519
Now I need to distract
myself with something.

258
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,356
Hello, something.

259
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,693
You know, just in case
I'm giving off an

260
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,695
"I have zero
self-respect" vibe,

261
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,822
let me make it clear.

262
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:14,657
Hands off.

263
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:15,616
(chuckles)

264
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:16,993
I'd rather sit
at home alone,

265
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:20,246
and in the dark,
than to hang out with you.

266
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,794
Sassy.

267
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:28,796
I like it.

268
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,675
Deal me in,
gentlemen.

269
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:33,509
Oh,

270
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:34,343
and lady.

271
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:35,803
Buy in's
ten thousand big ones.

272
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,931
Oh, right, high stakes.
I like it.

273
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,890
Pig farts!

274
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,559
Crash and burn.

275
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,060
Oh, I see, you're one of those.
Right.

276
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,895
- 200.
- MAN: I swear,

277
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:48,357
I am gonna stab you in
the eye if you do not stop

278
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,775
dealing me crap!

279
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:51,611
Call.

280
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:52,445
I'm out.

281
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,615
Um, ten thousand, all in.

282
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,075
- (grunts)
- Fold.

283
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,580
What do you know
about God Johnson?

284
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,914
I like fire.

285
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,166
Right, never mind.

286
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,584
Maybe I can help.

287
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:10,004
- I did see him perform a miracle.
- Really?

288
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,924
He scored me an extra
Jell-O at snack time.

289
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:15,676
Shh.

290
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:17,136
Useless.

291
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:18,554
Royal flush.

292
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:20,389
- Cheater!
- Red pubic hair!

293
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:21,390
Mm-hmm.

294
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,477
DOCTOR:
Billy, what did I tell you

295
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,312
about throwing
your underwear?

296
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:27,772
They're not mine.

297
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,065
DOCTOR: Really?
'Cause you're naked.

298
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,484
Yes, I'm more of a boxer
briefs guy, but thank you.

299
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,569
Sorry about that.
You must be Lucifer.

300
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:34,654
I'm Dr. Garrity.

301
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:35,655
- Oh.
- Yes.

302
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:36,864
Can we talk later?

303
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:39,158
I have to get him to
his electroshock treatment.

304
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,284
Really?

305
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,869
- Just kidding.
- Yes.

306
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:43,663
You, this way. Come.

307
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,748
- Very good.
- Let's go find
you some pants.

308
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:49,377
Dad.

309
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,298
(sighs)

310
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,226
Aha! Of course,
you're the murderer.

311
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,937
Right,
suppose I should thwart you now.

312
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:10,606
Off to jail, cowboy.

313
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,610
No, please, I have to save her.

314
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:15,986
What do you mean, save her?

315
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:20,658
(exhales)

316
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:32,128
- (grunts)
- (gasps)

317
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,014
It really is you.

318
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:49,228
You son of a bitch.

319
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,484
Why the hell would you
get yourself committed?

320
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:57,570
I did it to help
the investigation.

321
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:00,406
Hey.

322
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:01,574
What do you think?

323
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:02,825
It's a good likeness, isn't it?

324
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:04,535
That's it, I'm pulling the plug.

325
00:13:04,744 --> 00:13:05,953
- I'm getting you
out of here, now.
- No, no, no, no.

326
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,288
You were the one who said
it would be difficult

327
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,706
to interview
God Johnson.

328
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,124
So, I took
some initiative.

329
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,709
I went undercover.

330
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,878
You must admit having an inside
man could be quite effective.

331
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,379
So, you're doing this

332
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,672
just to help the case?

333
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,425
Well, there may also be
some personal issues

334
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,801
I'd like to explore
with Mr. Johnson.

335
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,471
But yes, the main reason I came
was to prove he's the killer.

336
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:24,722
Is that why you punched him?

337
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,182
- To force a confession?
- (sighs)

338
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,225
Not exactly,
but he had it coming.

339
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,311
(sighs)
You see, Detective,

340
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:33,439
it turns out, he may actually be
my father after all.

341
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,443
You've decided that the lead
suspect in this investigation

342
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,402
may be your father?

343
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,238
I know that God Johnson
is not the killer.

344
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,031
And you know that because...

345
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:43,073
Because
another patient

346
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:44,617
was attacked last night

347
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:47,536
and I saw God Johnson heal her.

348
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,706
And here's me being
super-duper helpful:

349
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,291
before the orderlies

350
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,835
took the victim away,
she told me who did attack her.

351
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,045
Great. Who is it?

352
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,713
Santa Claus.

353
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,800
CHLOE:
<i>He's always been...</i>

354
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,718
quirky, but now, he's...

355
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,762
I-I don't know. I'm-I'm
worried about him.

356
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,722
Well, Lucifer certainly is
an interesting case,

357
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:10,017
but I can't really discuss the,
uh, specifics of his diagnosis.

358
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,812
Now, is he your, um...

359
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,147
uh, fiancé?
I mean, uh, boyfriend?

360
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,190
No.
(chuckles)

361
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,149
Lucifer's a co-worker.

362
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:19,151
Good, good. Well--
(chuckles)

363
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,985
I'm sorry.

364
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,905
I mean, that's good to know.
That's, um, information,

365
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,032
which is helpful,
'cause it's informative.

366
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,784
Right. Yes,
of course, yes.

367
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:27,618
NURSE:
Dr. Garrity?

368
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:28,828
It's time for music therapy.

369
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,371
Thank you,
Nurse Kipsy.

370
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:31,872
I should get
going anyhow.

371
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,666
Well, listen, um,
if maybe, uh,

372
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,876
if you want to talk some more,
about Lucifer or, uh,

373
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:39,004
anything else, uh, feel free,
uh, to give me a call.

374
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,506
My cell phone
number's there.

375
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,132
Thank you.

376
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,050
Okay.

377
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,094
(phone rings)

378
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,390
Hey, Maze. What's up?

379
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,155
I'll give you one
chance to apologize.

380
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,448
Apologize?

381
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,534
You punched me.

382
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,078
Tell you
what I can do:

383
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,163
I can forgive you.

384
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:16,250
(laughs) Taking the
high ground, are we?

385
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,668
Magnificent.

386
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:20,504
Well, I may have struck
the latest blow,

387
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:24,675
but that is only in response to
the litany of offenses that you,

388
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,137
dear old Dad, have
bestowed upon me.

389
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,432
So you believe me? Good.

390
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,727
Tell me, just what is it
you think I've done?

391
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,229
Oh, we're going there, are we?
Right, let's see.

392
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,274
Um, casting me into Hell
for eternity

393
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,484
because you haven't got the
balls to get your own cowardly

394
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:43,986
hands dirty.

395
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,113
Manipulating me
with the detective,

396
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:47,948
giving me the illusion
of control.

397
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,074
You are a...

398
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,327
patronizing, sinister,

399
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,120
helicopter parent!

400
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:55,748
So you think
you have no free will.

401
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,584
Every bad thing that's happened
throughout eternity

402
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,253
is your doing, not mine!

403
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,380
It's all part of "God's Plan."

404
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:04,882
Even Mum's coming here

405
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,009
and manipulation of me
was part of it.

406
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:08,802
- Your mother's here?
- Oh!

407
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,137
Look who cares now.

408
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,722
Oh, my.

409
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,601
Oh, well, that is something.

410
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,813
I still remember
the first moment we met.

411
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:25,402
Mmm. There was nothing,
just darkness and...

412
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,323
...then she appeared.
(chuckles softly)

413
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,160
It did not take long for us
to light up the universe.

414
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:36,288
Much as I'm enjoying this trip
down memory lane,

415
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,291
I want an apology-- nay.

416
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,961
Nay, I demand penance.

417
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,505
You must atone
for what you've done.

418
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:45,673
(eyes crackle)

419
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,258
Now, that's not the Samael
I remember.

420
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,301
No.

421
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,973
No, Dad, this is who you made me
when you cast me away!

422
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:55,641
Now apologize!

423
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:56,850
(door opens)

424
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:58,644
LINDA:
Uh, Lucifer?

425
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,441
MAZE:
Guy sounds like
he wants to bang.

426
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:05,901
CHLOE (on phone):
He's Lucifer's doctor, Maze.

427
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,735
MAZE:
So what?

428
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,237
Doctors don't want to get laid?

429
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,406
Does everything always have to
be about sex with you?

430
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:11,615
Yeah.

431
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:13,033
He was just trying
to be helpful.

432
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,244
We should invite him
on the booze cruise.

433
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,495
What booze cruise?

434
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,622
Tonight.
I had a friend set up a yacht.

435
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:20,624
You know,
it'll be like a hip-hop video.

436
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,626
You said you wanted to expand
our circle of friends.

437
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,211
That's not what I meant at all.

438
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,838
Oh.

439
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,924
You want to ride solo
with Dr. McHotty.

440
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:30,509
I can get behind that.

441
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,302
Or on top, dealer's choice.

442
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,013
(laughs) I'm kidding.

443
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,514
Okay, I'll set it all up.

444
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:39,018
You won't have to lift a finger.
Let me help you.

445
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,103
I don't want, nor need,
your help

446
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,479
with setting up a date.
I'm good.

447
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,439
Why not?

448
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,442
You and I are flowing, Chlo.
Same page.

449
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,736
Nope.
Different books altogether.

450
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,112
You crack me up, Decker.

451
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:55,325
("If God Was One of Us" playing)

452
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:59,747
ELLA (singing along):
♪ What if God was one of us? ♪

453
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:05,627
♪ Just a slob like one of us ♪

454
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,880
♪ Just a stra-- ♪

455
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,175
Oh, my God, Chloe,
this song is so good.

456
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,969
Yeah, yeah. People seemed
to really like it...

457
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,220
in 1995.

458
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,722
Oh, my God, and
the music video.

459
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,348
- Uh...
- Oh.
- (music stops)

460
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:19,349
What's going on?

461
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,310
So, um, by chance,

462
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,063
have you found
any evidence

463
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,565
pointing to, um...

464
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,025
Santa Claus?

465
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,236
I was gonna ask you
the exact same thing.

466
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:32,279
- Really?
- Yes.

467
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:34,823
Long white hair.

468
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,366
Found it on the
victim's clothes.

469
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,161
Wasn't sure what it was, but
yeah, totally screams Santa.

470
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,789
I'll have it
tested ASAP.

471
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,791
I could see if
you're mentally troubled,

472
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,460
you see someone with long
white hair commit a crime,

473
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,045
you could call him
Santa Claus.

474
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:49,797
- Right?
- (pages turning)

475
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,008
Kind of like this guy.

476
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,053
ELLA:
Uh, yeah.

477
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,639
Dude looks exactly like
the creepy drunk Santa

478
00:18:58,847 --> 00:18:59,932
at the mall when
I was a kid.

479
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,976
Too bad setting up an interview
would take forever...

480
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,521
without a doctor's permission.

481
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:06,897
Ooh.

482
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,566
A doctor's permission...

483
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:12,861
Yeah?

484
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,279
Hey, Maze.

485
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,824
You still want to help me?

486
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,117
(Linda exhales sharply)

487
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,327
Okay, so that was "God" God
back there?

488
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:21,537
As in capital "G"?

489
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:22,913
I didn't bow.
I should have bowed.

490
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:24,248
You should have spit
in His face.

491
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,457
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

492
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,667
Then you're no use to me,
Doctor.

493
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,085
What on earth
are you doing here anyway?

494
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,462
Chloe sent me to check on you
because she was worried.

495
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:31,964
(sighs)
But now, I'm worried.

496
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:32,965
Please tell me
you're not still planning on

497
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,800
having your mom and God
destroy each other.

498
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,885
Don't be silly.
That plan won't work anymore.

499
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,929
Oh. Oh, good.
Maybe I should've curtsied.

500
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:40,597
Unfortunately,
Dad seems to be soft on Mum.

501
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,391
Like he still has feelings
for her.

502
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,394
(gasps)Which gives me
another way to punish them,

503
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,396
far more tortuous than death.

504
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,522
And we're back to "not good."

505
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,607
No, no, no, no, this is better.

506
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,652
And you, my dear doctor,
are going to help me. (laughs)

507
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,704
LUCIFER: Okay,
you've all been chosen

508
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,081
to help with
a very special mission called

509
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,333
"Operation Help Lucifer
Escape from the Hospital."

510
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,419
Mm, that's a little
on the nose, son.

511
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,379
You are literally the judgiest
person in the universe.

512
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:13,463
You know that, Dad?

513
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,339
PETE:
Escape?

514
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,924
But we get pudding here.

515
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,719
Oh, look,
I know the puddings are good,

516
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,637
but there must be more
that you all desire.

517
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,181
I mean, come on, Pete.

518
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:23,599
I know desserts
aren't the only thing

519
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,809
that tickle your fancy,
are they? Hmm?

520
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,477
I do want to watch it all burn.

521
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:28,812
Right.

522
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,439
- (lighter flicks open)
- Then fire away.

523
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,732
Oh...

524
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,983
Go, go, go, go, go.

525
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:33,817
Right.

526
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,653
I want to turn the lights on...
and off.

527
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:37,905
Good! Go!

528
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:38,655
I love a good rave.

529
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:39,489
Who's next?

530
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:40,782
I want to throw
underwear at heads.

531
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,285
Laundry room! Right?
Go forth, people. Come on.

532
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,536
Liberate yourselves.

533
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,705
Play to your strengths.

534
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:48,957
So this is your big plan
for busting us out of here.

535
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,376
Encouraging a man
to steal underwear?

536
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,086
No, no. That was just for fun.

537

538
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,757

escape from here.

00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:41,194
I've seen your mom dress
sluttier than this.

567
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,156
Okay, Maze,
this is an interrogation

568
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,741
disguised as a casual dinner.

569
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:46,867
There's no need
to get dolled up.

570
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,369
Please don't tell me you made
reservations at somewhere fancy.

571
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,163
Opposite of fancy.

572
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,289
It's here.

573
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,334
Here. Why?

574
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:57,419
Well, duh, your bedroom's here.

575
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:58,545
Where else
are we gonna have sex?

576
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:01,965
(sighs) For the last time, Maze,
we're not having a threesome.

577
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,633
I'm okay to watch.

578
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,719

I don't need the Flaming Sword

to exact my revenge.

595
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:28,260
Okay, but how is having them
fall in love again revenge?

596
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,304
Oh, trust me, Doctor, after
a brief re-honeymoon period,

597
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,932
they'll start torturing each
other like they always do.

Tell me what?

666

00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,008
Try to remember that
each one of them is a person.

677
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:58,970
Yeah. I, uh, I saw this older
gentleman the other day.

678
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,514
Uh, long white hair.
White beard.

679
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,391
He reminded me of
my crazy Uncle Al.

680
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,393
- You must be talking about Dale.
- Yeah, what's his deal?

681
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,437
Is he one of the violent ones?

682
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:10,815
Um...

683
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:11,900
Uh...

684
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:16,446
Um, what kind of civil servant
are you, exactly?

685
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:17,822
(phone chimes)

686
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:22,911
Wow. Well, this evening
just got even more interesting.

687
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,747
Apparently, your co-worker,
Lucifer, just escaped

688
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,500
and took God Johnson with him.

689
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,176
What's he doing here, Lucifer?

690
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,053
I don't know. You married him.

691
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,514
Well, it kind of ruins our plans
to storm the Gates of Heaven

692
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:43,932
and destroy him.

693
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,643
Well, I'm thinking we might
not need to do that anymore.

694
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:49,396
I will never forgive him, if
that's what you're getting at.

695
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:50,855
The point is, Mum,

696
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:55,235
that I think Dad...
sincerely misses you.

697
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:56,820

698
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:58,738

How could I not?

699
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,074
Look at you.

700
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:04,494
An absolute vision.

701
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,371

Oh, you have no idea.

703
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:09,374
(laughs softly)

704
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,501
I'm just gonna... Doctor.

705
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,337
For the life of me, I can't even
remember why we were fighting.

706
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:16,589
The flames? Eternal damnation?

707
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,508
The... Kind of hard to forget.

708
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,469
JOHNSON: I am so sorry
that you suffered.

709
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:24,806
Well, I su... suppose
I should apologize

710
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:27,308
for trying to destroy
your precious toy

711
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:30,687
with floods and
with plagues and whatnot.

712
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,648
I guess humanity
isn't entirely awful.

713
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,150
They did make vodka.

714
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:37,318
Roller coasters.

715
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:39,070
Triple crème Brie.

716
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,699
You hear about dancing?

717
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,702
Yes, I actually did some of that
on a table, once.

718
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:49,038
("Can't Take My Eyes
Off Of You" begins playing)

719
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,169

This.

729
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:33,333
I didn't think
this was possible.

730
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,126
It wasn't part of the plan.

731
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,461
So, maybe...

732
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,464
maybe we make a new plan.

733
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,926

First you check yourself

749
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:14,833
into a mental hospital,

750
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,002
only to kidnap another
patient and escape.

751
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:19,963
Lucifer, how is that helping?

752
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,465
Well, i-if you must know,

753
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,884
God Johnson is
indeed my father,

754
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,512
and, uh, I needed to do
a little matchmaking.

755
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,055
(sighs)

756
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,182
With him and
Charlotte Richards?

757
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,476
I mean, I'm scared to know
how she ties into all this.

758
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:36,521
Well, never mind that.
What about our killer?

759
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,690
Hmm? Did you find
proof of Santa Claus?

760
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:39,816
Time for your meds.

761
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,192
Ooh, lovely.

762
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,820
Thank you. Right.

763
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,822
Unexpected perk of the place.
(chuckles)

764
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,073
Maybe it's a good thing

765
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:50,410
there's another day
on your 72-hour hold. You know?

766
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,912
Maybe being here is the best
thing for you right now.

767
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:53,872
Okay.

768
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,503
(knocking on door)

769
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,298
Hey.

770
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,174
I just wanted to say

771
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:06,634
that I'm sorry I lied.

772
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,138
I, um...

773
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:13,683
Sometimes with work,

774
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:14,934
I get shortsighted.

775
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,270
And I never wanted to...

776
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:18,438
Use me?

777
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:22,108
(quietly):
Yeah.

778
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,946
If you had just been
up-front with me,

779
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,699
I would've told you that Dale,
the guy you were asking about,

780
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,367
he's been here for 15 years.

781
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:35,747
Yeah, he can seem a bit prickly,
but he's a teddy bear.

782
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,707
He's got no
violent tendencies.

783
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:40,001
There is just no way
he'd kill someone.

784
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:40,835
All right.

785
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:45,757
Legally, I can't let you
look at Dale's medical file.

786
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,051
But, um...

787
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,596
what happens
when I turn away is, um,

788
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,181
out of my hands.

789
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:55,475
Thank you.

790
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:57,810
(quietly): Yeah.

791
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:01,814
Ooh, look, a Nigerian prince
needs my help.

792
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,316
Wow.

793
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:05,944
Thanks.

794
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:11,866
Santa Claus?

795
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,035
Okay, so what's the big deal?

796
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:15,620
Someone dresses up
as Santa every year.

797
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:16,454
Patients love it.

798
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:17,789
Yeah, well, that someone
could be the killer.

799
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,165
But a different person
does it every year.

800
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:21,125
Even I did it a
few years back.

801
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,378
Okay, we store the,
uh, costume in here.

802
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:28,132
Wait, wait, wait.

803
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,218
(clears throat)

804
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:39,852
Where's the beard?
The red hat?

805
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,771
- It should be in there.
- Okay, two things.

806
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:44,607
Who else has a key
to that cabinet? And...

807
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,110
...I need you
to put these on.

808
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:49,737
Ooh, ooh.

809
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,281
These drugs are a bit different,
aren't they?

810
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,243
'Cause I can't feel my tongue.

811
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:58,746
Oh. Hello, pretty kitty,

812
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:01,624
kitty, kitty, kitty...

813
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:04,669
Santa, you're here as well?

814
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:07,630
Oh, I'm afraid
I've been a naughty boy.

815
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:08,881
(grunts)

816
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:16,055
LUCIFER:
You may want to rethink this.

817
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:18,558
You see,
I am actually the Devil.

818
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:20,435
(distorted):
No, you're not the Devil.

819
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,479
You're just a man who's
delusional in a mental hospital.

820
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,939
You made it all up.

821
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:25,982
So...

822
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,359
...I'm not the Devil.

823
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,112
I'm just a man who's delusional.

824
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:32,822
I made it all up.

825
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:34,949
I made it all up!

826
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:38,244
I made it all up.
(chuckles)

827
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,539
Hello, son.

828
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,666
Dad!

829
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,877
See? I am the Devil.

830
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,754
Nice try, Santa.

831
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:48,796
(chuckles)

832
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:51,799
- Tell me what you told
the police.
- Only the truth.

833
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:55,845
That you, Mr. Kringle,
are a cold-blooded killer.

834
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:56,679
What else?

835
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:58,347
What do you want to know,
Nurse Kipsy?

836
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:09,901
Why aren't the drugs
working on you?

837
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:11,194
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

838
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:12,987
It's because he's God!

839
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:14,864
LUCIFER:
Uh, oh.

840
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,032
Hey.

841
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:17,784
Hey, they shouldn't be working

842
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:19,869
on me, either, but...

843
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:21,329
Is the detective still here?

844
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,247
- That might explain it.
- Shut up.

845
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:25,124
- Okay.
- KIPSY:
Doesn't matter.

846
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,460
Now you know it's me,
I have to kill you both.

847
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,253
(sighs)

848
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,800
What's that for?

849
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,176
A long shot.

850
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:44,894
Okay.

851
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:47,855
(camera clicks)

852
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:50,191
That's got to be the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

853
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,735
I'd-I'd applaud, you know,
if I weren't cuffed.

854
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,362
Sorry about that.
It's just a precaution.

855
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:56,155
- Hey, I get it.
- (cell phone beeps)

856
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:57,740
- Bingo.
- Wow.

857
00:35:57,949 --> 00:35:58,741
That was fast.

858
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,118
Yeah, you don't know Ella.

859
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:02,995
The print belongs
to one Patricia Hightower.

860
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:04,664
We have a patient
named Sue Hightower,

861
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,082
the one God Johnson attacked.

862
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,876
Okay. I'm waiting
on a DMV photo.

863
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:10,211
(cell phone beeps)

864
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:11,838
She looks familiar.

865
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:14,507
That's Nurse Kipsy.

866
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:15,967
KIPSY:
<i>I changed my name</i>

867
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:17,927
so no one would know
she's my mother.

868
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,975
She was a raging bitch
my entire life.

869
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:27,812
Controlling,
manipulative...

870
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:30,815
She tortured me.

871
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,610
So I decided to torture her.

872
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:36,404
Pumped her full of drugs,
drove her crazy.

873
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,656
Preaching to the choir, sister.

874
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:39,699
Evil parents

875
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:40,867
deserve to be punished.

876
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,661
You had every right
to destroy her.

877
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,080
But what about the orderly?

878
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,374
He found out what I was doing.

879
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,251
He... said he was
gonna turn me in.

880
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:51,127
I had no choice.

881
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,461
No, he was innocent

882
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:53,963
and you killed him,

883
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:56,799
so I am gonna have
to punish you.

884
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:59,552
(grunts)

885
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,638
Why aren't I pulverizing you?

886
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:06,100
Uh, one because you're a nutjob.

887
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:07,226
And two,

888
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,312
because I switched out
your normal meds

889
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,230
with a massive dose of Haldol.

890
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:12,398
(chuckles)

891
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:14,400
You know...

892
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:16,861
...they don't normally

893
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,362
let patients wear belts.

894
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:20,615
Suicide risk.

895
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:23,242
So, thank you for getting a
special dispensation for yours

896
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,036
because now I got it.

897
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,580
God is gonna kill Lucifer,

898
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,207
then hang himself.

899
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:31,584
(chuckles)

900
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:34,003
Kind of poetic, don't you think?

901
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,214
Gonna go find a ladder.

902
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:38,049
Oh, a ladder.
(chuckles)

903
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:39,884
JOHNSON:
Now, I had no idea

904
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,469
you were so angry with me.

905
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,304
Really?

906
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,849
'Cause I... I've been
pretty up-front about it.

907
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:48,768
But to want to destroy me?

908
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,020
That's pretty serious.

909
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:53,481
You mind telling me why?

910
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:55,858
Because...

911
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,403
because I'm your son.

912
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:01,864
And...

913
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,493
...you rejected me.

914
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:08,204
Oh.

915
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:12,875
Well, then I guess
I can't say as I blame you.

916
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,418
Fact of the matter is,

917
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:15,544
I don't even remember why

918
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:17,672
I was ever so angry with you
to begin with.

919
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:22,969
For what it's worth...

920
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,554
I am sorry.

921
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:28,057
I truly am.

922
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,686
And I am proud of you, Samael.

923
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:34,647
I am proud of the man
you've become.

924
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:39,735
So, what do you say...

925
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:40,945
Wait, no.

926
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:41,904
Not... not my belt.

927
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:43,030
You can't take my belt.
It's mine.

928
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,533
Patricia Hightower, LAPD.
Don't move.

929
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:46,742
(belt clatters on floor)

930
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,829
Detective.
(whoops)

931
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:51,831
You okay?

932
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:53,124
Honestly...

933
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:55,918
I've never felt better.

934
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,004
(grunts)

935
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:02,383
What this?
What-What just happened?

936
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:04,885
What are you talking about?
We just beat Santa.

937
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:06,971
Who are you?

938
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,180
It's me, Dad.

939
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:09,473
Lucifer.

940
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:12,810
Does someone want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

941
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,478
Get me out of
these damn things.

942
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,781
"The piece is here."

943
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:34,665
(scoffs)

944
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,084
Well, what do you know.

945
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,377
It fits perfectly.

946
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:40,963
Yes, I think this is what Uriel
was trying to tell me.

947
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:44,342
Just before he died,

948
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,053
he whispered in my ear,
"The piece is here."

949
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:49,013
I mean, I thought it
was nonsense, but...

950
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,432
this must be why
the sword wasn't working.

951
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,308
It wasn't complete.

952
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,185
Dad supposedly destroyed
the Flaming Sword

953
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:55,227
after the rebellion.

954
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,854
So, are you saying

955
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:59,190
he just broke it into two
pieces? Azrael's blade...

956
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:00,149
And this.

957
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:02,860
Yes, which somehow
ended up on Earth.

958
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:04,362
Its power probably awakened

959
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:07,615
when Azrael's blade
ended up here, too.

960
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:10,701
Which is when Mr. Johnson
must've stumbled upon it.

961
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,119
But why did he think
he was father?

962
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:16,040
Well, I mean, Azrael's blade
inspired death.

963
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:19,877
Maybe this piece
activated the opposite-- life.

964
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:21,670
Healing. Gave him the power

965
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:22,880
and knowledge of the divine.

966
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,341
And when he found out that he
could heal like that, he...

967
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:26,926
he thought he was God.

968
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,511
What's more
important is that

969
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,430
now the sword's complete,
we can get on with our plan.

970
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,682
So... the...

971
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:36,018
(sighs)

972
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:37,311
Or not.

973
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:45,236
Maybe there's
another piece missing.

974
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,738
Or maybe a dragon
has to breathe on it.

975
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:48,823
Who knows?

976
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,449
Well, maybe Mum does.

977
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:51,909
Did...

978
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:53,702
Where is she, anyway?

979
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,038
<i>(knock on door)</i>

980
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:03,963
I thought I made
myself clear.

981
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:06,799
I kissed a man today.

982
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,134
What's your deal?

983
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:10,678
I thought he was my ex-husband.

984
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:12,972
When I kissed him,

985
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:15,683
I realized it wasn't him.

986
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,768
And the strangest part is,

987
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:19,895
I don't know what's
more upsetting...

988
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:23,274
that it wasn't him?
(chuckles)

989
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:28,988
Or that I... I wished it was.

990
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:30,322
Wow.

991
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:32,867
I just don't want to be alone.

992
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:36,203
Could we just
hold each other?

993
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,248
Please?

994
00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:45,880
With your pants off, of course.

995
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:57,141
I still can't believe
I gave all my money away.

996
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:59,018
Well, if it's
any consolation,

997
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,604
- you haven't exactly
been yourself of late.
- Yeah.

998
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:03,731
Listen, I wanted to ask you...

999
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:05,900
what's the last thing
you remember?

1000
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,402
I was in New Mexico for work,

1001
00:42:08,986 --> 00:42:11,155
I was walking through
this Navajo gift shop.

1002
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:13,949
I saw a cool belt buckle,
so I picked it up, and...

1003
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:15,743
next thing I knew, I woke up

1004
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,203
strapped to a gurney
next to you.

1005
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:19,038
- Lucky you.
- Yeah.

1006
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:20,956
Hey, they, uh,

1007
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:22,374
they say we was arguing.

1008
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,419
If I did or said something
to upset you, I apologize.

1009
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:29,256
No, no, you were quite
lovely, actually.

1010
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:34,053
For a brief moment,
I thought you were my father.

1011
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:34,929
(chuckles)

1012
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:37,973
A man for whom I harbor
a great deal of resentment.

1013
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:39,975
And you said some things

1014
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:42,603
that I think I wish
he'd always said to me,

1015
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:45,940
so for that I thank you.

1016
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:48,859
Well, I guess even
a blind squirrel

1017
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:50,444
catches a nut
every now and then.

1018
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:52,446
You take care of yourself.

1019
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:57,826
Hey, does this mean you're not
angry at your dad anymore?

1020
00:42:58,244 --> 00:42:59,495
No, I'm not angry.

1021
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:02,039
I'm bloody furious.

1022
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,416
'Cause I realized that my father

1023
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,627
would never say those things
to me.

1024
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:08,796
And for that...

1025
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:11,465
I hate him all the more.
