1
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:04,089
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
DAN: <i>Still no sign of Lucifer?</i>

2
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:06,049
It's been two weeks.
He's gone.

3
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:07,050
LUCIFER:
Detective!

4
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:08,468
<i>Meet Candy Morningstar,</i>

5
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:09,886
- my wife.
- (giggles)

6
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:11,763
Lucifer's
concocting a plan.

7
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:13,807
What if there is
no hidden agenda, Mom?

8
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:14,808
Why would I be surprised?

9
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,768
<i>You disappeared after
I almost died?</i>

10
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:19,479
Does Chloe know that
you <i>zagged</i> Candy?

11
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:20,605
Everything I felt for her

12
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:21,648
<i>was smoke and mirrors,</i>

13
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:22,899
<i>courtesy of Dad.</i>

14
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:24,734
So it's okay
to ignore her feelings?

15
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:25,944
Feelings that aren't real.

16
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:26,987
But she doesn't know that.

17
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:29,030
Which is why
I had to save her!

18
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,156
From you.

19
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:31,449
I manipulated him.

20
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,243
I pushed him too hard.

21
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,369
I did this.

22
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:36,663
The Oscar goes to
Candy Morningstar.

23
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:37,497
You think they bought it?

24
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:38,915
My mother doesn't know
what hit her.

25
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:40,250
Thank you for helping me

26
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,544
peek inside that
scheming head of hers.

27
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,838
What if I told you
that the Flaming Sword is

28
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:46,172
<i>Azrael's blade?</i>

29
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,633
<i>The weapon that can cut through
the Gates of Heaven itself.</i>

30
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:50,844
We have everything we need
to go home.

31
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:57,892
Azrael's blade.

32
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:58,810
You're sure?

33
00:00:59,102 --> 00:00:59,894
I am.

34
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:01,771
So if we could just
get your brother

35
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,649
to stop drinking and
show us where he hid it...

36
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:09,195
I just wanted you
to tell him what you told me,

37
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:10,447
before I make a mess.

38
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,615
What mess are
you going to...

39
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:16,995
That's where it's been
this whole time?

40
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,706
Put it somewhere
I could keep an eye on it.

41
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:21,499
Wouldn't want someone
to incite another

42
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,126
stabbing rampage, now, would we?

43
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,879
Well, it's not my fault humans
can't handle the divine.

44
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,130
Besides, if I
hadn't done that,

45
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,300
we wouldn't have found out
what that blade actually is.

46
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,719
And you really think
that this is the Flaming Sword?

47
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,221
I thought Father destroyed it
during my rebellion

48
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,514
so I wouldn't use it
against Him.

49
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:38,016
Father <i>said</i> He destroyed it.

50
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:40,810
Apparently, He just hid it
in plain sight.

51
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:45,231
But it's so small
and so... not flaming.

52
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:49,277
That's because only you,
my Lightbringer,

53
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:50,612
can ignite it.

54
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:52,447
Well, what am I supposed to do,

55
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:54,616
dip it in some whiskey
and light a match?

56
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:57,577
Last time it caught
flame, you were angry,

57
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:00,455
so think about your Father;
that should do it.

58
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:02,624
All right.
(clears throat)

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,001
(exhales)

60
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,546
(strains):
No!

61
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:10,882
Right, back to my whiskey plan.

62
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:12,509
No, you're much too calm.

63
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:14,803
When it flamed before,
you were furious.

64
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:18,264
So you're saying the blade
can sense my emotional state?

65
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:19,307
It's the most powerful weapon

66
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:20,517
in the universe, Mum--

67
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,269
the sword that guarded Eden,
not a groovy mood ring.

68
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:24,479
Maybe I should try it.

69
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,648
Your brother is the
Lightbringer, Amenadiel.

70
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:29,818
He just needs to apply
himself and get angry!

71
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:31,903
Well, I can't just
get ang... Aah!

72
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:33,780
Bloody hell!

73
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:36,324
Well, it was worth a shot.

74
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,785
Right. Maybe Amenadiel
should try it.

75
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,538
Here, why don't you hold it,
and I'll kick you in the...

76
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:42,747
Boys!

77
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:46,709
We need to work
together on this.

78
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,545
We're so close now.

79
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:49,587
Are we, Mom?

80
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:51,339
Because our return home hinges

81
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:54,050
on Lucifer being able
to control his emotions.

82
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,136
Oh, you've no faith
in me, brother? Good.

83
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,846
Means I get to prove you wrong.

84
00:02:58,972 --> 00:02:59,848
(scoffs)

85
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,524
So the three of you plan
to use this... Flaming Sword

86
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,901
to cut through the
Gates of Heaven

87
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,111
and go home?

88
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,071
That's the plan, yes.

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,532
Do you mean actual gates?

90
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,950
Like big and pearly?

91
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,076
Are we talking clouds?

92
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:22,787
Harps? Old dudes in white robes?

93
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:24,539
And my dad is Morgan Freeman?

94
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:27,041
Focus, Doctor.
Now, come on.

95
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,878
I need you to help me
control my emotions.

96
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:31,963
Well, emotions can't be
controlled, Lucifer.

97
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,465
What?
Isn't that your entire job?

98
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:38,344
My job is to help you
understand your emotions.

99
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:41,264
I can help you become aware
of what it is you're feeling,

100
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,601
or trying to
<i>avoid</i> feeling.

101
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,106
Right, you've got
that look on your face

102
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:51,441
when you're saying
something insightful

103
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,610
and waiting for me
to figure it out.

104
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,446
I think you married her
to hide something.

105
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:59,782
- Or <i>from</i> something.
- Right, look,

106
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:03,036
what I may or may not be hiding
is beside the point, Doctor.

107
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,954
Either way,
I need the sword lit.

108
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:07,457
So, come on.
Emotions. Chop, chop.

109
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,584
You clearly have a lot
of walls up, Lucifer.

110
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:11,419
Between yourself
and your emotions,

111
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:13,463
and now between yourself and me.

112
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,424
If you're unwilling
to bring those walls down,

113
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:17,634
I can't help you.

114
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:20,637
(sighs)

115
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:22,847
(rock music playing)

116
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,229
(rock music playing through
Maze's earbuds stops)

117
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,313
What the hell, Decker?

118
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,439
No breakfast?

119
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:34,817
Oh, I forgot. Sorry.

120
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:35,818
You forgot?

121
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,570
Chloe Decker forgot?

122
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,366
Are you okay?

123
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,076
What did you do
with my roommate?

124
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,703
She would never ask
about my feelings.

125
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,247
(laughs):
Oh, feelings?

126
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,499
No, I was thinking brain tumor,

127
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,543
early-onset dementia, chlamydia.

128
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,465
Uh, well, yeah.

129
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,677
I guess I'm still a little upset

130
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:03,388
that Lucifer just
disappeared on me

131
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:05,765
and got married
just when we were...

132
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,934
(sighs) You know, I don't
know what we were.

133
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,603
(rock music playing loudly
through earbuds)

134
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,481
And sure, he got it annulled
right away, but, you know,

135
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,899
that almost makes it worse.

136
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:18,528
(rock music continues
through earbuds)

137
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,862
Focus on Trixie.

138
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,115

nauseous.

152
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,228
Of course.

Tall, non-fat

158
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:10,038
with sugar-free caramel drizzle
and no vodka this time.

159
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:11,164
What's the occasion?

160
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,166
Well, I thought we should
celebrate our first day together

161
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:14,959
as crime-solving divorcees.

162
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:15,835
(laughs)

163
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,962
Ah, making a joke you
don't like. Check.

164
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,006
See? We'll be back
to normal in no time.

165
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:23,176
Uh, not until you start whining
about how boring the case is.

166
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,303
(chuckles) Well,
touché, Detective.

167
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,389
Our victim's name
is Debbie Lang.

168
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,433
She worked as the head of
administrations of a very

169
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,769
prestigious elementary school
on the Westside called...

170
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:34,437
called Starford.

171
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,815
How could a career in
education pay for all this?

172
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:39,734
L.A. private
schools are insane.

173
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,652
You know, money
gets thrown around.

174
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:42,528
What do we have?

175
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:45,239
Well, poor Debbie was
stabbed in the back,

176
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:46,115
literally.

177
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:47,492
DAN:
Maybe figuratively, too.

178
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,534
There was no signs of B&E,

179
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,536
which suggests
she knew who her killer was.

180
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,747
- Anyone recover
the murder weapon?
- No, not yet.

181
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,792
ELLA: You'd think knife,
but the circumference

182
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,752
of the wound is unusually wide,

183
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,879
like it was a... fat knife.

184
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:01,589
LUCIFER:
PhD in psychology,

185
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,716
certificate for
behavioral therapy.

186
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:05,176
I should have thought
this woman had figured out

187
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:06,719
human interaction,
yet she provoked someone

188
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:08,054
into killing her?

189
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,473
Therapists don't really
know anything, do they?

190
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,476
Ooh, Lucifer's projecting
his personal issues on the case.

191
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,644
Guess we're back to normal.

192
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:15,770
- (chuckles)
- ELLA:
Ah, man.

193
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,439
I got into it with my shrink
a couple of weeks ago.

194
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,233
What? You see
a psychologist?

195
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,527
I know. You wouldn't
think so, right?

196
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:24,779
'Cause I'm so upbeat
all the time.

197
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,907
But up here-- lot of darkness.

198
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:29,742
- Really?
- CHLOE:
Hey, guys?

199
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:31,536
What's this?

200
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,291
(Lucifer laughs)

201
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,210
Well, where do I start?

202
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,088
ELLA: Missing
commemorative scissors.

203
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,132
Looks like we found
our fat knife.

204
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,466
Or didn't find it,

205
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:46,759
but, you know.

206
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,511
So, weapon of convenience.

207
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,346
Could have been
a crime of passion.

208
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:51,722
Vic knew the killer,

209
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,391
so we should go to the school
where she worked.

210
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:01,732
I, uh...
I just can't believe it.

211
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,818
You know, Debbie was the best

212
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,319
head of admissions
we've ever had,

213
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:08,614
the heart and soul
of the Starford community.

214
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,616
We're all devastated.

215
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,327
Is there any way
we could see her office

216
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:14,745
or the last few things
she was working on?

217
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:15,663
Sure.

218
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,373
No phones on campus, please.

219
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,041
Sends a message

220
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,586
that our arms aren't actually
available to our children.

221
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,838
Right. Detective,
this school is weird,

222
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,214
and, yes, this
case is boring.

223
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:26,215
Not weird.

224
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:27,592
Unique.

225
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,094
Our groundbreaking
pedagogical approach

226
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:33,139
focuses on
emotional self-control.

227
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,558
Emotional self-control?
How'd you go about that, then?

228
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,143
Lucifer, can you go back
to being bored,

229
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,478
and not derail the conversation?

230
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,813
No, no, but this is fascinating,
Detective. The so-called expert

231
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,316
I just consulted insisted
emotions can't be controlled.

232
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,901
Well, we respectfully disagree.

233
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:48,362
Um, our children learn to manage
their emotions in no time.

234
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:51,199
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

235
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,202
Let the schooling begin!

236
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:55,828
(chuckles)

237
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,290
♪♪

238
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:11,552
You see, we make our students'
emotional needs the priority.

239
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:13,387
Whence our motto.

240
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,014
<i>"Sentio ergo sum."</i>

241
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,058
"I feel, therefore
I am." Hmm.

242
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,309
Hmm. Fascinating.

243
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:19,352
Let's just stick to the case.

244
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,686
Hold on, Detective.

245
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,355
Debbie isn't going
to un-die, is she?

246
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,565
Whereas I require
immediate assistance.

247
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,276
Look, yes, how long does
it take for rug rats

248
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:28,569
to gain emotional self-control?

249
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:29,946
MURRAY: Oh, our methods
work very quickly.

250
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,197
The parents see it
for themselves

251
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,074
after sitting in
on just one class.

252
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,618
Notice all the,
um, testimonials.

253
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,786
Yes.

254
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,579
So, Debbie.

255
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:41,582
Did she have any enemies
here at work that you know of?

256
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,210
You see, our faculty
practices the same

257
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,671
conflict-resolution method
as our children.

258
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:49,131
People in a conflict actually

259
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,050
present handmade gifts
to one another.

260
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:53,219
This was Debbie's desk,

261
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,389
and, as you can see,
not a single macramé.

262
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,809
What about outside
the faculty?

263
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,395
Any recent incidents
with parents maybe?

264
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,896
Nothing like that would
ever happen at Starford.

265
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,232
Oh, weird, 'cause
heads of admissions

266
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,401
at other prestigious
private schools

267
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,195
are practically stalked
by eager parents, so,

268
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,447
maybe the spots here at Starford
just aren't as coveted.

269
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:14,532
(laughs):
Not so.

270
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,866
No, parents go above and beyond

271
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,243
to get their children
here at Starford.

272
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,246
And they go absolutely crazy
when they fail to land a spot.

273
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,831
Just the other day...

274
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,463
Well, perhaps
there was one incident.

275
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,507
Debbie did get
into a rather

276
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,884
ugly fight with
the parents of a child

277
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,219
who'd been denied admission.

278
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,305
- It got vicious.
- LUCIFER: Ooh.

279
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,181
Fisticuffs? Beat-down
at the bike sheds

280
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,182
after the final bell?

281
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,602
No, <i>verbally</i> vicious.

282
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,978
- Ah, terrible grammar.
- Mm-hmm.

283
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:44,937
Got you.

284
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:48,274
Did you see the fight?

285
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,108
Everyone saw it.

286
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:50,443
It happened right in
front of the school,

287
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,819
violating what we
like to think of as

288
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:53,946
our safe space
here at Starford.

289
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:55,156
What was said?

290
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,241
I will kill you.

291
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,287
That is what I said, yes.

292
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,164
But you have to understand.

293
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,875
I was furious that she'd
rejected our son, Wolfe.

294
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,377
If you have children,
I'm sure you can relate.

295
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,962
A Starford education

296
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,922
feeds almost directly
to the Ivy League.

297
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,843
Debbie took our money
and crushed our son's future.

298
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,136
What do you mean? What money?

299
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:20,264
Well, she implied that a hefty
contribution to the school

300
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:22,224
would grease the wheels
on Wolfe's admission.

301
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,852
So you made the contribution
and Wolfe was still rejected?

302
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:25,686
Yes.

303
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,147
We felt we'd been... misled.

304
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:29,398
More like robbed.

305
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:30,816
And then,
when we tried

306
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:33,527
to bring it up to Debbie,
she had the gall

307
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,155
to suggest that the school
hadn't received the donation.

308
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:37,740
But the check cleared!

309
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:38,616
Lying...

310
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:41,369
(clears throat)

311
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,123
JON: I know
my husband's temper

312
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:48,584
suggests otherwise,
but we're dealing with this

313
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:51,420
the civilized way--
through our lawyer.

314
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,090
We could never kill anyone.

315
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,258
Then can you explain
why the murder weapon

316
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:57,635
was found in your pool house?

Mr. Morningstar,
you're under arrest.

329
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:36,424
(laughs)

330
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:37,800
I am now, am I?

331
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,927
- On what charge?
- Ladies,

332
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,345
he's resisting arrest.

333
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:42,471
Cuff him.

334
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:44,390
My pleasure.

335
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,058
Right, why do you
sexy detectives

336
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,060
look so disturbingly familiar?

337
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:52,940
Mum!

338
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:54,692
Mum, come on.

339
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,027
Come on out from
wherever you're snooping.

340
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,781
- What?
- Ah.

341
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,075
I tried to find ones that
resemble your detective.

342
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,910
Then again, all humans
look alike to me.

343
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,663
No, you did, um,
well, remarkably well.

344
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:09,165
But what on Earth for?

345
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,250
Since anger didn't work,
I wanted to incite

346
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,169
a different emotion.

347
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,546
See if that would get
the sword fired up.

348
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,132
A foursome isn't
an emotion, Mum.

349
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,718
Ladies, I'm sorry, but, uh,

350
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,344
it's hard for me to enjoy
a triple-Decker

351
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,597
with my mum's hands
all over it, so...

352
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:29,518
Another time, maybe. Shame.

353
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:32,188
(clears throat)

354
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:34,815
Don't look so glum.

355
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,484
It's just a matter of time
before I get

356
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,360
a handle on my emotions.

357
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:40,738
I know it's
a matter of time.

358
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,823
- That's the problem.
- What's the rush?

359
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:45,576
Not like eternity's got
a "best before" date.

360
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,663
You'd understand
if you had children.

361
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,248
Many of which you haven't
seen in a millennia.

362
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:52,082
Yes.

363
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,376
That's it, Mum. You're right.

364
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,545
I need to have a child.

365
00:13:57,922 --> 00:13:59,381
Right, have a gander at that.

366
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,258
See if you can
learn a few things.

367
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:09,725
Mm-hmm.

368
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,228
Right, well, it seemed like
something wasn't adding up.

369
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:14,313
Yeah, okay.

370
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:16,357
Thanks, Ella.

371
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,152
(gasps) Okay.

372
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,654
(exhales)

373
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:25,282
I am gonna tie a bell
around your neck at some point.

374
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:27,034
Oh, sounds like a fun
bit of foreplay,

375
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,661
but I've more important
things to attend to first.

376
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,204
Yeah, I'm sure you do,
but hold on.

377
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,580
Something's bothering me.

378
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,666
The killer wiped the
fingerprints off the handle,

379
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,292
but not Debbie's blood
from the blade.

380
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,503
But the scissors were
found at their home, correct?

381
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,963
In the unlocked pool house,

382
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,006
so anyone could have
gained access to it.

383
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,925
So you think the killer
planted the murder weapon

384
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,844
on the couple last seen
fighting with the victim.

385
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:45,970
That's admirably devious.

386
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,264
Jon and Craig said
that their check cleared.

387
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,516
But Debbie told them the school
never received their money.

388
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,560
- So she's lying.
- But what if she
wasn't lying?

389
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,645
What if somebody embezzled
the money at the school?

390
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:56,689
Debbie could have found out,
she could have confronted them.

391
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:57,523
They could be the killer.

392
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,567
So, you know, what we got
to do-- check the books,

393
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,277
see if there's a record
of a donation.

394
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:02,152
LUCIFER:
Right.

395
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,238
Baby, why are you
still in your PJs?

396
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,447
You're gonna miss the bus.

397
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,199
I don't have time to
drive you to school today.

398
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:08,117
Hold on.

399
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:09,368
Why don't you go
and deal

400
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:11,161
with the donation thingy,

401
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,707
and I can, uh, take the little
sh... ugar plum fairy to school.

402
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:16,500
Are you sure?

403
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,044
For my partner?
Yes, I can sacrifice.

404
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,213
You okay with that?

405
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,173
Brilliant.

406
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,594
♪ Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah ♪

407
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,013
♪ Yeah-eah-eah-
eah-eah ♪

408
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,891
♪ Yeah-eah-eah-eah, yeah. ♪

409
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,311
You're gonna be in trouble
if my mom finds out.

410
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,646
What? I said
I'd drive you to school.

411
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,231
I never specified which one.

412
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,859
So, play along, and I'll
deliver my end of the bargain.

413
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,152
- Mr. Morningstar?
- Yes.

414
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,737
- Hey. Mr. Taylor.
- Ah.

415
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:45,696
You're here
for the Starford tour?

416
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,281
I am indeed.
I am indeed.

417
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,784
And this little creature,
who gets whatever she wants...

418
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,621
Trixie Morningstar.
Nice to meet you, sir.

419
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,789
Hi. (chuckles)

420
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,875
LUCIFER:
Ah, lovely.

421
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,799
So, right upstairs there
is our plant-based kitchen.

422
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,927
Uh, it's where the students
make their own lunch.

423
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,179
You know, instead of
packaged, preprocessed foods,

424
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,014
we, uh, we like them
to bring in, uh...

425
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,390
(quietly):
Sorry, do we have to touch?

426
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,351
Don't you have a leash or
something for when we go out?

427
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,478
Do you want to sell this or not?

428
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,104
- It's a lot of fun...
- Yes, that's all
quite riveting.

429
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,856
Um, where is it where
children learn to,

430
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,816
you know, harness
their emotions?

431
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,110
Uh... uh...

432
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,528
(sighs) Hold on.

433
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,447
Uh, sorry, this isn't
my normal job.

434
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,783
I'm just filling in till we find
a replacement for poor Debbie.

435
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,743
Oh, well, what is it
you normally do?

436
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,788
Uh, I'm the movement
and wellness mentor.

437
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:38,040
So you're the P.E. teacher.
Lovely.

438
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:41,961
Okay, well,
right here, this is

439
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,213
the, uh, meditation room.

440
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,756
Um, and then,
right next door is, uh,

441
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:47,132
it's where the kids do
their justice circles.

442
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,218
I need you to show me
where they teach lessons

443
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,261
on controlling your emotions.

444
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,555
TAYLOR:
Oh.

445
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,058
She's having emotional problems?

446
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:57,476
Who?

447
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:58,352
Oh, the child.

448
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,104
Sure. Probably.

449
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,855
Listen, what would be
really helpful is

450
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,984
turning feelings into something,
like a weapon.

451
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,654
Well, I think I know
just the class.

452
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,572
You do? Wonderful.

453
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:11,532
Great.

454
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,368
Come on, child.

455
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:20,874
And you want to look
through our ledgers... why?

456
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,085
Because we want to know
if Debbie was telling the truth

457
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,503
about the missing donation,

458
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,297
and it could tie into
the motive for the murder.

459
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,508
(sobs)

460
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,051
I knew it.

461
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,554
(sobbing):
You got me.

462
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,598
No need to look
at the books. I did it.

463
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,810
The donation never made it
into the school account.

464
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:41,395
I cashed the check.

465
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:42,771
You stole the money?

466
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,857
- Why?
- I guess I was

467
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,109
tired of feeling
like I didn't belong.

468
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,153
Starford seemed so

469
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,196
nonjudgmental and inclusive.

470
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,282
But I'm-I'm under
a lot of pressure

471
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,408
to look a certain way,

472
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,909
drive a certain car.

473
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,455
And my salary
barely covers my rent.

474
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:02,875
Okay, so Debbie found out
that you took

475
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,626
Jon and Craig's donation money

476
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,754
and... did you kill her?

477
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,840
What? No, no.

478
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:14,178
Debbie assumed the parents
never extended the check.

479
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,637
They called her a liar,

480
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:19,266
got so upset,
and they killed her.

481
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,769
But I'm to blame.

482
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,396
I'm so sorry.

483
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:25,647
DAN:
Look, we're not

484
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:29,818
real sure if Jon and Craig
killed Debbie.

485
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:31,028
Really?

486
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:36,325
(sniffles)

487
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,284
Oh.

488
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,746
If it's not related
to the murders, after all, um,

489
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,124
perhaps we could
disregard...

490
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,211
that last exchange.

491
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,254
Uh, is everything okay in here?

492
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,006
Sounded like a child was crying.

493
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,009
We're just asking the
assistant dean some questions.

494
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,220
Uh, I am Detective Decker.
This is Detective...

495
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,347
Oh, you're Trixie's
cop-mom, aren't you?

496
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,765
That's a great
kid you've got.

497
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,142
Thank you.
H-How do you know...

498
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:03,018
How do you know my daughter?

499
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:04,353
She's in Madison's
class right now.

500
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,021
Yeah, her father
brought her in.

501
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,691
Um... I'm pretty sure
he didn't.

502
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,529
Uh, can you finish
getting the statement, please,

503
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,531
and I'll see whatever
the hell Lucifer is doing.

504
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:18,951
But the good news is
bad feelings can be

505
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,245
harnessed into
good actions.

506
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,747
My son Ranger knows this.
Right, Ranger?

507
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,753
Would anyone else like to try?

508
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:30,879
Yeah.

509
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,757
Would any of the <i>children</i>
like to volunteer?

510
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:34,800
(Lucifer sighs)

511
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,178
For a progressive school,
it's rather ageist.

512
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,973
Trixie.

513
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,474
Do you have feelings
you want to use?

514
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,268
I know it's only your
first time, but...

515
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,603
I feel sad.

516
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,564
- Okay, why?
- Because...

517
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,400
my mommy almost died.

518
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,152
Her job is scary.

519
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,779
But she has helped
so many other people

520
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,281
with their problems,

521
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,825
I don't want her
to worry about mine.

522
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,245
So I pretend I'm okay.

523
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,205
Well...

524
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,584
welcome to the club
of parental deceit, child.

525
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,169
It's a lonely place,

526
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,546
but, uh, that's the price
of being clever.

527
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,633
Okay, now what?

528
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,095
How does one control
that juvenile angst usefully?

529
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,640
Trixie can channel
her strong feelings

530
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,475
into something productive.

531
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,227
Okay, go on.

532
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,646
For example,
she could...

533
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,607
write a poem.

534
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:32,524
A poem?

535
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:33,859
I came here
to learn how

536
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,695
to turn emotions into energy,
not to become Dr. Seuss.

537
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,864
Well, creative energy is energy.

538
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,366
Oh, come on. If I wanted
to attend an art class,

539
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,451
I would have at least
had the sense

540
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,286
to take one with a nude model.

541
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,997
I suppose you're channeling
emotional despair

542
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,541
over not getting dessert
before your veggies, are you?

543
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:53,378
No. This is a picture of
my mommy stabbing Debbie.

544
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,466
Lucifer.

545
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,719
Detective.

546
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,638
Right, before you chastise me

547
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,306
for kidnapping
your offspring,

548
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,058
I've solved the case.

549
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,938
Okay, the boy's mother
is Joy Sherman.

550
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:12,481
This is her contact info.

551
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,107
Okay, I'll look into it.

552
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:15,359
Is Trixie okay?

553
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,110
I'll talk to her.

554
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,071
I'll see you at
the station, okay?

555
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:19,947
Yeah.

556
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,286
Ah, Detective.

557
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,454
You need to understand,
I'm dealing with

558
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:28,330
a most challenging issue...

559
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,332
Yeah, I want to talk to my
daughter for a second.

560
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,334
Please don't be mad at him.

561
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,752
I should be the one
in trouble.

562
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:36,880
Oh... I'm not mad at you.

563
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,423
You're not in
trouble, Monkey.

564
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,092
I do want you to know

565
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,719
you can talk to me
if something's going on.

566
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:44,137
I know.

567
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,555
You know that?

568
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,557
You want to talk
about something now?

569
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,185
I could tell you anything?

570
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:51,979
Yes.

571
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,565
I'd like to ride with Lucifer.

572
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,776
I promise
I'll make him take me

573
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,736
to my actual school this time.

574
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,115
Huh.

575
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,076
Um, yeah, okay.

576
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,790
You are lucky my daughter
likes you so much.

577
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:15,127
Yes, I'm starting to respect
the deceptive little parasite.

578
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,878
- (chuckles)
- Oh, well, that's nice.

579
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,381
Speaking of, a deal's a deal.

580
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:20,549
What?

581
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,428
CHLOE:
Oh, no.

582
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,472
I... (sighs)

583
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:29,975
Driving lessons
will have to wait

584
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,268
until your mum's not looking.

585
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,854
- CHLOE: Bye, babe.
- (engine starts)

586
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,777
(sighs):
Oh, kids.

587
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:44,614
Ah.

588
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:47,242
Wonderful, a mugger.
(chuckles)

589
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,411
Come on, then.
I fancy a bit of exercise

590
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:50,704
after a frustrating day.

591
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,548
(shouts)

592
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:11,683
Mum?

593
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,062
Let me see the blade.
Anything?

594
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,439
Since when can
you hit so hard?

595
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,317
My strength has been
growing steadily.

596
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,110
As is your recklessness,
it seems.

597
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,528
I mean, what did you
expect me to do?

598
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,615
Stab you with the blade and
have it be ignited by my joy?

599
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,742
I was trying
to get you worked up.

600
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,160
Anger and awakening

601
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,204
- your sexual instincts
didn't work.
- I...

602
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:35,665
I thought maybe if you were
afraid for your life...

603
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,209
Well, if you really
wanted to upset me,

604
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,127
you should have just thrown me
into the Corvette.

605
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,004
Don't...

606
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,131
throw me into
the Corvette.

607
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:46,176
Just trust me, Mum.
I'm dealing with this.

608
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:47,969
Clearly, not fast enough.

609
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,137
Why are you so angry?

610
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:50,222
I'm not angry!

611
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,057
Yes, you are.

612
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:52,891
Just...

613
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,061
really need to get home,
where we belong.

614
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:57,687
Soon.

615
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,278
Hey, Chlo, we got that
kid's mom in inter...

616
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:08,240
What's wrong?

617
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:09,616
Look at this e-mail.

618
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,702
Why are you being invited
to a "grieving gathering"

619
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:13,703
at Starford Academy?

620
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,622
'Cause Trixie's being
considered for admission.

621
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:18,083
Apparently, she impressed
some of the teachers there.

622
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,168
Or they were impressed with
Lucifer's bank account.

623
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:21,336
It's probably the only
thing they care about

624
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:22,754
at that
pretentious place.

625
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:23,630
Well, I mean,

626
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,382
it is non-traditional,
that's for sure.

627
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:27,050
Wait, are you actually
considering it?

628
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:29,094
- Uh...
- I mean, don't you think
that with the divorce

629
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,887
and the move and everything
that Trixie's had enough

630
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,681
- big changes lately?
- Exactly.

631
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,474
Trixie's pretending
that she's fine, Dan.

632
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:38,270
One morning at Starford,
and she's been opening up

633
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:41,148
like I haven't been able
to get her to do for months.

634
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,608
- You didn't see her.
- Yeah, well,

635
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,235
it kills me to think
that she, uh,

636
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,696
she's been keeping up an act
just to protect us.

637
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:49,781
When did our kid
get so adult?

638
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,075
She does still hide chocolate
cake under the bed, though.

639
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,618
Yeah, well, thank God for that.

640
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,036
Okay, well,

641
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,372
maybe we can consider sending
our daughter to that school

642
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:00,083
after we've solved the ongoing
murder investigation there.

643
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:03,336
DAN: Can you
explain to us why

644
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,338
your son would draw this,
Ms. Sherman?

645
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,592
I'm not sure
what it even is.

646
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,886
He says it's you killing Debbie.

647
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:14,055
Oh, he was listening to me.
(chuckles)

648
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,849
He never listens to me.

649
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,351
So you said
that you killed Debbie?

650
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,438
No, I-I said
I wanted to kill her.

651
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,857
Every morning,
while peeling the sticker off

652
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,358
some root vegetable
I got at the supermarket

653
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,819
for a third of the price
of the organic crap.

654
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,071
Rubbing it in dirt
works like a charm, by the way.

655
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,906
Hmm.

656
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,532
Why would you say that to him?

657
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,869
Because I'm single
and I work full-time,

658
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,205
and Debbie had
a million little ways

659
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,081
of making me feel like
a bad mom because of it.

660
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,042
- For working?
- Yeah.

661
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,795
Well, that sounds like
a great environment.

662
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:48,298
Apparently,
I wasn't "involved enough."

663
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:50,467
Like, I'm sorry
that my bake sale cupcakes

664
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,719
weren't gluten
and dairy free, Debbie.

665
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,429
Joy, where were you
two nights ago?

666
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:56,932
Tuesday?

667
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:58,558
Mm-hmm.

668
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,938
Um, I was,
I was with Mr. Taylor.

669
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:03,980
CHLOE:
Mr. Taylor?

670
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,983
The wellness mentor?
What were you doing?

671
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:09,528
We weren't discussing
the French New Wave.

672
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,071
- Oh.
- DAN: So you're
having an affair

673
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:11,947
with the...

674
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,032
with the
P.E. teacher.

675
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,784
JOY:
Only on Tuesday nights.

676
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,203
He had a busy schedule.

677
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,748
Look, every mom
at Starford knows

678
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,208
that the movement
and wellness program

679
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,293
is one of the best benefits
of the school.

680
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,964
I mean, the man is
as dumb as a box of hair,

681
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:32,592
but he does know how to move.

682
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,719
CHLOE: While I check
into your alibi, uh,

683
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,805
can you tell us, are
there any other people

684
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:38,807
that you can think of that
had a grudge against Debbie?

685
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:40,475
Are you, are you kidding?

686
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:43,270
Who didn't hate the Wicked Witch
of the Westside?

687
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,730
She held the keys to the most
exclusive school in the city,

688
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,941
and she never let
anyone forget it.

689
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:49,818
We were told that
she was very well loved.

690
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,403
(laughs)

691
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:54,197
Well, the hairlines
and the perky boobs

692
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,365
aren't the only phony things

693
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:56,366
at that school.

694
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,993
You want to know who killed her?

695
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:01,371
You should go to that grieving
gathering they're throwing.

696
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,665
All her frenemies will be there.

697
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:13,133
(mumbling quietly)

698
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,218
(snaps fingers)

699
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,013
Never seen you so worried
about an outfit, Decker.

700
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:20,682
Not picking up the first
coat off the floor as usual?

701
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,142
Nope.

702
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:23,893
No, I'm not.

703
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:25,478
I am going

704
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,230
to a grieving gathering
at the school,

705
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,275
and, well, you should see
the other parents.

706
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:31,735
They are very fancy.

707
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:32,611
It's...

708
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,030
- (sniffs)
- You know what?

709
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:36,656
Never mind. I don't
want to make you sick

710
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:37,949
- with my feelings.
- No.

711
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,993
Come on. I'm
listening, I promise.

712
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,161
No more earbuds.

713
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,459
Okay, Trixie might get into
this private school,

714
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,210
and it could be
really, really good for her.

715
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:50,754
But it's super exclusive,

716
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:53,298
and I'm not sure that I want her
in that kind of environment.

717
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:56,551
That's what you're
so worried about?

718
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,552
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

719
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,512
A school like that
is great for Trixie.

720
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:00,639
You think so?

721
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:01,473
Yeah.

722
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:02,766
Fancy-pants rich kids?

723
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:03,933
They're like vipers, okay?

724
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:06,144
Trixie will learn
to slash them with her words.

725
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,897
Then I will teach her
the knives.

726
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:11,441
Oh, okay.

727
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,485
I think-- I know
you're trying to help,

728
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:14,903
but, uh, I don't think

729
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,280
you can help me with...
with this now.

730
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:23,787
♪ I'm counting bones
of your casualties ♪

731
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,497

CHLOE:
Hi. (clears throat)

733
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,334
Uh, Chloe Decker.
Uh, Trixie's mom.

734
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,252
Just you?

735
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:33,713
Alone?

736
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,049
Just me, alone.

737
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:37,300
Yeah.
(chuckles nervously)

738
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:38,343
WOMAN:
Aw.

739
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,220
That must be difficult.

740
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,639
Actually,
she's with me.

741
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,728
Oh. Two mommies?

742
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,563
Oh, hell yeah.

743
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:53,066
- Um...
- Trixie's a handful,

744
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,068
definitely
a two-woman job.

745
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:56,569
Right, honey?

746
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,530
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

747
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,407
♪ It's comin', comin' ♪

748
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,368

00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,416
CHLOE:
What are you doing here?

750
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:12,585
Look, I'm not good
at listening.

751
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,255
Or talking about
emotion stuff.

752
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,090
But I do know you
don't let your girl

753
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:19,008
go into enemy
territory alone.

754
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:20,927
Thank you.

755
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,432
Oh, wow.

756
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:28,435
I guess networking
is the new grieving.

757
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:29,936
MAZE:
Mm-hmm.

758
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,273
You're Trixie's moms, right?

759
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,692
- Mm.
- I'm the event
coordinator here.

760
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,943
I just wanted to tell you

761
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,405
that we'd be so happy to
have you as part of the family.

762
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:43,074
Mid-afternoon yoga
always needs more volunteers.

763
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:43,908
- (giggles)
- Oh.

764
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:45,577
I would love to,
but mid-afternoons,

765
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:46,661
I'm at my job.

766
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:47,787
- Oh.
- Yeah.

767
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,831
She's a homicide detective.

768
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:50,665
Oh.

769
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,292
She has a gun
and everything.

770
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,543
(woman chuckles)

771
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:55,044
A real pistol in
the sack, too.

772
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:56,504
- (woman laughs)
- Oh!

773
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,089
(chuckles) Jokester.

774
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,258
I wish I had time for a job.

775
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,509
But you know what they say:

776
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,846
exceptional child,
exhausted mom.

777
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,181
(giggles)

778
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,307
Mm-hmm.

779
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,685
I've never heard
anyone say that.

780
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,687
- (scoffs)
- Doesn't makes sense.

781
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,565
Maze, look at everybody.
Look at these parents.

782
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,484
Who has a kid and is
this put together?

783
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:18,985
Use those detective
skills, Decker.

784
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,987
Get out of your own
head. Look around.

785
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:21,821
All right.

786
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,948
That entire table
over there

787
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,075
is just waiting
for that couple to go nuclear.

788
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:28,453
- (chuckles)
- Oh, when that
woman walked in,

789
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,456
the entire room started
commenting on her cheek-filler.

790
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:33,082
- Hmm.
- They're miserable.

791
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,126
And waiting to tear
each other apart.

792
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:36,878
Actually...

793
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,838
reminds me of home.

794
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:40,340
Hmm.

795
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,510
You know what?
You're right.

796
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:46,554
They love gossip.

797
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:48,932
And the juicier,
the better.

798
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:50,809
You know what?

799
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,936
Let's give them something
to talk about.

800
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,148
Don't do that.

801
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,360
♪ Am I thinking
what I think I'm feeling? ♪

802
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,488

Careful, brother.

809
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:19,462
Too much of that
will make you go blind.

810
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:22,048
Mom was right.

811
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:24,926
I can't make it work.

812
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:26,761
Ah, I see. You're up here

813
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,681
practicing a different kind
of self-flagellation, are you?

814
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:31,933
Hoping for
a celestial spark?

815
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:33,309
You don't even
have your powers.

816
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:35,228
Yeah, thanks for
that reminder, Luci.

817
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,772
You know, I also don't seem

818
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:39,566
to have much of
Mom's attention anymore.

819
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,943
Because, unlike you,

820
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:46,281
I don't have some glorious
destiny to wield the sword.

821
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:47,699
(sighs)
And what's so great

822
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,409
about Mum's attention?

823
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,369
She nearly killed me
in the car park earlier,

824
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,454
trying to help me
achieve that destiny.

825
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,790
Oh, good job warning me she's
strong enough to lift a house,

826
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:56,624
by the way.

827
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,168
Same old Luci,
always the victim.

828
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:01,754
Can't you just be
grateful for once?

829
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,047
You're the Lightbringer!

830
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:03,882
Am I?

831
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,425
Am I, indeed?

832
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,302
'Cause so far,
it's just Mum's word against,

833
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,012
well, reality.

834
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:12,015
What if she's wrong, brother?

835
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:14,475
She's been acting
very odd recently.

836
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,144
On edge.

837
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,438
This obsession
with getting home,

838
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:19,731
it's a bit much,
don't you think?

839
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:20,773
(scoffs)

840
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,652
You see, I thought
we all wanted to go back.

841
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,279
You know I don't lie, brother.

842
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:30,033
So trust me when I say
nothing would make me happier

843
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:31,659
than Mum getting her wish.

844
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:35,079
Then you need to stop
fighting this, Luci,

845
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:36,581
and find a way

846
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:37,957
to get the sword to work.

847
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,793
Because whether
we like it or not,

848
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:43,796
it is all on you.

849
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,174
Lightbringer.

850
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,016
You, uh, call
this pâté, huh?

851
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,809
(chuckles)
I know, right?

852
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,187
You know, say what you will
about Debbie,

853
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,439
but that woman knew
how to cater a party.

854
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:04,692
You're married
to that cop, right?

855
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,194
Yeah.

856
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:09,656
Actually,
can you keep a secret?

857
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,534
My wife is very close

858
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,161
to making an arrest.

859
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,873
We think the killer
might actually be here.

860
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,627
She found evidence
just tonight.

861
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:23,544
DNA.

862
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,088
It's in the car right now.

863
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:31,177
Somebody here is going to jail.

864
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,223
Oh, but keep that on
the DL, all right?

865
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:36,432
Knuckles.

866
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:44,774
(gasps)

867
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,568
Five gossips down,
a couple more to be safe.

868
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,365
No, look,
this is plenty.

869
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:54,617
Let's hope
they take the bait.

870
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,412
Okay, all I have
to do now

871
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,123
is stake out the car;
if the killer is here,

872
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,000
they'll go out there
for the evidence.

873
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:13,052
Ah.

874
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:14,887
Just the person
I'm looking for.

875
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,889
- Mr. Morningstar.
- Yes.

876
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,767
Look, I'm willing to give
your Kumbaya curriculum

877
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:20,685
a second look.

878
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:23,479
Perhaps if I'm more specific
about what I want out of it:

879
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,064
uh, less
watercolors,

880
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:27,191
more, sort of, heavenly flames?

881
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:28,651
Are you
following me?

882
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,570
Sorry, do you need something
out of the detective's car?

883
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:33,865
Uh, uh, yeah, she-she asked me
to grab something for her.

884
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:34,699
Ah.

885
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,075
Well, let's get that over with,

886
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:38,077
so we can focus on
what's important: me.

887
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:38,911
(chuckles)

888
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,829
(car alarm chirps)

889
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,499
Uh, don't tell her I,
uh, got a copy made.

890
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:46,753
She gets all fussy about
things like illegal duplicates.

891
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,921
So, uh, do you do
private tutoring?

892
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,298
'Cause I'm free
most of the time.

893
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:51,632
Specifically now.

894
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:52,925
Yeah.

895
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,595
Lucifer,
what are you doing?

896
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:58,139
Uh, Madison said she needed
something from your car.

897
00:34:58,723 --> 00:34:59,432
What?

898
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,100
She's the killer.

899
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,644
(chuckles)
That's quite a leap, Detective.

900
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,354
No, it isn't.
Lucifer, please, she...

901
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:09,859
My gun's in the car.

902
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:13,988
Well, why didn't you
tell me all this earlier?

903
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,657
- Put your hands up.
- (sighs)

904
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,121
MADISON:
Stay back!

905
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:26,042
- Stay back!
- Madison,

906
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,044
- put down the gun.
- Yes.

907
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,378
Perhaps if you
channel your feelings

908
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:30,546
into something
other than bullets,

909
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:31,380
that might...

910
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,758
- (yelping)
- Okay.

911
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,427
I said stay back!

912
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,387
Okay, got it.

913
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,057
Oh, you!

914
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,352
This is all your fault!

915
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,145
With your stupid

916
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:48,815
handsome face
and your chiseled abs

917
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:49,899
and your huge...

918
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,901
You slept with the
P.E. teacher, too?

919
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,278
Well, the movement and wellness
mentor, Detective, but...

920
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:57,448
CHLOE: Madison, if I've
learned anything here tonight,

921
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:59,992
it's that everyone here
has secrets.

922
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,410
No one's perfect.

923
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:02,370
Okay?

924
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,622
- But we didn't have sex.
- (gasps)

925
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:05,873
Well, I mean, okay, one time.

926
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:07,375
But, come on, that was,
like, years ago.

927
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,293
One time was all it took.

928
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:12,421
This is about your son,
isn't it?

929
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,506
LUCIFER: What?
You mean the boy

930
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:15,842
in the class with the special
diet of boogers and paste?

931
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:16,759
Lucifer.

932
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:17,635
I...

933
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:19,804
MADISON:
God knows I love Ranger,

934
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:23,182
but he's not very smart.

935
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,684
My husband is,

936
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,395
and that witch Debbie
put two and two together.

937
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,605
And she told you
that she was gonna

938
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:31,858
expose Mr. Taylor as Ranger's

939
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:32,692
real father.

940
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,194
She hated how
all the moms loved him.

941
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:37,071
My husband
would've left me.

942
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,573
Madison, I understand.

943
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,366
You were just thinking
of your son's future.

944
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:42,869
I-I get it. I-I'm a mother, too.

945
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:44,787
Um, maybe you remember
Trixie, my daughter.

946
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:46,455
Th-The little girl who was sad

947
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,499
because her mom had
such a scary job.

948
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:49,917
That's me. She's my daughter.

949
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:52,587
So, please,

950
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:54,672
Madison, put
down the gun.

951
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:01,470
I'm so sorry.

952
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,181
I-I got so angry,

953
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:05,057
I couldn't control myself.

954
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,225
What? Hold on.

955
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:08,477
All this talk about
controlling your emotions

956
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,856
and harnessing them for creation
was all just a sham?

957
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,025
I tried so hard to make it real.

958
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:14,859
(sighs)

959
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,278
We can't control our emotions.

960
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:18,738
We just have to keep try...

961
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:19,572
(Madison screams)

962
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,616
(crowd gasps)

963
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,995
(panting)

964
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,664
Listening to feelings,
it's not my thing.

965
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:30,541
Right, honey?

966
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:33,586
You know,
if I were you,

967
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,379
I'd take my child
out of this school.

968
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,881
Terrible place.

969
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:39,175
Wait.

970
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:40,968
I'm a father?

971
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:45,556
(laughs):
That's awesome.

972
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,355
(softly):
Here you go.

973
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:56,943
How cute this guy is.

974
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:00,112
So...

975
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:03,241
I went back to
that school today.

976
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:06,327
And I think they'd let you
in if you wanted to go.

977
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:08,204
So how do you
feel about that?

978
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:13,251
Well, can I tell you how
it made me feel being there?

979
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:15,419
Well, at first,

980
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:19,548
it made me feel
insecure and worried.

981
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,884
I mean, the school is so fancy,

982
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:25,012
and all the other mommies
seemed so perfect.

983
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:27,098
But guess what I found out.

984
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:28,099
What?

985
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,101
That the other mommies,

986
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,937
they were just as worried
as I was.

987
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:35,815
And they were just
pretending to be perfect.

988
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,026
Is it bad to pretend?

989
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,362
No, not always, Monkey.

990
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:44,156
I mean, sometimes
people feel like...

991
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:46,033
(sighs)

992
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,245
...like they have to pretend
that everything's okay.

993
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:50,663
But--

994
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:53,708
and this is
the most important part--

995
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,252
you and me,

996
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:58,504
we never have to

997
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:01,215
pretend with each other.
(sniffles)

998
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:06,262
I really didn't
like that school.

999
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:08,264
(whispers):
I didn't like it either.

1000
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:09,515
(chuckles)

1001
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,021
Thanks for
telling me, Monkey.

1002
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,904
It turns out
you were right, Doctor.

1003
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,198
It's impossible to
control your feelings.

1004
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,160
And anyone who does risks
turning into a murderous lunatic

1005
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,412
with a child of below-average
intelligence, so...

1006
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,788
Yeah, well, I'm sure

1007
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:35,791
at least some of that,
that's inaccurate.

1008
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,877
But I'm glad
you've come around.

1009
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:42,590
Are you ready to be
more forthcoming now?

1010
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:43,924
(sighs)

1011
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,010
Yes, I suppose.

1012
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,846
If that's what it takes
to get you to help me.

1013
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:50,890
So...

1014
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:51,974
um...

1015
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:54,727
I wasn't lying before,
obviously.

1016
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:57,355
I do intend to use
the Flaming Sword

1017
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:59,023
to cut through
the Gates of Heaven.

1018
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:00,775
But what you left out...?

1019
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,276
Is that once I do that,

1020
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:04,904
I plan on kicking Mum
into Heaven

1021
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,198
and slamming the gates
on her backside.

1022
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:09,533
But she'll be
trapped there,

1023
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:10,868
on her own.

1024
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:13,371
Won't God destroy her?

1025
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,873
Hopefully, they
tear each other apart.

1026
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:17,625
Then they'll both get
what they deserve.

1027
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:18,501
What's that?

1028
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:19,668
Punishment.

1029
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:21,837
For manipulating me.

1030
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,756
I mean, Dad set a trap for me,

1031
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:25,716
but Mum was the one who made
sure that I fell into it.

1032
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:28,302
She was the one
that made sure that I felt...

1033
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:32,598
...that I...

1034
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:36,060
that I felt things that
I don't want to feel anymore.

1035
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:37,186
That, right there,

1036
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:39,897
that what you stopped
yourself from feeling,

1037
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:42,900
that's exactly
what you need to feel.

1038
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,151
What, the anger?

1039
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:45,736
Oh, I feel it.

1040
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:47,029
Not the anger.

1041
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:49,907
The pain.

1042
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,076
That's what you've
been suppressing.

1043
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,162
All the pain and heartbreak

1044
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:58,249
that you have over
what happened with your mother.

1045
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:02,670
And Chloe.

1046
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:07,550
I know it's difficult.

1047
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:12,179
But the only way
to get over that pain...

1048
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,556
(chuckles softly)

1049
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:15,266
...is to go through it.

1050
00:41:21,689 --> 00:41:23,524
AMENADIEL: <i>So you think
you've figured it out?</i>

1051
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:24,316
Yes.

1052
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,110
And you're sure
this time?

1053
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:27,194
Just...

1054
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,947
let me do it, Mum, please.

1055
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,424
♪♪

1056
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:57,975
(sobbing softly)

1057
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:13,324
That's it?!

1058
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:15,075
You must not be feeling enough!

1059
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:16,869
(scoffs) Trust me.

1060
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:18,746
That's it. That's all I've got!

1061
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,207
You have to try harder.

1062
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:22,708
- What?
- Try harder!

1063
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:25,044
Mom! That's enough!

1064
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:26,921
I'm not broken.

1065
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,881
The sword must be.

1066
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:29,882
Okay.

1067
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:31,383
Okay, then we'll fix it.

1068
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:32,968
There's plenty of time.

1069
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:34,720
(chuckles)

1070
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:36,013
Of course.

1071
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,640
You're right, son.

1072
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:39,225
There's plenty of time.

1073
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:42,102
(scoffs)

1074
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:51,654
(elevator bell dings)

1075
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:05,626
(exhales)

1076
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,337
Just not for me.
