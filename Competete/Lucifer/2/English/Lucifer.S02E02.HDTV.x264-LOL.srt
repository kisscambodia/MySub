1
00:00:00,684 --> 00:00:03,637
- Previously on Lucifer...
- Who escaped Hell?

2
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:04,777
Mum.

3
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:06,923
Dad got pissed off and
tossed me out of the house.

4
00:00:06,947 --> 00:00:08,180
And what did your mother do?

5
00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:09,759
She just stood there and let it happen.

6
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:12,151
A couple of a thousand years later,
Dad kicked her out, too.

7
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:15,955
So I did the same for her
as she did for me: zilch.

8
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:18,824
So, Mama Morningstar's on the loose.

9
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,159
I never could break that woman.

10
00:00:20,227 --> 00:00:21,453
She wouldn't submit.

11
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,406
- What are you doing here?
- I've been demoted.

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,364
Been reassigned to assist on cases.

13
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:28,000
You lied to me about being a doctor.

14
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:29,368
Do you realize

15
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:31,537
the ethical position you've put me in?

16
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:36,242
If she's not coming to kill me,

17
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,944
then I don't know what she's doing.

18
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:39,423
That's truly terrifying.

19
00:00:41,248 --> 00:00:42,281
Lucifer.

20
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:43,349
Mum.

21
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:45,251
Help me.

22
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:50,767
Hello?

23
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,168
- Are you okay?
- He just collapsed.

24
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:54,527
- Does anyone know CPR?
- No, I don't know.

25
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:55,995
Hello? Are you okay?

26
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:57,463
Call 911!

27
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:59,165
Uh, heart attack maybe?

28
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:01,167
I think he might be dead.

29
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:07,540
Sir? Sir?

30
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:09,075
- Lucifer?
- Sir, are you okay?

31
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:10,343
Lucifer? Where are you?

32
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,844
Sir, are you okay?

33
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:13,746
Has anyone seen Lucifer?

34
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:36,869
Lucifer.

35
00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:38,571
I need to find Lucifer.

36
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:42,642
Man. Thought I killed your ass.

37
00:02:17,077 --> 00:02:19,211
Hey, Mom?

38
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,849
Mommy...

39
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:08,594
Lucifer.

40
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:12,932
And that's when I started
looking for you, son.

41
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,333
At least I've managed to keep

42
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:16,836
this flesh sack in one piece.

43
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:18,704
It has not been easy.

44
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:22,241
Quite a few of the male species
have been eying me hungrily.

45
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:24,944
Do humans eat their own?

46
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:27,780
Well, say something.

47
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:29,415
Aren't you glad to see me?

48
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:31,517
I apologize for my human form, but...

49
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:34,954
at least this one has supreme hindquarters.

50
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:37,790
You're lying.

51
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:39,558
No. They're quite sturdy. Feel it.

52
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:41,160
I wasn't referring,

53
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:44,096
nor will I ever refer,
to your butt, Mother.

54
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:47,608
I simply don't believe
your wounded bird story.

55
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:49,543
You're the goddess of all creation.

56
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:52,680
Not anymore, unfortunately.

57
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:54,448
Now I'm just trapped in this stinky human

58
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,117
with the exceptional ass.

59
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:59,520
I swear, all I've done for three
days is wander this cesspool,

60
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:02,323
asking these vacuous
cretins how to find you.

61
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:07,962
What are you doing?

62
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:09,200
Calling Amenadiel.

63
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:11,232
Oh!

64
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:12,900
Wonderful. He's here, too?

65
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:15,240
Yes. And he'll be the one
taking you back to Hell, so...

66
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:16,737
What?!

67
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:18,139
Why?

68
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:20,541
Because you're dangerous and terrifying.

69
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:23,344
I promise you I'm not
here to hurt anyone.

70
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:26,175
You have to believe me.

71
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:28,582
My entire focus has been
on finding you, son.

72
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,284
So you can eviscerate me? Got it.

73
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:33,821
No. We've wasted enough
time being... estranged.

74
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:36,557
I'd do anything to rectify that now.

75
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,659
Sure you don't mean "revenge that"?

76
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:42,429
Lucifer, your father put me in Hell.

77
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:44,131
Not you. I know that.

78
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,132
Yes.

79
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,635
But I was your warden.

80
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:49,036
Not by choice.

81
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:50,804
We were both wronged.

82
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:56,577
But you could have at least visited me.

83
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:58,846
Oh, I'm sorry.

84
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:01,782
When Dad cast me out,
who stood by and did nothing?

85
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,585
Hint: it's a palindrome for "mum."

86
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:08,222
Well, maybe if you had talked
to me in Hell instead of sending

87
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,657
your little demon torturer,

88
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:11,358
I could've explained the whole thing.

89
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,167
You're right, you're right.

90
00:05:13,235 --> 00:05:16,103
But I'm here now, so by all means, explain.

91
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:21,175
You wouldn't believe me.

92
00:05:21,243 --> 00:05:25,780
I know how suspicious
and untrusting you are.

93
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:28,249
You don't know anything about me.

94
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:30,518
Lucifer.

95
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:32,453
I'm your mother.

96
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:36,323
Not for a very, very long time.

97
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:40,961
Well, I want to be now.

98
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:50,504
Then I'm going to need you to prove

99
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:52,707
your little origin story to me.

100
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:55,910
We'll retrace your steps.

101
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:58,045
If I don't find a trail
of bloodshed and carnage,

102
00:05:58,113 --> 00:05:59,714
then perhaps I'll believe you.

103
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:03,684
Fine. We'll begin where I found
the tiny spear in my neck.

104
00:06:03,752 --> 00:06:05,326
- Fine.
- Hmm.

105
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:07,398
Gonna need to get you some clean clothes.

106
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:10,491
Humans tend to frown
at the sight of blood.

107
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,326
Yes.

108
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:13,516
I've noticed.

109
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:29,777
Uh, just leave it, would you?

110
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:31,846
Gosh, perhaps we shouldn't
have borrowed from Maze.

111
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:34,949
Her clothing is insufficient.

112
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,784
Yes. Half my hide is exposed.

113
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:39,186
Human attire is very impractical.

114
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:40,821
They're morons, aren't they?

115
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,969
Oh. So you admit you revile them?

116
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,535
To revile them would
be to care about them,

117
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:47,161
which I do not.

118
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:55,220
Then all those rumors

119
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:57,204
about why Dad sent you to Hell...

120
00:06:57,272 --> 00:06:58,172
the plagues,

121
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,475
the floods... they weren't you?

122
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:02,676
Well...

123
00:07:02,744 --> 00:07:05,045
Yeah. That's what I thought.

124
00:07:05,113 --> 00:07:06,247
I was angry.

125
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:07,615
But humans weren't

126
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:10,317
the reason your father
and I were fighting.

127
00:07:10,385 --> 00:07:12,052
At least, not then.

128
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,921
Uh, Mum?

129
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:14,989
Hmm?

130
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,597
I think you left out a minor detail.

131
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:25,332
Oh, dear.

132
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:35,116

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

133
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:45,107
Liar, liar, slutty dress on fire, Mother.

134
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:46,709
Whoever destroyed my human suit

135
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:49,912
must have killed this little
imp as well, it's obvious.

136
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,281
Lucifer, honey,

137
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:55,751
why would I bring you here
just to disprove my story?

138
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,386
I don't know.

139
00:07:57,454 --> 00:07:59,689
But that's exactly what
I'm going to find out.

140
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:02,558
Management.

141
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,995
- Don't... Wait! Wait.
- Why?

142
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:08,464
Because there is a dead
man lying on the bed.

143
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:10,533
Humans don't like that sort of thing.

144
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:12,481
- Fine. Then let's fly out the window.
- What...

145
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:15,104
I don't have wings anymore, Mum.

146
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:16,539
What?

147
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:18,774
It's a long story.

148
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:19,842
Come on. This way.

149
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:24,347
Management.

150
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,650
Yeah, this way.

151
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:29,485
What happened to your wings, son?

152
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:30,920
I cut them off.

153
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:33,022
Why would you...? I mean, come to Earth,

154
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,358
get a haircut or something,
but that's a little extreme.

155
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:37,293
Hey, bud.

156
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,196
Can I tag in next?

157
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,364
Excuse me?

158
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:42,665
With the lady.

159
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,066
How much?

160
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:46,335
This one you could kill. Come on.

161
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:48,571
I'm joking!

162
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,040
I'm joking, Mother.

163
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:52,408
Gosh.

164
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:54,110
You're gonna have to lose those clothes.

165
00:08:54,177 --> 00:08:55,711
They're a serious problem.

166
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,313
Taking you home,

167
00:08:57,381 --> 00:09:00,616
'cause this being out in public
thing obviously isn't working.

168
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:03,085
And then I'm gonna see my colleague...

169
00:09:03,153 --> 00:09:04,487
Mum!

170
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:06,055
- Yes?
- You're naked!

171
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:09,525
Well, you said the clothes were
a problem, so problem solved.

172
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:12,628
Get in the bloody car, will you?!

173
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:14,730
God. Traumatized for eternity now,

174
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:16,132
so thank you very much for that.

175
00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:32,581
Maze?

176
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:34,050
Ah, good, you're still here.

177
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:35,384
I have a job for you.

178
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:37,386
On my way out, Lucifer. No more jobs.

179
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:39,065
Yes, yes, I know.
You don't work for me anymore.

180
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:42,825
Very clear. But I have a feeling
you're gonna love this one.

181
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:44,927
Just think of it as a parting gift.

182
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:46,195
Come on.

183
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:51,500
Hello, Mazikeen.

184
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:56,038
Is that her?

185
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:57,106
Mm-hmm.

186
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,374
In a human body?

187
00:09:58,442 --> 00:09:59,909
Well, unfortunately.

188
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:02,011
For you.

189
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,181
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
Maze, but hands off.

190
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,348
What?

191
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,616
You're kidding.

192
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:11,187
Millennia, Lucifer...

193
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:13,522
with no physical form.

194
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:17,050
But now...

195
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:21,430
...look at all that flesh.

196
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:23,042
Yes, but sorry,
dear. No torture.

197
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,800
Just don't let her out of your sight.

198
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:27,069
Until I've worked out
whether she's lying or not,

199
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:28,370
she can't be trusted.

200
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:31,722
You want me to babysit?

201
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:34,520
Well, "my mum in the body of
a disturbingly hot woman"-sit,

202
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:36,412
but yes, for now.

203
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:42,351
Mmm.

204
00:10:57,701 --> 00:11:01,036
I was just trying to give
Tammy Twinkletoes a makeover.

205
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:09,245
Honey, you... you popped out her eye.

206
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:11,147
Yeah.

207
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:12,748
That was an accident.

208
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:15,851
Well, I think she looks rather fetching.

209
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,019
Lucifer.

210
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:19,855
Hello, Detective. Sir Douche. Offspring.

211
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:21,757
You know, I bet you're actually

212
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:23,592
behind this, aren't you? Sadly, no.

213
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,561
Can't take the credit, but I do approve.

214
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:27,429
Can we get to work now, please?

215
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:30,132
I'm just wondering if there's
any fresh homicides popped up.

216
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:32,812
Ooh, you know, when you make that face,

217
00:11:32,836 --> 00:11:34,236
you look a bit like the doll.

218
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:40,810
- Hey.
- Ah, look.

219
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:43,379
You can disco a bad guy into confessing.

220
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:44,980
This isn't a game; this is parenting.

221
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,382
And it's important.

222
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:48,918
She mutilated Tammy Twinkletoes.

223
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:50,519
And I'm sure there's a real mutilation

224
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:52,321
out there to solve as we speak.

225
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:53,722
Something that screams

226
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,325
"crazed witchy woman on a rampage" perhaps?

227
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:58,627
What? Not that I know of.

228
00:11:58,695 --> 00:12:01,063
Okay, I'm gonna go back in there.

229
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:02,064
Detective!

230
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:03,499
Just a doll.

231
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,734
I don't know what all the fuss is about.

232
00:12:05,802 --> 00:12:08,470
It's not just a doll, it's manipulation.

233
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:10,840
- What?
- Trixie's best friend Landa got a new

234
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:12,842
All-American doll, and
now Trixie wants one.

235
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:14,810
So what does she do?
She destroys her old doll,

236
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:16,779
- expecting me to replace it.
- Mm, impressive.

237
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:19,815
But, then, I'd expect nothing
less from the shrewd little minx.

238
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:21,660
Why don't you comply,
then we can get on, yes?

239
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:24,753
No. And I'd appreciate it if you
don't undermine my authority.

240
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:26,021
But you're being a bad mother.

241
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:27,923
Abandon the child in its time of need,

242
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:29,735
and it won't trust you in the future.

243
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,560
- Is that what you want, Detective?
- Decker.

244
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:33,229
Yeah.

245
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:35,264
Got it.

246
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:37,266
New case. Hotel Gleam.

247
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:39,702
Ah, finally! Fantastic news.

248
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:45,507
He's practically a kid.

249
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:47,270
Yeah, 19 or so.

250
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:48,790
How long has he been here?

251
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:50,579
I don't know, maybe a few days.

252
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:51,981
Guess the maid really took

253
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:53,816
the "do not disturb" sign seriously.

254
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:58,354
Cause of death: single
puncture wound to the neck.

255
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:00,389
I'm thinking ice pick.

256
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:01,924
Or a screwdriver, perhaps.

257
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:03,259
Five-inch, head?

258
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:04,827
Huh.

259
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,562
Yeah. Maybe.

260
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,830
You're good.

261
00:13:07,898 --> 00:13:08,964
I know. Detective,

262
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:11,033
interesting pool of blood through here.

263
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:17,673
I'm assuming it belongs to Cinderella here.

264
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:20,276
Cinderella? Sure we don't
mean evil stepmother?

265
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:22,278
Really?

266
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:25,047
Are we really still on the whole
"my mother did it" thing?

267
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:27,116
I thought she was responsible
for our last murder.

268
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:29,373
What, you're just throwing homicides at her

269
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:31,365
- until one sticks?
- No, I'm simply saying

270
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:33,534
that the missing woman
may well be our killer.

271
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:35,802
A murderous psycho whose rampage started

272
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,271
by impaling that poor lad.

273
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:39,740
Okay, my guess is that this
is an affair gone wrong.

274
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:43,143
Jealous husband follows
his cheating wife here.

275
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:45,212
He kills the young lover, he wounds her,

276
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,748
and then he drags her home or she escapes.

277
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:49,182
Definitely the latter.

278
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,394
Well, we would know more

279
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:51,952
if she had left more than a shoe.

280
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,621
We don't have a purse.

281
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,189
No wallet, no keys.

282
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:58,025
Would the woman's phone help?

283
00:13:58,092 --> 00:14:00,027
Well, yes, of course, but we don't have...

284
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:02,062
A phone!

285
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:05,899
Wow!

286
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:07,601
Good eye, Luce!

287
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:10,137
...ifer.

288
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,172
I'll get this back to the lab.

289
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,707
See if I can restore it.

290
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:15,615
Yeah, fast as you can,
Ella, we have to proceed

291
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:17,520
as if this missing woman
is still alive, okay?

292
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:19,914
- Yeah.
- I don't want to find another body.

293
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:22,516
Trust me, you will not find another body.

294
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:25,085
I found a body.

295
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:34,992
She's a maid at the hotel.

296
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,843
Explains why she didn't
find our dead guy.

297
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,112
'Cause, you know, she was dead.

298
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,947
Anyway, okay.

299
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,659
No open wounds, so she's
definitely not our Cinderella

300
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:44,793
who bled all over the place.

301
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,151
You see the bruising

302
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,563
and the semi-circular marks on her neck?

303
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,087
- Strangled.
- Aha.

304
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,923
Long fingernails,
which means the killer's female.

305
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,059
Not necessarily.
I mean, the marks aren't deep.

306
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,160
It could just be a dude

307
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,995
- who's not serious man-groomer.
- Come on.

308
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,764
It's so obvious, your Cinder-hellion

309
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,133
had just plunged a
screwdriver into the poor lad,

310
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,711
when she was interrupted
by the chambermaid,

311
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,480
who she then snuffed
out with her bare hands.

312
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,537
Chambermaid?

313
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:06,805
Who's the killer, Mrs. Peacock

314
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,183
in the library with the candlestick?

315
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,250
I love that game.

316
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:11,520
I really don't think it's
the missing woman, Lucifer.

317
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,260
It's a little unusual for a
woman to strangle someone.

318
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:16,081
But look at the size of the bruising,
clearly not man hands.

319
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,617
I've seen some guys with
some pretty tiny lady hands.

320
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,818
Dan doesn't count.

321
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,163
- Come on.
- Okay, regardless,

322
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,888
the maid's death wasn't planned.

323
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,157
I still think we're
looking at a third party...

324
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,622
someone attacking the couple
when the maid entered.

325
00:15:27,783 --> 00:15:30,038
The killer then dragged
the maid into the bedroom,

326
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,696
where they struggled until he

327
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,632
finally managed to strangle her.

328
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,611
Which gave our Cinderella time
to get the hell out of there.

329
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,868
I couldn't agree less.

330
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,403
And she needs to go straight to Hell

331
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,938
as soon as possible.

332
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,981
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to make a call.

333
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:44,264
Oh, did we get anything on that cell phone?

334
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:46,547
Oh, right! Uh, totally forgot.

335
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:48,816
No, no.

336
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:50,361
Could not recover anything
from the SIM card.

337
00:15:50,385 --> 00:15:52,352
Water and phones, bad news.

338
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,298
I dropped mine in the
toilet once... that sucked.

339
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:56,200
- Damn. So much for that.
- Had to reach in, I didn't have my gloves.

340
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:57,691
Uh, no.

341
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,527
No, 'cause I did get a
serial number off of it,

342
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:02,930
so I know who bought it, at least.

343
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:04,665
Richards and Wheeler.

344
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:06,500
High-end law firm in Beverly Hills.

345
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:07,468
Cool.

346
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:08,855
Next time, if you want, you know,

347
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:12,005
you can just lead with that information.

348
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:13,574
If you want.

349
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,209
Okay, boss, where do you want me?

350
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:17,811
I'm not your boss, I'm just,
you know, kind of...

351
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,979
My boss.

352
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,380
It's okay, Chloe.

353
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,733
I've accepted my demotion like a big boy.

354
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:25,430
And besides, it's kind of hot
when you give me orders.

355
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,788
Sorry.

356
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,490
Old habits.

357
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,625
Why don't you
start with missing persons,

358
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:33,337
see if there are any new
leads on our Cinderella.

359
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,896
Lucifer and I will go to the law firm.

360
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:37,731
- Okay.
- Okay.

361
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,832
Lucifer.

362
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,567
- Lucifer.
- Hmm?

363
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:43,470
Oh. Uh, are you praying or...?

364
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,205
Yes. Usually works.

365
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:47,407
He must've gone for a wank or something.

366
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:51,178
Come on, Amenadiel, where are you?

367
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:55,916
Hello?

368
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:57,351
Is this thing on?

369
00:16:57,418 --> 00:16:59,953
I keep waiting for God to talk back to me,
too.

370
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,656
But you know what,
don't get discouraged, okay?

371
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:04,224
He is listening, it's just

372
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,927
a one-way intercom kind of deal.

373
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,269
Come on, brother, where are you?

374
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,213
Linda.

375
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:31,451
Surprised to see you're still coming in.

376
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,587
I mean, after all, this is a...

377
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:37,882
a real facility for real
therapists with real patients.

378
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:39,853
Unfortunately,
I can't talk right now, Linda.

379
00:17:39,854 --> 00:17:40,727
I've got some research to do.

380
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:41,628
Oh, sure, I bet.

381
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:43,430
Learning more about psychiatry?

382
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:46,763
Or is it time to switch it up?
Be a lawyer maybe.

383
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,398
Astronaut.

384
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:49,699
I understand.

385
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,963
You're upset that I told
you I was a therapist.

386
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:56,072
Maybe you are one,
'cause your intuition's uncanny.

387
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,442
Linda, listen. I did what
I had to do, all right?

388
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,030
Now, you wouldn't understand this,

389
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:03,056
but I was dealing with
matters of great importance.

390
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,447
I didn't have a choice.

391
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:06,149
Yes, you did.

392
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,520
You used me.

393
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,923
You didn't have to do that.

394
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:15,994
I'm used to my patients lying
to me, not my colleagues.

395
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,630
Not my friends.

396
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:22,601
I confided in you, trusted you.

397
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,970
And you betrayed that trust.

398
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,073
It is difficult to explain,

399
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,277
but things have been very trying for me.

400
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,845
Mm-hmm.

401
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,880
Maybe if you didn't think
so much about yourself

402
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,650
and more about how you treat others,

403
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,852
things wouldn't be so trying.

404
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:45,056
It's called karma.

405
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,293
Might want to research that.

406
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,546
All right, the most
effective way to do this

407
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,482
is with a discreet and systematic approach.

408
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,783
Understood.

409
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,618
We can start with the partners and then...

410
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,554
Attention, lawyers! Hello!

411
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,223
Hello. Attention, please.

412
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,293
Uh, now, does anyone recognize
this critical piece of evidence

413
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,562
found at a gruesome crime scene?

414
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,997
Yeah. See?

415
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,966
That's our corporate-issue phone.

416
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,167
We all have one.

417
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:30,368
That could be anybody's.

418
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,037
Right.

419
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:32,837
What about this

420
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,239
Louboutin power pump

421
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,409
with the ombré finish in
a size, uh... seven?

422
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,077
- Six, U.K.
- Lucifer...

423
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,178
Oh, my God.

424
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,280
Th-That's Charlotte's shoe.

425
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,349
Is she okay?

426
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,051
Prince Charming, I presume.

427
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,554
Richards. Charlotte Richards.

428
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:50,955
She's the owner of this firm.

429
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,091
When she didn't come into
the office, I just...

430
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,194
assumed she was out of town on a case.

431
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:59,364
Was this man involved in any of
those cases, by chance?

432
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,568
- Oh, my God, is he...?
- Dead as a doornail.

433
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,470
Yes. Or in this case, a door screw,

434
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,539
'cause the hole in his
neck's from a screwdriver.

435
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,651
And I happen to think that
Charlotte may well have done...

436
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,210
Could provide us with more...

437
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,446
information on his death.

438
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,015
Well, I-I don't recognize him.

439
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,284
Wait, does that mean
you think Charlotte is alive?

440
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,418
Define "alive."

441
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,754
When was the last time you saw her?

442
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,699
I did this!

443
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,134
Oh, Charlotte, I'm so sorry!

444
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,936
All right, Bradley, listen up,

445
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,205
'cause I've got personal
trust issues at stake here.

446
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,973
Brad, look at me.

447
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,178
Did you want Charlotte gone?

448
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,782
No. No.

449
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,517
That's the last thing I wanted.

450
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,819
Right. Then what do you desire?

451
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,555
T-To be with Charlotte.

452
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,157
We were in love.

453
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,959
Mr. Wheeler,

454
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:06,231
um, would Charlotte maybe have, um...

455
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,967
also... slept with the guy in the photo?

456
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:09,901
No.

457
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,737
We were completely monogamous.

458
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,939
She wouldn't even sleep
with her own husband.

459
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,276
She was married already?

460
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:21,045
Yeah, but she hated that guy.

461
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,091
Sorry about the mess.

462
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,293
I'm sorry about those shoes.

463
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,694
Excuse me?

464
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,296
Mr. Richards, when was the last time

465
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,464
your wife was home?

466
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,832
Oh, God, uh...

467
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,134
Three days ago, maybe.

468
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,936
You didn't file a missing person's report?

469
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:48,139
She's always traveling.
Doesn't always tell me when.

470
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,318
Did she tell you she was
bonking her associate Bradley?

471
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,010
Lucifer.

472
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,078
Did she?

473
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,180
I knew.

474
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,247
What could I do?

475
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,582
Well, one option would be

476
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,984
to stab her in the neck with a screwdriver.

477
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,320
Do you recognize this man?

478
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,555
Oh, God.

479
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,056
Uh... h-he came by

480
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,193
the house with a package for
Charlotte, uh, last week.

481
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,961
Pretty sure it was, like, a work thing.

482
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,030
Well, it depends what kind
of package, doesn't it?

483
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,666
- Uh, I-is Charlotte all right?
- Can you account

484
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,434
- for the last three days?
- Yeah.

485
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,436
I've been up to my ears in puke.

486
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,071
My kids are home sick.

487
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,974
Uh, I haven't left the house since Monday.

488
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,709
And not showered since, I see.

489
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,344
Are your children home?

490
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:27,589
I'd like to confirm with them.

491
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,714
Yeah, sure. Uh, just down the hall,

492
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,183
and, uh, uh...

493
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,619
When exactly did you
surrender your manhood?

494
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,854
Excuse me?

495
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,089
I mean, I'm all for stay-at-home dads,

496
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,791
and believe me, I personally commend you

497
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,259
for not abandoning your children,

498
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,261
but that's still no reason to give up.

499
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,763
Oh, I-I... I haven't given up. I'm...

500
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,433
Mr. Richards, you have an
entire slice of salami

501
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,235
stuck to your shirt.

502
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,303
Oh, God.

503
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,571
Come on.

504
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,106
Where's your closet? Up here?

505
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,174
Mm.

506
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,109
Oh, goody. They come in more colors.

507
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,978
There's only one body part

508
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,412
- rubber should be worn on.
- Oh!

509
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,714
Not that you'd know.

510
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,182
You've clearly castrated yourself.

511
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,384
But don't worry. I'm here to help.

512
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:07,952
Hawaiian print?

513
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,488
The eighth deadly sin. Out.

514
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,790
Dave Matthews tribute tank.

515
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,926
Now I'm doubting your sanity.

516
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,794
What have we got? Ah! Here we go.

517
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,796
This is more promising.

518
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,265
Not worn since the...?

519
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,200
- Wedding.
- That's what I thought, right.

520
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:23,501
Let's have a look.

521
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,136
Come on.

522
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,605
Come on!

523
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,277
Is that, uh...

524
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,778
Cocaine!

525
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,580
Oh, and the good stuff, as well.

526
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:39,083
Ah, Detective, welcome to the party.

527
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:48,306
Ready in a minute.

528
00:23:48,373 --> 00:23:51,242
You know, feeding a whole
ball team isn't too big a job

529
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,511
when you have macaroni
and cheese dinner handy.

530
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:55,179
Okay, boys, come and get it!

531
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:59,417
Mazikeen, what is this
strange gooey substance

532
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:01,586
that this boy is cooing about?

533
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:03,988
You watching porn?

534
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:12,697
What is this?

535
00:24:12,764 --> 00:24:14,132
It's like money.

536
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:17,468
Humans use it to buy
things they can't afford.

537
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:18,803
Wish I'd found this

538
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:20,938
before I ate out of those street bins.

539
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:24,275
Humans are silly animals, aren't they?

540
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:27,411
Weak. Fragile.

541
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,113
That's what I'm counting on.

542
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:33,851
Now... where were we?

543
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:47,165
That's a lot of coke.

544
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:49,834
Think the attorney's husband was dealing?

545
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:52,370
I don't think he's the
entrepreneurial type.

546
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:54,238
Thinking maybe the lawyer was.

547
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:56,466
Doesn't make a whole lot of sense,
but it would explain

548
00:24:56,508 --> 00:24:58,743
why she ended up bleeding
in that hotel room.

549
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,313
Well, maybe the kid was her
street dealer or something.

550
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:05,216
Yeah, maybe. Anyhow, Ella got
a big fat print off the plastic.

551
00:25:05,284 --> 00:25:06,651
I'm running it through AFIS now.

552
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:08,619
What's with the box?

553
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,154
Delivery for you.

554
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:11,589
- What?
- Yeah.

555
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:18,796
Dan, I thought we talked about this.

556
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,331
A united front, especially now.

557
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:22,533
Hey, don't look at me.

558
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:23,634
Oh, she's here! Lovely.

559
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:25,203
Did the mini kitchen come, too?

560
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,972
Lucifer, you shouldn't
have gotten her the doll.

561
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,520
It's fine. You can say it's from you.

562
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:32,610
Oh. Hello.

563
00:25:32,678 --> 00:25:34,378
Luis Mendoza.

564
00:25:34,758 --> 00:25:36,959
He's a known associate of
drug kingpin Victor Perez.

565
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:38,427
He's a scary dude.

566
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,662
Smart though,

567
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,641
to partner up with a
high-powered defense attorney.

568
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,200
Which would explain why he's
eluded the FBI for years.

569
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:46,068
I have a friend in the Bureau.

570
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:47,514
I'll call him, I'll see
what I can find out.

571
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:49,005
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

572
00:25:49,072 --> 00:25:51,874
Oh, look, she comes with an
adorable little chocolate cake.

573
00:25:51,942 --> 00:25:53,042
Your child's favorite.

574
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,011
I will deal with you later.

575
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:58,781
You're welcome.

576
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:05,621
Eeny meeny miney...

577
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,230
You are wasting your time, Mazikeen.

578
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:15,498
You couldn't break me in Hell.

579
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,333
What makes you think you could do it here?

580
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:20,536
Maybe I couldn't hurt you
because you weren't human.

581
00:26:20,604 --> 00:26:22,171
Well, now you are.

582
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,840
No, it's because I wasn't
guilty of anything.

583
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:27,243
Hell gives the damned what they deserve.

584
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:29,779
I didn't deserve to be punished.

585
00:26:29,846 --> 00:26:31,180
And you know it.

586
00:26:31,248 --> 00:26:32,715
No.

587
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:35,851
I think it's because I just
didn't find your weak spot.

588
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,254
Everyone has one.

589
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:40,723
Human bodies have several.

590
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:42,124
Careful.

591
00:26:42,192 --> 00:26:43,893
This body only heals once,

592
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:45,661
and Lucifer told you not to harm me.

593
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,165
You may have him confused
right now, but he's smart.

594
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:53,069
He'll come around, see you
for who you really are.

595
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:55,304
A mother who loves her son.

596
00:26:55,372 --> 00:26:58,541
Loving mothers don't abandon their sons.

597
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:02,311
I threaten your relationship
with him, don't I?

598
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:05,281
Nice try.

599
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,218
Even though you say you're on your way out,

600
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:11,754
you're still here doing his bidding.

601
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:13,055
You need him.

602
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:15,424
And if I stay, then he won't need you.

603
00:27:15,492 --> 00:27:17,627
Trust me, you won't stay.

604
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:20,963
Lucifer made a deal with your
ex to take you back to Hell,

605
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:24,000
and he doesn't break deals.

606
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:26,969
Don't think he'd start with God.

607
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:30,006
He made a deal?

608
00:27:30,907 --> 00:27:33,042
Wait.

609
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:39,315
Is that a weak spot?

610
00:27:43,754 --> 00:27:47,123
Are those... tears?

611
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:53,896
Oh!

612
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,767
You're a bad mother.

613
00:27:57,834 --> 00:28:00,736
Really? I think you might
be projecting a little bit.

614
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,271
Oh, really? How's that?

615
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:04,974
Well, you keep trying to pin
murders on your own mother.

616
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:08,310
I'm guessing you and her don't
have the best relationship.

617
00:28:08,378 --> 00:28:09,745
There.

618
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,848
At least I get to keep the
cute little chocolate cake.

619
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:14,067
Oh, come on.

620
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:16,052
Talked to Agent Colburn.

621
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,196
Charlotte wasn't working for the cartel.

622
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,654
She was working to bring it down.

623
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:20,322
So was that poor kid.

624
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:22,848
His name's Marco Sanchez.
Got in over his head

625
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:24,817
with the cartel,
was trying to make it right.

626
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:27,724
So he was working with Charlotte
and the FBI as an informant?

627
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:29,955
Trying to build a case
against Perez, yeah.

628
00:28:30,023 --> 00:28:32,992
That's why he and Charlotte were
meeting at the hotel in secret.

629
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
But look at this.

630
00:28:34,094 --> 00:28:37,697
Perez's hit man is Jimmy the Carpenter.

631
00:28:37,764 --> 00:28:40,466
Want to take a guess at his M.O.?

632
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:42,168
- Screwdriver?
- Boom.

633
00:28:42,235 --> 00:28:45,604
So the woman isn't a
ball of homicidal fury.

634
00:28:45,672 --> 00:28:47,673
No. Perez is.

635
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:49,442
- Or his hit man anyway.
- Right.

636
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:51,097
Well, shall we arrest
the Perez chap, then?

637
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:53,045
The FBI has been trying
to do that for years.

638
00:28:53,113 --> 00:28:54,146
He's Teflon. He launders

639
00:28:54,214 --> 00:28:55,958
everything through his
tanning salon franchise.

640
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:57,915
Yeah, we can't risk
derailing the FBI's case.

641
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:00,273
We have to go through the court,
and we have to get a warrant.

642
00:29:00,297 --> 00:29:01,564
I'll see if I can rush one.

643
00:29:01,631 --> 00:29:02,842
Perez could have Charlotte now.

644
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,467
Ah, I doubt it.

645
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,669
Well, if not, he's after her.

646
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:08,204
I don't doubt that.

647
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:10,339
Yeah, why don't you stay
here and get the warrant.

648
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:11,941
I think I've left the cooker on.

649
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:16,979
Ah, lovely. You got one on the go.

650
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,914
Right. New information, Maze.

651
00:29:18,982 --> 00:29:22,084
Seems Mum might not be a lying
sack of savagery after all,

652
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:24,353
but it also seems that she's the target

653
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:26,455
of a vicious cartel hit man.

654
00:29:26,523 --> 00:29:28,524
So you mustn't let her leave the penthouse

655
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:30,726
until this whole mess is resolved. Right-o?

656
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:33,929
Your mom's gone.

657
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:35,464
What?

658
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:38,267
Well, how did that happen, Maze?

659
00:29:38,335 --> 00:29:39,502
She tricked me,

660
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,471
then head-butted me, then left.

661
00:29:44,341 --> 00:29:45,608
Sorry.

662
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:47,643
Oh, well.

663
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:49,712
Suppose the worst that could happen

664
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,947
is that she's brutally murdered.

665
00:29:52,015 --> 00:29:54,116
If so, she'll just find a new body

666
00:29:54,184 --> 00:29:57,019
and run right back like a good mum, yeah?

667
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,154
Or not.

668
00:29:58,221 --> 00:29:59,789
I may have let

669
00:29:59,856 --> 00:30:02,391
the whole deal with God thing slip.

670
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:04,527
So I think she might be running away.

671
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,797
So if she goes into a new body,
we'll never find her.

672
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:12,735
Okay. Then we'll just have to
find her before that happens.

673
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:15,204
I mean, how far can a celestial being

674
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,466
trapped in a feeble human
body for the first time get?

675
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:18,707
Well, let's see.

676
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:21,287
She's stupid hot, wearing my clothes,

677
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:23,489
and she's got a corporate credit card.

678
00:30:25,592 --> 00:30:27,159
Bollocks.

679
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:36,327
Hello, chaps. Just looking for
the head of a big drug cartel.

680
00:30:36,395 --> 00:30:38,596
Is he home? Vicky?

681
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:41,065
Victor?

682
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,000
- Oh!
- Oh. Sorry, love. Vicky!

683
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:44,836
Ah.

684
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:49,073
Ah. Hello.

685
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:50,408
Mr. Perez, I need you to know

686
00:30:50,476 --> 00:30:51,864
that I'm not here to talk to you

687
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:53,321
about your criminal drug enterprise.

688
00:30:53,345 --> 00:30:54,779
I'm here about Charlotte Richards.

689
00:30:56,782 --> 00:31:00,752
Are you, by chance,
holding Charlotte prisoner?

690
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:02,620
- Who?
- Right. I'll take that as a no.

691
00:31:02,688 --> 00:31:04,007
Here's my point.

692
00:31:04,008 --> 00:31:05,610
You may think that she's
dead, but she's not,

693
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:06,929
which is fine, because you also think

694
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,849
that she's still Charlotte,
which she's also not.

695
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:10,240
- Is that clear?
- Ow!

696
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:12,075
I simply need you to promise

697
00:31:12,143 --> 00:31:14,378
to stay away from Charlotte
Richards. Deal?

698
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:22,452
Oh. Oh, look at that.

699
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,690
Snowstorm in a tanning
salon. How ironic.

700
00:31:28,826 --> 00:31:30,661
Oh. Detective.

701
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:33,168
I think Vicky here is ready for
a little bit of show-and-tell.

702
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:34,898
Emphasis on the show.

703
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:39,970
Wait a second.

704
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:42,839
You think I had him killed
'cause he's a narc?

705
00:31:42,907 --> 00:31:44,408
Why would I do that?

706
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:45,509
I was using him.

707
00:31:45,576 --> 00:31:48,078
Fed him bogus information on purpose.

708
00:31:48,146 --> 00:31:51,148
Had the FBI chasing after their own knobs.

709
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:53,016
Kid was an asset.

710
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:54,549
Be stupid to hurt him.

711
00:31:54,694 --> 00:31:57,164
Well, you forgot to tell your
buddy Jimmy the plan.

712
00:31:57,188 --> 00:31:59,323
Screwdriver to the neck.

713
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,426
The Carpenter? He's dead.

714
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:06,697
Did I throw a wrench in your works?

715
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:09,299
Get it? Screwdriver? Wrench?

716
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:10,767
It's a whole theme.

717
00:32:13,538 --> 00:32:16,740
Ah. How's my little drug kingpin panini?

718
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:18,475
Not our guy.

719
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:20,811
We have to find someone
connected to Marco and Charlotte

720
00:32:20,878 --> 00:32:22,646
that didn't know Jimmy
the Carpenter's dead.

721
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:24,915
Well, Jimmy's dead? Tragic.

722
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:28,719
So assuming the whole cartel
knows that, it rules them out

723
00:32:28,786 --> 00:32:31,121
and points us to the only way

724
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:33,156
that Charlotte and Marco are connected:

725
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:35,592
the law firm.

726
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,461
Two shakedowns in one day. I'm in.

727
00:32:37,528 --> 00:32:39,663
No more shakedowns, no more
tanning booth shenanigans.

728
00:32:39,731 --> 00:32:42,132
You and I have been working
together long enough

729
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,934
for you to know how to follow protocol.

730
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:46,136
I'm sorry, Detective,
but Charlotte's in danger.

731
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:47,738
We need to find her.

732
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:50,640
How did she go from big bad
wolf to little lost lamb?

733
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,642
Well, maybe she's a
wolf in sheep's clothing,

734
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,179
but right now she needs
to return to the flock.

735
00:33:00,818 --> 00:33:02,219
Yeah, I worked on that case.

736
00:33:02,286 --> 00:33:04,187
I work on every case
that comes through here.

737
00:33:04,255 --> 00:33:06,323
Okay, but the Perez case was sensitive.

738
00:33:06,391 --> 00:33:07,657
You were the only one here

739
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:09,259
besides Charlotte who knew about it.

740
00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:11,094
Which means you're also

741
00:33:11,162 --> 00:33:12,562
the only one here who was aware

742
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,331
of Jimmy the Carpenter's methodology.

743
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,867
Wait. You don't think that I...

744
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:18,668
Got handy with a screwdriver

745
00:33:18,736 --> 00:33:21,571
and tried to pin it on the Perez cartel?

746
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:23,740
Yes. That's insane.

747
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:24,941
What's insane is

748
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,249
a guy with a Harvard law degree

749
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:27,944
still working as an associate.

750
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:31,114
Yes. Passed up for partner
by old Tom Cruise out there.

751
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:34,351
Guess you should've been
slipping the boss your top gun.

752
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:36,386
If you're suggesting that I killed

753
00:33:36,454 --> 00:33:40,624
an innocent kid and my boss...
my mentor of 12 years...

754
00:33:40,691 --> 00:33:44,861
all out of professional
jealousy, you're crazy.

755
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:46,363
Hold on.

756
00:33:46,431 --> 00:33:48,498
I don't believe that we
mentioned two murders.

757
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:50,801
I mean, we showed you the
crime scene photo of Marco,

758
00:33:50,868 --> 00:33:52,969
- but not Charlotte.
- Lucifer...

759
00:33:53,037 --> 00:33:56,306
Well, given the information
that you presented...

760
00:33:56,374 --> 00:33:59,910
the phone, the shoe...
I just assumed that she was...

761
00:33:59,977 --> 00:34:01,545
Dead? No.

762
00:34:01,612 --> 00:34:04,514
Just missing. And if we find
her alive, it's gonna be

763
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:07,050
very interesting to hear what
she has to say about you,

764
00:34:07,118 --> 00:34:08,852
her loyal protégé.

765
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,922
This line of questioning is now over.

766
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,557
Why don't you go speak to my attorney.

767
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:16,393
He's two doors down.

768
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:19,863
Why would you divulge
privileged information to a guy

769
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:21,665
who's now clearly our lead suspect?

770
00:34:21,732 --> 00:34:24,568
Sorry. I'll get that
protocol thing down one day.

771
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:54,139
Why aren't you dead?

772
00:34:54,163 --> 00:34:55,797
What? Who are you?

773
00:34:55,865 --> 00:34:57,065
Don't give me that, Charlotte.

774
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:58,600
By the way, thanks for using

775
00:34:58,668 --> 00:35:01,041
the credit card we opened
for the Perez case.

776
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:03,090
Did you forget I'm the only
one that has access to it?

777
00:35:03,114 --> 00:35:04,348
That I'm the only one

778
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:06,483
who did anything for you
at that hellhole?

779
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:09,153
Hellhole? Are you a demon, too?

780
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,320
Why?

781
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:11,889
Because I'm a little upset?

782
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:14,491
Wouldn't you be, too,
if you got passed up by Wheeler

783
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:16,193
with the big wiener?

784
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:18,629
Oh, I know who you are now.
You're the one who killed me.

785
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:20,431
Well, apparently not. But I am now.

786
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:22,433
Sorry.

787
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,568
- Can't kill my mum.
- Oh!

788
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:25,703
Lucifer!

789
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,837
Detective.

790
00:35:26,905 --> 00:35:28,906
If you're gonna follow me following him,

791
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:30,908
we should have just drove together.

792
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:35,779
Right, you get him, Detective!

793
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:38,315
I'll stay here and protect the poor lady!

794
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:40,284
Protect me? From what?

795
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:42,453
Ow!

796
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,854
What'd you do that for?

797
00:35:43,922 --> 00:35:45,658
Well, the detective knows
you're alive now,

798
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:47,668
so you're gonna have to sell
the whole Charlotte charade.

799
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:49,593
Need to explain that blood pool somehow.

800
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:51,862
- Oh, you little...
- Devil?

801
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,731
Yes. But about that...

802
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:56,333
we've never met until now,
don't know each other.

803
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:59,436
I fear it's too much for
the detective to handle.

804
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:05,142
Well, it looks like she
can handle quite a bit.

805
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,313
Yeah.

806
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:20,157
Well, it seems that wound was
re-aggravated in all the hubbub.

807
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:21,525
Poor woman.

808
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:23,761
You want to tell me what
the hell you were doing?

809
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:25,706
Well, leading the mouse
to the cheese, of course.

810
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,231
I mean, I was gonna be the cat,

811
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:31,301
but then you showed up, so
I suppose that makes you the dog.

812
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:32,720
What am I gonna do with you?

813
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:34,571
Well, I can think of a few things.

814
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,173
Might need a stretch first though.

815
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:37,708
You need to follow the rules.

816
00:36:37,776 --> 00:36:39,910
You tell me not to ravage
suspects in front of you.

817
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:41,845
Now I can't do it behind your back either?

818
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:44,047
I mean, make your mind up, Detective.

819
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:45,849
No more buying my daughter $200 dolls.

820
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:48,218
Well, why not? You weren't going to.

821
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:50,888
I was teaching her a lesson.

822
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:53,056
Neglect 101. You're abandoning her

823
00:36:53,124 --> 00:36:54,725
in her time of need, Detective.

824
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:03,867
I don't know what happened
between you and your mother.

825
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:06,904
And if you ever want to talk
about it, I'm here for you.

826
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:08,138
But listen to me.

827
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:09,640
Doing what's best for your child...

828
00:37:09,707 --> 00:37:13,343
it doesn't always make 'em happy.

829
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:27,958
I hate to interrupt so late, but, uh...

830
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:30,160
I just wanted to apologize.

831
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:31,361
Oh?

832
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:33,297
Yeah, you were right, Linda.

833
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:36,700
You see, I really do have
a lot to atone for.

834
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:41,238
I've... made so many mistakes lately.

835
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:43,173
But a big one was hurting you.

836
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:45,175
I may have forged a friendship with you

837
00:37:45,243 --> 00:37:47,544
under false pretenses, yes.

838
00:37:47,612 --> 00:37:51,548
But I did consider you a friend.

839
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:54,351
And I'm deeply sorry that I ruined that.

840
00:37:57,455 --> 00:38:00,924
If anyone understands mistakes,
it's a therapist.

841
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:03,961
Not that you'd know.

842
00:38:07,232 --> 00:38:08,866
Apology accepted.

843
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:11,802
Thank you.

844
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,737
Night.

845
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:15,739
Good night.

846
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:32,382
What on earth is that?

847
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,984
Cheesy noodles.

848
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:37,621
It's what mothers make to
bring their children joy.

849
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:41,458
I saw it on the flat-screen.

850
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:45,929
That explains all the cheese.

851
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:52,269
Lucifer...

852
00:39:52,337 --> 00:39:55,806
I wish, with all my being,

853
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:59,142
that things could go back
to the way things were.

854
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,745
With you...

855
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:04,915
and all my children again in Heaven.

856
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:11,888
I want what your father took from me.

857
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:14,725
I want my home back.

858
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:22,966
But I know that's not possible.

859
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:25,569
So I want to do what I can

860
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:30,807
to be a good mother to
you here, on Earth.

861
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:41,351
It's too late.

862
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:45,989
You abandoned me, Mum.

863
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:50,193
You just stood by and
watched as I was cast out.

864
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:54,364
Thrown into Hell and
vilified for all eternity.

865
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:58,702
There aren't enough cheesy
noodles in the universe

866
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,904
to fix all that, I'm afraid.

867
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:07,444
Okay.

868
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:21,958
Your father never sent you to Hell.

869
00:41:24,062 --> 00:41:26,863
I did.

870
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:29,399
Oh, great. Much better.

871
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:33,336
I did it to save your life.

872
00:41:33,404 --> 00:41:37,874
After the rebellion, your
father was angry.

873
00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:40,477
Deeply angry.

874
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:46,583
He wanted to destroy you.

875
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:50,087
I begged him not to.

876
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:54,724
I asked him to send you to Hell instead.

877
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,629
I did it because I love you, son.

878
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:03,533
And I always will.

879
00:42:03,601 --> 00:42:06,436
However...

880
00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:09,106
if you still need me

881
00:42:09,173 --> 00:42:12,008
to return me to Hell, I understand.

882
00:42:13,778 --> 00:42:16,046
You do what is right for you.

883
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:20,050
That's very gracious of you, Mother.

884
00:42:21,419 --> 00:42:23,553
Okay, but please don't
send me back to Hell.

885
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:30,694
But I meant the rest.

886
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,931
I know you did.

887
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:38,135
All right.

888
00:42:38,202 --> 00:42:39,836
All right, you can stay.

889
00:42:39,904 --> 00:42:41,671
For now.

890
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:43,807
Just until I...

891
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,309
figure out what I need to do.

892
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:48,578
