Oh, him... as opposed to you.

180
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:15,835
That's right, because you're the

181
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:16,836
(whispering):
son of God.

182
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:17,837
- Exactly.
- (clicks tongue)

183
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,422
- Yes.
- I get it.

184
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,174
I mean, Stanislavksy
would be very proud of you.

185
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:24,218
Okay, for the last time,
I am not a method actor.

186
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:25,595
So method of you to say.

187
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,055
Damn, you are good.

188
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:28,931
Hey, can you cry on cue?

189
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:31,851
Sorry, excuse me.

190
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:34,771
(horn honking)

191
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:50,870
MAN:
Hello, brother.

192
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,247
LUCIFER:
Ah.

193
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:54,665
Uriel!

194
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,167
I thought it was you.

195
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,211
Welcome to Earth.

196
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,630
Clearly, I got the fashion sense
in the family.

197
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:02,548
Word of advice:
I'd lose the trench coat,

198
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:03,549
'cause as it stands,

199
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,134
it's less cool,
brooding angel,

200
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,469
more sort of
"pedophile chic."

201
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,763
- One joke down. One to go.
- (chuckles)

202
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,973
Why can't you take anything
seriously, Lucifer?

203
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,058
What do they say?

204
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,434
Laugh like no one's listening?

205
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:14,936
Dance like you're standing
on the corpses

206
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:15,937
of your enemies?

207
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,230
And there's the other.

208
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:19,273
Predictable as ever.

209
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:20,817
What do you want, Uriel?

210
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,778
I came to you tell you
that you have 24 hours.

211
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,406
I'll bite. 24 hours or what?

212
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,116
Either return here
with Mom,

213
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:30,952
or I'll finish what I started
with your detective.

214
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:34,580
The car accident.

215
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,834
You made a deal with Dad.
Time to pay up. So...

216
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:39,919
bring Mom to me,

217
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,131
or I'll take back what Dad
gave you.

218
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,848
♪♪

219
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,525
Uriel is here?

220
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,193
Pleasant aroma and all.

221
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:05,903
And he's after Chloe?

222
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:06,779
MAZE:
No.

223
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:07,947
He's after Chloe

224
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:10,575
or that classy bitch
you call "Mom."

225
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,618
You made a deal with Daddy.

226
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:13,703
Time to pay up.

227
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:14,829
(scoffs)
Uriel can come after

228
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,539
celestial beings like us, yes,

229
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,124
but angels aren't allowed
to kill humans.

230
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,208
Chloe should be safe.

231
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,835
Yes, but remember, dear brother,

232
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,712
that Uriel can play
with patterns.

233
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,297
He makes a butterfly
flap its wings

234
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,716
and a housewife gets chlamydia.

235
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:30,136
Or Chloe gets into a seemingly
accidental car wreck.

236
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,721
Correct, for ten points.

237
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,181
Well, too bad there isn't
an easy way

238
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,141
to make this all go away.

239
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,101
Oh, wait, there is.

240
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,811
Send your mom back to Hell.

241
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,521
- (chuckles)
- A solution which you

242
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,106
will, no doubt, avoid.

243
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,400
Well, worry not,
my little sex thug, because

244
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,194
Uriel won't be a problem.

245
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,196
We have a nuclear weapon.

246
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:50,072
What's that?

247
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,324
You.

248
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,909
Well, Uriel doesn't know that

249
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,368
we're working together on this.

250
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:55,828
We all know he won't
listen to me.

251
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:58,498
But he will if it's someone
from the home team.

252
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,083
So, you will go and convince him

253
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:02,710
that he needs to go back.

254
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,338
Or, you know, just punch him
in his smug face.

255
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:06,464
Dealer's choice.

256
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,465
(chuckling)

257
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,175
God, it's nice

258
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,135
having a super powerful angel
on your side, isn't it?

259
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:14,597
Good luck with that.

260
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:19,268
CHLOE:
Huh.

261
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:21,354
Saved your life.

262
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,231
(chuckling):
Maybe. You never know.

263
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:24,732
What are you talking about?

264
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,692
Well, it appears that
I was correct this morning.

265
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:29,320
You are being targeted
by cosmic forces.

266
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,697
But fear not,
it's all being dealt with.

267
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:32,740
And I'm here.

268
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:33,866
CHLOE:
Now...

269
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,035
what is with everyone

270
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:37,370
and this car accident? I'm fine.

271
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,331
No, I'm afraid that you're not.
And so, for the next day or so,

272
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,542
I'm gonna need you to be
unpredictable.

273
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,168
Whatever you'd normally do,
just, you know--

274
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:45,711
ah, ah--
do the opposite.

275
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,129
Too bad.

276
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:48,881
I was totally gonna have sex
with you today.

277
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:50,132
Really?

278
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,720
Oh. Well played, Detective.
(chuckles)

279
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,556
Yes, but until the threat
has passed,

280
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:57,723
just to be safe,

281
00:09:57,932 --> 00:09:59,058
I won't be leaving your side.

282
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,685
So just think of me

283
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,436
as your Guardian Devil.

284
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:03,729
(softly):
Okay.

285
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,231
Guys, Wesley Cabot's dead.

286
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,399
I can't believe it.

287
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,942
Oh, God. Not you, too.

288
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,152
Oh, man. <i>Body Bags</i>
1 through 6.

289
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,071
First in line. I mean,
I even skipped out

290
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,323
on some of our wedding planning
to see <i>Body Bags 6</i>. Remember?

291
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:15,783
That was the big emergency?

292
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,743
It was totally worth it.
It was a great movie.

293
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,412
Yes, it was. Better catch
phrase, wasn't it?

294
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,580
BOTH:
"Not on my watch."

295
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:21,789
(both chuckling)

296
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:23,165
Maybe I should get
a catch phrase.

297
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,084
You don't need a catch phrase.
And you.

298
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:27,086
Do you have anything
constructive to add?

299
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:29,714
Uh, yep.
Yep, I do.

300
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:32,592
The boy who, uh, found the body

301
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,927
remembered the first three plate
numbers of the getaway car.

302
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,387
13 matches.

303
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:37,805
13. That's a lot of legwork.

304
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,390
Jamie Lee Adrienne.

305
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,058
The, uh, the Playmate?

306
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,184
- The ex-party girl?
- Yeah.

307
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,686
What does she have to do
with Wesley Cabot?

308
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,938
She's his ex-wife. They met
on the set of <i>Body Bags 4.</i>

309
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,732
Apparently, Jamie and
Wesley's divorce proceedings

310
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,233
were very contentious.

311
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,611
Maybe she went
to "renegotiate."

312
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,154
(Lucifer and Dan chuckling)

313
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:54,655
By "renegotiate",
I mean kill him.

314
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:56,532
- Yeah.
- Uh...

315
00:10:58,784 --> 00:10:59,535
Yeah...

316
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,955
I can't believe
Wesley's really gone.

317
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:05,625
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Cabot?

318
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,711
Um... a few weeks ago.

319
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,712
Maybe.

320
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,713
Interesting.

321
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,008
Then can you explain why
a witness said that they saw you

322
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,302
speeding away from Wesley's
dojo this morning?

323
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,554
Welcome to Devil Time.

324
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,641
- What are you doing?
- Trying out my
new catch phrase.

325
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:22,642
"Welcome to
Devil Time"?

326
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,143
- What the hell does that mean?
- She knows what it means.

327
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:25,519
I have no idea what that means.

328
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,980
- Oh.
- Okay, yeah. I...

329
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,690
I was at the dojo this morning.

330
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:31,651
But it's not what you think.

331
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,986
I went because of this...

332
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:35,279
WESLEY (on voice mail):
My life is destroyed.

333
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:37,239
And it all started
with <i>Body Bags 4.</i>

334
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:38,658
Call me back.

335
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,826
What "started with <i>Body Bags 4"?</i>

336
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,161
I have no idea.

337
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,954
That's why I went
to go see see Wesley.

338
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:46,666
But he was already dead and...

339
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,001
I panicked and then I ran...

340
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,169
But I swear

341
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:51,712
I would've never hurt Wesley.

342
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:54,924
Even though we were divorced,
I really cared about him.

343
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,842
Where were you at 7:00 a.m.
this morning?

344
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,845
With Raphael.
My Pilates instructor.

345
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:02,181
And how does the Weaponizer
feel about all this?

346
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:04,767
(whispering):
Who the hell is
the Weaponizer?

347
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,727
He's a character played
by Kimo Van Zandt,

348
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,062
Wesley's co-star

349
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,689
and her current husband.

350
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,234
So you used to be married
to an action star,

351
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,486
only to divorce him
and marry

352
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,071
another action star?

353
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,989
Yeah. It was the '90s.

354
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,408
We did a lot of coke.

355
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,034
Well, how did
your current husband feel

356
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:23,244
about you visiting your ex?

357
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:24,537
Oh, that's easy.

358
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:25,955
Kimo and Wesley
hated each other.

359
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,331
Long-standing feud.

360
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,749
God only knows
what Kimo would've done

361
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,209
if he knew I went to see him.

362
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:31,711
Where was Kimo this morning?

363
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,131
Uh, at ActionCon in Reno.

364
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,507
Signing autographs.

365
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:38,175
WESLEY:
<i>Where's my money, partner?</i>

366
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:40,094
I will end you!

367
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,638
Without <i>Body Bags 4,</i> you are nothing, man!

368
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,433
How does <i>Body Bags 4</i> figure into all this?

369
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:48,352
Well, Wesley, our victim, uh,

370
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:49,645
was the hero of
the <i>Body Bags</i> franchise.

371
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:52,857
Ooh, and in <i>Body Bags 4,</i> newcomer
Kimo Van Zandt appeared.

372
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,483
He played this
shady CIA operative,

373
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:55,901
who acted as Wesley's foil

374
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,403
and his eventual
ambiguous ally, but...

375
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,363
Then Kimo's character
got spun off into his own,

376
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,116
more successful franchise,
<i>The Weaponizer.</i>

377
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,285
Personal fave:
<i>Weaponizer 4: The Last Arsenal.</i>

378
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,828
- So good, right?
- At the end, with the whole...

379
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,956
(both imitate explosion)
Okay, I so regret
asking you guys this.

380
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:10,958
Although, you're oddly adorable.

381
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,127
So, it seems like
Kimo has always

382
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,503
had it out for Wesley.

383
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,714
Stole his wife,
stole his film franchise.

384
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,591
So maybe he really did "end" it
for him once and for all.

385
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,050
But Kimo was in Reno.

386
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,136
At ActionCon.

387
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,305
But that convention
happens the last week in August.

388
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,432
- How do you know that?
- My mom used to go
to it every year.

389
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,350
- So Jamie's lying.
- Or Kimo's lying to her.

390
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,602
Either way, we gotta find him.

391
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,437
- I'll put out a BOLO.
- Okay.

392
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:34,899
MOM:
<i>Please, hold on. Um...</i>

393
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,611
Again, I apologize that the
children were late for school.

394
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,988
And, yes, I understand

Ooh!

399
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:56,420
Rough day?

400
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:57,797
Oh...

401
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,174
Since returning to my
employment, I have found

402
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,427
the number of daily tasks
to be almost insurmountable.

403
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:05,471
But hey...

404
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,057
at least you're not here
to take me back to Hell.

405
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:15,105
You are here to take me
back to Hell?

406
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,024
No, Mom, I'm not.
I'm just...

407
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,360
Listen, I was just wondering
if your being here

408
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,654
is just postponing
the inevitable.

409
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,073
I mean, at some point...

410
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:28,202
other siblings will come
down here looking for you.

411
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,162
And I'll convince them
to let me stay,

412
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,872
just like I did you and Lucifer.

413
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,708
You were gone
for a really long time, Mom.

414
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:39,129
You might not know your children
as well as you think you do.

415
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,550
You may be right.

416
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,719
But, at least for now,

417
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,263
I have you and Lucifer.

- Uh, you know, Kimo sure as hell
couldn't pay it himself.
- Oh, it's the least

530
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:13,445
I could do
for a true national treasure.

531
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:14,696
CHLOE:
So, for someone
with so many

532
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,949
hit movies under their belt,
why is he so broke?

533
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,660
Exotic cars. Private islands.

534
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,912
You know what costs more
than an albino tiger?

535
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,164
The upkeep on an albino tiger.

536
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,374
He blew through
his money.

537
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,667
Didn't listen.

538
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,460
And now there's no more
coming in.

539
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:30,671
- Thanks again.
- Yes.

540
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,464
Such a tragedy.

541
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,675
Well, it's always a tragedy
when someone gets killed.

542
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:36,718
No, I'm talking about his tiger.

543
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,345
I would have bought it
if I'd known.

544
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,225
Why isn't Dan
checking the alibi?

545
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:44,935
Dan...

(siren wailing in distance)

547
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,655
I want to talk about Uriel.

548
00:19:57,156 --> 00:19:58,157
Well, what's there
to talk about?

549
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,450
Punch, taunt, punch,
groin stomp. Repeat.

550
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:01,994
Yeah, listen, Luci,
I've been thinking,

551
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,830
there might be a better way
to handle this without violence.

552
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,206
What, like hugging him
back to Heaven?

553
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,542
Like hiding Mom.
Hiding Chloe.

554
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,877
And wait Uriel out.

555
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,837
- What?
- Look, just because
he told us his plan

556
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,672
doesn't mean
that's his plan.

557
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:14,798
It's Uriel.

558
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,342
It could be a trap.

559
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,554
Brother,
you've been here too long.

560
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,347
It's changed you.

561
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,642
- What do you mean?
- Meaning that ever since

562
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,561
you've been here,
you've had to restrain yourself.

563
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,856
But this is Uriel. You're you.

564

Unleash yourself.

00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:36,862
Enjoy it.

(sighs)

568
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,868
Look, you do know that
he was always afraid of you.

569
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,370
- Don't mock me, Lucifer.
- I'm not. It's true.

Growing up, we...

well, we all looked up to you.

You were like our
very own action star.

Even you?

But trust me.

Pathetic,

Wesley was going over all

says he's entitled

revenue. It's not much.

658

There were two awards,

One of the awards
was given to Wesley...

689
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,711
- And one to Kimo.
- Someone must've

690
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,004
switched out his
award for Wesley's.

691
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,297
That's why Kimo's
prints were on it.

692
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:48,798
Jamie Lee Adrienne
was at the dojo.

693
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,383

703
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,034
MAZE: This would
never have happened

704
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,161
if you'd listened
to me earlier.

705
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,000
(scoffs)
How is this possible, brother?

706
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,172
I no longer have my powers.

707
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:33,051
- Well, what happened to them?
- Oh, I don't know, Luci, pick a sin.

708
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,595
Is it because I released
a damned soul from Hell?

709
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,223
Slept with a demon? Is it
because I'm working with you?

710
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,100
Or because of Mom?

711
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,188
Or am I simply no longer worthy?

712
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:47,899
(sniffles)

713
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,944
It's time that I faced
the truth, brother.

714
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,699
I've fallen.

715
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:01,955
Well.

716
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,541
Welcome to the club.
Meetings are on Tuesdays.

717
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:06,293
It's different
for me, Luci.

718
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:07,836
It's different.

719
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:11,798
I no longer have my powers.
My very strength...

720
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,341
Big deal!

721
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,094
It's probably the best thing
that ever happened to you.

722
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,055
But right now I haven't
got time to hold your hand,

723
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,433
because I need to
clear up your mess!

724
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,311
- My mess?
- Uriel's still out there.

725
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:25,270
And the clock is up--

726
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,731
which means the detective
is in grave danger.

the husband,

then it was the job,

What are you doing here?

772
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,226
I could ask you two
the same thing.

773
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,311
Uh, we're just having
a business meeting.

774
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,229
- Yeah.
- Mm.

775
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,814
You make out
with all your clients?

776
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:34,649
What's the occasion?
You celebrating

777
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:37,527
the successful theft of Wesley
and Kimo's merchandising money?

778
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,071
I would never steal
from my clients.

779
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:42,574
Oh, you are clever, Ryan.

780
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,826
- What is she talking
about, Ryan?
- What I'm talking about

781
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,077
is how Wesley realized

782
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,455
his action figures
were selling like hotcakes,

783
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,165
did some investigating,

784
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:51,958
and saw that
he was getting robbed.

785
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,043
- I think you should go.
- Unfortunately for Wesley,

786
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,629
he shared his concerns
about his business manager

787
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:59,048
with his ex-wife, who happened
to be sleeping with him.

788
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,050
And that voice mail
that you played for us,

789
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:03,303
that's what started this,
and that's what got him killed.

790
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,850
He did it! He's the one
who killed Wesley!

791
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,977
What?! No, it was her idea!

792
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,605
It was her idea to switch out
the Nunchuck Award, cover it in blood...

793
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:14,606
Don't shoot!

794
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,316
KIMO:
You stole from me,

795
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:17,609
killed Wesley,

796
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,570
then you tried
to frame me for it?!

797
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,364
- Kimo...
- I cared about both of you!

798
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,991
(screams)
No, please!

799
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,827
Kimo...
Put the gun down. Please.

800
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,579
They murdered Wesley.

801
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:32,624
And they will pay for that,
I promise you.

802
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,794
But don't let them ruin
your life, too, Kimo. Please.

803
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:38,296
My life is already ruined.
Get out of the way.

804
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:39,380
- No.
- I'll shoot you!

805
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:40,632
I don't care anymore!

806
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,800
LUCIFER:
Kimo!

807
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:43,843
CHLOE: Lucifer,
stay back.

808
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,553
Guys, stand down.

809
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,305
Detective, you don't know
what you're up against.

810
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,599
This was engineered
to put you in harm's way.

811
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,351
You must believe me.

812
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:52,769
Lucifer,

813
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:55,647
I know exactly
what I'm up against.

814
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:57,398
It's just a man...

815
00:30:58,274 --> 00:30:59,442
who's in a lot of pain.

816
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,616
Kimo, a couple
days ago

817
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,410
I was in a really bad
car accident.

818
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,996
And I've spent the last few days

819
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:14,666
trying to convince everybody
that cares about me

820
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,167
that it wasn't
a big deal.

821
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:17,877
The truth is...

822
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:19,587
I'm terrified.

823
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,925
I'm scared of how
it can all just end...

824
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,468
with no rhyme or reason.

825
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,012
And what I want
to do right now

826
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,806
is just go home

827
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:32,016
and read a bedtime story
to my daughter.

828
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:36,145
But... you know...
that's not up to me, either.

829
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:39,482
We can't control
what happens to us,

830
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,902
only how it affects us
and the choices we make.

831
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,405
So, please.

832
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:48,449
Make the right choice, Kimo.

833
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:51,411
Please put down the gun.

834
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,088
(sirens wailing)

835
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:04,382
(exhales)

836
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,259
(whispering):
Thank you.

837
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,723
Well, well done, Detective.

838
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,516
Kimo was about to do
a very bad thing.

839
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:15,602
Oh, well, not on my watch.

840
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,730
(chuckles) Very good.

841
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,690
Let me escort you back
to the station.

842
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,568
No... I'm-I'm okay.

843
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,195
You know, I don't
believe in fate.

844
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:28,031
And I don't believe in bad luck.

845
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,660
And I appreciate your concern,
but come what may.

846
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:35,622
I am leaving here... alone.

847
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:38,333
Very well.

848
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,295
But just... buckle up,
Detective, please.

849
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:43,963
(sighs)

850
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:45,548
Right. Now, if
you'll excuse me.

851
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,634

Right. Of course.

Chloe is safe,

870
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,181

871
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,893
More importantly,
you get to keep your word.

872

I am keeping my word.

You're serving out your sentence

874
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,941
You know that's not

875
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,275
Do I?!

876
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:49,070
Everyone thinks

00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,660
Human wars have been
waged because of it.

879
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,329
Dad showed me

880
00:33:58,538 --> 00:33:59,831
an open door.

881
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,874
Does that mean I was meant
to take you back to Hell

882
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,335
or was he insinuating
that Hell was getting drafty?

883
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,004
Nobody bloody knows,

884
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,506
because the selfish bastard
won't just tell us!

885
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,800
And I'm sick of it.

886
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,511
No more.

887
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,514
No more.

888
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,516
There's my Lightbringer.

889
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:22,061
My Morningstar.

890
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:28,067
Uriel was so small
when he was a child.

891
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:31,404
All he ever wanted was to play
with you and the older kids.

892
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,072
But you all excluded him.

893
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:33,990
Yes.

894
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,367
And every time he came back,

895
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,327
pestering us again.

896
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,496
Which is strange,

897
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:42,373
considering he knew
what the outcome would be.

898
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:46,169
That's how much he wanted
to be around you, Lucifer.

899
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:48,963
Uriel is a
stubborn boy.

900
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:50,715
When he sets his mind,

901
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,341
it doesn't waver.

902
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,762
He's not going to
give up until he has

903
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,764
either me or
that detective.

904
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:58,931
Mum...

905
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:01,726
I refuse to believe that.

906
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,771
There is always another way.

907
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,773
If anyone can find it,

908
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,025
it's you.

917

For a brief moment,

918
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,353
the pattern faltered.

919
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,774
I thought it meant
you'd actually bring Mom.

920
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:52,568
That somehow, you'd surprise me.
'Cause for once in my life,

921
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:54,612
I'd like to be surprised,
but no.

922
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:56,781
No, here you are.

923
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:04,747
Are you done hiding behind
our big brother's skirt?

924
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:05,581
(short chuckle)

925
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:07,959
Yes, it's just me now.

926
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,336
Big, bad Lucifer.

927
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,094
We've already had this fight
before, Lucifer.

928
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:20,138
Right here.

929
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:22,348
You see, in my head,

930
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:24,100
I've seen everything you do.

931
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,978
I've heard every
dumb quip you have to say.

932
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:27,812
Right, let
me guess--

933
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,647
in your version,
I deliver Mom to you,

934
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:32,775
apologizing, tears
streaming down my face.

935
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:34,610
Actually, no.
In my version,

936
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,571
you refuse to give Mom up

937
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:38,573
and your human friend dies.

938
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:39,991
Yes, you've tried that
twice now.

939
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,492
Not much luck.

940
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,619
Maybe you're not as good
at this as you thought.

941
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:45,663
Maybe I'm building up
to a big finale.

942
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:48,583
All right.

943
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:50,793
Uriel...

944
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,338
you don't know what Dad wants.

945
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:55,798
None of us do.

946
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:58,134
- So I think...
- You're right.

947
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,970
I don't know what Dad wants.
None of us do.

948
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:02,930
Right.

949
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,641
Great, well, I'm glad
we had this talk.

950
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,643
I'll see you at the next
family reunion.

951
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:08,978
I'll buy the first round.

952
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:11,022
But I do know
what he needs.

953
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:14,817
Mom's out.
It's only a matter of time

954
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:16,694
before she
finds her way back to Heaven,

955
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:18,154
and then he'll forgive her.

956
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:20,656
- He would never do that.
- Why not? You did.

957
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:22,825
She's been here, like,
what-- three minutes?

958
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:24,243
Now you're already
defending her.

959
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:26,245
Dad'll do the same thing.

960
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:27,997
He'll let His guard down.

961
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:30,124
And then she'll destroy Him.

962
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,338
I need to make sure
that doesn't happen.

963
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:38,257
That's Azrael's Blade.

964
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:40,343
How do you have it?

965
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:41,928
I borrowed it
off the Angel of Death

966
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,471
when she wasn't looking.

967
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,848
You're not planning on
taking Mom back to Hell.

968
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,851
That weapon will wipe her
out of existence entirely.

969
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,728
No Heaven, no Hell, just...

970
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:53,648
just gone.

971
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,816
Finally, a moment
of clarity between us.

972
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:58,361
You've gone completely
insane, brother.

973
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:00,029
I'm doing what
has to be done,

974
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:01,656
and you've run out of time.

975
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,200
See, I don't care
about your deal with Dad.

976
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:06,577
I don't care about what happens
to your little human.

977
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:08,371
But it's obvious
you care for her

978
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,873
a tad more than you do Mom.

979
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,876
Now, all I need to do

980
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,921
is hit this one
little key right here.

981
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,007
A sequence will begin,
and two days from now...

982
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,718
your cute little human
will finally die.

983
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:26,430
So, Lucifer,

984
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:28,891
you can either let that happen

985
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:30,768
or you can give me Mom.

986
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:33,354
Last chance.

987
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:36,065
You choose.

988
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:40,027
Very well.

989
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,117
Well, you didn't see
<i>that</i> coming, did you?

990
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:47,493
Eh?

991
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,373
Actually, I did
see it coming.

992
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,417
(grunting)

993
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,756
I mean, I knew
you were gonna attack.

994
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:02,591
I just wasn't sure how.

995
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,434
Patterns are tricky like that.

996
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:13,644
Takes time to get
a real sense of them.

997
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,732
I needed to study you a bit.

998
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,570
Took much less time
than I expected.

999
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,155
Aah!

1000
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:48,471
You're lucky I'd never use
Azrael's Blade on you, brother.

1001
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:54,602
Why don't you pick on a girl?

1002
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:56,771
But I have no qualms

1003
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,815
about using it on a filthy,
scum-sucking demon.

1004
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,418
You haven't
disappointed, Mazikeen.

1005
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:21,462
Your patterns
were tough to see.

1006
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:26,467
Aah!

1007
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:32,223
But still predictable
nonetheless.

1008
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:46,570
Because you made it
so difficult,

1009
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:50,533
now I'm gonna take out Mom
<i>and</i> the detective.

1010
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,035
You can't stop me, brother.

1011
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,377
I didn't see that coming.

1012
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,967
(whispers)

1013
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:16,600
What did he say?

1014
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,313
I... I couldn't understand.

1015
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:23,858
Prick got what
he deserved.

1016
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:30,906
