1
00:00:00,907 --> 00:00:03,762
- Previously on Lucifer...
- Everything I felt for her

2
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:05,828
was smoke and mirrors, courtesy of Dad.

3
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:07,935
Did you sleep with me to
get intel on this case?

4
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:09,945
- Of course.
- What are you doing here?

5
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:12,726
You don't let your girl go
into enemy territory alone.

6
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:14,290
The piece is here.

7
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:16,296
My last words were a clue.

8
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,587
A clue? A clue to what?

9
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,768
Well, you're the one who has
to figure that out, aren't you?

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,824
And you really think that this is

11
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:21,963
the Flaming Sword?

12
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:23,374
It's so not flaming.

13
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:25,139
That's because only you,

14
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:28,088
my Lightbringer, can ignite it.

15
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:30,143
That's it. It's all I've got.

16
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:32,313
Okay. Then we'll fix it.
There's plenty of time.

17
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:34,362
Just not for me.

18
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:36,722
I do intend to use the Flaming Sword

19
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:38,144
to cut through the Gates of Heaven.

20
00:00:38,147 --> 00:00:39,179
Once I do that,

21
00:00:39,182 --> 00:00:41,266
I plan on kicking Mom into Heaven

22
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:43,313
and slamming the gates on her backside.

23
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:44,540
Won't God destroy her?

24
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:46,510
Hopefully, they tear each other apart.

25
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,413
Then they'll both get what they deserve.

26
00:00:54,603 --> 00:00:58,072
I'm not the Devil, I'm
just a man who's delusional.

27
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:02,143
I made it all up. I made it all... up.

28
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,213
_

29
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:08,449
I'm doing great.

30
00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:11,118
Great.

31
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,255
Great is... good...

32
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:16,677
Okay, good talk.

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,770
Same time next week?

34
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:20,741
Uh, sorry, it's just that...

35
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:22,430
some of the things that you said

36
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:23,874
in our last session

37
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:26,829
raised some issues for me.

38
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:29,451
Do tell. So this secret plan

39
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:31,133
to cut through the Gates of Heaven...

40
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,615
Well, actually, we've hit
a bit of a snag with that.

41
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:35,336
The Flaming Sword's kaput.

42
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:37,410
Now, we can't work out
what's wrong with it,

43
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:39,714
and until we can, we're in
a bit of a holding pattern.

44
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:41,862
- Ah, that's a relief.
- Well, why would you say that?

45
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:44,966
God and His ex having
a fight to the death?

46
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:47,970
Sounds kind of bad
for, you know, humanity.

47
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:49,173
Oh, you'll probably be fine.

48
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,209
Probably?

49
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,787
That's not exactly reassuring.

50
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,001
What does Maze think of your plan?

51
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,392
Well, I don't know. I haven't told her.

52
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:58,431
Hence the secret part
of the secret plan.

53
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:00,018
- She's your best friend.
- Yes, well,

54
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,521
as much as I love my little sex thug,

55
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:04,240
Maze can do things that she
thinks are in my best interest

56
00:02:04,242 --> 00:02:07,210
that turn out to be, well, disastrous.

57
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:08,277
And I can't afford that.

58
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:10,513
- Hmm.
- But the good news is

59
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:13,379
she's busy focusing on
her new bestie right now.

60
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:14,481
The detective.

61
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:16,851
They're practically inseparable.

62
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:25,228
Hey, roomie.

63
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,296
- Where you going?
- Maze, hey.

64
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,532
Um, I'm on my way to
work. I'm running late.

65
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:31,374
Oh, no, but you haven't
had breakfast, come on.

66
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,238
♪ Mm! ♪

67
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,506
No, I'm...

68
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:38,541
Oh, yeah, no, I'm not hungry.

69
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:40,376
Yeah, I know, the whole

70
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:42,531
boring domestic thing... Not my jam.

71
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:43,534
I should stick to managing

72
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:45,302
the social part of our friendship.

73
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:47,383
- You want to kick someone's ass?
- Maze,

74
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:50,283
I feel like, you know, we've
been hanging out a lot lately.

75
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,287
And I think

76
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,924
perhaps we should expand
our circle of friends.

77
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,392
I got you, Decker.

78
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:57,527
Yeah? You do?

79
00:02:57,529 --> 00:02:59,896
I smell what you're stepping in.

80
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:02,465
Trust me.

81
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:05,067
You know, you should give a Maze a call.

82
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,786
Hasn't it been a while
since you two hung out?

83
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:08,838
Tired of tripping over
her sex toys, are you?

84
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,139
I didn't say that.

85
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:12,508
I just think it would
do her, and me, some good

86
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,243
if she wasn't around all the time.

87
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:16,437
Well, here's the thing.
Maze is like one of those

88
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,673
little baby birds that
imprints on whatever's near.

89
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:21,083
Sadly, that's you. You are the new me.

90
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:23,953
I don't want to be you.
I just want some space.

91
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,545
Oh. Eventually Maze will find her place,

92
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:28,764
but until then, what's the
worst that could happen?

93
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:30,590
Murder. Confirmed.

94
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:33,294
Blunt-force trauma to
the back of the head.

95
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,164
The victim got hit with
this backgammon board.

96
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,566
Not very sportsmanlike.

97
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:41,402
Hmm-mm. He was an orderly.

98
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:43,371
Toby Mulligan, 32.

99
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:45,539
- Body was found here.
- Okay.

100
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,274
They interview the staff
or the patients yet?

101
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:49,810
No, not yet. It's a
psychiatric hospital,

102
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,679
so the staff didn't want
the patients wigging out

103
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:52,713
over the dead body.

104
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:54,315
They've been busy moving everyone

105
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,349
to a different floor.

106
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,218
I love the mentally ill.

107
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,587
I mean, who isn't amused by
someone who thinks they're Elvis

108
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:01,589
or Napoleon or Wesley Snipes?

109
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:02,690
Who found the body?

110
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:04,425
- God.
- Ah! See?!

111
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:06,508
God Johnson, he's a
patient. He's right in there.

112
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:08,496
The guy actually thinks he's God.

113
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,264
He changed his name and everything.

114
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,355
Oh. You two should have

115
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:12,633
- a lot to talk about.
- Yes.

116
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:14,602
I would like to have a
chat with the Almighty.

117
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,237
Cool your jets, man, all
right? There's a whole bunch

118
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,982
of bureaucratic hoops to jump through

119
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:19,140
to set up an interview.

120
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,375
The hospital administrator
has all the info.

121
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:35,965
Well, hello, God.

122
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:37,692
Hello, my son.

123
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:41,381
Right, yes, I suppose that
would be the standard way

124
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:43,418
to greet your children.

125
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:44,448
Nice touch.

126
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,400
What can I do for you?

127
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:49,136
Well, it's what I can do
for you that's exciting.

128
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:52,373
See, I can reveal the truth
about the Supreme Being

129
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,041
you've chosen to impersonate.

130
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,043
I bet you wanted to be God because

131
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,546
He's benevolent,
all-powerful, yada yada.

132
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,583
But in actual fact, He's a dick.

133
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:07,555
Look, if you want to be angry with me,

134
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,224
you just go right on ahead.

135
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,946
I can be anything you need me to be.

136
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:17,143
Right, enough of this idle chit-chat.

137
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:20,000
Time to tell you what the
charade's really about.

138
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:21,425
What do you desire?

139
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:22,369
Hmm?

140
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:24,105
To avoid a vengeful ex-wife?

141
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:26,943
Years of back taxes? What's your game?

142
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:32,113
Is this a staring contest?

143
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:34,482
'Cause, you know, I'm
pretty good at those.

144
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:37,485
How is this possible?

145
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,620
Oh, right, yes, I bet you're on

146
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,489
some really amazing drugs, aren't you?

147
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:43,390
If so, share-zies.

148
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:46,327
You're not supposed to be in here.

149
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,628
Oh, never mind.

150
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,531
I'm done with this fraud, anyway.

151
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,366
It was real good seeing you, Samael.

152
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:55,569
What did you say?

153
00:05:59,174 --> 00:06:00,407
Dad?

154
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:06,491
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

155
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:09,910
Has Dad ever visited Earth before?

156
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,378
Not that I'm aware of.

157
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:13,329
And besides, why would He do so now?

158
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,023
Mm. I don't know, maybe because

159
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,659
we're plotting to overthrow Him.

160
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:18,829
Even so, Luci, that's
not the way Dad operates.

161
00:06:18,832 --> 00:06:20,249
If He has a problem,

162
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:22,061
He sends an emissary, like me,

163
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:24,264
or maybe a burning bush.

164
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:28,134
So how does this God
Johnson know Samael, hmm?

165
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:29,603
My name.

166
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:31,738
Oh, wait, I know.

167
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,073
- You do?
- The Internet!

168
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:35,182
It's truly amazing what
you can find online.

169
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:36,626
Have you seen that video with the cat

170
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:37,744
that jumps inside the box?

171
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:38,979
Very funny, but I didn't even

172
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,198
introduce myself as Lucifer.

173
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,251
And there's something strange about...

174
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:45,652
I can't explain it.

175
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:46,987
Because it's just crazy talk

176
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,722
coming from a mentally ill human.

177
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:52,525
- Well, there might be another reason.
- Right.

178
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:53,471
What's that?

179
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:55,127
Well, Earth is His favorite toy.

180
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,597
Maybe He got fed up of
looking at it from afar.

181
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,078
I mean, it's not an
entirely awful place.

182
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:01,531
Even you have to admit that.

183
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:04,136
Now you're the one sounding
crazy, Luci, because Earth...

184
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,840
Earth is nothing compared to Heaven.

185
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:09,360
Oh, come now, brother.

186
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,478
I think you've grown to
like the place, haven't you?

187
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,435
Come on, be honest.

188
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:15,115
When we return to Heaven,
there must be something

189
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:16,983
that you're gonna miss, eh?

190
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:20,521
Or someone, maybe?

191
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,691
Someone in tight leather pants
with a penchant for knives?

192
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,651
I'm referring to Maze, of course.

193
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,864
Come on, guys.

194
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,033
Is it really so crazy?

195
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,703
I mean, what if God was one of us?

196
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:36,738
Just a slob, like one of us.

197
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,006
Exactly. Or just a...

198
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:39,474
A stranger on a bus.

199
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:41,442
My father would never
use public transport.

200
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:42,844
That song is completely unrealistic.

201
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:44,379
- What song?
- The song I hate

202
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,080
almost as much as I
hate these hypocrites,

203
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:47,782
like God Johnson.

204
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:49,751
Hypocrite? Hmm, I don't know.

205
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:52,013
I see some similarities
between the two of you.

206
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:54,118
That man is not my father.

207
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:56,540
Well, good thing, 'cause
he might be our killer.

208
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:59,427
Whaaat? Oh, my God, Ella,
how do you know that?

209
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:01,927
I'll tell you how I know that,
because our victim was bald.

210
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,499
It's very hard to get prints off a body,

211
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:07,153
so I whipped out the ultraviolet

212
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:10,123
alternate light source,
and... boom, complete set

213
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:12,126
on the victim's noggin.

214
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:13,942
They match one Earl Johnson,

215
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:16,546
wealthy oil magnate from Odessa, Texas.

216
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:19,747
Huh. It says here his wife
committed him a few months ago

217
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,616
after he gave all of his money away

218
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:23,785
and started calling himself "God."

219
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:27,121
Mr. Johnson never said that
he touched the victim's body.

220
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:29,359
Left out the killing part as well.

221
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:31,593
And proving he's the
killer is the perfect way

222
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,870
to expose his false idolatry.

223
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:34,939
Right, shall we?

224
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:36,207
No, we shan't.

225
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,527
Because you spoke to
him without permission,

226
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,530
I had to apply for a special hearing

227
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:41,745
just to interview him.

228
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:43,200
That'll take at least a few days,

229
00:08:43,202 --> 00:08:44,968
so thank you for that.

230
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:53,945
Hello, there.

231
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:55,947
I'd like a suite for
the evening, please.

232
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:57,082
Preferably one with a view.

233
00:08:57,084 --> 00:08:58,717
Are you joking?

234
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,352
This is a psychiatric hospital.

235
00:09:00,354 --> 00:09:02,220
Apologies, I'm skipping ahead.

236
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:05,991
Uh, I am the one and
only Lucifer Morningstar.

237
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,662
The Devil. Dark Lord?

238
00:09:10,664 --> 00:09:12,580
Oh, for goodness sake, Beelzebub!

239
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:15,967
Look, I clearly need to
be committed right away.

240
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:18,103
Yeah, we're at near capacity, pal.

241
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:22,207
So unless you're a danger
to yourself or others...

242
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:23,942
- How's that?
- Great.

243
00:09:23,944 --> 00:09:25,977
Lovely.

244
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,387
Dammit!

245
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:39,711
Who stole my pudding again?

246
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:41,393
Huh?

247
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:43,061
Markowitz?

248
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:44,629
Want a taste?

249
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:50,235
Don't you have better things to do

250
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:51,403
than to raid our fridge?

251
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:53,905
I was about to leave
this place altogether,

252
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:55,740
but I hit an unexpected snag.

253
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:59,744
Now I need to distract
myself with something.

254
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,381
Hello, something.

255
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:06,885
You know, just in case I'm giving off an

256
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:08,920
"I have zero self-respect" vibe,

257
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:11,256
let me make it clear.

258
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:12,891
Hands off.

259
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,323
I'd rather sit at home alone,

260
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:18,542
and in the dark, than
to hang out with you.

261
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:25,170
Sassy.

262
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:26,905
I like it.

263
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:30,942
Deal me in, gentlemen.

264
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:32,368
Oh, and lady.

265
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:34,779
Buy in's ten thousand big ones.

266
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:37,048
Oh, right, high stakes. I like it.

267
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,049
Pig farts!

268
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,784
Crash and burn.

269
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:41,319
Oh, I see, you're one of those. Right.

270
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,054
- 200.
- I swear,

271
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:46,725
I am gonna stab you in
the eye if you do not stop

272
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:47,926
dealing me crap!

273
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:49,601
Call.

274
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:50,603
I'm out.

275
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:53,731
Um, ten thousand, all in.

276
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:56,101
Fold.

277
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,739
What do you know about God Johnson?

278
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:02,240
I like fire.

279
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:03,348
Right, never mind.

280
00:11:03,351 --> 00:11:04,950
Maybe I can help.

281
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:08,262
- I did see him perform a miracle.
- Really?

282
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:12,050
He scored me an extra
Jell-O at snack time.

283
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:13,418
Shh.

284
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,320
Useless.

285
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:17,022
Royal flush.

286
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:18,812
- Cheater!
- Red pubic hair!

287
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:19,814
Mm-hmm.

288
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,761
Billy, what did I tell you

289
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:24,929
about throwing your underwear?

290
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,031
They're not mine.

291
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,438
Really? 'Cause you're naked.

292
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,868
Yes, I'm more of a boxer
briefs guy, but thank you.

293
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,770
Sorry about that. You must be Lucifer.

294
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:32,937
I'm Dr. Garrity.

295
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,039
Oh. Yes.

296
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,173
Can we talk later?

297
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:37,442
I have to get him to his
electroshock treatment.

298
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:38,410
Really?

299
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:40,245
- Just kidding.
- Yes.

300
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:41,913
You, this way. Come.

301
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:43,782
- Very good.
- Let's go find you some pants.

302
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:47,318
Dad.

303
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:03,428
Aha! Of course, you're the murderer.

304
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:05,904
Right, suppose I should thwart you now.

305
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:09,121
Off to jail, cowboy.

306
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,844
No, please, I have to save her.

307
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:13,978
What do you mean, save her?

308
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:42,115
It really is you.

309
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:47,443
You son of a bitch.

310
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,996
Why the hell would you
get yourself committed?

311
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:54,966
I did it to help the investigation.

312
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:56,867
Hey.

313
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:58,135
What do you think?

314
00:12:58,137 --> 00:12:59,370
It's a good likeness, isn't it?

315
00:12:59,372 --> 00:13:01,005
That's it, I'm pulling the plug.

316
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:02,373
- I'm getting you out of here, now.
- No, no, no, no.

317
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,774
You were the one who
said it would be difficult

318
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:05,268
to interview God Johnson.

319
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:06,410
So, I took some initiative.

320
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,012
I went undercover.

321
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:10,659
You must admit having an inside
man could be quite effective.

322
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:11,716
So, you're doing this

323
00:13:11,718 --> 00:13:13,117
just to help the case?

324
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:15,720
Well, there may also
be some personal issues

325
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:17,288
I'd like to explore with Mr. Johnson.

326
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,790
But yes, the main reason I came
was to prove he's the killer.

327
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,158
Is that why you punched him?

328
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,760
To force a confession?

329
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:24,395
Not exactly, but he had it coming.

330
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:26,931
You see, Detective,

331
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:30,207
it turns out, he may actually
be my father after all.

332
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,712
You've decided that the lead
suspect in this investigation

333
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:35,081
may be your father?

334
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:37,588
I know that God Johnson
is not the killer.

335
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:38,691
And you know that because...

336
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:39,744
Because another patient

337
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:41,145
was attacked last night

338
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:43,896
and I saw God Johnson heal her.

339
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:47,393
And here's me being
super-duper helpful:

340
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:48,719
before the orderlies

341
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:51,088
took the victim away, she
told me who did attack her.

342
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,289
Great. Who is it?

343
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,658
Santa Claus.

344
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:57,493
He's always been...

345
00:13:57,495 --> 00:13:59,495
quirky, but now, he's...

346
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:01,364
I-I don't know. I'm-I'm
worried about him.

347
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:03,332
Well, Lucifer certainly
is an interesting case,

348
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:07,336
but I can't really discuss the,
uh, specifics of his diagnosis.

349
00:14:07,338 --> 00:14:09,505
Now, is he your, um...

350
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:11,607
uh, fiancé? I mean, uh, boyfriend?

351
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:12,680
No.

352
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:13,847
Lucifer's a co-worker.

353
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,278
Good, good. Well...

354
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,612
I'm sorry.

355
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:19,015
I mean, that's good to know.
That's, um, information,

356
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:21,484
which is helpful,
'cause it's informative.

357
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,152
Right. Yes, of course, yes.

358
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,201
Dr. Garrity?

359
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:25,655
It's time for music therapy.

360
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,889
Thank you, Nurse Kipsy.

361
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:28,591
I should get going anyhow.

362
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:30,426
Well, listen, um, if maybe, uh,

363
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:32,495
if you want to talk some
more, about Lucifer or, uh,

364
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,631
anything else, uh, feel
free, uh, to give me a call.

365
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:37,133
My cell phone number's there.

366
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:38,668
Thank you.

367
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,670
Okay.

368
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,075
Hey, Maze. What's up?

369
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:01,722
I'll give you one chance to apologize.

370
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:03,758
Apologize?

371
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,226
You punched me.

372
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:07,461
Tell you what I can do:

373
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,597
I can forgive you.

374
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:12,600
Taking the high ground, are we?

375
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:13,868
Magnificent.

376
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,405
Well, I may have struck the latest blow,

377
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:21,964
but that is only in response to
the litany of offenses that you,

378
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,668
dear old Dad, have bestowed upon me.

379
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,340
So you believe me? Good.

380
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:31,619
Tell me, just what is
it you think I've done?

381
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:33,573
Oh, we're going there,
are we? Right, let's see.

382
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:36,625
Um, casting me into Hell for eternity

383
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:39,028
because you haven't got the
balls to get your own cowardly

384
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,663
hands dirty.

385
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:42,431
Manipulating me with the detective,

386
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,398
giving me the illusion of control.

387
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,368
You are a...

388
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,204
patronizing, sinister,

389
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,605
helicopter parent!

390
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:52,174
So you think you have no free will.

391
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:55,077
Every bad thing that's
happened throughout eternity

392
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,114
is your doing, not mine!

393
00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:59,864
It's all part of "God's Plan."

394
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:01,400
Even Mum's coming here

395
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:03,618
and manipulation of me was part of it.

396
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:05,321
- Your mother's here?
- Oh!

397
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:06,691
Look who cares now.

398
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:08,293
Oh, my.

399
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:12,395
Oh, well, that is something.

400
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:17,266
I still remember the
first moment we met.

401
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:21,713
Mmm. There was nothing,
just darkness and...

402
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:26,976
then she appeared.

403
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:29,645
It did not take long for
us to light up the universe.

404
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:33,149
Much as I'm enjoying this
trip down memory lane,

405
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:36,152
I want an apology... nay.

406
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:38,421
Nay, I demand penance.

407
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,946
You must atone for what you've done.

408
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:44,785
Now, that's not the Samael I remember.

409
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:45,866
No.

410
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:51,066
No, Dad, this is who you
made me when you cast me away!

411
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:52,334
Now apologize!

412
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,934
Uh, Lucifer?

413
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:00,943
Guy sounds like he wants to bang.

414
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:02,423
He's Lucifer's doctor, Maze.

415
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:03,424
So what?

416
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:04,827
Doctors don't want to get laid?

417
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,949
Does everything always have
to be about sex with you?

418
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:08,117
Yeah.

419
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,522
He was just trying to be helpful.

420
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:11,921
We should invite him
on the booze cruise.

421
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:13,022
What booze cruise?

422
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:15,090
Tonight. I had a friend set up a yacht.

423
00:17:15,092 --> 00:17:17,092
You know, it'll be
like a hip-hop video.

424
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:19,323
You said you wanted to
expand our circle of friends.

425
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:20,791
That's not what I meant at all.

426
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:22,965
Oh.

427
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:25,301
You want to ride solo with Dr. McHotty.

428
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:27,102
I can get behind that.

429
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:28,859
Or on top, dealer's choice.

430
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:30,372
I'm kidding.

431
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:31,974
Okay, I'll set it all up.

432
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:35,653
You won't have to lift a
finger. Let me help you.

433
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,765
I don't want, nor need, your help

434
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:39,098
with setting up a date. I'm good.

435
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:39,849
Why not?

436
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:43,184
You and I are flowing, Chlo. Same page.

437
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:45,319
Nope. Different books altogether.

438
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:48,522
You crack me up, Decker.

439
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:57,465
♪ What if God was one of us? ♪

440
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:02,837
♪ Just a slob like one of us ♪

441
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,839
♪ Just a stra... ♪

442
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:07,675
Oh, my God, Chloe, this song is so good.

443
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:10,478
Yeah, yeah. People seemed
to really like it...

444
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,712
in 1995.

445
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:13,314
Oh, my God, and the music video.

446
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:14,792
- Uh...
- Oh.

447
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:15,816
What's going on?

448
00:18:15,818 --> 00:18:17,752
So, um, by chance,

449
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:20,554
have you found any evidence

450
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:23,190
pointing to, um...

451
00:18:23,192 --> 00:18:24,525
Santa Claus?

452
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:27,728
I was gonna ask you
the exact same thing.

453
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,729
- Really?
- Yes.

454
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:31,251
Long white hair.

455
00:18:31,254 --> 00:18:32,833
Found it on the victim's clothes.

456
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:35,636
Wasn't sure what it was, but
yeah, totally screams Santa.

457
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:38,372
I'll have it tested ASAP.

458
00:18:38,374 --> 00:18:40,341
I could see if you're mentally troubled,

459
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:43,078
you see someone with long
white hair commit a crime,

460
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,747
you could call him Santa Claus.

461
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,949
Right?

462
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:49,416
Kind of like this guy.

463
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:52,586
Uh, yeah.

464
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,149
Dude looks exactly like
the creepy drunk Santa

465
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:56,390
at the mall when I was a kid.

466
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:59,794
Too bad setting up an
interview would take forever...

467
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:01,829
without a doctor's permission.

468
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:03,697
Ooh.

469
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:05,800
A doctor's permission...

470
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:09,236
Yeah?

471
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:11,505
Hey, Maze.

472
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:12,952
You still want to help me?

473
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:16,577
Okay, so that was "God" God back there?

474
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:18,179
As in capital "G"?

475
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:19,513
I didn't bow. I should have bowed.

476
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:20,848
You should have spit in His face.

477
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,183
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

478
00:19:22,185 --> 00:19:23,484
Then you're no use to me, Doctor.

479
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:24,852
What on earth are you doing here anyway?

480
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:26,821
Chloe sent me to check on
you because she was worried.

481
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:28,189
But now, I'm worried.

482
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:29,490
Please tell me you're
not still planning on

483
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,458
having your mom and
God destroy each other.

484
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
Don't be silly. That
plan won't work anymore.

485
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:35,429
Oh. Oh, good. Maybe
I should've curtsied.

486
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:37,164
Unfortunately, Dad
seems to be soft on Mum.

487
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,099
Like he still has feelings for her.

488
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:41,775
Which gives me another
way to punish them,

489
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:43,944
far more tortuous than death.

490
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:45,372
And we're back to "not good."

491
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:46,774
No, no, no, no, this is better.

492
00:19:46,776 --> 00:19:50,150
And you, my dear doctor,
are going to help me.

493
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:58,725
Okay, you've all been chosen

494
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:00,994
to help with a very
special mission called

495
00:20:00,996 --> 00:20:03,230
"Operation Help Lucifer
Escape from the Hospital."

496
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:05,172
Mm, that's a little on the nose, son.

497
00:20:05,175 --> 00:20:07,501
You are literally the judgiest
person in the universe.

498
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:08,344
You know that, Dad?

499
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:09,235
Escape?

500
00:20:09,238 --> 00:20:11,067
But we get pudding here.

501
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,807
Oh, look, I know the puddings are good,

502
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,009
but there must be more
that you all desire.

503
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:17,244
I mean, come on, Pete.

504
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:18,779
I know desserts aren't the only thing

505
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:20,380
that tickle your fancy, are they? Hmm?

506
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:22,482
I do want to watch it all burn.

507
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:23,517
Right.

508
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,758
Then fire away.

509
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:26,853
Oh...

510
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:27,988
Go, go, go, go, go.

511
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,222
Right.

512
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:31,563
I want to turn the lights on... and off.

513
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:32,598
Good! Go!

514
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:33,859
I love a good rave.

515
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:34,587
Who's next?

516
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,823
I want to throw underwear at heads.

517
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:38,064
Laundry room! Right? Go
forth, people. Come on.

518
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:39,333
Liberate yourselves.

519
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:41,234
Play to your strengths.

520
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:43,370
So this is your big plan
for busting us out of here.

521
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:46,340
Encouraging a man to steal underwear?

522
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:48,008
No, no. That was just for fun.

523
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:51,712
That is how we're
gonna escape from here.

524
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,948
Come on.

525
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,922
All right. It was a pretty good plan.

526
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:09,022
Thank you.

527
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:10,588
You've got a, um...

528
00:22:10,591 --> 00:22:11,690
Hmm?

529
00:22:11,693 --> 00:22:13,760
It's just... come here.

530
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:16,884
Ah, right.

531
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:18,853
Uh, Linda, Dad. Dad, Linda.

532
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:22,549
A handshake'll do, my beautiful child.

533
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,025
Okay.

534
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:26,286
Right, are we finished? Come
on, let's get a wriggle on.

535
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:28,422
Let's go.

536
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:36,263
I've seen your mom
dress sluttier than this.

537
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:38,832
Okay, Maze, this is an interrogation

538
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:40,334
disguised as a casual dinner.

539
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:41,869
There's no need to get dolled up.

540
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:44,322
Please don't tell me you made
reservations at somewhere fancy.

541
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:46,173
Opposite of fancy.

542
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:47,841
It's here.

543
00:22:47,843 --> 00:22:50,144
Here. Why?

544
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:52,012
Well, duh, your bedroom's here.

545
00:22:52,014 --> 00:22:53,580
Where else are we gonna have sex?

546
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:56,984
For the last time, Maze,
we're not having a threesome.

547
00:22:56,986 --> 00:22:58,519
I'm okay to watch.

548
00:22:58,521 --> 00:23:00,521
Showtime.

549
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:08,746
Oh, an orgy? Definitely off the table.

550
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,438
Lucifer?

551
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:24,444
What is it you wanted to show me?

552
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,108
Well, now.

553
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,282
You are as radiant as
the moment we first met.

554
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:02,857
Explain to me what's going on, please.

555
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,452
I'm trying to recreate their first date.

556
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:08,397
You're... what? Wait.

557
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,402
You're trying to Parent Trap
God and the Divine Goddess?

558
00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:14,437
What? It worked in the movie.

559
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:16,139
Don't you see? With Dad here on Earth,

560
00:24:16,141 --> 00:24:17,474
I don't need the Flaming Sword

561
00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:20,010
or a trip to Heaven to exact my revenge.

562
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:23,413
Okay, but how is having them
fall in love again revenge?

563
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:26,282
Oh, trust me, Doctor, after
a brief re-honeymoon period,

564
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:29,052
they'll start torturing each
other like they always do.

565
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:33,023
Mum and Dad together are
their own worst punishment.

566
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,090
It's genius.

567
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,359
Do I know you?

568
00:24:36,361 --> 00:24:38,294
Only since the beginning of time.

569
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:39,896
What is this?

570
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:41,550
Where's Lucifer?

571
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:42,618
Aw, who knows.

572
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:45,368
That son of ours is unpredictable,

573
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,536
to say the least.

574
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:51,274
Husband?

575
00:24:51,276 --> 00:24:53,610
Is this really you?

576
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:55,145
In the flesh.

577
00:25:01,386 --> 00:25:03,920
Oh! God...

578
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:06,389
You put me in Hell, you bastard.

579
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:18,468
Uh, it's a great pizza.

580
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,037
Uh, never tried pineapple
and jalapeño before.

581
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,338
Yes, I know.

582
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,722
Uh, Maze has very eccentric tastes.

583
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:26,191
I would, I would've made something

584
00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:27,569
if I had notice.

585
00:25:27,572 --> 00:25:28,904
You know. Any notice.

586
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,207
No, no. I-It's great.

587
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,905
You know, I like trying new things.

588
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:33,795
- Meeting new people.
- Are you gonna eat that?

589
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,852
N-No. No.

590
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:42,258
So, um, Maze. Uh, where are you from?

591
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,626
Hell.

592
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:47,097
By the way, I changed the
sheets on Decker's bed.

593
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:48,164
She's good to go.

594
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,532
Okay.

595
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:52,635
Excuse me. Maze, can I
speak to you for a second?

596
00:25:53,972 --> 00:25:56,439
Oh.

597
00:25:59,562 --> 00:26:01,697
I like the shape of your head.

598
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:03,399
What the hell are you doing?

599
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:04,633
I'm not Lucifer.

600
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:06,070
I don't need what he needs.

601
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:07,803
What I need is a friend.

602
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:09,938
You want your privacy.

603
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,758
Gotcha, Decker.

604
00:26:11,761 --> 00:26:13,675
Psst.

605
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,263
Excuse my roommate. Sh...

606
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:25,186
No, that's, uh, it's
nothing compared to the, uh,

607
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:27,289
intriguing folks I deal with at work.

608
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,426
I can imagine. I-I actually
would love to hear about that.

609
00:26:32,595 --> 00:26:35,831
Why are you here?

610
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:39,885
I wasn't planning on having
sex with you again, but...

611
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:41,370
Whatever, right?

612
00:26:41,372 --> 00:26:42,905
At least someone's getting laid.

613
00:26:45,195 --> 00:26:47,463
I'm not here for sex, Maze.

614
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,815
Okay. Then, what?

615
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:52,915
I just...

616
00:26:55,232 --> 00:26:56,932
There's not much time before we're gone.

617
00:26:57,935 --> 00:26:59,922
What, are you going on a vacation?

618
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:02,658
I'm not sure I'd call what
Lucifer, Mom and I are doing

619
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,793
going a vacation, but...

620
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:11,135
Lucifer didn't tell you.

621
00:27:11,138 --> 00:27:13,502
Tell me what?

622
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:20,309
I told you never to lie
to me again, Amenadiel.

623
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:23,412
Tell me what?

624
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:27,416
We're all going back to Heaven.

625
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:37,359
So tell me, how, how do you
have your job and stay sane?

626
00:27:37,361 --> 00:27:38,756
Oh, uh...

627
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,529
Years of practice, um...

628
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:42,498
Drugs. Mostly drugs.

629
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,982
Mm.

630
00:27:43,985 --> 00:27:45,834
But, um, but, seriously, um, I just...

631
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:47,308
I try and see beneath the DSM.

632
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:49,705
Try to remember that each
one of them is a person.

633
00:27:49,707 --> 00:27:53,709
Yeah. I, uh, I saw this
older gentleman the other day.

634
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:56,316
Uh, long white hair. White beard.

635
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,052
He reminded me of my crazy Uncle Al.

636
00:27:58,055 --> 00:28:00,381
- You must be talking about Dale.
- Yeah, what's his deal?

637
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,784
Is he one of the violent ones?

638
00:28:04,754 --> 00:28:05,821
Um...

639
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:07,256
Uh...

640
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:11,419
Um, what kind of civil
servant are you, exactly?

641
00:28:14,264 --> 00:28:18,200
Wow. Well, this evening just
got even more interesting.

642
00:28:18,202 --> 00:28:20,536
Apparently, your co-worker,
Lucifer, just escaped

643
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:23,272
and took God Johnson with him.

644
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:31,369
What's he doing here, Lucifer?

645
00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:33,323
I don't know. You married him.

646
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:35,792
Well, it kind of ruins our plans
to storm the Gates of Heaven

647
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:37,327
and destroy him.

648
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:39,829
Well, I'm thinking we might
not need to do that anymore.

649
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:42,799
I will never forgive him, if
that's what you're getting at.

650
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,134
The point is, Mum,

651
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:48,671
that I think Dad...
sincerely misses you.

652
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:52,075
Well, of course I do. How could I not?

653
00:28:52,077 --> 00:28:53,977
Look at you.

654
00:28:55,012 --> 00:28:57,847
An absolute vision.

655
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:59,582
Glowing, even now.

656
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:02,652
Oh, you have no idea.

657
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:04,687
I'm just gonna... Doctor.

658
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:07,690
For the life of me, I can't even
remember why we were fighting.

659
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:09,692
The flames? Eternal damnation?

660
00:29:09,694 --> 00:29:11,594
The... Kind of hard to forget.

661
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:14,764
I am so sorry that you suffered.

662
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:17,867
Well, I su... suppose I should apologize

663
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:20,703
for trying to destroy your precious toy

664
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:24,007
with floods and with
plagues and whatnot.

665
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:26,876
I guess humanity isn't entirely awful.

666
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:29,145
They did make vodka.

667
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:30,713
Roller coasters.

668
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:32,257
Triple crÃ¨me Brie.

669
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:35,985
You hear about dancing?

670
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:39,022
Yes, I actually did some
of that on a table, once.

671
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:47,230
Would you do me this honor?

672
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:09,719
You sure it's revenge you're after?

673
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:12,155
Of course it is. What else would it be?

674
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:22,999
What's the matter?

675
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:24,767
This.

676
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:26,436
I didn't think this was possible.

677
00:30:26,438 --> 00:30:28,238
It wasn't part of the plan.

678
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,807
So, maybe...

679
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:33,810
maybe we make a new plan.

680
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:36,012
This time, we make it together.

681
00:30:50,621 --> 00:30:52,395
Lucifer!

682
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:54,397
Detective!

683
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,266
Seriously?

684
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:00,670
Okay, outside now.

685
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:06,526
First you check yourself

686
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:08,010
into a mental hospital,

687
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:11,047
only to kidnap another
patient and escape.

688
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:13,283
Lucifer, how is that helping?

689
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:15,885
Well, i-if you must know,

690
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:18,154
God Johnson is indeed my father,

691
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:20,790
and, uh, I needed to
do a little matchmaking.

692
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,427
With him and Charlotte Richards?

693
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:27,096
I mean, I'm scared to know
how she ties into all this.

694
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:29,832
Well, never mind that.
What about our killer?

695
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:32,001
Hmm? Did you find proof of Santa Claus?

696
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:33,036
Time for your meds.

697
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:34,370
Ooh, lovely.

698
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:37,106
Thank you. Right.

699
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:39,108
Unexpected perk of the place.

700
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,410
Maybe it's a good thing

701
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:43,653
there's another day on
your 72-hour hold. You know?

702
00:31:43,656 --> 00:31:45,915
Maybe being here is the
best thing for you right now.

703
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:47,116
Okay.

704
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,392
Hey.

705
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:58,222
I just wanted to say

706
00:31:58,225 --> 00:32:01,064
that I'm sorry I lied.

707
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:04,867
I, um...

708
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:06,736
Sometimes with work,

709
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:08,137
I get shortsighted.

710
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:10,273
And I never wanted to...

711
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:11,274
Use me?

712
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,278
Yeah.

713
00:32:17,214 --> 00:32:20,116
If you had just been up-front with me,

714
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:22,919
I would've told you that Dale,
the guy you were asking about,

715
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:24,320
he's been here for 15 years.

716
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:28,958
Yeah, he can seem a bit
prickly, but he's a teddy bear.

717
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,860
He's got no violent tendencies.

718
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:33,390
There is just no way he'd kill someone.

719
00:32:33,393 --> 00:32:34,659
All right.

720
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:39,268
Legally, I can't let you
look at Dale's medical file.

721
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,038
But, um...

722
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,041
what happens when I turn away is, um,

723
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:46,042
out of my hands.

724
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,711
Thank you.

725
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:50,947
Yeah.

726
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:54,984
Ooh, look, a Nigerian
prince needs my help.

727
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:56,986
Wow.

728
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:58,788
Thanks.

729
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:04,861
Santa Claus?

730
00:33:05,847 --> 00:33:07,397
Okay, so what's the big deal?

731
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:08,731
Someone dresses up as Santa every year.

732
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:09,518
Patients love it.

733
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,067
Yeah, well, that someone
could be the killer.

734
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:12,201
But a different person
does it every year.

735
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:14,170
Even I did it a few years back.

736
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:17,106
Okay, we store the, uh, costume in here.

737
00:33:19,743 --> 00:33:21,711
Wait, wait, wait.

738
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:32,855
Where's the beard? The red hat?

739
00:33:32,857 --> 00:33:34,824
- It should be in there.
- Okay, two things.

740
00:33:34,826 --> 00:33:38,227
Who else has a key to
that cabinet? And...

741
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:40,129
I need you to put these on.

742
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:42,598
Ooh, ooh.

743
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,368
These drugs are a bit
different, aren't they?

744
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,704
'Cause I can't feel my tongue.

745
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:51,841
Oh. Hello, pretty kitty,

746
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:54,677
kitty, kitty, kitty...

747
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,047
Santa, you're here as well?

748
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,716
Oh, I'm afraid I've been a naughty boy.

749
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:10,198
You see, I am actually the Devil.

750
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:12,101
No, you're not the Devil.

751
00:34:12,103 --> 00:34:14,771
You're just a man who's
delusional in a mental hospital.

752
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:16,639
You made it all up.

753
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:17,707
So...

754
00:34:18,742 --> 00:34:20,510
I'm not the Devil.

755
00:34:20,512 --> 00:34:23,212
I'm just a man who's delusional.

756
00:34:23,214 --> 00:34:24,480
I made it all up.

757
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:26,949
I made it all up!

758
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:31,187
I made it all up.

759
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:33,723
Hello, son.

760
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:34,891
Dad!

761
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:37,310
See? I am the Devil.

762
00:34:37,313 --> 00:34:39,228
Nice try, Santa.

763
00:34:40,282 --> 00:34:43,209
- Tell me what you told the police.
- Only the truth.

764
00:34:43,212 --> 00:34:47,292
That you, Mr. Kringle,
are a cold-blooded killer.

765
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:50,019
- What else?
- What do you want to know, Nurse Kipsy?

766
00:34:59,585 --> 00:35:01,385
Why aren't the drugs working on you?

767
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:02,687
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

768
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:04,930
It's because he's God!

769
00:35:04,957 --> 00:35:06,490
Uh, oh.

770
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:07,825
Hey.

771
00:35:07,827 --> 00:35:09,393
Hey, they shouldn't be working

772
00:35:09,395 --> 00:35:11,262
on me, either, but...

773
00:35:11,264 --> 00:35:12,663
Is the detective still here?

774
00:35:12,665 --> 00:35:14,699
- That might explain it.
- Shut up.

775
00:35:14,701 --> 00:35:16,500
- Okay.
- Doesn't matter.

776
00:35:16,502 --> 00:35:18,769
Now you know it's me,
I have to kill you both.

777
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:24,976
What's that for?

778
00:35:24,978 --> 00:35:26,410
A long shot.

779
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,887
Okay.

780
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:41,459
That's got to be the
coolest thing I've ever seen.

781
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:43,928
I'd-I'd applaud, you
know, if I weren't cuffed.

782
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,930
Sorry about that.
It's just a precaution.

783
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:47,465
Hey, I get it.

784
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:49,000
- Bingo.
- Wow.

785
00:35:49,002 --> 00:35:50,267
That was fast.

786
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:51,502
Yeah, you don't know Ella.

787
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:54,338
The print belongs to
one Patricia Hightower.

788
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,873
We have a patient named Sue Hightower,

789
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:57,408
the one God Johnson attacked.

790
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,511
Okay. I'm waiting on a DMV photo.

791
00:36:01,748 --> 00:36:03,188
She looks familiar.

792
00:36:04,383 --> 00:36:05,683
That's Nurse Kipsy.

793
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:07,485
I changed my name

794
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:09,350
so no one would know she's my mother.

795
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:15,960
She was a raging bitch my entire life.

796
00:36:15,962 --> 00:36:19,897
Controlling, manipulative...

797
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:22,731
She tortured me.

798
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:25,582
So I decided to torture her.

799
00:36:25,585 --> 00:36:27,571
Pumped her full of
drugs, drove her crazy.

800
00:36:27,573 --> 00:36:29,573
Preaching to the choir, sister.

801
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:30,841
Evil parents

802
00:36:30,843 --> 00:36:32,276
deserve to be punished.

803
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:35,212
You had every right to destroy her.

804
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:37,581
But what about the orderly?

805
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,583
He found out what I was doing.

806
00:36:39,585 --> 00:36:41,318
He... said he was gonna turn me in.

807
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,319
I had no choice.

808
00:36:42,321 --> 00:36:43,854
No, he was innocent

809
00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:45,304
and you killed him,

810
00:36:45,307 --> 00:36:48,288
so I am gonna have to punish you.

811
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:54,229
Why aren't I pulverizing you?

812
00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:57,566
Uh, one because you're a nutjob.

813
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:58,901
And two,

814
00:36:58,903 --> 00:37:00,870
because I switched out your normal meds

815
00:37:00,872 --> 00:37:02,838
with a massive dose of Haldol.

816
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:05,741
You know...

817
00:37:07,353 --> 00:37:08,253
they don't normally

818
00:37:08,256 --> 00:37:09,745
let patients wear belts.

819
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:12,014
Suicide risk.

820
00:37:12,016 --> 00:37:14,864
So, thank you for getting a
special dispensation for yours

821
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,942
because now I got it.

822
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,255
God is gonna kill Lucifer,

823
00:37:19,257 --> 00:37:20,690
then hang himself.

824
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:25,928
Kind of poetic, don't you think?

825
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,863
Gonna go find a ladder.

826
00:37:27,865 --> 00:37:29,932
Oh, a ladder.

827
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:31,067
Now, I had no idea

828
00:37:31,069 --> 00:37:33,469
you were so angry with me.

829
00:37:33,471 --> 00:37:35,171
Really?

830
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:38,249
'Cause I... I've been
pretty up-front about it.

831
00:37:38,252 --> 00:37:40,676
But to want to destroy me?

832
00:37:40,678 --> 00:37:42,878
That's pretty serious.

833
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,947
You mind telling me why?

834
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:48,084
Because...

835
00:37:48,086 --> 00:37:50,820
because I'm your son.

836
00:37:50,822 --> 00:37:53,089
And...

837
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,826
you rejected me.

838
00:37:57,828 --> 00:37:59,695
Oh.

839
00:38:01,498 --> 00:38:03,966
Well, then I guess I
can't say as I blame you.

840
00:38:03,968 --> 00:38:05,822
Fact of the matter is,

841
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,124
I don't even remember why

842
00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:08,807
I was ever so angry
with you to begin with.

843
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:15,021
For what it's worth...

844
00:38:15,023 --> 00:38:17,858
I am sorry.

845
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,427
I truly am.

846
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:23,830
And I am proud of you, Samael.

847
00:38:23,832 --> 00:38:25,832
I am proud of the man you've become.

848
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,704
So, what do you say...

849
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:32,105
Wait, no.

850
00:38:32,107 --> 00:38:33,340
Not... not my belt.

851
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:34,608
You can't take my belt. It's mine.

852
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,005
Patricia Hightower, LAPD. Don't move.

853
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:41,815
Detective.

854
00:38:41,817 --> 00:38:43,450
You okay?

855
00:38:43,452 --> 00:38:44,785
Honestly...

856
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:47,125
I've never felt better.

857
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:53,586
What this? What-What just happened?

858
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:56,323
What are you talking
about? We just beat Santa.

859
00:38:56,998 --> 00:38:58,498
Who are you?

860
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,599
It's me, Dad.

861
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:01,468
Lucifer.

862
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,078
Does someone want to tell
me what the hell is going on?

863
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:06,181
Get me out of these damn things.

864
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:17,060
"The piece is here."

865
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:28,094
Well, what do you know.

866
00:39:28,096 --> 00:39:29,713
It fits perfectly.

867
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:32,383
Yes, I think this is what
Uriel was trying to tell me.

868
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:35,769
Just before he died,

869
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:38,505
he whispered in my ear,
"The piece is here."

870
00:39:38,507 --> 00:39:40,674
I mean, I thought it
was nonsense, but...

871
00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:42,542
this must be why the
sword wasn't working.

872
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:43,777
It wasn't complete.

873
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:45,512
Dad supposedly destroyed
the Flaming Sword

874
00:39:45,514 --> 00:39:46,580
after the rebellion.

875
00:39:46,582 --> 00:39:48,114
So, are you saying

876
00:39:48,116 --> 00:39:50,700
he just broke it into two
pieces? Azrael's blade...

877
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:51,418
And this.

878
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,087
Yes, which somehow ended up on Earth.

879
00:39:54,089 --> 00:39:55,989
Its power probably awakened

880
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:59,646
when Azrael's blade ended up here, too.

881
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,995
Which is when Mr. Johnson
must've stumbled upon it.

882
00:40:01,997 --> 00:40:03,768
But why did he think he was father?

883
00:40:03,771 --> 00:40:07,200
Well, I mean, Azrael's
blade inspired death.

884
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:10,871
Maybe this piece activated
the opposite... life.

885
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:12,902
Healing. Gave him the power

886
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:14,371
and knowledge of the divine.

887
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:17,209
And when he found out that
he could heal like that, he...

888
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:18,443
he thought he was God.

889
00:40:18,445 --> 00:40:19,978
What's more important is that

890
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,048
now the sword's complete,
we can get on with our plan.

891
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,383
So... the...

892
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:29,888
Or not.

893
00:40:34,827 --> 00:40:36,762
Maybe there's another piece missing.

894
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:39,185
Or maybe a dragon has to breathe on it.

895
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:40,282
Who knows?

896
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:41,900
Well, maybe Mum does.

897
00:40:41,902 --> 00:40:43,769
Did...

898
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:45,403
Where is she, anyway?

899
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,179
I thought I made myself clear.

900
00:40:56,182 --> 00:40:58,049
I kissed a man today.

901
00:40:58,051 --> 00:40:59,684
What's your deal?

902
00:40:59,686 --> 00:41:02,020
I thought he was my ex-husband.

903
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:04,289
When I kissed him,

904
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:07,225
I realized it wasn't him.

905
00:41:07,227 --> 00:41:09,327
And the strangest part is,

906
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:12,197
I don't know what's more upsetting...

907
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,866
that it wasn't him?

908
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:20,583
Or that I... I wished it was.

909
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:21,973
Wow.

910
00:41:21,975 --> 00:41:24,176
I just don't want to be alone.

911
00:41:24,178 --> 00:41:27,879
Could we just hold each other?

912
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:31,249
Please?

913
00:41:35,288 --> 00:41:37,155
With your pants off, of course.

914
00:41:45,932 --> 00:41:48,633
I still can't believe I
gave all my money away.

915
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:50,268
Well, if it's any consolation,

916
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,171
- you haven't exactly been yourself of late.
- Yeah.

917
00:41:53,173 --> 00:41:54,940
Listen, I wanted to ask you...

918
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:57,248
what's the last thing you remember?

919
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:59,678
I was in New Mexico for work,

920
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,047
I was walking through
this Navajo gift shop.

921
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:05,417
I saw a cool belt buckle,
so I picked it up, and...

922
00:42:05,419 --> 00:42:07,202
next thing I knew, I woke up

923
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:08,605
strapped to a gurney next to you.

924
00:42:08,608 --> 00:42:10,288
- Lucky you.
- Yeah.

925
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,123
Hey, they, uh,

926
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:13,391
they say we was arguing.

927
00:42:13,393 --> 00:42:16,895
If I did or said something
to upset you, I apologize.

928
00:42:16,897 --> 00:42:20,231
No, no, you were quite lovely actually.

929
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:24,835
For a brief moment, I
thought you were my father.

930
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:29,007
A man for whom I harbor a
great deal of resentment.

931
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:31,412
And you said some things

932
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:34,279
that I think I wish
he'd always said to me,

933
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:37,115
so for that I thank you.

934
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:40,387
Well, I guess even a blind squirrel

935
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,710
catches a nut every now and then.

936
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:43,795
You take care of yourself.

937
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,495
Hey, does this mean you're
not angry at your dad anymore?

938
00:42:49,498 --> 00:42:51,229
No, I'm not angry.

939
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:53,412
I'm bloody furious.

940
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:55,800
'Cause I realized that my father

941
00:42:55,802 --> 00:42:58,270
would never say those things to me.

942
00:42:58,272 --> 00:43:00,305
And for that...

943
00:43:00,307 --> 00:43:03,141
I hate him all the more.

944
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:12,430
