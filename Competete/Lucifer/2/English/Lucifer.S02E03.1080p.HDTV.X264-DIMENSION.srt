of the crime is so specific,

179
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:04,733
we need to figure out
who had a personal grudge

180
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:07,819
against the victim.
Hmm.

181
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:12,190
Uh, by the way, you've
skipped a spot, there.

182
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:13,825
Oh.

183
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,076
Yeah, it's not like you

184
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:17,495
to miss a step in the
clothing department.

185
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:19,058
Yes, well, I had to rush out
this morning.

186
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:20,760
I've got an unexpected
houseguest I can't get rid of.

187
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:23,168
Oh, right. New lady friend
that you can't shake.

188
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:25,036
A rather old one,
actually.

189
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,041
Yeah, I know how...
complicated exes can be.

190
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:31,626
What? She's not an ex.

191
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:33,428
You should
see this, Detective.

192
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:34,713
Thanks.

193
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:36,047
What is it?

194
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:38,800
E-mails from Nick's
supervisor at Wobble.

195
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:40,719
A woman by the name
of Leila Simms.

196
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:41,864
Let me guess,
something riveting

197
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:43,521
about the latest
quarterly report?

198
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:44,389
"How could you?

199
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:46,024
"I should have
known better.

200
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:47,692
You won't get
away with this."

201
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:50,195
"I'll burn you
starting with your man parts"?

202
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,064
No.

203
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:53,886
Still, that's a pretty
good lead.

204
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,336
Yep.

205
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:01,573
Do not... touch...

206
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:03,708
the charred crotch.

207
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,415
And Nick was so...
sweet and charming.

208
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:12,133
How could someone do
such a thing?

209
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:14,085
So, Leila, you were
his supervisor.

210
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:16,087
How well did you
know him?

211
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,472
We dated briefly,
a while ago.

212
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:18,673
Oh.

213
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:23,812
Would you say
things sort of flamed out,

214
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:25,263
or did they end in more of

215
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:26,514
a blaze of glory?

216
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:28,266
Lucifer.
You're right, far too subtle.

217
00:08:28,268 --> 00:08:30,268
Why did you torture
the poor young man to death?

218
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,487
Torture him?

219
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:35,323
Oh, God.

220
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:37,275
You think I had
something to do with this?

221
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:38,943
Well, we know about
the angry e-mails.

222
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:40,412
I was pissed off.

223
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,947
He shared pictures
of us together.

224
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:44,165
Mm, mid-coitus?

225
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:45,845
If so, we'll have to
confiscate those immediately.

226
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:47,335
No.

227
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:48,371
Just of us

228
00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:49,422
at-at dinner.

229
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:50,955
But I'm his boss,

230
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:52,624
and inter-office romance
is frowned upon here.

231
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:53,842
Well, it hardly
seems worthy

232
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:56,428
of lighting a man's
Johnson on fire.

233
00:08:57,881 --> 00:08:59,681
Wait.

234
00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:01,433
Is that how he died?

235
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:04,185
There's something
you should see.

236
00:09:08,141 --> 00:09:10,308
Ray, can you come in here,
please?

237
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,478
Ray, I'm gonna need you
to pull up the video

238
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,563
of Tommy at the
company retreat.

239
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:17,115
<i>The</i> video of Tommy?

240
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,733
Ray's head of our H.R.

241
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:20,535
Being protective is
part of his job.

242
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,120
Do it, Ray.

243
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:26,491
Nick was a charmer,
but he had a tendency

244
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:28,543
to be a little harsh
with interns.

245
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:30,829
Aka, he could be a real dick.

246
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:33,715
As you'll see.

247
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:40,672
Aah! Aah!

248
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:42,590
My balls! Get it off!

249
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:50,065
Come on,
that is quite funny.

250
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,016
Nick posted the video
shortly after the retreat,

251
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:54,319
and even though
it was quickly taken down,

252
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:55,520
everyone saw it.

253
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:58,356
Tommy was a
laughingstock.

254
00:09:58,408 --> 00:09:59,858
He quit pretty soon after.

255
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,826
Certainly looks like motive.

256
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:04,245
Huh.

257
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:10,001
What can you tell me
about Nick Sand's death?

258
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:12,270
Just that the bastard
finally got what he deserved.

259
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:15,090
Okay. And why did
he deserve it?

260
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,492
As soon as I took
the job at Wobble,

261
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:19,427
Nick made it
his personal mission

262
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:21,379
to make my life hell.

263
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:23,698
Sabotaging my work,
terrorizing me,

264
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,917
making me the butt
of all of his jokes.

265
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:28,303
Or the <i>balls,</i> in this case?

266
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:30,822
That stupid video was

267
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:32,707
my breaking point.

268
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:35,643
Everyone saw it.
Everyone laughed at me!

269
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:37,479
No one's laughing now, Tommy.

270
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:40,231
So after everything
that happened, what,

271
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,767
you-you wanted to
make him feel your pain?

272
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:44,836
He deserved
what happened to him.

273
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:47,322
Yeah, but you're not
answering the question.

274
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,376
Did you kill Nick?

275
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:54,140
I understand
punishment all too well, Tommy,

276
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:57,715
and Nick deserved
to be punished.

277
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,501
He did, didn't he?

278
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:01,531
Mm. He took your
dignity, and so you had to

279
00:11:01,555 --> 00:11:02,921
take your revenge.

280
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:06,341
There was no other way to get
your proverbial balls back.

281
00:11:06,393 --> 00:11:07,926
So tell me...

282
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:10,979
...did you desire...

283
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:12,347
I killed him.

284
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,682
Oh.

285
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:16,100
Well, that took

286
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:18,570
all the fun out of it.

287
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,273
That did not go how I expected.

288
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,826
Oh, come now, Detective.
He obviously wanted people

289
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:26,494
to know that he got
his revenge.

290
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,530
Now our would-be punisher's
brought to justice,

291
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:31,916
and the field is mine again...

292
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:34,536
What on earth is she doing here?

293
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:36,171
Charlotte Richards.

294
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:38,206
The defense attorney
we saved, remember?

295
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:40,925
She must be back here
defending some scumbag.

296
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:44,045
But why are they
all being so... chummy?

297
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:46,881
Well, she used to be
a cop, and, oh, yeah,

298
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:48,633
'cause she's a knockout.

299
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,885
Personally, I'm surprised
that you haven't tried...

300
00:11:50,937 --> 00:11:53,054
Pardon me, pardon me.
Excuse us.

301
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:56,207
Charlotte, hello. Do you mind
if we have a quick word?

302
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:00,995
What are you
doing here, Mother?

303
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:02,642
I thought we agreed
you'd do something constructive

304
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,049
with your time, like
mall walking or a studio tour,

305
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:06,467
perhaps, but...

306
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:08,386
How did you even find
your way here?

307
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:10,004
Well, it wasn't difficult.

308
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:13,808
I simply smiled at a male human
and asked him to take me.

309
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:16,155
Need I remind you that Charlotte
Richards has a husband out there

310
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:18,096
who's wondering
where she popped off to.

311
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:20,348
And you have a son who wants
to take you back to Hell.

312
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,411
So drawing attention
to yourself in a police station

313
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:25,820
in this little... getup,
not a good idea.

314
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:27,989
But I had to see
it for myself.

315
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:30,491
My boy, working,
toiling,

316
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,327
amidst humanity's muck.

317
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:34,112
Well, I hope it's everything
you imagined and more.

318
00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:36,898
Now go see <i>Cabaret.</i> I'm sure
you'll find it riveting.

319
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,283
I just don't understand.

320
00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:40,652
Of all the things that
you could do with your talents,

321
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:42,654
law enforcement?

322
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:44,956
Have you considered I might
enjoy exploring humanity?

323
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,293
They eat, darling.

324
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:49,627
All they do is eat.

325
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:52,046
And then afterwards,
the food comes out changed

326
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:54,916
and not for the better.

327
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,253
Detective.

328
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:00,672
I didn't realize

329
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:02,507
you and Charlotte knew
each other so well.

330
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:05,927
Oh, we do and we don't.
It's a long story, really.

331
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:07,679
Right, shall we
go somewhere

332
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,347
to, uh, celebrate
solving the case?

333
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:11,149
No. Not yet.

334
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:13,017
Tommy was humiliated.

335
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:14,852
Makes sense
why he'd want to kill Nick.

336
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:16,654
But something
just doesn't sit right.

337
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,240
Detective, you, of all people,
should know how good it feels

338
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:20,794
to punish someone
who's wronged you.

339
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:21,546
How so?

340
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,661
Oh, come now.

341
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:25,580
You may not be roasting
Dan's chestnuts-- yet--

342
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:28,082
but a shoulder shrug here,
a dismissive look there

343
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:29,132
could be just as effective.

344
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,085
Okay, fine.

345
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:32,265
Maybe I've been a little hard on
Dan lately, but he deserves it.

346
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:33,871
And I'm sure
you found it very satisfying.

347
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:34,872
But have you considered

348
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:36,174
for just one moment

349
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:39,877
how your fighting affects
those caught in the middle?

350
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,379
You mean Trixie?

351
00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:43,047
What? No, I mean me.

352
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:44,849
Think how terribly
bored I am by it all.

353
00:13:44,884 --> 00:13:47,435
Ah, look, there he is.
Now's your chance

354
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,021
to stop with your "will they,
won't they" nonsense.

355
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:50,972
It's not that simple.

356
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:51,973
I'm avoiding
a difficult conversation.

357
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:53,107
Well, I...

358
00:13:53,143 --> 00:13:55,226
Hi.

359
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:56,778
There's something
you got to see.

360
00:13:56,813 --> 00:13:58,758
Another apology video dropped
along with another body.

361
00:13:58,782 --> 00:14:00,949
I know it was wrong!

362
00:14:00,984 --> 00:14:04,202
I shouldn't have posted
that video!

363
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:06,904
She didn't deserve
to be humiliated like that.

364
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:09,407
I'm sorry.

365
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:36,317
Two murders.

366
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:37,652
Same M.O.

367
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:40,104
But Tommy was already in custody
when this guy was killed.

368
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:41,773
There's no way
he did this.

369
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:43,574
Tommy wanted
his dignity back.

370
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,076
Whoever did this

371
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:47,795
clearly had a much grander
objective in mind.

372
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:49,163
Ladies and gentlemen,

373
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,199
it looks like we're
tracking a serial killer.

374
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:59,438
Victim's Adam Wiser, 29,

375
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:01,556
worked as an assistant
at a local bank.

376
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,168
Time of death was two hours ago,
but apparently he's been missing

377
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,444
for almost two days.

378
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,612
Ooh, that's a long time
on a sex rack.

379
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:10,032
Not a record,
but quite impressive.

380
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:11,650
Ella, we know
the cause of death?

381
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,819
Well, he's got broken ribs,
a ruptured spleen

382
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:17,439
and possible cranial bleeding,
which would all totally suck.

383
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:19,291
And yet, this dude asphyxiated.

384
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:21,743
He was choked
with an apple?

385
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,462
No.

386
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:26,398
More like an orchard.

387
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,417
We're gonna have to cut
him open to get the rest.

388
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,718
That's messed up.

389
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:32,337
Certainly brings new meaning
to the term "deep throat."

390
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,839
Why not just
kill the guy?

391
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,924
Why all the pomp
and circumstance?

392
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,343
Well, our punisher's
clearly sending a message.

393
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,095
Perhaps if we find the
video that Apple Boy

394
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,931
is apologizing for,
we'll know what that message is.

395
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,184
Hold this.

396
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,268
What are you doing?

397
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:47,080
The original video was filmed
on Nick's phone, right?

398
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:49,321
What if Adam's doing
the same thing?

399
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:01,700
Be careful, Detective.

400
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:03,118
Might be a booby trap.

401
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,930
The video's already cued up.

402
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,850
Look at this.

403
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,563
Notice anything familiar?

404
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:33,365
The ball gag's
amaranth.

405
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,684
Just like the apple.

406
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:38,153
What, so our killer's paying
homage to a bloody sex tape?

407
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,622
He's recreating the crimes
he's punishing for.

408
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:42,491
First lighting Nick's
groin on fire, now this.

409
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,608
He's upping his game.

410
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:44,921
Yeah, but what's
with the outfit?

411
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:46,985
I mean, other than giving me
super creepy flashbacks

412
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:49,748
to Catholic school,
it doesn't add up.

413
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,917
And the woman is not
wearing one in the video.

414
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,137
She certainly looks too old
to be in school.

415
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:57,722
Unless she
teaches at one.

416
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:05,230
Her name's
Sarah Aiken, 27.

417
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,232
Third grade teacher.
Cute.

418
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:09,985
Not hot, but extra points
for proclivities.

419
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,520
When she broke things
off with Adam,

420
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,939
he uploaded his
revenge porn to Wobble.

421
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,942
Some teachers caught wind
of it, and she was fired.

422
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,778
Well, maybe she took out both
Nick and our loathsome ex.

423
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,196
You know, no harm, no foul.

424
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,772
And no dice because she had
no connection to Nick.

425
00:17:23,796 --> 00:17:24,333
Oh.

426
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,702
And shortly after she lost
her job, she killed herself.

427
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:30,755
What, so our poor,
sexy teacher's dead,

428
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,791
and our apple-chomping
schoolboy's responsible?

429
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,093
And the only other connection
we were able to find

430
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:37,879
is that both victims posted
their illicit videos to Wobble.

431
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,016
So, maybe some sicko
saw both videos

432
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:42,490
and decided to take action.

433
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:43,353
"Sicko"?

434
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,854
Sounds to me like someone's
doing our job for us.

435
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:48,440
We don't exact
vengeance, Lucifer.

436
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:49,941
Well, maybe we should.

437
00:17:49,977 --> 00:17:51,059
As far as I'm concerned,

438
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,195
these little wankers
got exactly what they deserved.

439
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,279
See you later.

440
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:56,031
Hey, where are you going?

441
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,532
We have to find out
who did this.

442
00:17:57,568 --> 00:17:58,795
Well, I thought
someone out there

443
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,702
was stealing my job,
but far be it for me

444
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:02,737
to stand in the way
of excellent work.

445
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:04,156
I'm off for a drink.

Honestly, I'm impressed.

450
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:16,134
It's hard going out on your own.

451
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,004
Changing old habits.

452
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,672
I admire the steps
you're taking.

453
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:22,591
Well, don't
admire too much.

454
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,476
I'm still coming to Lux.

455
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,394
Hmm, yes.

456
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,979
Baby steps are fine.

457
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:31,099
Plus, the view here is... nice.

458
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,272
The real key
is to avoid setbacks.

459
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:44,128
Setbacks that are tall, blond
and have a special place in Hell?

460
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:44,663
Mm.

461
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,780
Hi, Maze.

462
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,950
Hi, human.

463
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:53,922
I need to get rid
of that bitch.

464
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:56,508
Now I know
why you're still here.

465
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:59,094
Why?

466
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:02,013
You and Lucifer are very close.

467
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,517
It's normal that you be
jealous of a new girlfriend.

468
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:07,929
I'm not jealous.

469
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,801
Ah. Mm-hmm.

470
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:10,291
And she's not his girlfriend.

471
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,275
She's just toxic.

472
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,143
Lucifer doesn't
see it, but I do.

473
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,562
Oh, so you want
to protect him?

474
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,232
I want her to get
what she deserves.

475
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,867
Which, at the very
least, is a head-butt.

476
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:23,902
I'll be right back.

477
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:24,869
Okay, okay.

478
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:26,988
Okay, maybe...

479
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,990
we should start
with our words.

480
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,543
Perhaps as Lucifer's friend,
you can talk to him.

481
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:33,912
Express how you feel.

482
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,714
He won't listen.

483
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,501
But maybe someone else will.

484
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:41,803
Where are you going?

485
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:43,588
Taking your advice.

486
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,223
Hey, Man Bun.

487
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,508
Take care of my friend.

488
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,680
Why do I even try?

489
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,266
Because you're
an incredible woman.

490
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,067
Oh.

491
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:57,569
Thanks.

492
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,357
So, I reached out to Wobble
to cross-reference who saw

493
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,975
both Nick and Adam's videos.

494
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:04,805
And?

495
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,245
They lawyered up.

496
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,530
Hid behind privacy laws,
and without a warrant,

497
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,016
Wobble won't let us anywhere
near their viewership data.

498
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:15,120
Okay, pull the warrant,
and I'm on my way there.

499
00:20:15,122 --> 00:20:18,290
No problem.

500
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,958
Dan.

501
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,343
Um...

502
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:23,128
So I've been thinking
about the trip,

503
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,796
and, um...

504
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,182
I don't think it's
fair to put Trixie

505
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:29,768
in the middle of our
problems, you know?

506
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:31,803
So you want to skip it.

507
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,472
No, I want to spare us
all heartache and...

508
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:36,808
I just feel like if
we go on the trip

509
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,893
and, you know, we pretend
everything's fine,

510
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:40,945
then we're just lying to her.

511
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:43,698
Yeah.

512
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,266

00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,410
on the tables smiling
and I wanted to discover

533
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:29,911
what they were so happy about.

534
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:33,415
Oh, is it possible it's
the money that I pay them?

535
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,083
It's possible.

536
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,702
But I have to admit
that when I started dancing,

537
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:41,206
rubbing up against
the other humans,

538
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,352
I got a tingling
sensation...

539
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:44,008
Okay, that's enough.

540
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:46,261
Excuse me, excuse me, thank you.

541
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:47,429
I don't understand.

542
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:48,991
I thought you'd be
pleased by my effort.

543
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:50,932
Disturbed is more like it.

544
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,685
Are you actually trying
to systematically disrupt

545
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,912
every part of my life?

546
00:21:54,936 --> 00:21:55,538
No.

547
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:58,056
I'm trying to <i>learn</i> about
every part of your life.

548
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,441
Oh, right.

549
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:00,975
How's that going for you so far?

550
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:03,111
Well, quite
illuminating, actually.

551
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:07,115
I understand now why you
have this provocative club.

552
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,733
I understand why
you amused yourself

553
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,260
with that
curvaceous savage.

554
00:22:10,821 --> 00:22:12,704
But what I don't
understand...

555
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:14,072
Is my human job. Yes, I know.

556
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,125
It's very simple:
I'm a civilian consultant.

557
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,878
But why do you
still punish people?

558
00:22:19,913 --> 00:22:21,663
It's what I've always done.

559
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,914
That's not true.

560
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,500
That's who your father
wanted you to be.

561
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,554
Are you still trying
to win him over?

562
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:31,256
Careful, Mother.

563
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,223
Why?

564
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,392
Are you going
to punish me?

565
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:53,188
I'm sorry, Detective.

566
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,125
I looked into
the two videos in question,

567
00:22:55,225 --> 00:22:57,325
and unfortunately,
there was no overlap.

568
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:58,625
Doesn't make any sense.

569
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:00,744
I'll need a list of everyone
who saw the videos.

570
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,914
Sadly, we don't track people,
just I.P. addresses.

571
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:07,167
Maybe I'm looking
at this the wrong way.

572
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,004
Can you take me through how
your video process works?

573
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,673
Well, our users can upload
anything they want.

574
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,675
And if we find that
the content's inappropriate--

575
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,811
uh, anything from
animal cruelty to beheadings--

576
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:19,396
it gets taken down.

577
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,731
By who?

578
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,182
Our content moderators.

579
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,484
Huh.

580
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,436
Most of them
only last a few months.

581
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:26,603
Frankly, most people

582
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,689
can't stomach something
so dark or upsetting.

583
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,625
Right.

584
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:33,582
God, that has got to smart.

585
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:37,277
Can I see that again?

586
00:23:37,312 --> 00:23:38,978
Lucifer?

587
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,947
Oh, Detective.
You're here.

588
00:23:40,982 --> 00:23:42,448
Did you know that this room

589
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,317
collects all the best parts
of the Internet?

590
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,547
Can I talk to you for a second?

591
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,119
Yeah, yeah.

592
00:23:46,121 --> 00:23:47,954
But you got to see this--
a-a naked man

593
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:49,872
thinks he can jump
on the back of a rhino.

594
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:52,125
You'll never
guess what he lands on.

595
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,410
Actually, you probably will.

596
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:56,246
What? You've seen it already?

597
00:24:00,218 --> 00:24:01,467
What are you doing here?

598
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:03,622
Trying to catch our killer.
Duh.

599
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:04,837
I thought you
didn't care

600
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,236
whether this sicko
was brought to justice.

601
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:06,974
Oh, I don't.

602
00:24:06,975 --> 00:24:09,642
But then I realized that
our killer may have the answer

603
00:24:09,678 --> 00:24:11,978
to a question that I'm,
you know, struggling with.

604
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:13,012
Mm.

605
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:14,514
Why does he punish?

606
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:15,732
That's it?

607
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:18,017
First you want to teach
this vigilante a lesson,

608
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:19,674
and now you want to
have a talk with him?

609
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:20,318
Yes.

610
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:22,333
And lucky for me, I found out
where you were headed.

611
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:24,574
I mean,
these videos are enthralling.

612
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:26,053
No, I-I can't.
I can't watch these.

613
00:24:26,077 --> 00:24:27,637
Oh, I've seen worse.

614
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:29,862
But never so many collected
in one single room.

615
00:24:29,914 --> 00:24:31,998
You know, if I ever
go back to Hell,

616
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:34,000
I am getting me
one of these.

617
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:36,002
Selfish bastards
get to see everything.

618
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:41,174
Yeah.

619
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,793
They do.

620
00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:45,678
I know where
the overlap is.

621
00:24:50,218 --> 00:24:53,468
(♪ "Share"
by STACEY, playing ♪ )

622
00:25:23,685 --> 00:25:26,502
Amenadiel,
I know you're in there.

623
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:30,840
Open up!

624
00:25:36,748 --> 00:25:38,681
Hey.

625
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:44,704
What are you hiding?

626
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:46,522
Nothing.

627
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:53,679
Oh.

628
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:58,701
I see what's going on with you.

629
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:01,184
You do?

630
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,373
Sure.

631
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:05,324
Humans say that rebound sex
is important after a breakup.

632
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,244
You don't have to hide
that you're getting some.

633
00:26:09,764 --> 00:26:11,264
I'm not.

634
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:15,468
Right.

635
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,937
Of course. I didn't want you
to feel awkward.

636
00:26:17,972 --> 00:26:19,856
Silly me.

637
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,596
So what are
you doing here?

638
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:30,283
I have a problem.

639
00:26:30,318 --> 00:26:31,451
I need your help.

640
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:33,986
There's a new...

641
00:26:33,988 --> 00:26:36,572
woman in Lucifer's life.

642
00:26:36,624 --> 00:26:39,158
I want her gone,
but he won't listen to me.

643
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,377
And why do you care?
I thought you were

644
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:43,079
stepping away
from both of us.

645
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:44,380
I am.

646
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:47,507
But before I do,
I need you...

647
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:48,719
I'll talk to him.

648
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,086
Yeah.

649
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:55,508
Well, that was easy.

650
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,843
I'm his big brother, Maze.

651
00:26:56,895 --> 00:26:59,429
I really should start looking
out for him more often.

652
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:03,266
Okay.

653
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:05,101
Thank you.

654
00:27:06,855 --> 00:27:08,438
All right. Thanks.

655
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,989
Dan's working with
Wobble to trace

656
00:27:10,024 --> 00:27:11,585
what moderator may have
pulled both videos.

657
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:12,920
Hopefully, we'll
have an answer soon.

658
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:14,544
Then why are you
so sure the killer's

659
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:15,878
one of these misanthropes?

660
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:17,497
Well, serial killers

661
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:18,893
usually start with
someone they know.

662
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,666
If the killer worked
here, they knew Nick,

663
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:22,919
saw how much the
prank hurt Tommy.

664
00:27:22,954 --> 00:27:24,348
So you think
seeing someone they recognized

665
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:27,039
in one of these twisted videos
finally made them snap?

666
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:29,459
Maybe it awakened
something in them.

667
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:32,762
Something that was always there,
just fighting to get out.

668
00:27:32,797 --> 00:27:35,548
But...

669
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,518
they were just
trying to do a job.

670
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:40,052
Job no one else wanted.

671
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:42,138
Well, maybe they chose
that for a reason.

672
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,308
No one chooses
to be a sin-eater, Detective.

673
00:27:45,343 --> 00:27:48,611
No one wants
to be custodian

674
00:27:48,646 --> 00:27:51,447
of the world's filth.
Why would they?

675
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:54,700
Absorbing the worst humanity has
to offer, day in and day out.

676
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:56,235
Changes you.

677
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:57,904
So you think
it's the job's fault

678
00:27:57,956 --> 00:27:59,076
that they started to punish?

679
00:27:59,123 --> 00:28:00,323
People don't
arrive broken.

680
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,326
They start with passion
and yearning

681
00:28:03,378 --> 00:28:06,913
till something comes along that
disabuses them of those notions.

682
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,865
Hmm.

683
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:13,419
Which means... that none
of these people did it.

684
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:14,754
Okay. I'm not following.

685
00:28:14,756 --> 00:28:16,339
Well, look at Tim there,

686
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:19,225
with the photos
of his ugly children.

687
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,677
Ivan and his flowerpots.

688
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:23,596
Poor Andrea's still hoping
Destiny's Child

689
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:24,981
get back together.

690
00:28:25,016 --> 00:28:25,982
Don't you see?

691
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:28,734
These people still have hope.

692
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:31,329
Excuse me.

693
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:32,272
Yeah.

694
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:33,694
Who's had this
job the longest?

695
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:34,908
Um...

696
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:36,108
maybe me.

697
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,693
I've been at it
two whole months.

698
00:28:37,745 --> 00:28:39,412
Huh.
Oh. Anyone else?

699
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:40,613
No.

700
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:42,331
Other than Leila, of course.

701
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:43,207
Leila, your boss?

702
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:44,785
Yeah. She stared
as a moderator

703
00:28:44,786 --> 00:28:46,752
before the company blew up.

704
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:48,504
She was the first of us.

705
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,622
Thanks.

706
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:53,125
Leila knew Nick, she had
access to the videos.

707
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:54,544
If she's behind this...

708
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:58,097
She's known what we've been
doing every step of the way.

709
00:28:58,132 --> 00:29:00,967
Dan, I need you to see if
you can trace the videos

710
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:03,719
to one person in
particular now.

711
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:06,405
We're looking
at Leila Simms.

712
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:13,896
I can't believe we had the
killer right under our nose.

713
00:29:13,948 --> 00:29:17,066
And she's gone.

714
00:29:17,118 --> 00:29:19,619
Touché, Leila. Touché.

715
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:30,478
Luci?

716
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:32,990
Luci, you home?

717
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:42,120
He's not here.

718
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:43,955
He left in quite
the hurry before.

719
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,926
Think it was
something I said.

720
00:29:49,196 --> 00:29:52,046
I'm sorry.
Are you his latest, uh...?

721
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:55,266
Trust me,
I'm not his latest anything.

722
00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:57,051
All right.

723
00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:59,220
So, what <i>are</i> you
doing here, then?

724
00:29:59,272 --> 00:30:00,939
I'm having a bit of

725
00:30:00,974 --> 00:30:03,958
an existential crisis,
I suppose.

726
00:30:03,994 --> 00:30:06,644
I've been known
to be a good listener.

727
00:30:06,696 --> 00:30:08,897
Okay.

728
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:10,565
Uh...

729
00:30:10,617 --> 00:30:12,817
I'm having some trouble
with my kids.

730
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,953
Needed to get away from them
for a little bit?

731
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:17,572
No, the opposite, actually.

732
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:19,290
I'm trying
to get closer to them,

733
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:21,659
but I'm not having much luck.

734
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,331
Tell me.

735
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:28,183
Are you a good son?

736
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:31,503
I try to be.

737
00:30:31,555 --> 00:30:34,205
Well, then perhaps
you can explain.

738
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:36,391
Would a good son

739
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:40,478
blindly take his father's side
in a divorce?

740
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:43,314
Would a good son

741
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,850
send his mother to Hell?

742
00:30:45,902 --> 00:30:48,937
And would a good son

743
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:52,157
stand here right before me,

744
00:30:52,192 --> 00:30:56,377
without a care in the world,
plotting to send me back?

745
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:00,832
Mom?

746
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:06,371
I thought I would come to Earth
to be with my sons.

747
00:31:06,423 --> 00:31:10,341
Instead, Lucifer is obsessed
with his human job,

748
00:31:10,377 --> 00:31:12,227
and you're still
your father's loyal soldier.

749
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:16,464
I'm tired of fighting for things
that I'm never gonna have.

750
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:19,717
So just take me back, Amenadiel.

751
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:21,719
I'm ready.

752
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,279
No matter what happens,

753
00:31:31,314 --> 00:31:35,450
I will <i>always...</i> love you.

754
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:37,068
Always.

755
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:42,373
Leila took down
both videos,

756
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:43,992
killed Nick and Adam,
and then led us

757
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:45,994
by the nose until she
had time to escape.

758
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:47,545
Why didn't I
realize it was her?

759
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:49,547
Because as a punisher,
she's quite adept

760
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:50,999
at avoiding
her own medicine.

761
00:31:51,051 --> 00:31:52,600
Quite impressed, really.

762
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:57,505
Hey, Dan.

763
00:31:57,557 --> 00:31:59,841
Yeah, I just saw it.
I'm already working on a trace.

764
00:31:59,843 --> 00:32:01,226
"Judgment Day"? Oh.

765
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:03,561
People should really be careful
how they use that phrase.

766
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:06,180
It isn't actually due
for another couple of years.

767
00:32:06,182 --> 00:32:08,016
She's gonna kill herself
live on the air.

768
00:32:08,068 --> 00:32:10,852
What?
Well, that won't do at all.

769
00:32:10,854 --> 00:32:13,104
How am I supposed
to talk to her if she's dead?

770
00:32:13,156 --> 00:32:15,106
Glad you have
your priorities in order.

771
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:17,442
Thought we were dealing with
someone smart and clever,

772
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:18,693
who tortured with
a brutal sense of irony,

773
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:20,078
but killing herself

774
00:32:20,113 --> 00:32:21,746
whilst humiliating
her company...

775
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:23,748
Doesn't fit the pattern.

776
00:32:23,783 --> 00:32:27,168
Hey, Sharon, can you pull up the
video of Leila driving again?

777
00:32:27,203 --> 00:32:29,287
Yeah. Sure.

778
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:32,290
Pause it there.

779
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:33,486
What are you
looking for, Detective?

780
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,459
Zoom in

781
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:36,177
to the edge of the seat.

782
00:32:36,212 --> 00:32:37,712
Can you go in tighter?

783
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:44,936
Well, I know
images can be deceiving,

784
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:47,388
but that looks an awful lot
like a gun, doesn't it?

785
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,724
Leila's not our killer.

786
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:51,726
She's in danger.

787
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:53,172
You understand this
sicko pretty well.

788
00:32:53,196 --> 00:32:54,896
Where do you
think he's going?

789
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:57,899
Well, somewhere linked
to her sins, I suppose.

790
00:32:57,901 --> 00:32:59,200
We barely know Leila.

791
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:00,955
Who knows what the killer
thinks she's done?

792
00:33:00,987 --> 00:33:02,427
Well, she runs
the company that hosts

793
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:04,956
humanity's worst depravities,
but we know she's not there.

794
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:06,541
Hey, Dan,
how's the trace coming?

795
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:08,271
The I.P. just keeps pinging
back to Wobble's main server.

796
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:10,495
It's got to be
a mistake.

797
00:33:14,668 --> 00:33:17,635
Unless it's not
a mistake at all.

798
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:24,008
You know, if you take
away the blinky lights

799
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,593
and add some lost souls,

800
00:33:25,645 --> 00:33:28,146
this place bares a striking
resemblance to Hell.

801
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:29,719
Shh. Listen.

802
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:34,535
My name is... Leila Simms.

803
00:33:36,323 --> 00:33:39,774
I'm one of
the co-founders of Wobble.

804
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:43,111
I wanted to apologize
to anybody who's watching

805
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:46,114
for... for creating a forum...

806
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:51,002
...where evil and hate
sought a refuge.

807
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:54,005
And there's
Queen Wobble herself.

808
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,124
Yeah, but where's
the killer?

809
00:33:56,176 --> 00:33:58,710
And tonight I go down
with the ship.

810
00:34:00,513 --> 00:34:02,730
Right alongside
all of those awful sins

811
00:34:02,766 --> 00:34:06,534
that-that I helped
give a voice to.

812
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:09,137
Please, please.

813
00:34:09,189 --> 00:34:11,356
P-Please, please.

814
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:13,941
D-Don't make me do this.

815
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:15,860
Please.

816
00:34:21,117 --> 00:34:22,717
There's Ray, the HR rep.

817
00:34:22,752 --> 00:34:26,237
Oh, goodness me,
I should have known.

818
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:28,322
Halitosis--
first sign of evil.

819
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,791
He had all the access
he needed

820
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:32,560
to find his targets
and frame Leila.

821
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:41,569
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him.

822
00:34:41,604 --> 00:34:43,254
If he drops that lighter,
he'll kill her.

823
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:44,672
I don't have a shot.

824
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:02,039
Okay, Detective, this next
part will be much easier

825
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:04,639
if you're not here, so I'm gonna
politely ask you to leave, okay?

826
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:05,807
I'm not going anywhere.

827
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:07,809
We're gonna figure this out.
Just give me a second.

828
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,066
All right, no rush.

829
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:17,319
Whilst you're pondering,
I'm gonna go and have a word

830
00:35:17,321 --> 00:35:18,653
with our killer.

831
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:19,821
That's a great idea.

832
00:35:21,158 --> 00:35:22,824
Sorry, say that again.

833
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,995
I never meant to cause anybody
any pain.

834
00:35:28,165 --> 00:35:30,332
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

835
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:30,969
Yeah.

836
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,337
Hello, Raymond.

837
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:37,672
Hate to, uh,
blow up your spot,

838
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:39,619
but I have a question
to ask you before you complete

839
00:35:39,643 --> 00:35:41,109
this twisted little
mise-en-scene.

840
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:42,410
Stay back.

841
00:35:42,446 --> 00:35:44,763
I swear I will drop this,
and she is dead.

842
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:46,314
Oh, gosh,
there's the halitosis.

843
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,682
It travels, doesn't it?

844
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:49,768
You should really get that
looked at, but first,

845
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,822
indulge me this one
simple query.

846
00:35:53,857 --> 00:35:55,190
Why?

847
00:35:58,095 --> 00:35:59,244
What?

848
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:02,213
Why are you a punisher?

849
00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:04,199
I understand
the longing for justice

850
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:07,202
or the joy
of sweet revenge,

851
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:09,371
but no one's forcing you
to do this,

852
00:36:09,373 --> 00:36:12,240
so why would you
take it upon yourself?

853
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:16,594
Because I couldn't
take it anymore.

854
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,313
All that evil

855
00:36:18,348 --> 00:36:19,547
is constantly spreading.

856
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,049
I had to do something.

857
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:24,569
I had to punish them.

858
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:27,555
You're wrong.

859
00:36:27,557 --> 00:36:29,190
You didn't have
to do anything.

860
00:36:29,226 --> 00:36:30,742
You <i>wanted</i> to punish them.

861
00:36:30,777 --> 00:36:32,394
No, that's not true.

862
00:36:32,446 --> 00:36:34,612
Yes, it started with Nick--
that was impulsive.

863
00:36:34,648 --> 00:36:36,564
But then you got
a taste for blood,

864
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:38,233
and it felt good, didn't it?

865
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:39,451
I was doing my part.

866
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:40,652
You had big plans

867
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:41,736
to go on a vengeance quest

868
00:36:41,738 --> 00:36:43,371
until we came
nipping at your heels,

869
00:36:43,407 --> 00:36:45,874
at which point
poor Leila took the fall.

870
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,242
- An innocent!
- No, you're wrong.

871
00:36:47,294 --> 00:36:48,460
And then what,
you'd stop?

872
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:51,046
Get away Scot-free?

873
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:57,002
We both know you can't stop
because you love it!

874
00:36:57,054 --> 00:36:59,170
Just like the people
you punished.

875
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:00,772
I don't! I...

876
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:07,095
I do.

877
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:13,768
I-I like seeing them
beg for forgiveness.

878
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,904
You see, the difference
between us

879
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:18,857
is that you became
part of the problem, Ray.

880
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:21,743
Someone deserving
punishment.

881
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,246
You're right.

882
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:28,950
I do.

883
00:37:30,454 --> 00:37:32,087
We all do.

884
00:37:33,457 --> 00:37:35,757
No, wait!

885
00:37:52,993 --> 00:37:56,611
Man, you really don't shut up.

886
00:37:56,646 --> 00:37:58,446
Congratulations, Detective.

887
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:01,149
I suppose you could say
I look quite extinguished.

888
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:03,034
Right.

889
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,086
Shall we get you untied?

890
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:10,875
Burning the midnight oil?

891
00:38:10,911 --> 00:38:13,411
Ha, ha, what can I say?

892
00:38:13,463 --> 00:38:15,630
Being everybody's
bitch really sucks.

893
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:17,665
Yeah, well,
it won't last forever.

894
00:38:17,717 --> 00:38:20,802
So I've had some time to think,

895
00:38:20,837 --> 00:38:24,556
and, um... I realize that

896
00:38:24,591 --> 00:38:26,474
I've been really harsh lately.

897
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,475
It's okay...

898
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:29,727
No, let me finish,
please.

899
00:38:29,763 --> 00:38:32,647
I've been really hard on you
for a while now.

900
00:38:32,682 --> 00:38:35,400
And I've been...

901
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:37,602
so upset and so angry.

902
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:41,673
And... I did,
I felt really betrayed.

903
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,491
I know.

904
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:45,577
But I realize you've...

905
00:38:45,612 --> 00:38:47,862
you've been working so hard
to make it right,

906
00:38:47,864 --> 00:38:51,199
and I feel like,
for the sake of Trixie,

907
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:52,884
that we should go on the trip.

908
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,619
You know, we should go,

909
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:57,622
like we always have.

910
00:38:59,593 --> 00:39:00,875
I can't do that.

911
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:03,178
Wh... What do you mean?

912
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:08,149
You were right before.

913
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:11,402
We shouldn't lie
to our daughter.

914
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:13,555
Okay.

915
00:39:15,642 --> 00:39:18,476
Look, I-I'm always gonna be
Trixie's dad.

916
00:39:20,197 --> 00:39:22,780
And I'm always gonna be
part of your lives.

917
00:39:22,816 --> 00:39:26,401
But we've been living
in the past for too long.

918
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,739
We're no, we're no good
for Trixie

919
00:39:31,741 --> 00:39:33,658
if we're no good for each other.

920
00:39:37,581 --> 00:39:40,248
But I think we both
know the truth.

921
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:48,056
It's time we get a divorce.

922
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,526
Hello, Luci.

923
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:14,115
Tell me you didn't do it.

924
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:15,583
Do what?

925
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:16,868
Don't play stupid with me.

926
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,603
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

927
00:40:19,956 --> 00:40:21,506
Easy, Lucifer.

928
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,007
Your brother didn't
send me to Hell,

929
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:24,792
if that's what
you're worried about.

930
00:40:24,794 --> 00:40:27,962
But you were so adamant.

931
00:40:27,964 --> 00:40:29,547
I told you, Lucifer,

932
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,383
a mother's love counts
for more than you think.

933
00:40:32,435 --> 00:40:34,519
My time on Earth
has helped me to realize

934
00:40:34,554 --> 00:40:37,305
that Father has a tendency
to overreact.

935
00:40:37,307 --> 00:40:39,807
So you're going
against Dad?

936
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:43,278
Things change, brother.

937
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:44,896
Do they?

938
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:48,616
Well, I for one am grateful
that we're all just

939
00:40:48,652 --> 00:40:51,986
in the same room, together,
as a family again.

940
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:54,539
Yes, not so fast, Mother.

941
00:40:54,574 --> 00:40:56,324
You see, I did
make a promise,

942
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:58,176
and I am a man of my word.

943
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:00,011
I told you
that you could stay here

944
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:01,379
until I figured out how to

945
00:41:01,414 --> 00:41:03,381
reconcile my
deal with Dad,

946
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:05,333
and now I have.

947
00:41:05,385 --> 00:41:06,834
So you're going to
punish me anyway?

948
00:41:06,836 --> 00:41:08,836
I am, indeed.
And not because

949
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:11,723
I've been brainwashed by Dad
or I'm trying to prove anything.

950
00:41:11,758 --> 00:41:15,677
I punish because I'm good at it.

951
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,812
I like giving people their due.

952
00:41:19,232 --> 00:41:20,648
Makes me happy.

953
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:24,352
I suppose I can't ask
for a better reason.

954
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:28,640
Which brings me
to your sentence.

955
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,527
Mother...

956
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:35,663
you shall remain
right here on Earth

957
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:38,750
amongst the creatures
you so despise...

958
00:41:38,785 --> 00:41:39,968
as one of them.

959
00:41:40,003 --> 00:41:42,003
Wait.

960
00:41:42,038 --> 00:41:43,371
You're going to send me

961
00:41:43,373 --> 00:41:45,707
into the life
of Charlotte Richards?

962
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:47,458
Mm-hmm.

963
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,226
Well, how's that
supposed to work?

964
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,545
Not my problem.

965
00:41:49,546 --> 00:41:51,045
And what if I refuse?

966
00:41:51,097 --> 00:41:53,715
You can't fight this;
you're human now.

967
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:54,966
But that husband...

968
00:41:55,018 --> 00:41:56,184
And there's children, right?

969
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:57,602
They're going to <i>need</i> things.

970
00:41:57,637 --> 00:41:59,470
Oh, I'm counting on it.

971
00:41:59,522 --> 00:42:01,723
But if you truly want
to be with your sons,

972
00:42:01,775 --> 00:42:04,859
then that's the price
that you have to pay.

973
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:17,205
So be it.

974
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:36,758
Your money or your life, bitch.

975
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,726
I-I choose money.

976
00:42:39,596 --> 00:42:41,729
Does anyone choose life?

977
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:42,664
That doesn't very...

978
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:43,932
Come here!

979
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:45,933
I'll give you what you want!
Just hold on.

980
00:42:45,985 --> 00:42:48,019
I said, hold on!
