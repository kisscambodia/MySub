1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:04,647
- Previously on Lucifer...
- I don't care much for my dad.

2
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:07,179
But you clearly... care about yours.

3
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:09,909
I think he would be proud of you.

4
00:00:10,671 --> 00:00:12,308
Uriel, that's Azrael's blade.

5
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,544
You're not planning on
taking Mum back to Hell.

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,879
That weapon will wipe her
out of existence entirely.

7
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,748
No Heaven, no Hell, just...

8
00:00:18,753 --> 00:00:19,803
gone.

9
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:21,684
Why do you feel guilty?

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,886
Uriel didn't just die.

11
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,254
I killed him.

12
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,123
I need you to be honest with me

13
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,658
about who you are.

14
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:29,792
No more lies.

15
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:30,863
Very well.

16
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,532
This is where Lucifer
buried your brother.

17
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,800
Why did he do this?

18
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,669
- Lucifer was just trying...
- No, Mom.

19
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:41,738
Not Lucifer. Father.

20
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:42,872
If he wanted to, he could have

21
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,841
prevented all of this from happening.

22
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:48,347
I'm done trying to please
someone who isn't even here.

23
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,503
What the hell?!

24
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:16,408
Aah! Get off me!

25
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,308
Help!

26
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,011
Help...!

27
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,046
Stop! Stop!

28
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,819
- Leave her alone!
- Hey, man, stop!

29
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:35,760
Wait. It's you?

30
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:37,428
You're kidding me, right?

31
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,300
We can totally work this out.

32
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:56,080
And so there we were,
the detective and I,

33
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:58,650
standing in her kitchen, and...

34
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:01,085
she made me...

35
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,087
a sandwich.

36
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:09,193
I believe this is the
part where you tell me

37
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:12,166
it's much more than just a sandwich.

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,667
For example...

39
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:18,397
maybe it was a gesture of intimacy.

40
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:20,750
You know, the slices of
bread representing, perhaps,

41
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:22,405
the detective's trust.

42
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,875
Or... was it a mistrustful sandwich?

43
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,943
I...

44
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:28,644
Doctor, please,

45
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,317
what delicious message
was she sending me?

46
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,916
What about Hitler?

47
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,085
The sandwich is Hitler?

48
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,455
How did you actually
torture Hitler in Hell?

49
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,924
I mean, is his cell next to Idi Amin's?

50
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,192
Or Mussolini's?

51
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,461
Or is there kind of a-a-a...

52
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,630
a tyrant wing in Hell?

53
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,065
Right.

54
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,583
I suppose it was futile of me
to think that you wouldn't want

55
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:54,684
to discuss the whole...
"I'm really the Devil" thing.

56
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,306
The actual Devil?

57
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:00,276
Look, I have to say...

58
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,378
I was worried I'd never see you again.

59
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,713
I thought I'd...

60
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:05,615
- scared you off for good.
- Yes,

61
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,750
well, Maze, of all people...

62
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:10,152
well, of all...

63
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,954
demons...

64
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,190
gave me some needed clarity.

65
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,691
Did she, now?

66
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,533
Yes. Right. Well,

67
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:19,424
speaking of clarity,
do you mind if we return

68
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,713
to my current emotional growth?

69
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:22,465
Oh. Yes.

70
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,543
Sorry.

71
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:25,034
Apology accepted.

72
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,469
So, um...

73
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:29,375
what do you think it means?

74
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:31,874
What about my Uncle Edwin?

75
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,076
Is he down there?
I mean, 'cause he was...

76
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,311
you know....

77
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,880
one... he was one bad mama jama.

78
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,182
I think I've
broken my therapist.

79
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,518
And now she's somewhere to
the left of totally useless

80
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,420
and to the right of babbling lunatic.

81
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,455
Oh, so she's you in a skirt.

82
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,357
Very funny. This is serious, Detective.

83
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,192
I'm actually a bit worried for her.

84
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,661
Hmm, I'm sure she'll be fine,

85
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,963
but if you need anyone
to talk to, I'm here.

86
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,065
This is actually something
I can't discuss with you.

87
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,566
What? I'm sure I can handle it.

88
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,168
I've seen all your ugly parts by now.

89
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,436
Not even close, I'm afraid.

90
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,904
Saved by the Douche.

91
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,206
Our victim's name is Maddie Howard.

92
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,375
She was attacked when
she left her apartment.

93
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,910
The assailant chased her down the alley

94
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,445
and stabbed her repeatedly.

95
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,047
19 times, to be exact.

96
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,762
Overkill is usually a
crime of passion... they probably

97
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:14,544
knew each other.

98
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:16,020
She was killed in broad daylight?

99
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:17,386
- There must have been witnesses.
- Yeah,

100
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,921
a bunch, but depending on who you ask,

101
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,589
the killer was a male
who's either Hispanic,

102
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,259
Caucasian or black, short or tall,
brown or blond hair,

103
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:24,860
or completely bald.

104
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,796
So we're dealing with a shapeshifter.

105
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,098
Well, eyewitness testimonies
can be unreliable.

106
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,534
Yeah, people's ojos go a little loco.

107
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,303
Evidence, however, does not lie.

108
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:37,073
We got substantial bruising to the skin,

109
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:40,376
blade penetrated not only
soft tissue but also bone.

110
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,511
So the killer was big and strong.

111
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:46,186
Also, blond head hair,
so odds are really good

112
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:48,150
- we're looking for a white guy.
- Hey, guys.

113
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,992
Got something over here.
Tourist caught the beginning moments

114
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:52,703
of the attack in the
background of a photo.

115
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:53,759
Did you get a look at the killer?

116
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:55,723
No, but look at this...
we got a good look at the weapon.

117
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:59,293
Pretty insane. Looks like
a movie prop or something.

118
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,041
Can't be.

119
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,695
What do you mean, "Can't be"?

120
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,365
A movie prop. Those things
are rubber, aren't they?

121
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,799
What?

122
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:07,571
I have to go.

123
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:19,146
I don't really have time
for a hike, Lucifer.

124
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:22,049
Bounty business is booming, okay?

125
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:23,260
So this better be important.

126
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:24,888
It is.

127
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,560
Is this...?

128
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,697
Where Lucifer buried Uriel. Yeah.

129
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,234
Okay.

130
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:42,274
So if you two want to cry it out,
I'll be in the car.

131
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:45,494
What's happened, Lucifer?

132
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,313
- Well, someone dug up the grave.
- Yeah,

133
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:48,614
I can see that.

134
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:50,816
But why?

135
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:52,919
- Uriel's body is still there.
- Yes,

136
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:55,124
but Azrael's blade isn't.

137
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:01,694
I believe the weapon
of the Angel of Death

138
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,308
is in human hands.

139
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,398
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

140
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:27,022
So let me get this straight:
in human hands, Azrael's blade

141
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:28,276
wants to kill?

142
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:30,312
It demands to be used to...

143
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:32,314
- to fulfill its purpose.
- Humans are more...

144
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,837
malleable than we are,
so it whispers in their ears,

145
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,876
beckons to be held... it takes any
reason someone might want

146
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:40,634
- to hurt another and...
- Amplifies it

147
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,990
- a thousandfold.
- So if someone

148
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:43,158
leaves the toilet seat up...

149
00:06:43,163 --> 00:06:44,893
Trip to stabby town, yes.

150
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:47,129
That's one angry-ass knife.

151
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:48,163
Yes, well,

152
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:50,599
it was stolen from the Angel of Death.

153
00:06:50,604 --> 00:06:52,452
Sis is no sweet peach, is she?

154
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:53,902
Listen, we're wasting time here.

155
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,036
We need to find the blade.

156
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,371
Why?

157
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,306
So a few meter maids
bite the dust, who cares?

158
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,941
People off each other all the time.

159
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:02,144
No, Maze, you don't understand.

160
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:03,945
This will accelerate.

161
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,048
Passing from human to human,
leaving an unimaginable trail

162
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,683
of destruction in its wake.

163
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:11,353
Yes, nasty little thing.

164
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:12,868
We need to retrieve it.

165
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:16,658
Oh, I'm so glad you're on
board with this, Luci.

166
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:18,894
I mean, who would've thought
that bringing celestial objects

167
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:21,796
to Earth might lead to such destruction?

168
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,298
Ooh, I like the smug.

169
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:24,766
Much sexier than the earnest.

170
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,434
I'm just surprised that
you would actually take

171
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,792
a little bit of responsibility.

172
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:29,638
I thought an unmarked grave
in the middle of nowhere

173
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:30,639
would be safe enough.

174
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,374
Clearly I was wrong.

175
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:34,943
But... I clean up my messes.

176
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:39,414
Well, good luck, you two.

177
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,852
You'll want to help, Maze.

178
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:43,040
No, thanks.

179
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:46,054
Let me remind you, I have a job.

180
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:49,391
And let me remind you that the
blade doesn't just kill humans.

181
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:51,726
It also obliterates celestial beings,

182
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,268
including demons.

183
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:55,664
So, say the detective were to
find it and bring it home...

184
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,882
I get snuffed out for
not doing the dishes.

185
00:07:57,907 --> 00:08:00,936
Which is why the detective can't
be part of this investigation.

186
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:05,273
Now, I'll need you two
to move Uriel's body.

187
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:08,413
Somewhere it won't be found this time.

188
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:12,228
Very well.

189
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:13,949
And one note,

190
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:15,984
you're to do so without
disturbing the grave site

191
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:18,957
in the slightest,
specifically that footprint there.

192
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:20,595
Why?

193
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,928
Because I'm going to get an
expert to help me examine it.

194
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:28,530
You need a favor?

195
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:32,801
Yes, your scientific expertise
on a discreet matter.

196
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:33,868
Mm.

197
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:35,170
Paternity test?

198
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:37,709
What? Do I look like someone
who'd be so irresponsible?

199
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,009
Uh, regardless, if you
do this favor for me,

200
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:43,119
then I'll do a favor for you in return.

201
00:08:43,144 --> 00:08:43,912
Lucifer,

202
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:47,624
the whole point of a favor
is to do it for free, okay?

203
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:50,986
And then you just trust the love
will come back to you somehow.

204
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:52,387
Favors are about faith.

205
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:54,789
Ugh. Please don't ruin favors for me.

206
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:55,924
Look, come on, I insist.

207
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:56,925
Tit for tat.

208
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,929
Fine, um...

209
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:03,732
Well, there is something
that I would like.

210
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:04,733
Mm?

211
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:07,068
But I'm not sure you can handle it.

212
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:09,437
Oh, well, now I'm intrigued.

213
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:11,106
I mean, it might be a little...

214
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:13,675
inappropriate among colleagues.

215
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,710
Oh, right, even better.

216
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:17,479
Well, why don't you, uh...

217
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:19,247
Well... Okay, so...

218
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:21,686
Oh.

219
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,125
Oh, no, no.

220
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,092
Definitely not.

221
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:32,894
You're the one who wanted tit for tat.

222
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,799
Yes, if only
it were that simple.

223
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:39,801
All right, fine.

224
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:41,703
You have a deal.

225
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,938
Gosh, you're a nasty
little nerd, aren't you?

226
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,017
Right. Here we are.

227
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:58,644
Does your favor involve killing me?

228
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:01,389
I'm just kidding, no.

229
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,224
I need you to do your forensic whatnots

230
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:05,994
and work out what disturbed this area.

231
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:08,072
Uh, you mean this empty grave?

232
00:10:08,097 --> 00:10:09,064
Look,

233
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:11,232
you said to me that favors
were about faith, right?

234
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:12,189
Yeah.

235
00:10:12,214 --> 00:10:14,369
Well, I'm asking you to have faith in me.

236
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:16,838
And know that I wouldn't ask
anything untoward of you.

237
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:20,709
You know, when you use my own
words against me like that,

238
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:22,896
it's actually really hard to say no.

239
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:23,778
I know.

240
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,947
There's some very interesting
footprints over there.

241
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:30,385
Well, it looks like we
got a man's sneaker.

242
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,721
Okay, I'll take a mold, but assuming

243
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:34,889
it's one of the major brands,
I mean, you're looking at a pool

244
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:37,258
of, like, two million dudes in L.A.

245
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:40,028
Maybe 10,000 robust ladies.

246
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:42,864
Well, I was hoping for something
a little more specific.

247
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:46,334
Thai's not how analytical science works.

248
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,037
Whoa.

249
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,875
Someone tried to burn something.

250
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:55,043
It looks like there's writing on one s...

251
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:57,212
side.

252
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:59,714
Yeah, I should be able to
reconstruct this at the lab.

253
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,349
Ah, excellent.

254
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:03,885
Right, whilst you do that,
I'll get back to the detective.

255
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,653
Oh, and remember...

256
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:07,088
Yeah, don't tell anyone

257
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:09,524
about your super creepy non-grave grave.

258
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,929
Got it.

259
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:17,276
So you worked
here with the deceased?

260
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,967
We didn't just work together.

261
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,302
I mean, Maddie was a friend.

262
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:24,239
The person who introduced
me to the Glory Way.

263
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:28,435
God, I can't believe that she's dead.

264
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,744
I'm sorry. The glory what?

265
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:30,945
The glory hole.

266
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,946
The Glory Way.

267
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:33,181
- Ah.
- Developed by

268
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:35,450
our guru, Jenson Glory.

269
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:39,487
The Glory Way is a mind
and body sensibility system

270
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,890
designed to reveal what we call

271
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:43,625
the "home you."

272
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,860
Right. Do people actually believe

273
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,395
the word salad that you're selling?

274
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,563
'Cause, I mean, look,

275
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:50,732
I enjoy a taut, spandex-wrapped backside

276
00:11:50,737 --> 00:11:52,233
as much as the next chap,

277
00:11:52,238 --> 00:11:54,869
but that was one large helping
of spiritual gobbledy-gook.

278
00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:58,750
Follow Jenson's teachings and you
will uncover your true self.

279
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:02,110
And what if your true self is a 400-pound
nimrod with flatulence issues?

280
00:12:02,115 --> 00:12:05,547
Just saying. Some things
are better left buried.

281
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,449
Given the specifics of the murder,

282
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:10,685
we're looking for someone who
had a real hatred for Maddie.

283
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,220
Does anyone come to mind?

284
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:16,213
No. Maddie was a wholesome
soul, a true light.

285
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:17,792
What about petty grievances?

286
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:19,461
Perhaps Maddie drank
someone's probiotic smoothie

287
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:22,030
or did one too many peacock
poses for someone's taste?

288
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:23,231
- Lucifer.
- No.

289
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:24,699
Just... think.

290
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:27,013
There must be some little disagreements.

291
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,501
So why don't you write us up a list?

292
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:31,003
Anyone who so much as raised
a patchouli-scented eyebrow

293
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:32,972
in Maddie's direction
could be the killer.

294
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,643
- See...
- Excuse us.

295
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,744
That's not the profile

296
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:39,545
of the murderer we're investigating.

297
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,180
I'm just being thorough, Detective.

298
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:44,751
Like you said, "Shake the bushes
until the truth flies free."

299
00:12:44,756 --> 00:12:46,619
I don't think I've ever said that before.

300
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:48,299
- No?
- Uh-uh.

301
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:50,857
Oh. Perhaps it was Ms. Lopez.

302
00:12:50,862 --> 00:12:54,127
Mm. You've been spending
a lot of time with Ella.

303
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,329
You know, working together, I mean.

304
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:58,531
Not particularly.

305
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:00,166
Hmm.

306
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:02,368
Shall we see how this list is getting on?

307
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,871
Mm-hmm.

308
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,309
Glad to see you're hard at work.

309
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:14,247
You know, studies show that the
brain does some of its best work

310
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,481
when it's not trying.

311
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:17,950
That's why great ideas come in the shower.

312
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:19,471
- For me, it's usually women.
- Hmm.

313
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:21,220
Any progress so far?

314
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:22,688
- Damn straight.
- Hmm.

315
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:23,823
I...

316
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:27,160
rehydrated that burnt piece of paper

317
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:28,657
we found at your super creepy place

318
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,329
using polyvinyl acetate.

319
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:33,032
- Oh, it's easy for you to say.
- I ran these pieces

320
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:34,534
through a pattern recognition program,

321
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,169
and I found two things.

322
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:39,505
First...

323
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,575
what looks to be a map

324
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,545
leading from downtown L.A. to
that exact spot you took me to.

325
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,181
Right. What was the second thing?

326
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:50,783
Some business logo of a law firm.

327
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,922
What law firm?

328
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:00,296
Bloody hell.

329
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:08,034
I said no interruptions, so unless

330
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,036
you're that broad-shouldered
intern from this morning...

331
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,637
Hello, Mum.

332
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,139
Oh.

333
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,473
Hello, son.

334
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,912
It appears you've been busy.

335
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:33,250
I was getting bored with
my mate and offspring,

336
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:36,220
so I thought I'd dive into my employment.

337
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,822
Not that hard once you
read the law books.

338
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:39,990
What law books?

339
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:41,391
Well, all of them.

340
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:42,659
Took less than a weekend

341
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,461
with time to teach the hubby

342
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,929
new tricks.

343
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:49,466
Have you ever heard of something
called the reverse cowgirl?

344
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,968
Well, I'm thrilled,

345
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,336
Mum, really, I am.

346
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:55,852
Here you are studying law
and the Kama Sutra.

347
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:59,312
And drawing maps to Uriel's grave!

348
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:04,882
Did someone find the blade?

349
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:07,451
Oh, so you admit that
you led a human to it?

350
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:09,386
Well, not a human. More like ten.

351
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:11,388
- Ten?
- Maybe 12. Uh...

352
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:12,618
- But...
- 15?

353
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:14,091
Only my craftiest clients.

354
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:15,940
I mean, I had to make sure
that someone would actually

355
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:18,028
follow through and dig the damn thing up.

356
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,497
Why in the world would you tell people?

357
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,032
What is wrong with you?!

358
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:24,601
Me? If you didn't want the blade found,

359
00:15:24,606 --> 00:15:27,004
you shouldn't have left it
in a hole in the ground!

360
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,973
A filled-in hole in the
middle of nowhere,

361
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:33,477
which no one would've possibly
found if not for you.

362
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,946
Yes. Well... there's that.

363
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:38,315
Besides, where else am I gonna hide it?

364
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,785
Lux? You know how many people
traipse through there each week?

365
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,887
Well, I don't know. Your bedroom, then.

366
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,622
- Worse.
- Yes.

367
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:46,890
You are sexually prolific.

368
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,561
Turns out, you get that from me.

369
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,663
Oh, Mum, why?

370
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:57,634
Why would you release
Azrael's blade into the world?

371
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:03,910
Because I wanted to get
your father's attention.

372
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:07,584
Your brother,

373
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:11,148
Uriel... my son... died.

374
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:13,750
Do you think it's crazy that
I wanted to talk about it?

375
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:15,485
Mourn with him, maybe?!

376
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,121
- I...
- So I reached out,

377
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:20,157
and guess what I got back.

378
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:21,992
- Nothing.
- Yes.

379
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:23,627
Like always.

380
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:27,998
So I figured that if his toys
started stabbing each other

381
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:31,501
with a celestial blade, that maybe
he might take a moment.

382
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:33,470
Humans are dying because of you.

383
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:34,938
Well, humans die.

384
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:36,340
They all do eventually.

385
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,141
It's what they were designed to do.

386
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:40,347
Yes, but not like this.

387
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,917
Your vacation here has changed you.

388
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,152
You seem attached to these creatures,

389
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:54,992
and I can't, for the life of me,
figure out why.

390
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:59,096
Look, you say you want
to stay here on Earth,

391
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,932
to live with your sons, right?

392
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:06,303
So, a choice: willingly help
me get the blade back,

393
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:10,744
or I'll send Maze over here
to give you some inspiration.

394
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,846
Hmm. Fine.

395
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:17,915
You're killing my reverse cowgirl high.

396
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,217
I...

397
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:22,152
LAPD

398
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,254
investigation, that's right.

399
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:28,158
Uh, just your whereabouts
around 7:00 a.m. this morning.

400
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:30,127
Okay. Can you prove that?

401
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,062
Right.

402
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:33,497
Thank you.

403
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:34,898
So the guy that complained

404
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:36,733
Maddie didn't have enough
cool-down time was

405
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:39,703
at an ashram in Sedona, so, not our guy.

406
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,638
My pudding's gone.

407
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,899
I'm sorry?

408
00:17:42,924 --> 00:17:44,541
In the break room fridge, my pudding...

409
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:46,310
Clearly labeled "Dan"... It's gone.

410
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,111
Not the first time, either.

411
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:50,881
Wow. Do you want me
to put some unis on it?

412
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:52,235
Want me to schedule a stakeout?

413
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,363
- Are you even okay?
- No, Chloe.

414
00:17:53,387 --> 00:17:55,939
I'm just saying that a man's snacks...
they're sacred, okay?

415
00:17:55,964 --> 00:17:57,900
- Okay.
- What up, detective people?

416
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:00,190
- Hey.
- Hey.

417
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:03,060
Are Lucifer and Ella working on
a case that I don't know about?

418
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,728
Mm. Why?

419
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:08,999
No reason, they just seem to be
spending a lot of time together.

420
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,702
Is someone jealous?

421
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:12,703
What?

422
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,004
No.

423
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,105
No way.

424
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,074
- Gross.
- 'Cause you can tell me if you are.

425
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,176
I mean...

426
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,144
we can be there for
each other, as friends.

427
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:23,714
Even... even if it's about another guy.

428
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:26,183
Right, but Lucifer's not another guy.

429
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,417
He's a weirdo.

430
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,252
This is about partnership, nothing more.

431
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:30,487
Partners don't keep secrets.

432
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:31,822
Well, maybe with Ella,

433
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:33,657
it's more than just sex, maybe it's...

434
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:34,925
a little more serious.

435
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,693
Huh?

436
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,695
No, it's not like Lucifer...
I don't think he...

437
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,467
"Not like Lucifer" wha-what?

438
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,668
Likes poker.

439
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,336
Dan has a monthly game.

440
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:47,771
Oh, no, I love a good gamble.

441
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:48,739
Count me in.

442
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:50,240
Right, where's that list of grievances

443
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:51,541
against poor Maddie?

444
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:52,743
- Oh, it's the...
- Yeah.

445
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:55,047
- There... all right, there you go.
- Lovely, thank you.

446
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:56,243
Why would you do that?

447
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,881
Okay, now you're making it weird.
You're making it weird.

448
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,883
- You're making it weirder.
- Sorry.

449
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,852
I'll make it weird on your face.

450
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:04,154
Duncan Watts is our killer.

451
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:05,422
What makes you say that?

452
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:06,693
Well, just a hunch.

453
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,961
Duncan Watts.

454
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,237
His offices are upstairs
above the yoga studio.

455
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:15,512
Oh, and he's Maddie and
Corrina's landlord.

456
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:18,668
Duncan was apparently upset
that Maddie kept parking in his spot.

457
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:19,936
He also tried

458
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,938
to have the yoga studio
evicted a few months ago.

459
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:24,241
Neither of which is really
a reason for 19 stabs.

460
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,576
Yes, but just look at his
stabby mug, hmm?

461
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:29,513
Blond hair, thick neck, which
suggests Cro-Magnon strength.

462
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:31,782
Just as our dear Ella guesstimated.

463
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,483
Ah, "dear Ella," hmm.

464
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:34,518
Where you going?

465
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:36,353
I'm just off to see this Duncan chap.

466
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:37,052
No.

467
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:39,656
We will go together like partners, okay?

468
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:43,138
Right, yes, I-I just need to
make a quick phone call first.

469
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:45,880
Oh, okay. No worries.

470
00:19:45,905 --> 00:19:47,697
Private phone call, Detective.

471
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:49,299
Just give me a moment.

472
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:50,937
Yeah, sure.

473
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:53,904
You sure this is the right place?

474
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:55,305
Duncan Watts, Maze.

475
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,410
That's the name Lucifer gave me.

476
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:06,650
I got nothing.

477
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,151
Yeah, me neither.

478
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:11,154
Even if we find the blade,
it's a temporary fix.

479
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,522
Your mom is the problem.

480
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,592
She released the blade to create chaos,

481
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,694
and you two respond by coddling her.

482
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:19,563
Nobody's coddling her, all right?

483
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,231
Tell yourself whatever you want,

484
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:24,534
but you know it's true,
and it explains a lot.

485
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,303
Explains what?

486
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,773
Doesn't really matter anymore,

487
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:33,443
but, just so you know,
this whole mama's boy thing?

488
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:35,412
Kind of a turnoff.

489
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:36,947
Oh, yeah?

490
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:38,815
Well, your whole "skintight leather,

491
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,050
hot body everywhere" thing?

492
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:43,320
- Mm-hmm?
- It's really not that...

493
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:47,524
It's not... it's not that-that great.

494
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,227
Yeah, it is.

495
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:53,797
They're here.

496
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:56,603
Yeah, we should probably warn Lucifer.

497
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,874
Well? There's no blade.

498
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:05,775
Right, use the back way out.

499
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:09,479
Ah, Detective,

500
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:11,081
you know, after reflection,
I think you're right.

501
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:13,644
Parking space thievery
is no motive for murder.

502
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:15,565
What is going on with you?

503
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,920
First, you're so eager to get here,

504
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:19,322
you practically jump out of
my car before I've parked,

505
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:20,557
and now you want to leave.

506
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:22,058
What are you hiding?

507
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:24,694
Hiding? What would I be hiding?

508
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:26,329
Blood.

509
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:29,135
What?

510
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:40,610
This is Unit 831 requesting backup.

511
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:43,750
Soul Depot, 15534 Hillgreen Drive.

512
00:21:57,732 --> 00:21:59,529
It's Duncan.

513
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:01,668
Oh, must've been some parking space.

514
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,638
Uh, Detective.

515
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:10,473
Yeah.

516
00:22:10,478 --> 00:22:14,214
Seems this class took
corpse pose quite literally.

517
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,133
So, no sign of the murder weapon?

518
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:38,367
Uh-uh.

519
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:39,869
Are you sure?

520
00:22:39,874 --> 00:22:42,872
Right. Nothing left for us to
do here then, I suppose.

521
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:45,341
Except for figuring out
how six people were killed.

522
00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:47,604
I'm thinking the primary
killer was Duncan.

523
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:49,712
Killing Maddie didn't satiate his anger,

524
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:52,648
so he went after her clients
and probably got stabbed

525
00:22:52,653 --> 00:22:54,250
when one of them defended themselves.

526
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:55,852
I doubt it. More likely
the weapon was passed

527
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:57,220
from one person to the next

528
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:58,988
in a game of murderous hot potato.

529
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:00,156
That's insane.

530
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:01,524
I know, right?

531
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:04,927
Totally insane and probably
exactly what happened.

532
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:07,063
I say this with huge respect for the dead,

533
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:08,898
but this case is totally gonna be a panel

534
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:10,066
at the next forensic conference.

535
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:11,934
Okay. So based on my preliminary

536
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:13,269
assessment of the wounds,

537
00:23:13,274 --> 00:23:16,239
it looks like Duncan
came through the door,

538
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:18,741
attacked victim number
two with the same weapon

539
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:19,942
used to kill Maddie Howard.

540
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:22,545
But Duncan had ligature
marks on his neck,

541
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,380
like someone strangled him

542
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:25,915
from behind with a yoga strap.

543
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,783
Like... this, here.

544
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:29,118
- Oh.
- Right?

545
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:31,053
Which is when he attacked

546
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:33,322
victim number three.

547
00:23:33,327 --> 00:23:35,892
But victim number three
had defensive wounds

548
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:37,293
that matched skin flecks

549
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:39,228
under the fingernails of number four,

550
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,630
so I'm thinking Duncan

551
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:42,231
dropped the knife...

552
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:45,835
Okay, number four picked it up, right?

553
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,054
Attacked number three, like this.

554
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,806
Right, and then at some point,

555
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:52,675
number five got involved.

556
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,244
And so on and so on,
until full yoga massacre.

557
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:57,213
Oh, that will be what the panel's called,

558
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:58,447
Full Yoga Massacre

559
00:23:58,452 --> 00:24:00,049
- 2016.
- Very good.

560
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:02,018
Okay, so, say that all happened
like you just said it did,

561
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,386
which is crazy.

562
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:05,388
There are seven mats and seven bodies.

563
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:06,689
Yeah. So?

564
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:08,558
So Duncan was the pissed off landlord,

565
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:09,926
not the class attendee.

566
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:12,128
Subtract him, we're missing one yogi.

567
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,496
Okay, well, all of the
bodies were situated

568
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:17,436
around these six mats...
The student mats.

569
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:23,105
So that could be the
teacher's mat, maybe.

570
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,041
The teacher must have been here.

571
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,109
Get this.

572
00:24:27,114 --> 00:24:28,978
Teacher training taught by

573
00:24:28,983 --> 00:24:31,080
Jenson Glory himself.

574
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:32,048
I mean,

575
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,416
his body's not among the dead.

576
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:34,850
Could be our missing victim.

577
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:36,956
Slash attacker.

578
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:41,557
Guy's a piece of work.

579
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:44,427
Jenson Glory, his real
name is Jamie Ostrowski.

580
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:46,696
Soul Depot is the latest
in a long line of

581
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,531
failed fitness enterprises.

582
00:24:48,536 --> 00:24:50,666
Glory has five fraud lawsuits,

583
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:53,135
two sexual harassment
claims working their way

584
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,170
through the court system.

585
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:56,739
Sexual harassment?

586
00:24:56,744 --> 00:24:58,207
Yeah, former assistants.

587
00:24:58,212 --> 00:24:59,408
Both beautiful young women,

588
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:00,409
like Maddie.

589
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:02,211
Oh, and look at the
contract that they sign

590
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:03,879
when students join Soul Depot.

591
00:25:03,884 --> 00:25:06,215
"I surrender myself to Soul Depot,

592
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,617
body, mind and soul,

593
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:09,752
and to the only true guru
of health and serenity,

594
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:11,921
Jenson Glory." Wow.

595
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,089
Pretty much a cult.

596
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,357
Think he brainwashed his students

597
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:16,525
into a Jonestown type thing?

598
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,294
Kind of a stretch, right?

599
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:19,695
That a yoga pun?

600
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,265
No. It's an honest question.

601
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,701
I mean, drinking cyanide
juice is one thing,

602
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:28,137
but a bunch of people
stabbing each other?

603
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:29,972
Totally insane!

604
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:32,475
A magic blade in Los Angeles

605
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,378
which belongs to the Angel of Death?

606
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:37,747
Now, in the hands of a yogi shyster

607
00:25:37,752 --> 00:25:40,349
who's apparently touchy-feely
in more ways than one.

608
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:41,751
Okay, can we go back

609
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:43,386
to the Angel of Death?

610
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:44,954
Is he... uh,

611
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,455
is he another one of your brothers?

612
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,224
Sister, actually.

613
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:50,960
The Angel of Death is a chick?

614
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:51,961
Yes, I sort of wish we were

615
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:53,362
back to talking in metaphors.

616
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,331
- That makes two of us.
- Because I do actually

617
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:57,433
have things that I'd like to
talk about, Doctor.

618
00:25:57,438 --> 00:25:59,635
Oh. Oh, yes. I'm so sorry.

619
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,903
Yes. Please.

620
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:02,305
Right.

621
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,974
So, my mum asked me why I care so much

622
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:06,208
about these people dying

623
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:09,078
and I'm not sure I know.

624
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:12,148
I mean, it's not like
I know them personally,

625
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,716
and Maze is right...

626
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:16,352
Even without Azrael's blade,
humans are capricious.

627
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:17,753
Hell,

628
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:19,322
they're willing to trade their souls

629
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,190
to lose unsightly tummy fat, but...

630
00:26:21,195 --> 00:26:24,134
So...

631
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,395
why should I feel bad?

632
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,663
Why should I feel responsible?

633
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:29,065
And... why

634
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,866
am I doing my own therapy?

635
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:33,069
Lucifer, I'm sorry.

636
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:35,271
I'm trying to digest this whole thing

637
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:37,373
myself. And, well,

638
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:41,544
there is no listing in the DSM-5
for Azrael's Blade Anxiety.

639
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:42,712
Oh.

640
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:44,516
Excuse me.

641
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:46,662
_

642
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:47,950
Ah,

643
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:50,653
the guru with the doo-doo
juju has been picked up.

644
00:26:50,658 --> 00:26:53,025
So, I'm afraid that's all
we've got time for today.

645
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:58,430
Just... call me if you need to reschedule.

646
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:01,630
I wasn't even at the studio, actually.

647
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:03,833
That's not what the schedule says.

648
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:05,935
May I have a tea?

649
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,140
Siberian ginseng if you have it.

650
00:27:09,543 --> 00:27:10,740
Well...

651
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:12,441
Hello, Richard Simmons.

652
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:13,609
Sorry I'm late.

653
00:27:13,614 --> 00:27:15,010
Where's the knife?

654
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:17,780
Who is this tense man?

655
00:27:17,785 --> 00:27:19,048
Okay,

656
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:20,416
back to the teacher training class.

657
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:22,017
Can you prove that you weren't there?

658
00:27:22,022 --> 00:27:24,120
Of course, there's a computer system...

659
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,088
All of the teachers have
to swipe a key card.

660
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:27,890
Even me. Check it.

661
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:29,558
So, where were you?

662
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:30,993
Home.

663
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:33,362
I missed the last few classes, actually.

664
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:35,698
I've been... sick.

665
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:37,800
Obsessing over a new toy, more like.

666
00:27:37,805 --> 00:27:39,263
What are you talking about?

667
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:41,637
I'm talking about something
that's probably beckoning you

668
00:27:41,642 --> 00:27:42,972
as we speak.

669
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:44,306
Whispering to you

670
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:46,075
to do terrible things.

671
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,480
Wretched, sinful deeds.

672
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,481
That... that's true...

673
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:53,516
I-I want...

674
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:55,151
Go on, tell me. Tell me what you want,

675
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:57,019
what you really, really want.

676
00:27:57,024 --> 00:27:58,457
I want...

677
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,858
a raspberry cream cheese muffin.

678
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:04,560
And... and-and

679
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:06,056
to take this thing...

680
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:07,062
off!

681
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:08,731
- Oh, my...
- Oh.

682
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:10,166
Expecting twins, are we?

683
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:12,835
Hey, I backslid a little bit, all right?

684
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,770
Carbs are the Devil's spawn, man.

685
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:16,372
Don't blame your weaknesses on me.

686
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:18,140
- Huh?
- Is that why you didn't show up

687
00:28:18,145 --> 00:28:19,875
to the class? Because you gained weight?

688
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,478
Of course. No one's gonna
find their "home self"

689
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:25,043
from a guru who looks like
he ate all the furniture.

690
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:26,415
Well, I think I'd rather be chubby

691
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,951
than a handsy dipstick in a corset.

692
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:30,186
That's it.

693
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:32,354
I want my lawyer now.

694
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:34,256
Well, don't eat him.

695
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:41,363
All right, listen,
we searched Glory's house,

696
00:28:41,368 --> 00:28:43,466
his car, his other car...

697
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,167
there is no blade.

698
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:47,039
We did find a safe in the basement.

699
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,575
Pop-Tarts.

700
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,577
Which... you stole?

701
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:55,978
Ah, I figured it's a win-win.

702
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:58,314
I'm saving the evil guru from future fat,

703
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,281
and, you know,

704
00:28:59,286 --> 00:29:01,420
Pop-Tarts.

705
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,087
Mr. Glory has a second home in Ventura.

706
00:29:05,092 --> 00:29:06,589
If you wouldn't mind.

707
00:29:06,594 --> 00:29:07,623
Okay, we'll check it out,

708
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:09,425
but...

709
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,960
Luci, if he's the one with the blade,

710
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,998
he's much more likely
to go on a killing spree

711
00:29:13,023 --> 00:29:14,322
than to stash it.

712
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:29,912
Ah. Come back for
your processed pastries?

713
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:32,147
Ms. Lopez!

714
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:33,949
Well, this is a surprise.

715
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:35,551
Have you found something new?

716
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:38,521
Oh, I found something all right.

717
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,523
Proof of Bigfoot?

718
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,157
Tread on the shoes Duncan
Watts was wearing

719
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:43,626
when he was found dead.

720
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:45,027
Tread that you showed me

721
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:47,763
at your super weirdo hole in the ground.

722
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:51,000
They match, which means that this case

723
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:52,001
and your favor

724
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:53,702
are connected.

725
00:29:53,707 --> 00:29:55,207
Start talkin', dude.

726
00:30:07,383 --> 00:30:09,368
Do you have something to do
with these murders?

727
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:13,868
Come clean with me.

728
00:30:13,873 --> 00:30:15,936
Or I can't keep this a secret anymore.

729
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,305
You see, that's just it.

730
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,341
The last person I came clean with

731
00:30:20,346 --> 00:30:21,942
became a tad untethered.

732
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,044
Dude, I grew up in Detroit.

733
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:25,045
Look,

734
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,047
all I can tell you is

735
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:29,617
I'm dealing with a matter
of cosmic importance

736
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:32,586
and I ask you to indulge me
for just a little longer.

737
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:33,587
You mean have faith?

738
00:30:33,592 --> 00:30:36,193
Tomato, tomahto.

739
00:30:37,196 --> 00:30:39,093
Well, I guess faith isn't faith

740
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:40,294
unless it's tested.

741
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,596
Bring it in.

742
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:44,935
What? Oh.

743
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:52,273
- Ella.
- Detective.

744
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:53,741
Oh, um...

745
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:55,743
I was just...

746
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:57,678
uh, you see,

747
00:30:57,683 --> 00:31:00,381
there's this, uh,
store that has really special...

748
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:01,313
soap.

749
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:03,111
And, you know,

750
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:05,392
but I should really get going now and...

751
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:08,088
clean stuff with the soap.

752
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:10,394
- Bye!
- Enjoy your shower.

753
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,295
So, um...

754
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,796
to what do I owe this pleasure?

755
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:18,699
Jenson's home security system
shows video of him sleeping

756
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:21,035
during the murders,
so he wasn't lying about that.

757
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,304
We checked the key card
system at Soul Depot,

758
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:25,105
and guess who was subbing for Jenson.

759
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,340
Corrina,

760
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:27,708
Maddie's co-manager.

761
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:29,250
Right, and where's Corrina now?

762
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:31,219
We checked her house, she wasn't there.

763
00:31:31,244 --> 00:31:33,714
Forensics confirms that she didn't
kill anyone at Soul Depot,

764
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,716
so she's either running,
hiding or scared.

765
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:37,651
I put out a BOLO.

766
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:40,321
Yeah, I don't think Corrina's
the one running this time.

767
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:41,322
What?

768
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:44,124
Where are you going?

769
00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:46,196
Hello?

770
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:04,378
Hello?

771
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:08,449
Anyone here yielding a deadly,
celestial blade?

772
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:11,719
Huh? Anyone?

773
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:14,625
Well, that'll be a resounding yes.

774
00:32:16,795 --> 00:32:20,027
I... I don't know what happened.

775
00:32:20,032 --> 00:32:23,197
I was in class and Duncan barged in.

776
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:25,699
It was horrible.

777
00:32:25,704 --> 00:32:28,135
All that killing...

778
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,838
and the knife was on the ground.

779
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:32,209
It started calling you.

780
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:37,378
Did I do that?

781
00:32:37,383 --> 00:32:39,480
Yes.

782
00:32:39,485 --> 00:32:41,782
You got retribution for
a grudge, I believe.

783
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:45,219
But it wasn't an insignificant
grudge, was it?

784
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:48,425
Did he harass you like the others?

785
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:52,493
Or was it worse than that?

786
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:54,328
Years ago.

787
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:57,768
We were alone in the studio.

788
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:01,702
I-I... I said no.

789
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:04,505
I swear, but he wouldn't stop.

790
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,841
I-I... I tried to forget. I...

791
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:10,010
You tried to bury it deep,
get on with your life.

792
00:33:10,015 --> 00:33:11,645
You might have succeeded,

793
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,746
if not for...

794
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,249
...the blade.

795
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:17,451
LAPD, hands in the air.

796
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:19,319
Move away from the body, Corinna.

797
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:21,655
- Now!
- I... I-I killed him.

798
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,790
I-I did this. I...

799
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:24,858
Acted in self-defense.

800
00:33:24,863 --> 00:33:28,162
Mr. Glory attacked Corrina
first. She had no choice

801
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:30,164
but to wield that knife, Detective.

802
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:33,270
I think, in this case,
justice has actually been served.

803
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:39,540
Henderson, take her statement.

804
00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:41,645
Come with me.

805
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:44,945
Where's the murder weapon?

806
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,346
What?

807
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:48,415
Unis shouldn't have bagged
it without taking photos.

808
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,284
They couldn't help themselves.

809
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:52,619
Anyone else feeling a murderous urge?

810
00:33:52,624 --> 00:33:56,056
No? The need to slice and dice?

811
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:58,158
Anyone?

812
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:00,664
Oh, God.

813
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:08,205
Oh, no.

814
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:14,374
Detective Douche... Daniel. Dan.

815
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:17,044
Why don't you put down the knife, hmm?

816
00:34:17,049 --> 00:34:18,812
Bury the proverbial hatchet and all that?

817
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:21,515
I mean, I know we've had our
differences in the past, but

818
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,186
we're friends now, right?

819
00:34:28,594 --> 00:34:31,061
You ruined my marriage.

820
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:34,798
I'll take that as a no.

821
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:48,356
My life went to hell when I met you!

822
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:50,378
Hey! Well, technically,
that's not true, but I understand

823
00:34:50,383 --> 00:34:51,579
the basic metaphor.

824
00:34:54,053 --> 00:34:57,051
Easy with the blade, Detective.

825
00:34:57,056 --> 00:34:59,921
One deep cut, and yours truly
could be wiped from existence.

826
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:01,489
Prayers answered.

827
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:05,893
What...

828
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:07,728
Okay, Detective,

829
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:10,965
I can assure you your current
mood will be rectified

830
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,734
by simply putting down the knife.

831
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:17,205
My entire life imploded because of you.

832
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,739
- What?
- My marriage!

833
00:35:19,846 --> 00:35:21,760
My job.

834
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:23,311
My snacks.

835
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:26,414
- What?
- I know you ate my pudding.

836
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:29,383
You're really going to smite me

837
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:31,352
over a tub of sweetened goo?

838
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:35,456
You're damn right I am.

839
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:38,726
Dan... Dan.

840
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:41,162
Recent friend. Growing compatriot.

841
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:43,598
Your marriage was already on the rocks.

842
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:46,434
You started cutting procedural
corners way before I arrived,

843
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:47,802
and as for your pudding...

844
00:35:47,807 --> 00:35:50,671
As for your pudding, I...

845
00:35:50,676 --> 00:35:52,106
Okay, yes.

846
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:53,975
I sometimes lay waste
to the precinct fridge.

847
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,209
But have mercy, Daniel.

848
00:35:55,214 --> 00:35:57,144
How was I supposed to know it was yours?

849
00:35:57,149 --> 00:36:00,050
Because it was labeled!

850
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:08,789
You're fighting the blade,
which indicates a strength

851
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:12,159
I didn't know you had.
Look at me in the eye.

852
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:13,864
Look at me.

853
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,497
Your marriage.

854
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:18,602
Did I ruin it?

855
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:21,636
No.

856
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:23,638
No.

857
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:25,706
We were separated before
Chloe even met you.

858
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:28,142
And your career?

859
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:30,811
Palmetto... was all me.

860
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,780
Yeah. Yeah.

861
00:36:37,957 --> 00:36:39,854
W-What are we doing back here?

862
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:41,722
Hmm? Oh, just a nice,

863
00:36:41,727 --> 00:36:43,257
intimate chat between friends.

864
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:45,426
I'm glad you got it off your chest.

865
00:36:45,431 --> 00:36:46,488
Oh, man, you're bleeding.

866
00:36:46,513 --> 00:36:47,995
What? Oh.

867
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,263
No, it's just a scratch, really.

868
00:36:49,268 --> 00:36:51,565
Nothing to worry about. And you?

869
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,833
How are you doing?

870
00:36:54,573 --> 00:36:56,771
I feel great, actually.

871
00:36:56,776 --> 00:36:58,142
Good.

872
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,080
Good talk.

873
00:37:16,562 --> 00:37:18,626
Ah! Good morning, Detective.

874
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:19,927
Everything all right?

875
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:21,862
No. Heads are gonna roll.

876
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:24,498
First, some tech pulled the murder weapon

877
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:27,001
without documentation,
and now it's just gone.

878
00:37:27,006 --> 00:37:29,804
Right. Well, it's probably for the best.

879
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:31,976
Nasty bit of steel, anyway.

880
00:37:33,012 --> 00:37:35,009
So, one second you're obsessed

881
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:37,678
with the knife, and now
it's just no big deal?

882
00:37:37,683 --> 00:37:40,514
Well, we got the murderer,
didn't we? Job done.

883
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:43,284
You know, Lucifer...

884
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:46,187
I thought you and I had a
real moment the other day,

885
00:37:46,192 --> 00:37:47,555
talking about my dad, I...

886
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,457
I thought we were partners,

887
00:37:49,462 --> 00:37:51,362
but more importantly, friends.

888
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,831
Right.

889
00:37:56,836 --> 00:37:59,433
Is this about me and
Ella in the penthouse?

890
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:02,370
Look, who you sleep with
is none of my business,

891
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,704
but...

892
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:05,940
I mean, the lab tech? Really?

893
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:07,408
- It's a little inappropriate.
- Well,

894
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,243
much as I love to cross
professional boundaries,

895
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:10,911
Detective, I can assure you,
everything you saw

896
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,050
was entirely work-related.

897
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:18,085
Mm-hmm? Is that... is that the truth?

898
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,720
Always the truth.

899
00:38:19,725 --> 00:38:22,089
Point of pride for me, Detective.

900
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:23,391
- Gotcha.
- But you know,

901
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:24,992
if you ever did want to cross boundaries

902
00:38:24,997 --> 00:38:27,300
into "partnered friends who
hang out naked..."

903
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:28,796
Okay. Stop talking.

904
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:36,470
So, global crisis averted?

905
00:38:36,475 --> 00:38:38,609
Yes. For now.

906
00:38:39,512 --> 00:38:41,342
So, we can...

907
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:44,011
you know, talk about Caligula, Stalin,

908
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:45,513
Trump. I mean,

909
00:38:45,538 --> 00:38:47,563
I know he's not dead,
but he's definitely going.

910
00:38:47,588 --> 00:38:50,254
Lucifer, I owe you an apology.

911
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,424
But in my defense...

912
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:55,956
...you're the Devil.

913
00:38:57,061 --> 00:38:58,826
Things were much less
complicated when I thought

914
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:02,763
you were just another
average delusional patient

915
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:05,399
with a complicated family.

916
00:39:05,404 --> 00:39:07,835
Well, I've never been "average," Linda.

917
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,004
Mentally, physically... And as you know...

918
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:11,338
Sexually.

919
00:39:11,343 --> 00:39:13,841
Oh, my God.

920
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:16,277
I had sex with the Devil.

921
00:39:16,282 --> 00:39:19,346
Many, many times. And you're welcome.

922
00:39:19,351 --> 00:39:21,615
Okay, now, see, that I understand.

923
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,385
Narcissistic tendencies rooted

924
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,287
in a complex paternal relationship

925
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:28,255
and a disrupted adolescence.

926
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,257
See? Just another screwed up patient.

927
00:39:30,262 --> 00:39:32,159
And you can treat me as such.

928
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:35,362
All right.

929
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:37,498
Let's do this.

930
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:41,469
The doctor is in.

931
00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:43,204
Lovely.

932
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:47,908
I really do
have urgent business

933
00:39:47,913 --> 00:39:49,376
to attend to. Are you certain

934
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:51,278
that this is the favor that you desire?

935
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:53,848
Because, uh, believe me,
when I say the last two times

936
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:55,182
I've darkened the doorstep of a church,

937
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:58,018
- insert blood-soaked carnage here.
- Again,

938
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,487
with the drama!

939
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:02,123
We solved your case, now I get my favor.

940
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:04,658
Just go with me, okay?

941
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:07,528
Look, since the moment we've met,

942
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,664
okay, I've had this
Spidey-sense that you were...

943
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:13,767
I don't know, searching for something.

944
00:40:13,772 --> 00:40:16,203
- Right. Spiritual lost and found.
- Yes!

945
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,672
And I have found a lot since
I developed a relationship

946
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:21,509
with the Big Guy, and... so might you.

947
00:40:21,514 --> 00:40:24,278
Trust me. We're much
closer than you think.

948
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:26,113
Well, then, no harm, no foul.

949
00:40:26,118 --> 00:40:27,648
I beg to differ.

950
00:40:27,653 --> 00:40:29,216
Oh.

951
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:31,051
On second thought...

952
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:32,853
What?

953
00:40:32,858 --> 00:40:36,193
I should at least give someone
a reason to go to confession.

954
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,704
So, where will you put it, brother?

955
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,140
Somewhere far away from our mum,

956
00:40:53,145 --> 00:40:55,245
for starters.

957
00:40:56,148 --> 00:40:58,345
Mm!

958
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,481
And speak of the Devil's mum.

959
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:02,049
Well, that was fast.

960
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:05,085
You couldn't have waited
a day or two to find it?

961
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,927
There hasn't been nearly enough carnage.

962
00:41:06,952 --> 00:41:08,255
Now we'll never hear from your father.

963
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,757
All the killing in the world

964
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:11,725
may not have gotten his attention, Mum.

965
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,727
Surely you've learned that by now.

966
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:15,262
Uriel was our son.

967
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:16,664
Your brother.

968
00:41:16,669 --> 00:41:18,399
We should grieve together.

969
00:41:18,404 --> 00:41:20,834
I don't think that's all this is about.

970
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:23,270
You want something from Him.

971
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,772
What is it?

972
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:26,874
What I've always wanted.

973
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:29,677
I want my family back.

974
00:41:29,682 --> 00:41:31,178
I'm afraid that's not possible.

975
00:41:31,183 --> 00:41:32,313
Oh, but it is.

976
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:35,549
With my two sons by my
side, a united front,

977
00:41:35,554 --> 00:41:37,851
your father will be forced
to listen to reason.

978
00:41:37,856 --> 00:41:39,520
Force Dad?

979
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:42,122
I think human delusion is
rubbing off on you, Mother.

980
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,525
Tell her.

981
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,598
Luci, I can't, because I agree with her.

982
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:54,468
I thought you were just Team Mum

983
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:56,670
because you couldn't
fly her back to Hell.

984
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:58,806
- Since when did you turn?
- Now,

985
00:41:58,811 --> 00:42:01,508
more than ever, I know
that humanity and divinity

986
00:42:01,513 --> 00:42:02,509
do not mix.

987
00:42:02,514 --> 00:42:04,678
That... that blade, Luci.

988
00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:07,948
That blade was the last straw.
It shouldn't be here.

989
00:42:07,953 --> 00:42:10,317
We shouldn't be here.

990
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:11,885
Well,

991
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,006
- I am not going back to Hell.
- Oh, this isn't about

992
00:42:15,011 --> 00:42:16,290
returning to Hell.

993
00:42:16,295 --> 00:42:18,292
This is about Heaven.

994
00:42:18,297 --> 00:42:20,327
It's about going home.

995
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,762
Home.

996
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,230
For you, maybe.

997
00:42:23,235 --> 00:42:25,599
Neither of you understand, do you?

998
00:42:25,604 --> 00:42:27,001
You never have.

999
00:42:27,006 --> 00:42:30,337
Hell wasn't home, and Heaven was...

1000
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:31,905
well... hell!

1001
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,074
The only place I've ever felt

1002
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,443
wanted or respected...

1003
00:42:36,448 --> 00:42:38,045
Is here? With humanity?

1004
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,817
Yes. This is my home.

1005
00:42:43,422 --> 00:42:45,088
Deal with it, Mother.

1006
00:42:46,492 --> 00:42:48,625
Fine.

1007
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:51,158
Fine.

1008
00:42:51,163 --> 00:42:54,295
No sense arguing.

1009
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,266
Time to go.

1010
00:42:59,738 --> 00:43:01,568
Careful.

1011
00:43:01,573 --> 00:43:03,840
It's sharp.

1012
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,444
What's that saying?

1013
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:13,347
"When my dear husband closes a door,

1014
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:15,485
he opens a window"?

1015
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,843
The window just opened.

1016
