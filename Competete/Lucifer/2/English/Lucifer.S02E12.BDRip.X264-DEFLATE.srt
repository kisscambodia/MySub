00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:02,629
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,837 --> 00:00:04,756
Tell me, what do you desire?

3
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:06,216
This is it?
This is your big trick?

4
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:07,509
Why don't I affect you,
Detective?

5
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:09,177
I guess we both have
our mysteries.

6
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:11,888
35 years ago, Father asked me
to come down here

7
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:13,890
to bless a couple who was unable
to have a child.

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,226
You look really familiar.
Have we met?

9
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,436
MOM:
<i>Your Father put her
in Lucifer's path.</i>

10
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:19,896
We're going home, son.

11
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:22,607
<i>And Chloe is the key.</i>

12
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:25,402
Andy Kleinberg? Jana Lawrence
was found murdered this morning.

13
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,904
KLEINBERG:
<i>One of them broke.
I spilled a little on myself.</i>

14
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,240
What the hell is happening
to me?

15
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,701
MAZE:
<i>So what if you slept
with Charlotte Richards?</i>

16
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,244
You slept with my...

17
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:35,078
Whoa!

18
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,539
He's different
when he's with you.

19
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:40,583
- MAZE: <i>Chloe Decker is causing
your vulnerability.</i>
- LUCIFER: I'm bleeding.

20
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,252
Do you think I'm
boyfriend material?

21
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,087
Perhaps you've been
underestimating yourself.

22
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:46,131

What are you doing in here?

47
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:01,915
What? I heard you scream,
so I ran in to see

48
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,875
if you were in danger.
Then I figured out

49
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:06,169
what was really going on,
you know,

50
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,504
so I stayed to watch the show.

51
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:08,880
Hey.

52
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:10,840
What was that--
that thing you were doing?

53
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:11,841
You were like...

54
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:13,301
Okay, Maze,

55
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,302
get out.

56
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,887
Now.

57
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:18,473
All right, at least you're
getting laid in your dreams.

58
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,517
'Cause it's not happening
in real life.

59
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:22,018
You don't know that.

60
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:26,022
I just wish you'd loosen up,
Decker.

61
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:27,649
You know,
throw caution to the wind,

62
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,192
be impulsive,

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,401
just once.

64
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,904
Instead of, you know,

65
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:34,239
being you.

66
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:39,702
(door opens)

67
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:41,079
(door closes)

68
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,458
Maybe this time
will be different.

69
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,838
This time will definitely
be different, Doctor.

70
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:52,632
I've decided to
take things slow, for once.

71
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:55,051
Hmm, and why
is that?

72
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:58,304
Because I'm a
responsible Devil.

73
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:02,976
And I-- well, I know
what a big deal the kiss was...

74
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,227
for the detective.

75
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:05,520
For <i>her?</i>

76
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:06,688
Well, I'm sure
it must have made

77
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:07,689
quite an impact
on her.

78
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:10,191
I mean, it, it is me.

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,442
No doubt
she's overwhelmed

80
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,111
by emotions
she's never felt before.

81
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,279
<i>She's</i> overwhelmed?

82
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:15,697
- LUCIFER: Mm.
- LINDA: Uh-huh.

83
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,949
Is that why you went your
separate ways after the kiss?

84
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:19,742
Precisely.

85
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,744
Yes, although she did have
that wretched dependent

86
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:22,954
waiting for her at home.

87
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:25,248
Well, two,
if you count the child.

88
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,667
I think I know what's happening.

89
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:29,252
Y-You do?

90
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,962
You're stalling, Lucifer.

91
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:32,463
(laughing):
Stalling?

92
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,382
Sex? Me?

93
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,593
Doctor, have we even met before?

94
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,595
You're stalling
because you've realized

95
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,889
how complicated
your relationship is.

96
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,432
Look...
(sighs)

97
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,893
the, um,
the truth is that...

98
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,103
I still don't
understand why,

99
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:51,107
after everything I said about
my less positive qualities,

100
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,109
she still chose to kiss me.

101
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,570
I mean, do you think she's ill?

102
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,113
Or maybe...

103
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,157
she's just taken by you?

104
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,284
Well, that's impossible.

105
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,745
The detective is
completely immune to my charms.

106
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,708
Or she <i>was</i> immune.

107
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,252
Maybe that's what's changed.

108
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,172
Of course, I mean why else
would she kiss me?

109
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:15,632
But there's also
the possibility...

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,466
No, no, no.

111
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,301
No. That's very good.

112
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,136
Thank you, Doctor.

113
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:21,763
I know what to do now.

114
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:22,972
(door opens)

115
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:28,561
Morning.

116
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,480
Hey.

117
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,149
So, how was the rest
of your night?

118
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:34,776
It was fine, thank you.

119
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,319
How was the rest of your night?

120
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,405
Uh, fine, thank you.

121
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,157
Excellent. So we're
all fine, then.

122
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:42,450
But before we deal with

123
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,534
whatever
atrocity awaits,

124
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:44,369
there's something
important

125
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:46,079
I need to ask you,
Detective. It's...

126
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:47,789
well, it's about us.

127
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:50,166
Okay.

128
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,588
So what is it
you truly desire now?

129
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,134
Lucifer, what the
hell are you doing?

130
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:01,511
You know that stuff
doesn't work on me.

131
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:03,179
Right.

132
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,473
Yes, no, of course.
I was, uh, joking.

133
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:06,516
(chuckles)

134
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:08,601
Right.

135
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,396
(laughs)

136
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:15,400
I was just trying to...

137
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,902
Maze said this
morning, you know,

138
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:21,239
throw caution to the--
never mind, it...

139
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:24,534
That was weird. Yeah.
We-- let's go.

140
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,327
Right.

141
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:31,916
Right, what have we got?

142
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,670
ELLA:
Meet Rick Cormier.

143
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:39,382
19-years-old.
Malibu State freshman.

144
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,051
Friends thought he was just
hungover after the big win

145
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,886
against the
Pasadena Gray Hawks.

146
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,388
Turns out, he be dead.

147
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:46,389
Of poisoning.

148
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:47,390
Ooh.

149
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:48,474
Like alcohol poisoning?

150
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:51,269
No, like <i>poison</i> poisoning.

151
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,395
Check it out:

152
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:54,564
petechial hemorrhaging,

153
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,191
ribboned skin,

154
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:58,943
ocular discharge.

155
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:00,778
(chuckles) Sorry,
she said "discharge,"

156
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:01,863
it gets me every time.

157
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:02,947
(laughs)

158
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:06,701
Any idea

159
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,411
of how long it took
the poison to activate?

160
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,747
ELLA: Well, it's hard to say
for sure, but best guess,

161
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,081
maybe 24 hours?

162
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:14,083
I hope poor Ricky
made 'em count.

163
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:17,211
Enjoying what little life
he had left with sex or friends.

164
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,130
Or sex with friends.

165
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,802
I just figured that's where
you were going with that.

166
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:26,471
ELLA: Yeah, well,
I mean, I don't know

167
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,930
how down he
was to party,

168
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,308
but, you guys,

169
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,935
I've seen
a lot of messed up stuff.

170
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:35,355
This toxin tore
through his body

171
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,315
like it was burning him
from the inside out.

172
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,025
I mean, I'm gonna
have to reach out

173
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,444
to my forensic contacts just
to see if anyone knows anything.

174
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:42,695
Who found the body?

175
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:46,074
I thought he was just
sleeping it off for once.

176
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,242
I didn't realize he
was freakin' dead.

177
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,453
Do you know anyone who may have
had a problem with him?

178
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,496
No way.

179
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,122
We all loved Ricky.

180
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,957
Did you notice anything strange
in the last few days?

181
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,334
Any unusual behavior?

182
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,251
Like what?

183
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,545
Like someone carrying
a small apothecary bottle

184
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,339
marked with a skull
and crossbones perhaps?

185
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,257
No, nothing like that.

186
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,885
But Johnny Kane came by
the dorm yesterday.

187
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:07,720
- CHLOE: Mm.
- LUCIFER: What, <i>Johnny Kane</i> Johnny Kane?

188
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,138
As in the actor Johnny Kane?

189
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:10,932
Yeah. My mom
went pretty nuts

190
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,392
when I told her.

191
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:14,102
He even signed
one of my DVDs.

192
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,436
- LUCIFER: No.
- CHLOE: Huh.

193
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:18,189
LUCIFER:
Oh. <i>To Love Is to Die.</i>

194
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:19,816
(chuckles)
Impressive work.

195
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,484
I mean, to be a man
playing a woman playing a man.

196
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,236
It's absolutely dizzying.

197
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:25,947
What, should I have
said "spoiler"?

198
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:27,698
TIMMY:
Apparently he was here

199
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:28,825
researching a role.

200
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,326
Hmm, committed.

201
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:31,661
He's, like, 40 years old,
there's no way

202
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,663
he could pull off
playing a college student.

203
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,790
Um, surely you
misspoke, Detective.

204
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:36,999
I mean, Johnny
Kane's a spry

205
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,418
and handsome young
man, wouldn't you say?

206
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,378
CHLOE: No, he's quite old.
And since when did you become

207
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:41,671
the president of his fan club?

208
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,632
Since he just walked in here
wielding a large knife.

209
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,385
Am I too late?
Is he dead?

210
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,304
- JOHNNY: Is he dead?
- CHLOE: Freeze. Drop
the knife.

211
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,140
It's my fault.
He's dead because of me.

212
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,141
Put down the
knife, Johnny.

213
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,143
Yes, listen to her, Johnny.
She's quite a good shot.

214
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:56,686
You don't understand!

215
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,104
I couldn't do
what the man said.

216
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,105
What man?

217
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,315
The man said
he would kill that kid

218
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,235
if I didn't cut my face.

219
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:07,738
♪♪

220
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:18,249
Mr. Johnny Kane,
you're an amazing actor

221
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,878
with an impressive library
of films under your belt.

222
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:24,505
Beloved by critics
and the public alike.

223
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:25,840
Many would say

224
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,843
you're at the top
of your profession right now.

225
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,761
Which is why
it'll be so interesting

226
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,056
to see what decision you make
for this experiment.

227
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,391
You can either...

228
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,437
carve up your own face, or...

229
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,858
Rick Cormier, an innocent
freshman at Malibu State,

230
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,152
will die of poisoning.

231
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,571
You have 24 hours to decide.

232
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,407
Do what's asked and an antidote
will be delivered.

233
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,160
The choice is yours alone.

234
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,287
LUCIFER:
Well, that's dramatic.

235
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:58,289
When did you get this video?

236
00:08:58,706 --> 00:08:59,916
Yesterday. At first,

237
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:02,418
I thought
it was some sick joke.

238
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:05,546
Fans send bizarre letters
to my manager all the time,

239
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:07,924
but this was sent directly
to my personal e-mail,

240
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:10,176
and it was so...

241
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,427
disturbing.

242
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:12,762
I couldn't get it
out of my head.

243
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,763
I had to
check it out.

244
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:14,764
So you went to the school.

245
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,140
Yeah,
when I realized

246
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:17,892
that this kid was a real student
at Malibu,

247
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,769
I-- I started thinking

248
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,104
that this "experiment"
might be real, too.

249
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:25,191
I went home and I stared
at that knife for hours.

250
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,901
But I couldn't do it.

251
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,820
I couldn't cut up my face.

252
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,781
LUCIFER: Well,
of course you couldn't.

253
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,366
That's an impossible choice.

254
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,284
This killer is clearly
playing God.

255
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,911
I mean, no one would
do something like that

256
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,621
unless they're
being manipulated.

257
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:40,957
(sighs)

258
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:42,375
Not unlike someone

259
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,878
showing affection
when it made no logical sense.

260
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:47,964
(softly):
What?

261
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,298
JOHNNY: I mean,
what kind of sick bastard

262
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:50,675
would do such a thing?

263
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,760
That's exactly what
I'd like to know.

264
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,429
Excuse me.

265
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,057
(door opens)
Where are you going?

266
00:09:59,141 --> 00:09:59,976
(door closes)

267
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,687
Okay, look, we are
doing everything we can

268
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,981
to trace that e-mail,
but in the meantime,

269
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,441
did you have any connection
to the poisoned student?

270
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,026
Or any idea why
he was targeted?

271
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:11,529
No, until yesterday I'd never
met him before in my life.

272
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:18,160
(line ringing, phone ringing)

273
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,042
Like that, is it?

274
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,421
Excuse us, thank you.

275
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:29,672
Fess up.

276
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,715
What did you do to her?

277
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,301
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to be more specific.

278
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,303
I've done a lot of things
to a lot of people by now.

279
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,972
(chuckles) Don't play
silly buggers with me, Mum.

280
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:40,975
The detective kissed me
and I need to know why.

281
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,185
Did you say you kissed?

282
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:44,729
Please spare me
the appearance of surprise

283
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,355
and just tell me how you did it.

284
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:48,065
Well, I wish I had that
kind of power, but, sadly,

285
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:49,692
I can't take credit.

286
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,988
Why are you so upset?

287
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:57,533
I assumed you'd be pleased
by such a development.

288
00:10:58,576 --> 00:10:59,577
Well, I...

289
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,539
I'm upset because
I just don't know if it's...

290
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,041
real.

291
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,043
All I can say is,

292
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,211
follow your heart, son.

293
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,590
These things have a way of
working themselves out in time.

294
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,760
- LUCIFER: Really?
- DAN: Hey.

295
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:18,846

Dick.

298
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,267
Well, I suppose
that's my cue.

299
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:25,770
Remember what
I said, Lucifer.

300
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:30,024
Bye-bye, Daniel.

301
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,071
I just came by to tell you
that Chloe's looking for you.

302
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,406
Cyber got a hit
off that e-mail trace.

303
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:39,075
Great.

304
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:41,452
Great.

We traced the e-mail to a grad

309
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:56,467
He works here part-time.

310
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:58,260
Libraries.
Dreary places, aren't they?

311
00:11:58,469 --> 00:11:59,637
They smell like feet.

312
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:02,348
I don't know.

313
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,601
I think they can, uh,
be kind of romantic.

314
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:09,522
Have you ever, you know,
made out in a library?

315
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,524
What...

316
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,526
Detective, what has gotten
into you today?

317
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,945
This is usually when you
tell <i>me</i> to focus on the work.

318
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,739
- LUCIFER: And yes, of course
I've made out in a library.
- CHLOE: Right.

319
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:21,283
Yeah, I was-I was-- I've been
trying to kind of...

320
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:22,910
You know what?

321
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,496
Never mind.
(laughs)

322
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:28,290
It's definitely not getting
the reaction I was expecting.

323
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:29,625
- LUCIFER: Right.
- CHLOE: So, just-- no.

324
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:30,668
You know what? No.

325
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:34,046
Since when have you've
been one to avoid sex?

326
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:36,257
(woman screaming)

327
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,845
(woman moaning on computer)

328
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,638
- CHLOE: What?
- LUCIFER: LAPD.

329
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,140
- LUCIFER: Show us what's in your hands.
- CHLOE: No,

330
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:45,891
raise your hands above your head
where we can see them.

331
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,644
- Well, it might be a gun,
Detective.
- It's not a gun.

332
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,022
WOMAN:
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,065
Just...

334
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:55,860
I don't know any kid...

335
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,903
Ah, ah, ah.
Better safe than sorry.

336
00:12:58,738 --> 00:12:59,613
Right.

337
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,240
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

338
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:02,992
I don't know
any kid named Rick.

339
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,119
You are Dee-man69, yeah?

340
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,787
That's a very clever play
on words, by the way.

341
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:08,956
Was "Nevergetslaid#1" taken?

342
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,626
Yes, that's my
e-mail, but...

343
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:16,714
I only ever use it
for... you know....

344
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:18,174
porn.

345
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,843
Care to explain why you sent
Johnny Kane a threatening e-mail

346
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,303
yesterday at 9:10 a.m.?

347
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,846
LUCIFER:
Busted, Mr. Hoffing.

348
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,223
You may as well come clean now.
Pun intended.

349
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:28,642
First off, I'm kind of
a fan of Johnny Kane.

350
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,228
I think he's super talented,
but not enough to e-mail him.

351
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,104
And secondly,

352
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:33,230
I couldn't have e-mailed
him at that time

353
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,649
even if I wanted to.
I was T.A.ing a class.

354
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,152
- LUCIFER: Oh.
- MATTHEW: Here, I can prove it.

355
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,283
MATTHEW:
Okay. There is an e-mail there.

356
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:45,409
Oh, wait for it.

357
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:46,619
But it wasn't me.

358
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,037
Do they ever get
less predictable?

359
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,039
No, I'm serious.
It must've been hacked.

360
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,374
I didn't send that e-mail, and
I didn't send this one either.

361
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,252
- CHLOE: What other one?
- MATTHEW: This one,
sent an hour ago.

362
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:56,837
It wasn't me.

363
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,175
Dr. Gwendolyn Scott.

364
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,886
You're a world-renowned
thoracic surgeon.

365
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,972
Who's saved an awe-inspiring
number of lives.

366
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,433
Which is why it'll be
so interesting to see

367
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:13,062
what decision you make
for this experiment.

368
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:18,692
You can either
destroy your hand or...

369
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,111
Ashley Corbett,

370
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,657
an innocent sophomore
at Malibu State, will die

371
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,158
of poisoning.

372
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,953
You have 24 hours to decide.

373
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,498
Do what's asked, and an antidote
will be delivered.

374
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,417
The choice is yours alone.

375
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,169
This isn't just about
Johnny Kane.

376
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:39,338
We have to find
Ashley Corbett now.

378
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:52,935

is find Ashley Corbett.

let me handle this.

382
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,818
Okay, Detective,
in order to do so,

383
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,778
we need to... blend in.

384
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:04,655
Meaning?

385
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:08,701
Meaning less hall monitor,
more, sort of, hot for teacher.

386
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:09,952
So, do you mind if I...

387

00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:27,636

All right, well,

Remember, we're not
here to party,

00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:01,629
we're here to
find Ashley.

412

sick already,

Excuse me,
have you seen this girl?

419
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,939
I think I saw her an hour ago.

420
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:23,108
- She's, like, way hot.
- Yeah, great.

421

Uh, do you know where she is?
'Cause she might be in danger.

No...

- Hi.

Dear, how do I turn
this thing off?

432
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,882
I'm looking for
Ashley Corbett.

433
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,759
Uh, can you tell
me where she is?

434
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:49,969
We'll tell you.

435
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,888
But first you have to do
something for us.

436
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,140
(nervous chuckle)

437
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,434
We are almost through,
Dr. Scott.

438
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,645
I really appreciate you
answering our questions.

439
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,314
Probably should've called you
when I got the e-mail.

440
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,066
I was afraid.

441
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,734
It's okay, Doctor.

442
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:06,902
We're here now.

443
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,030
Can I ask you something,
Detective?

444
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,116
What would you do?

445
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:14,702
If you were me,

446
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,662
and it were your hand

447
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,373
or an innocent girl's life?

448
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,458
What would you do?

449
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:25,963
I don't know.

450
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,217
I've dedicated my life
to saving people.

451
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,054
Taken an oath to do no harm.

452
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,933
H-How am I supposed
to make that choice?

453
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:39,601
You don't have to.

454
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,229
They've drawn blood
from the first victim

455
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:43,981
and they're already
working on an antidote.

456
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,941
That's great
if they find the girl.

457
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,318
But what if they can't?

458
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,446
They will find her.

459
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,698
I promise you.

460
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,909
Some of our best people
are on it.

467
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,131
Right. Now,

468
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,467
can you please tell
me where Ashley is?

469
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,635
Mm. Come with me.

470
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:15,929
Whoa! Hey...

471
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,264
Was that an earthquake,

472
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:18,766
or did you just
rock my world?

473
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,018
I don't think so.

474
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,478

how do I know that it's real?

482
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,953
It's real if you're

actually take a leap

488
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,298
and trust you for once.

489
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,384

line and here you are doing...

490
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,471
Wait, what are you doing?

491
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,973
Well, I was actually
working, Detective.

492
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,517
Oh, my God.

493
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,352
- Is this her?
- Yes.

494
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,020
She's so pretty.

495
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,647
Oh.
(chuckles)

496
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,233
Well, I-I mean I was working
and maybe, sort of,

497
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,151
you know, asking about you.

498
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,070
- About me?
- Well, we had some time to kill

499
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,113
whilst we're waiting
for Ashley.

500
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,031
'Cause apparently
she's in that bathroom.

501
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,659
- Don't know what's
taking her so long.
- (knocking)

502
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,744
Ashley Corbett. LAPD.

503
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:22,746
Ashley.

504
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,503
It just won't stop.

00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,507

So, this is where the...

506
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,634
healing happens.

507
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:37,886
It's cute.

508
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,682
So, what brings you here?

509
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,227
I have some upsetting
information to give to Lucifer.

510
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,522
It's a revelation that might
send him over the edge

511
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,565
against his Father.

512
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,774
Okay.

513
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:55,737
But considering that Lucifer and I
have a bumpy track record,

514
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,198
I'm afraid
he won't believe me.

515
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,075
I'm afraid he might
think I have some...

516
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,743
(chuckling):
ulterior motive.

517
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,120
Do you?

518
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,875
I'm not going to tell him
this information for you,

519
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,168
if that's what
you're asking.

520
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,630
What if I say
pretty please, hmm?

521
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,176
Apparently that's supposed
to do something.

522
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,803
Look, I understand
that you have been--

523
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:24,057
uh, are the goddess
of all creation.

524
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,310
You're very...

525
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,687
uh, tall.

526
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:31,940
And most certainly
quite powerful.

527
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,819
But my loyalties are
to my patient, your son.

528
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,363
Doctor-Devil
confidentiality.

529
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,866
But I'm not asking you
to break his trust.

530
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,869
In fact, I'm asking you
to illuminate the truth for him.

531
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,872
If he's going to make an
informed decision about Chlo...

532
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,626
...about his future here,

533
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,420
he needs to know the facts.

534
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,172
(softly):
Right?

535
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,299
I said please, right?

536
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,053
If this information
is as upsetting

537
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,721
as you're making
it out to be,

538
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,806
I'm not interested
in being the messenger.

539
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,808
Afraid I'm too
smart for that.

540
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,895
So what you're saying is I need
to find someone he'll trust

541
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,397
that is foolish enough
to help me deliver the news.

542
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:15,400
That's the exact opposite
of what I'm suggesting.

543
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,153
Thank you, Doctor.
I know just the person.

544
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,115
Now I see the resemblance.

545
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:27,829
All right, well, call me as soon
as you hear anything else.

546
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:28,956
Thanks.

547
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,208
How is she?
Is she going to be okay?

548
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,835
They found Ashley.
She's in the hospital.

549
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,172
But the poison must be different
from the first victim.

550
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,218
The antidote they made,
it's... it's useless.

551
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,388
But don't worry,
we will figure out a way.

552
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,681
We always do.

553
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,183
It just takes time. Okay?

554
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:53,063
I, um... I need to get
a glass of water.

555
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,277
(beeps)

556
00:21:59,111 --> 00:21:59,945
This is Espinoza.

557
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,488
I need to get an update
on Ashley Corbett.

558
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,282
(grinding, whirring)

559
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:05,617
I'm sorry. Can you say that
again? I can't hear you,

560
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:06,702
there's a...

561
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,413
garbage disposal...
Doc!

562
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:11,790
Don't.

563
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,417
Don't.

564
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:21,300
- (screams)
- DAN: No!

565
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,514
We e-mailed back
a photo of your hand.

566
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:28,765
Doubt we'll get a response.

567
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,684
The killer knows
that we may be monitoring.

568
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,103
That poor girl was going to die.

569
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:34,688
I had no choice.

570
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,189
LUCIFER:
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

571
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,942
You had a choice not
to be so foolish.

572
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:39,818
Lucifer.

573
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:40,986
Well, who's to say
the killer wouldn't

574
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,321
demand her other hand?

575
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,822
Her spleen?
Her heart?

576
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,657
'Cause, believe me,
there is no winning

577
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,327
when you play by
a twisted tyrant's rules.

578
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,704
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?

579
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,790
(exhales)

580
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,917
You are out of line.

581
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,002
Me?

582
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,421
The doctor just
destroyed her hand.

583
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,214
When are people going
to understand?

584
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,717
Thou shalt not negotiate
with terrorists!

585
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,969
Oh, surely you can see
this is a fool's game.

586
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,097
The only thing I can see is,
you are letting your emotions

587
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:12,267
get away from you. We can't let
our feelings get in the way

588
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,019
of our work, Lucifer.

589
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:16,146
We have to work together
as a team,

590
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,148
or else someone could get hurt.

591
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:20,901
Yes.

592
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,445
Yes, I suppose they could.

593
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:26,531
MESSENGER:
Hello?

594
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,534
I've got a delivery
for a Dr. Scott.

595
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:32,788
Uh, I'll take that. LAPD.

596
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:34,664
CHLOE:
Thanks.

597
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,755
"I'm a man of my word."

598
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,136
The antidote.

599
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,597
We need to test this
and get it to Ashley now.

600
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:51,431
LUCIFER: Right.

601
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,648
Boo-yah.

602
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,358
Remember how I sent
a shout-out to my peeps

603
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,068
- for other poison victims?
- DAN: Mm-hmm.

604
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,321
Well, meet Monsieur John Doe.

605
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,907
Now, according
to my buddy at DHS,

606
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,618
this guy was found in the cargo
hold of a plane in Chicago.

607
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:14,121
Similar symptoms
to our poison Vic.

608
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,665
And get this,
the flight he was on?

609
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,333
Came out of Los Angeles.

610
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:19,918
So, he might actually be
the first victim?

611
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,087
Mm-hmm. I mean,
the only difference

612
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,382
is he has hot spots all over
him, almost like the poison...

613
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,591
DAN:
Spilled on him.

614
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:27,717
ELLA:
Exactly.

615
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:31,179
But this stuff is so strong,
Dan, that it killed him anyway.

616
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,306
I mean,
we are talking

617
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,267
designer poison here.

618
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:38,353
Engineered
from controlled substances.

619
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,397
Each one
just a little bit different.

620
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,773
So, how do we get
an antidote?

621
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,775
Well, that right there
is the tricky part.

622
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,862
Designer poisons
need designer antidotes.

623
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,990
This guy, our killer,
is really good.

624
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,658
I mean, bad.

625
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:54,536
But really good.

626
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:57,038
Oh, my God.

627
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:58,248
I know.

628
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:01,001
It's tough. But we'll get
through this, buddy.

629
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:04,671
No. No, that photo.
Hold on one second.

630
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,797
Where is it?

631
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,054
What?

632
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,932
The same
birthmark.

633
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,894
Your dead guy from Chicago

634
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:20,645
is Andy Kleinberg.

635
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:22,606
The rich guy that we
looked into for the murder

636
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:23,732
of that stewardess.

637
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,318
We were searching
for a... a special package

638
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:27,777
that was smuggled
into the country.

639
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,529
- ELLA: Okay.
- DAN: We never found it.

640
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:30,947
It had to be the poison.

641
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,574
Kleinberg must've been
the one who stole it.

642
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,120
And look what
happened to him.

643
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,083
ASHLEY: This is the other
student that was poisoned?

644
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:43,835
I'm sorry.

645
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,213
I don't recognize him.

646
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,965
It's okay. We just need
to ask you these questions

647
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:50,091
now that you're feeling better.

648
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,177
LUCIFER: Yes. Now that your inside's
no longer bleeding out.

649
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:53,678
CHLOE: Do you have
any idea, Ashley,

650
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,388
when you could've
been poisoned yesterday?

651
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:58,058
No. I mean, it was a normal day.

652
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,894
I woke up. I
had a bio exam.

653
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,104
Lunch at the dorms...

654
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,398
Then I just, I went to the
gym, I couldn't even work out

655
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,942
'cause my arm was kind of sore.

656
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:08,735
Why was your arm sore?

657
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:10,445
ASHLEY:
I don't know.

658
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:13,573
Uh, I guess, 'cause of
the flu shot that I got?

659
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:15,283
ASHLEY: Do you think that
could have been it?

660
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,202
CHLOE: So, according
to the M.E. report,

661
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,954
the other kid got
a flu shot, too.

662
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,789
Ah. Well, what do you know?

663
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,374
Ashley, where did
you get the shot?

664
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:24,417
The university health van.

665
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:25,418
Great. Thank you.

666
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,003
- Yes.
- (clears throat)

667
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,672
- CHLOE: Excuse me.
- LUCIFER: Get well soon.

668
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:30,924
(beeps)

669
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,425
DAN:
The guy who gave the flu shots

670
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:33,969
was Dr. Jason Carlisle.

671
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,513
This is footage
of a car accident he was in.

672
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,935
He was a professor at Malibu
until this video went viral.

673
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:44,062
No!

674
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:46,606
Want to know why?

675
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,650
Because the poor sap
saved himself?

676
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,819
Correction. Because he saved
the dissertation he'd been

677
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:53,113
working on for four years, while
an innocent college student

678
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:54,823
working as an Uber driver died.

679
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,616
He was publicly humiliated,
his wife left him,

680
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,619
he lost his job, his entire
world spiraled out of control.

681
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,788
So he took a job
as a mobile health tech.

682
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:04,457
I thought our killer
was just raving mad,

683
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:05,834
but he's trying
to prove a bloody point.

684
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,503
That everyone would make
the same choice he did.

685
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:10,755
Saving their livelihood
over someone else's life.

686
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,382
Johnny Kane's face
is his bread and butter,

687
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:13,758
and so is the surgeon's hand.

688
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,677
So he's recreating
his own moral dilemma.

689
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,512
He's picking everyone
by design--

690
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:18,513
the kids, the professionals...

691
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:19,514
And he's not done.

692
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,057
Unis searched
the professor's house.

693
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,727
They found files on over
a dozen possible targets.

694
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,187
Okay. Well, we need to find him
or else we need to figure out

695
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,481
a way to draw him out carefully.

696
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,567
Or we could
just get a big stick

697
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,444
and poke the bear
as hard as we can.

698
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:33,361
What does that mean?

699
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,405
LUCIFER: Well, this man
clearly has an oversized ego,

700
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:38,617
comparing himself to the likes
of Johnny Kane and Dr. Scott.

701
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,536
If we threaten that ego,
trust me, he'll respond.

702
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:42,537
How do you know?

703
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,205
Because I know his type, Daniel.

704
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,041
Used to live with him, in fact.

705
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,709
Called him Dad.

706
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:53,882
What are you doing?

707
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:56,217
(typing)

708
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:57,719
What are you doing, Detective?

709
00:27:58,136 --> 00:27:59,220
Sending him an e-mail.

710
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,847
- (laughs)
- What?

711
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,724
LUCIFER:
"You pathetic sad sack,

712
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,851
"no wonder
you didn't get tenure,

713
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,645
your experiments
are as ugly as you are."

714
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,188
Well said, Detective.

715
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,231
DAN: Seriously? Insulting
the serial killer?

716
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,566
That's an awesome idea.

717
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:12,567
Thank you.

718
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,402
Also, his mask is a bit lame.

719
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,321
Could be much creepier.
Put that in.

720
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,367
DAN: Chloe. Don't send this.
All right? It's not you.

721
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:22,410
This is... This is,
it's a rash move.

722
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,747
(continues typing)

723
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:26,581
(taps key)

724
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,124
DAN:
That's great.

725
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,709
I mean, what could
go wrong, right?

726
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,670
I mean, surely this won't
force the psycho underground,

727
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,254
it won't cause him to
do anything crazy...

728
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:34,381
Chill out, Dan.

729
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:35,423
(computer chimes)

730
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:38,426
He responded.

731
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:39,678
Ah, told you.

732
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,098
With a link.

733
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,726
Hello, Detective.

734
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:50,397
You don't need that mask
anymore, Professor Carlisle.

735
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:51,606
(exhales sharply)

736
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,237
(inhales, exhales)

737
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:58,530
Ah.

738
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,658
So much easier to breathe
without that thing.

739
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:04,828
What do you want, Professor?

740
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:08,790
What do I want? To finish my
experiment without interference,

741
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,375
but here we are...

742
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,252
LUCIFER: Your experiment
failed, Professor.

743
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,712
We proved your theory wrong.

744
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,797
The doctor chose to save
the girl. So, clearly,

745
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:18,258
not everyone's as egregiously
selfish as you are.

746
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,803
I am not a selfish person.
I was vilified for doing

747
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:24,681
what anyone
in my position would do.

748
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,183
You went back for your computer.
That's not about survival,

749
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:28,643
that's about stuff.

750
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:31,646
It was about instinct,
but thank you

751
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:34,107
for reminding me
why I'm doing this

752
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,276
and for helping me

753
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,154
to improve upon my experiment.

754
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:40,780
Truth is, Dr. Scott

755
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:44,117
only mutilated her hand
because she was being observed

756
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,243
by you.

757
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:49,289
So this time
I'm controlling my variables.

758
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,252
Meet...

759
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,838
Benjamin Tibi.

760
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,799
Innocent student,
attached to a poison drip.

761
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,260
And here, Leon Klem,

762
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,638
accomplished track star,
stuck in a vice.

763
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,433
If Leon simply pulls the lever

764
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:12,270
and severs his leg
within 60 minutes,

765
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,521
Benji here

766
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,149
gets... this.

767
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:18,526
You guessed it.

768
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,361
The antidote.

769
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,615
Oh, and please, for your sake...

770
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:26,910
...don't waste your time
trying to make another.

771
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,038
They're all unique,

772
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,040
and the only place
the formula lives

773
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,458
is right here,

774
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,293
in my head.

775
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,172
Not bad for a sad sack

776
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,174
who couldn't get tenure, huh?

777
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:43,760
CHLOE:
Professor, wait!

778
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:46,846
Well.

779
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:49,891

You have two minutes. Talk.

00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:12,872
It's simple. There's something
Lucifer needs to know.

783
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,082
I think you should tell him.

784
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,251
Oh, really? And why's that?

785
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,545
Because it's about
his beloved Chloe.

786
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:21,422
He'll take it better from you.
You're his closest friend.

787
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,050
Lucifer may be stubborn,
but he listens to you.

788
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,261
Mm-hmm. Hate to break it to you,

789
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,513
but if you're buttering me
up, it ain't gonna work.

790
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,932
You have bad news
to give your son?

791
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,517
Suck it up

792
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,227
and do it yourself.

Good talk.

796
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,067
God made Chloe.

797
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,737
Yeah. He kind of
made them all.

798
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,906
No. Chloe wasn't
supposed to be here.

799
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,783
God put her in Lucifer's path.

800

She's a...

801
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:51,828
miracle.

Granny Panties Decker?
A miracle?

805
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:00,253
Please.

806
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,255
35 years ago,

807
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:05,216
Amenadiel was sent to this bar,
where he sat down,

808
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,635
had a chat, then blessed
Penelope Decker

809
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:10,179
so that she and her husband
could have a child.

810
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,598
That child

811
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:12,682
is Lucifer's partner.

812
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,393
It's no accident that they met.

813
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:19,397
Mm. So, what, Amenadiel blessed
Penelope's lady parts?

814
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,441
Wait,
is Amenadiel

815
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,234
Chloe Decker's daddy?

816
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:26,070
- (laughs)
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

817
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:28,740
Think...

818
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:30,491
about it.

819
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:33,661
Haven't you ever wondered
why that particular human

820
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,496
makes him vulnerable?

821
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,290
Mm.

822
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,500
But if you still
don't believe me,

823
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,794
there's something
you should see.

824
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,469
No luck.
I called every lab

825
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:50,720
the professor's ever
been affiliated with--

826
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:51,638
no one's seen him.

827
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,681
He could have built
that lab anywhere,

828
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,475
and the video link
was untraceable.

829
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,435
What if I made a mistake?

830
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:58,603
What if by sending
that e-mail

831
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,355
I just sped up
his timeline?

832
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,731
There's two lives
on the line here.

833
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,149
Two lives that you're
going to save,

834
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:04,943
- LUCIFER: Detective, I know you will.
- DAN: Exactly.

835
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:08,404
- Found something.
- Please tell me it's good news.

836
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,865
Eh, more like medium news.

837
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,992
So, Kleinberg's autopsy
came back.

838
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:14,953
Turns out he didn't die
of poisoning.

839
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:16,079
I mean, he would have
died of poisoning,

840
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,830
except he was
strangled.

841
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,165
Impatient little killer.

842
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:21,417
Since I finally got
time of death right,

843
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:22,377
I was able to ping

844
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,045
Kleinberg's cell
to Van Nuys Airport,

845
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,381
where I got this.

846
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,217
CHLOE:
It's the professor,
clear as day.

847
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:31,469
- DAN: So we can assume
that he killed Kleinberg.
- ELLA: Right.

848
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,930
But this only tells us
where the professor was.

849
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:34,931
It doesn't tell us

850
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:37,266
where he actually is,
hence "medium" news.

851
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,144
Uh, can you rewind it
to the part

852
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:41,521
where he goes through security?

853
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:43,523
DAN: Why, what are you
looking for?

854
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:45,608
CHLOE:
Okay, freeze there.

855
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,151
And then zoom in on the tray.

856
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,113
Looks like a key card
with a logo.

857
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:51,364
ELLA:
Oh, definitely a bird.

858
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:52,907
School mascot maybe?

859
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,993
We checked every lab
at Malibu State.

860
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,703
LUCIFER:
Well, he wouldn't go
back there, would he?

861
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,080
Trust me, when you get kicked
out of a fancy party,

862
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,124
the last thing you want
to do is sneak back in.

863
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:02,458
You do the opposite.

864
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,044
Who's Malibu's closest rival?

865
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,298
CHLOE: <i>The lab in here
is closed for renovation,</i>

866
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:10,675
<i>so maybe he's here.</i>

867
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:26,274
Well, well, isn't
this a surprise.

868
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:27,775
(door rattles)

869
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,736
It's locked, Detective.

870
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:33,322
But with that said, I'm
actually glad you made it.

871
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,366
Why, because you'd
like to surrender?

872
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:38,036
It's a bit anticlimactic,
but very well, we accept.

873
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:42,707
No, because now
you get to see firsthand

874
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,792
what I'm trying to prove.

875
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,169
CHLOE:
It's over, Professor.

876
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:49,255
Afraid you're
wrong about that.

877
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,299
(gunshot)

878
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,302
Acrylic glass, Detective.

879
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,888
Please don't kill yourself
with your own bullet.

880
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,514
We wouldn't be able
to conduct

881
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:00,641
the final part
of this experiment.

882
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,935
Time for you
to make a choice.

883
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:08,274
In this vial, an antidote
that will save Benji's life.

884
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:10,610
In vial <i>numero dos,</i>

885
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,112
poisonous gas
that will kill you

886
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:14,489
if you enter the room.

887
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,949
Simple, really--
you decide

888
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,743
what's more important.

889
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,291
No.

890
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:45,103
- LUCIFER: W-W-W-What are you doing?
- CHLOE: If I don't get in that
room right now,

891
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:46,270
that kid is gonna die.

892
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,563
Word of advice, Detective.

893
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:49,482
If you go into that room
right now, <i>you'll</i> die.

894
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,650
What are we supposed to do?

895
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,070
- LUCIFER: I can save him.
- CHLOE: What?

896
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,739
But in order to do so, you need
to go after the professor

897
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:57,990
right now,
before it's too late.

898
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,450
- CHLOE: What?
- LUCIFER: I promise you

899
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,410
I can get to that antidote
without harming myself.

900
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,496
- CHLOE: How?
- LUCIFER: We don't have time
to explain.

901
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,456
Do you trust me?

902
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,167
- CHLOE: Yes.
- LUCIFER: Then go.

903
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:10,253
Go!

904
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:24,433
Freeze!

905
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:28,146
(grunts)
(screams)

906
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:29,480
Right.

907
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:31,482
(coughs)

908
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,614
Okay.

909
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:40,658
Oh!

910
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,331
(grunts)
(indistinct chatter)

911
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:49,041
(both grunt)

912
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:52,628
(yells)

913
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,137
Oh, come on, Detective,
a bit of help here!

914
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,097
I need you further away.

915
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,063
Freeze!

916
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,316
There's nowhere left
to run, Professor.

917
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:22,158
(laughs cynically)

918
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,002
(inhales deeply)

919
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:34,420
(exhales)

920
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,465
Lovely.

921
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:46,224
I knew you'd save yourself.

922
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:50,394
It was the only choice
you could make.

923
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:52,438
Put down the knife.

924
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:54,523
It's not too late.

925
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:56,400
You can still make
a different choice.

926
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,528
The right choice.

927
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:01,447
You can still save
that kid back there.

928
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,533
You still don't get it.

929
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:07,578
I didn't want anyone
to get hurt,

930
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:10,122
but I needed people
to understand

931
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:14,752
I'm not a monster,
I'm human.

932
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:18,005
You call it biology,
call it God,

933
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:21,592
but choice is an illusion.

934
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,427
I didn't have one

935
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:26,097
when I pulled myself
out of that burning car.

936
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:31,018
And I certainly
don't have one now.

937
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:35,439
You'll understand soon enough.

938
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,332
Where is he?

939
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,126
Where is Lucifer?

940
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:57,962
LUCIFER: I'm right here,
Detective.

941
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,717
See? I told you everything
would be all right.

942
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:09,807
I'm so glad you're okay.

943

Hey.

945
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,733
I guess we make a good team
after all, don't we?

946
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,364
This is real, isn't it?

947
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,789

Interesting choice of venue.

My, my,

What's this, celestial
enemies' night out?

Why don't you have
a seat, Lucifer.

957
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,863
There's something that
we need to tell you.

958
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:09,492
Ooh, some sort of supernatural
intervention, is it?

959
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,451
(chuckles)

960
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,244
Well, doesn't matter
what shenanigans

you two have got
cooking up,

962
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,122

I'm too happy

963
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:16,499
for you to spoil things.

964
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:18,125
- MAZE: Happy?
- LUCIFER: Yeah.

965
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:21,170

Sorry...

966
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:23,964
<i>Chloe</i> and I are real.

967
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:26,634
I mean, I didn't think
it could happen,

968
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:30,388
but it has, and I've got
this overwhelming sensation--

969
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,139
I can't even
describe it, but...

970
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,434
I feel invincible.

971
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:38,104
So come on, ladies,
bring it on.

972
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:41,232
Whatever it is, I'm sure
I can deal with it.

973
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,070
Forget it.
Come on.

974
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:46,904
What?

975
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:48,656
There's nothing to talk about.

976
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,908
- LUCIFER: What? I've only
just got here.
- MAZE: Go. Go.

977
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:52,576
We discussed this,
Mazikeen.

978
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,247
No. <i>You</i> discussed this.

979
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,916
And I don't want to have
anything to do with it anymore.

980
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,459

00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,216

to get back at your ex?

984
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:09,760

what you're talking about.

985
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:10,886
MAZE:
I knew...

986
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,722
- you were up to something.
- LUCIFER: What the hell is this?

987
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,685

with Chloe's mum?

988

What is this?

991
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,864
I've been trying to find
the right way to tell you.

992
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:37,538
But there is no right way,
