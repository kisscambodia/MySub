1
00:00:00,328 --> 00:00:03,004
- Previously on Lucifer...
- I wasn't lying.

2
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:05,273
I do intend to use the Flaming Sword

3
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:06,881
to cut through the Gates of Heaven.

4
00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:08,048
But what you left out?

5
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:10,046
I plan on kicking Mum into Heaven

6
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:12,052
and slamming the gates on her backside.

7
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:14,665
- Maybe there's another piece missing.
- If you find the killer,

8
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,590
then you'll find our
piece of the Flaming Sword.

9
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:18,066
I went through a lot this last year,

10
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:20,427
and improv sort of
helped me reorient myself.

11
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:21,695
Amenadiel told you about our trip

12
00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:22,898
back to Heaven, didn't he?

13
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:25,366
You should have told me.

14
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:28,602
As promised. This opens
a safety deposit box.

15
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:31,405
LAPD. Bianca Ruiz, you're under arrest.

16
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,805
Are you certain this is all that
was in the safety deposit box?

17
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:36,410
We'll fix it. There's plenty of time.

18
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:37,820
Just not for me.

19
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:41,115
God shattered the Flaming Sword
into three distinct pieces.

20
00:00:41,117 --> 00:00:43,117
The Blade of Death,
the Medallion of Life

21
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:45,152
and the Key that binds
them all together.

22
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:47,254
Look down.

23
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,489
He entrusted it to you.

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,253
Congrats on nabbing Queen Tequila.

25
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:52,660
Well, Chet's still out there,

26
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:54,061
so this isn't over.

27
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,696
I need what Zeke really smuggled.

28
00:00:57,206 --> 00:00:58,999
My life is ruined!

29
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:22,389
Ow.

30
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:48,082
Hello?

31
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:50,284
It's Charlotte Richards.

32
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,319
I need a favor.

33
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:04,732
Would you look at that, Luci?

34
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:07,356
It really is the final piece.

35
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:08,591
Unbelievable.

36
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,485
Oh, no, I believe it.

37
00:02:10,527 --> 00:02:12,261
It's classic Dad.

38
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:14,066
Hanging the final piece
of the Flaming Sword

39
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:16,402
right under our noses... Well...

40
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,436
your nose,

41
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,005
this entire time.

42
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,308
I know, right?

43
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:23,709
It's ridiculous.

44
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,761
I mean, if that isn't
the biggest celestial bird

45
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,029
Dad's ever flipped.

46
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,365
What are you talking about?

47
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:33,102
This means that I'm the favorite son.

48
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:36,939
Uh, no, it means that once again

49
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:40,409
Dad is manipulating
us six ways to Sunday.

50
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:42,278
But, hey, what's new?

51
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:44,013
At least we have it now.

52
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:45,614
So...

53
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:51,987
Well, hand it over, Brother.

54
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:54,090
The sword's not gonna ignite itself.

55
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:58,094
It... oh, just give it to me.

56
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:00,262
Give it to me. Right,
don't be silly, Brother.

57
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:02,198
You know I'm ten times
stronger than you.

58
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,799
But I'm the favorite.

59
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,727
Oh, right. Of course.

60
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,279
That one.

61
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,573
Right, don't make me hurt you.

62
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:13,701
Remember, you're not
the angel you once were.

63
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:17,913
No, Luci, you're right, I'm not.

64
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,815
Well, oh.

65
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,881
I didn't mean to make
you all broody again.

66
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,149
No, it's okay.

67
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:26,119
I just need a little time
to process what it all means.

68
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,587
Process?

69
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:30,223
Okay. Fine.

70
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:31,991
Suppose we're in no real rush.

71
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:33,926
Process away.

72
00:03:33,962 --> 00:03:35,962
I think I've got E.T. on the DVR

73
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:37,597
if you need a good weep

74
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:40,333
and a pint of Haagen-Daz in
the freezer if that helps.

75
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,757
You scared me. God!

76
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:03,132
Goddess.

77
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:04,429
But whatever.

78
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,225
I need medical attention.

79
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:07,687
I'm wounded.

80
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:09,697
Then go to a hospital.

81
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:13,093
This isn't exactly a human injury,

82
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:15,469
and since you know who,

83
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,672
or rather what I am,

84
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:21,104
I would appreciate it if
you would just patch me up.

85
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,277
Why does everybody
keep doing this to me?

86
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:24,916
I am a doctor,

87
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:27,848
but patching people up isn't my thing.

88
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,383
Oh.

89
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:33,521
It is now.

90
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:36,691
Suppose I could take a gander.

91
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:38,960
Wonderful.

92
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:44,799
I should warn you, you might have to...

93
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:50,338
- duck.
- What?!

94
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,973
Who did that to you?

95
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:54,275
I mean, was it Lucifer?

96
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,950
I-I mean...

97
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,947
not on purpose, you know.

98
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:01,854
Accidentally, like with that

99
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:03,651
Flaming Sword thingy.

100
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,854
All right, let me see what I got here.

101
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:14,962
Okay, duct tape.

102
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,498
Trust me.

103
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:20,267
This stuff's amazing.

104
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,142
This is ridiculous.

105
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:29,276
You have experience

106
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:31,078
with emotionally fragile men, don't you?

107
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:32,580
You're self-aware today.

108
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:33,848
No, I meant Dan.

109
00:05:33,872 --> 00:05:35,082
Anyway, tell me,

110
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:37,585
how do you stop them from
overthinking everything?

111
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,086
Who's overthinking?

112
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,221
Amenadiel.

113
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,989
Leave it to him to turn a compliment

114
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:43,824
into something to angst over.

115
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,260
I mean, he should be
happy he's Dad's favorite.

116
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:49,196
Wait, your dad didn't actually
tell you guys that, did he?

117
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:53,100
Well, in so many Sumerian words, yes.

118
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:56,670
You know, the more I
hear about your dad,

119
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,773
the more I understand why you're...

120
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:01,075
you know, you.

121
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,843
Body dump.

122
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,813
Weird one, too, and not
just 'cause of the obvious

123
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,982
buck naked, deep-fried head thing.

124
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:12,820
But someone also shaved
this poor guy's entire body.

125
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:15,456
Well, maybe our poor
killer's just chaetophobic.

126
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:17,024
Fear of hair.

127
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,172
Always fun when they turn up in Hell.

128
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:20,761
Lots of wigs involved.

129
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,465
But I'm pretty sure...

130
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,302
this guy got a bath in bleach.

131
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:29,964
So, whoever dumped him is a pro.

132
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,975
It's like he just vanished
off the face of the Earth.

133
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:32,807
I know.

134
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,210
But it's pretty tough for
someone to cover every track.

135
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,013
If anyone can find
something, it's you, Ella.

136
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,048
Aw, that is so sweet!

137
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:42,550
Yes, well, u-until you do,

138
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:44,852
I've got some personal
business I need to tend to.

139
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:47,521
'Cause, you know, you're not
so much with the nice words,

140
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:49,023
but when they come out...

141
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,098
- Doctor.
- Hi.

142
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,418
Lucifer, what's up?

143
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,431
I'm wondering if you've seen Amenadiel.

144
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:02,337
Nope.

145
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,806
Haven't seen that family member. No.

146
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,908
Can you stop being
weird and just let me in?

147
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:10,244
Mum.

148
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,697
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, you know,

149
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,949
girl stuff.

150
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:17,494
Naked girl stuff?

151
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,369
Dr. Linda, I had no idea.

152
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:22,823
What is that?

153
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:30,297
All right, out with it, Mother.

154
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,999
It's nothing.

155
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,879
That spoiled brat,

156
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,136
Chet Ruiz, stabbed me,

157
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:36,504
and now I'm bleeding light.

158
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,539
It's... it's no big deal.

159
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,374
What?

160
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,942
That's a huge deal.

161
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:44,345
Mum, if your powers are
returning to this degree,

162
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,181
then your human body won't be
able to contain it, you'll...

163
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,570
you'll burst.

164
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,950
Oh, no.

165
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:51,519
I need to find Amenadiel now.

166
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,686
I'd rather you didn't.

167
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,188
I mean, it's bad enough

168
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,771
- that you'll be worried.
- No, that's just it, Mum.

169
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:58,592
Amenadiel has the missing
piece of the sword.

170
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,461
You're k... you're kidding.

171
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:03,264
Son, why didn't you say something?

172
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:06,800
Now we can finally ignite it and
cut through the Gates of Heaven

173
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:11,672
and I can see my... I
can... I can see my children.

174
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:16,043
Yes. Yes, but for now,
I need to find Amenadiel

175
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,978
and you need to stay away from humans.

176
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,914
You're a... ticking bomb.

177
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:21,382
Uh, um, actually,

178
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:26,153
speaking of that, I... may have already

179
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,890
harmed... someone.

180
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:32,563
Oh, no.

181
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:33,557
No, no, no.

182
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,463
I just came from a crime scene...
The man with a burned head.

183
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:37,865
Please tell me that isn't Chet.

184
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,501
The detective is on that case.

185
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,670
Well, not to worry. I had
a pro clean up the mess.

186
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:43,704
You don't understand.

187
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:46,840
The detective is good, annoyingly good.

188
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,376
Well, then we just need to
find Amenadiel, don't we?

189
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,312
- Yes.
- And get the piece.

190
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:52,813
Because if we don't
get you back to Heaven

191
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:54,181
before the detective gets to you,

192
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:57,585
then she is quite literally toast.

193
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:06,238

194
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:14,931
Did you slip on a banana peel, too?

195
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,043
- What?
- I'm afraid you're gonna need surgery.

196
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,273
Don't fight it.

197
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:20,480
The kid's fierce.

198
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:22,315
I...

199
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,484
So, I left Mum in the
wine cellar at Lux,

200
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,085
and that's the situation.

201
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:27,386
Ouch.

202
00:09:27,422 --> 00:09:29,055
Baby.

203
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,729
I still don't get why you're here.

204
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:33,860
Because I need the best
bounty hunter out there.

205
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:35,095
I can deal with the detective,

206
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,729
but I need you to find Amenadiel.

207
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:38,631
Then we can get the
pendant, assemble the sword

208
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,533
before Mum spews light everywhere.

209
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:42,055
You don't have to speak in code.

210
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,802
I can handle adult stuff.

211
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:45,701
So what if your mother explodes?

212
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:47,102
Why should I care?

213
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:50,409
Because many, many
humans could get hurt.

214
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:51,466
Yeah, and?

215
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:53,225
Oh, nice try, Maze, but I happen to know

216
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:54,974
there's a few that you care about.

217
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,118
Fine.

218
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:00,453
But you pay me my standard fee.

219
00:10:00,488 --> 00:10:01,687
No freebies.

220
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:02,755
Absolutely.

221
00:10:02,824 --> 00:10:04,290
Oh.

222
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:05,825
Love me a lolli.

223
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,995
Sorry, wussies don't get any.

224
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:22,589
So, I ran the prints,

225
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:26,612
and it came back as your brother Chet.

226
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:28,581
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:30,483
I know that you've been

228
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:34,220
living in Mexico, but
can you think of anyone

229
00:10:34,255 --> 00:10:35,953
who may have wanted your brother dead?

230
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:38,791
My family had many enemies.

231
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:41,701
It's why I left, to get away from

232
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:43,596
the Ruiz empire.

233
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:45,832
I tried to get Chet
to go with me, but...

234
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:49,635
But, unfortunately, he got
involved in the family business.

235
00:10:49,671 --> 00:10:53,406
I know you were the one
who put my mother in prison.

236
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:55,241
I also know you were after Chet,

237
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:58,277
so I know what you think of my family.

238
00:10:58,313 --> 00:11:00,613
But I loved my brother.

239
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:04,817
He didn't deserve to die.

240
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:07,053
Especially not like that.

241
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:09,689
No one deserves to die like that.

242
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:12,892
Look, I'm gonna work this
case as carefully and fairly

243
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:15,528
as I would any other case.

244
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,096
I promise you.

245
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:24,036
Ah, oopsie daisy.

246
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:25,938
There goes that clue. Klutzy me.

247
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:29,675
Aw, don't worry, buddy.
I am a total klutz myself.

248
00:11:29,711 --> 00:11:32,879
Which is why I always make a backup.

249
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:34,046
Oh, good.

250
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:35,715
Hope it leads us
straight to Chet's killer.

251
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:36,682
Oh, no,

252
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:37,998
that's from another crime scene.

253
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,719
I got a big steaming pile of nada

254
00:11:39,754 --> 00:11:41,905
from the Chet Ruiz crime scene.

255
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:44,522
Oh, good...

256
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:47,278
ness me, that is awful.

257
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:48,995
Please tell me you have something.

258
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:51,163
No, no, nothing. It's so frustrating.

259
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:53,442
Well, there is one thing I'm waiting on.

260
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,028
But I thought you just said we had nada.

261
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,769
Well, so the only thing we know for sure

262
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,697
is that someone had to
drive there to dump the body.

263
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:01,674
So, the tech team is checking
the vicinity for cameras,

264
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:04,944
but it's such a remote place,
so don't get your hopes up.

265
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,380
Ooh, yes. I think
you're right, Miss Lopez.

266
00:12:07,415 --> 00:12:09,081
Sadly, the only witness to this one

267
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:11,117
is my dear old dad.

268
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:13,886
Oh, right. Yes, your dad...

269
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,655
is always watching.

270
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:19,926
Wait a second. That gives me an idea.

271
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:20,723
It does?

272
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:23,462
Satellite imaging takes
sporadic photos of,

273
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:24,619
well, everything, so...

274
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:26,899
So there may be footage of the killer

275
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:28,901
- going to or from the warehouse.
- Exactly.

276
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:30,603
I mean, it's a long shot,

277
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:32,338
but thank you, Lucifer.

278
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:35,174
You're so welcome.

279
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,643
It's me. God chose me.

280
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,069
I'm the favorite son.

281
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:40,780
This whole time, I actually thought

282
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:43,316
that God had lost faith
in me, but it was me.

283
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:44,538
I lost faith in him.

284
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,607
I can see that now.

285
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:52,992
That losing my powers
must have been a test.

286
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:57,997
And if so, I failed.

287
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:02,868
I'm so sorry, Father.

288
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:05,838
Yes, and how was your pork chop?

289
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:09,141
Okay, that's great.
We'll cut right there.

290
00:13:09,177 --> 00:13:11,043
Hey, can I have the lights please?

291
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:15,748
So, uh, good job.

292
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:18,317
But there are a few subjects
that we try to avoid:

293
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:20,653
you know, religion, politics,
anything too polarizing.

294
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:21,654
Okay?

295
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,322
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Totally understand.

296
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:25,324
- I got this.
- Perfect.

297
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,259
All right, let's give
'em another scenario.

298
00:13:27,295 --> 00:13:30,363
Oh, uh, zookeepers and
the giraffe is pregnant.

299
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:32,198
Okay.

300
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,632
You guys ready?

301
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:37,403
Action.

302
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:38,671
Oh, man!

303
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,306
I think she's going into labor!

304
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:41,574
Help me!

305
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:43,075
How can I help when I'm supposed to

306
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:44,176
kill my own father?!

307
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:47,947
And cut.

308
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:56,822
It's a little dark, buddy.

309
00:13:56,858 --> 00:13:58,357
- Hmm.
- You know,

310
00:13:58,393 --> 00:13:59,792
just try to have fun with it.

311
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:01,460
But I thought you
told me this helped you

312
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:03,662
work through difficult personal matters.

313
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:06,632
I did.

314
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:13,325
APB got a hit that it was parked
in the lot across the street.

315
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:14,974
I'm telling you, we're wasting time.

316
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:16,209
It was the only vehicle parked

317
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:18,611
near the crime scene between
midnight and 5:00 a.m.

318
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:21,180
Yes, but how do you know this
parked van's even the same one?

319
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:23,115
I mean, there's no license
plates on this image.

320
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:26,085
Oh, come on! How many vans
have dandelions on the side?

321
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,754
They're not dandelions,
they're jellyfish.

322
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,489
What? Jellyfish?

323
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:31,791
Right, yes.

324
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:33,059
Well, I'm simply saying that

325
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:35,527
we should be focusing on
more pressing criminal issues.

326
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,764
- Such as?
- Well, I'm glad you asked, actually.

327
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:39,231
The death of Celeste McDougall.

328
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:40,800
Very suspicious, indeed.

329
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:43,369
- She was 92.
- Yes, and fit as a fiddle.

330
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:45,404
- I mean, look at that smug face. Look.
- I know.

331
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,573
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

332
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,241
LAPD!

333
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:50,943
Don't move!

334
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,879
You still think we're wasting our time?

335
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:01,619
Definitely rethinking the
lasagna I had for lunch.

336
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,187
Oh, my gosh.

337
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:04,555
This is not what it looks like.

338
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:06,290
What? Minions day out?

339
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:08,826
Take your hoods off, slowly.

340
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:15,499
I know this looks bad,
but we can explain.

341
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:16,767
I'm Ava.

342
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:18,235
This is my sister Kathleen.

343
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,537
Hi. How ya doin'?

344
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:21,038
Friendliest serial killers ever.

345
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:23,741
Oh, that's hilarious. We're not killers.

346
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:24,909
God, no.

347
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:26,610
We run Dandy Lyon Cleaners.

348
00:15:26,646 --> 00:15:28,779
Lyon's our last name. Get it?

349
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:31,382
We take care of crime
scenes, dead body removals.

350
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:32,817
All the icky stuff.

351
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:34,200
But totally legit.

352
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:36,727
Yeah, like this poor guy,
died of a heart attack.

353
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,965
Like, two weeks ago.

354
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:39,757
Right, well, perfectly good explanation.

355
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,759
- I knew it. Shall we, Detective?
- Wait, wait, wait.

356
00:15:41,761 --> 00:15:42,669
Why was your van

357
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:45,262
outside of an abandoned
warehouse in Eagle Rock

358
00:15:45,298 --> 00:15:46,831
at 3:00 a.m. last night?

359
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,307
I'm... pretty sure you're mistaken.

360
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:51,168
We were nowhere near that area.

361
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:52,903
Well...

362
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:55,272
Ugh, no. Eagle Rock.

363
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:57,608
Do not tell me you
went to see Fred again.

364
00:15:57,643 --> 00:15:59,210
I thought you were done with that jerk.

365
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:01,779
I was, till I ran into
him at Jamba Juice.

366
00:16:01,814 --> 00:16:03,180
Understand completely.

367
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:05,750
I mean, what's more intoxicating
than a Mango-A-Go-Go?

368
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:07,485
Alibi sorted.

369
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,581
We'll leave you here with
Soupy, and we'll be on our way.

370
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,288
- Come on.
- No. Wait, wait. Hold on.

371
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:12,623
Can I talk to you for a second?

372
00:16:12,658 --> 00:16:14,047
- Yes?
- Enough with this.

373
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,026
Why are you trying to
rush our investigation?

374
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:17,954
Why are you still hiding things from me

375
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:19,435
after all we've been through?

376
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,310
You know I don't lie, Detective.

377
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,218
But you also don't tell the whole truth.

378
00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:24,802
Does this have to do

379
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:26,704
with what you were
upset about this morning,

380
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:27,772
with your family?

381
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:30,341
Yes, but I can't explain,

382
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:31,942
because you wouldn't understand.

383
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:33,911
Not if you don't talk to me.

384
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:35,346
Never mind.

385
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:37,314
I thought we were past this.

386
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,984
Going backwards, Lucifer, is not good.

387
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,450
For anyone.

388
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,595
Trust me, dude, you're gonna
find this really freeing

389
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:53,330
once you get the hang of it.

390
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,175
And I'll help you through it.

391
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:57,601
Just takes practice.

392
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:59,336
You're a good man, Daniel.

393
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,172
Yeah.

394
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:03,274
Ooh!

395
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:04,575
Okay.

396
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,277
All right.

397
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:07,912
Wow. You're strong.

398
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:14,218
That family is so weird.

399
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,689
"You'll get the hang of it."

400
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:20,191
"It just takes practice."

401
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:23,828
And that hug.

402
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:25,830
You guys doing it?

403
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:27,331
So, what are you even doing here?

404
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:29,800
I'm bounty hunting
you, thanks to Lucifer.

405
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:31,842
Time to assemble the sword, Amenadiel.

406
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,238
I don't know that I want to, Maze.

407
00:17:34,273 --> 00:17:36,140
Father entrusted me
with the final piece.

408
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:37,295
That changes things.

409
00:17:37,298 --> 00:17:39,877
- Are you coming with me or not?
- Think about it, Mazikeen.

410
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:42,796
All of my actions, all of my feelings,

411
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,206
they were all just based on lies.

412
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:47,457
You see, I thought
I had fallen, and I...

413
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:53,357
I don't get paid by the hour.

414
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:01,765
Oh, my God! Are you going to Paris?

415
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:03,634
Can I be your travel buddy?

416
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:04,941
I love Paris.

417
00:18:04,957 --> 00:18:10,074
Les hommes, oh, très
sexy, romantiques, avec...

418
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:13,110
This is the Paris hotel
in Vegas, actually.

419
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:14,111
Oh.

420
00:18:14,146 --> 00:18:16,247
Not... going there.

421
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:18,315
Vegas and me...

422
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:19,383
not pretty.

423
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:20,885
Yeah, I'm not going, either.

424
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,319
But Kathleen Lyon's ex

425
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:24,388
Brad did, and according
to his Wobble page,

426
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:26,323
he's been partying there all weekend.

427
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,292
Oh, well, that blows up

428
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:31,495
Kathleen's reason for being
in Eagle Rock at 3:00 a.m.

429
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:35,399
You think our two
sweet, "legit" cleaners

430
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:37,668
are up to something not so legit?

431
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,277
Hello, Brother.

432
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:48,112
I notice you've changed your look.

433
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:49,914
Where's your pretty necklace?

434
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:52,049
Oh, I've put it in a safe place.

435
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:54,184
Ah. Keister it, did you?

436
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,753
Nope. Already checked.

437
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:57,121
Not there.

438
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:58,188
Lovely.

439
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,423
Listen, Amenadiel,

440
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,891
I need the final piece.

441
00:19:00,927 --> 00:19:03,827
Right. So you and Mom can slice
through the Gates of Heaven

442
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:04,995
and destroy Father.

443
00:19:05,031 --> 00:19:06,397
Yeah. I know.

444
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:07,831
Right.

445
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:09,033
Maze, darling, would you mind

446
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:11,168
running down to the wine
cellar and fetching Mum?

447
00:19:11,203 --> 00:19:13,003
I think she'd like to hear this.

448
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:19,510
I've been thinking about this, deeply.

449
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:22,171
And I think that we've been
looking at things the wrong way.

450
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:22,952
Oh?

451
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:24,915
That necklace was a gift.

452
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:26,684
It's not some manipulation.

453
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:29,086
Well, you only think that
because it was gifted to you.

454
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:30,287
No, no, Luci!

455
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:32,323
It's all about perspective.

456
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:34,024
Father doesn't always make things clear,

457
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,560
because he wants us to
form our own beliefs.

458
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:39,797
And I strongly believe that
I am to guard that piece.

459
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,498
Now, I may have lost my way,

460
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:44,201
but that doesn't mean that
I can't rectify things now.

461
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:46,170
Fine.

462
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:47,671
What if I was to tell you

463
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:49,512
I never planned on destroying Dad?

464
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:52,242
- I'd say you were full of it.
- Yes, I want to assemble the sword,

465
00:19:52,244 --> 00:19:54,358
yes, I want to cut through
the gates, blah, blah,

466
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,480
but then I was just
gonna kick Mum into Heaven

467
00:19:56,515 --> 00:19:58,082
and slam the gates behind her.

468
00:19:58,117 --> 00:20:00,651
Let the two lovebirds torture
each other for eternity.

469
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:02,314
- And that's better?
- Yes.

470
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:03,916
No!

471
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:05,956
Regardless of whether
you're with Mom or not,

472
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,891
I simply can't let Mom loose on Dad.

473
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:10,060
Now, it is finally time that I go back

474
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:12,863
to being the loyal soldier
that he entrusted me to be.

475
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:14,954
Mom is not going anywhere!

476
00:20:14,957 --> 00:20:18,035
Well, I am afraid that we do
not have a choice, Brother!

477
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,436
Mum's powers are returning,

478
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:22,043
and it won't be long before
we can't contain them.

479
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,679
I mean, she's already killed one person,

480
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,249
and now the detective is on a...

481
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:28,846
the detective is on her case.

482
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:30,739
So, please, no discussion.

483
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:33,083
Mum has to go!

484
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:35,819
She already has.

485
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:39,123
Your mother's gone.

486
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:41,725
What?

487
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:44,828
It's Cheval something or other.

488
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:47,731
It's valuable, so it must be good.

489
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:53,627
I wasn't expecting to see you

490
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,439
or your...

491
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:57,775
deadly light back so soon.

492
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,610
Well, something's been bothering me.

493
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:02,346
When you first saw my wound...

494
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:04,548
you asked if Lucifer had done it.

495
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:07,017
What did you mean by that?

496
00:21:07,053 --> 00:21:08,552
I meant nothing by it.

497
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:09,687
You know?

498
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:11,889
Meaningless brain fart, you know?

499
00:21:11,924 --> 00:21:14,625
Just blah. Came out.

500
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,660
There was a lot going on that day.

501
00:21:16,696 --> 00:21:18,362
Hmm.

502
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:21,365
I don't think so.

503
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,667
I think, in fact,

504
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:25,602
that you know something.

505
00:21:25,638 --> 00:21:27,371
I don't want to hurt you, Linda.

506
00:21:27,406 --> 00:21:30,307
I... am running...

507
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,276
out of time.

508
00:21:32,311 --> 00:21:35,079
You've seen what's happening to me.

509
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:38,882
So you can either tell me what you know

510
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:40,984
over a glass of wine

511
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,522
or over your own charbroiled corpse.

512
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:47,257
Your choice.

513
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:52,083
I came here to grill
Kathleen on the false alibi.

514
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,490
Whoa. Somebody already had, huh?

515
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:56,781
Yeah.

516
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,082
It's Ava Lyon.

517
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:00,018
I'm thinking whoever killed Chet

518
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,353
hired the Lyon sisters to clean up,

519
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:03,788
then cleaned up the cleaner.

520
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:05,857
Excuse me, what is going on?

521
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:06,958
I work here.

522
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,827
Ava!

523
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:11,162
Stop.

524
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,865
Oh, my God.

525
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:15,967
What did I do?

526
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,170
It's me, only me.

527
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,506
Ava knew nothing about it.

528
00:22:22,753 --> 00:22:25,176
I wasn't lying about Brad.

529
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,844
I did get back together with him,

530
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,581
but he gambles a lot,
and he needed money.

531
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:35,887
Then I got this call
offering me a hundred grand.

532
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,558
Who hired you?

533
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,794
Who killed Chet and your sister?

534
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:46,197
Maybe Ava's death was a warning.

535
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,599
For me to keep my mouth shut.

536
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,868
Maybe if I don't say anything...

537
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,376
So how do we find Mom?

538
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,979
Follow the trail of roasted humans?

539
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:03,348
Well, if anyone can find
that wily goddess, it's Maze.

540
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,550
She's on it.

541
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,839
Detective. Everything all right?

542
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,199
We found a body.

543
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,557
- Another body?
- A burned head.

544
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,359
- Same burned head?
- Yes.

545
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,028
So, what, you think whoever
killed Chet killed again?

546
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,896
Look, Lucifer, it's a long story,

547
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:20,898
but the second victim is Ava Lyon.

548
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,800
She's one of the cleaners we met.

549
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,335
I have her sister Kathleen here,

550
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,337
but she's not saying
anything... She's scared.

551
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:27,972
So I need you to come here,

552
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:30,074
and I need you to do your mojo thing.

553
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,177
Yes, Detective, believe me when I say

554
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,680
I want to find the
killer as much as you do.

555
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:36,881
Hello, boys.

556
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,116
Mum.

557
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,617
What? What? What's going on?

558
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,953
I-I'm so sorry. My mum's here.

559
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,234
I-I've got to rush.

560
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:45,857
Good luck with Kathleen. Ciao.

561
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,225
Damn it.

562
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,760
- What's wrong?
- Lucifer.

563
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,161
He's...

564
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,168
He's hiding something
from me, I can tell.

565
00:23:52,171 --> 00:23:54,899
Oh, you know what? It's probably
just embarrassing family stuff.

566
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,801
I mean, they seem totally bonkers.

567
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,036
Yeah.

568
00:23:58,071 --> 00:23:59,404
Maybe.

569
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,274
He is with his step-mom now, so...

570
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,442
So maybe...

571
00:24:05,497 --> 00:24:08,379
maybe he's not hiding something from me,

572
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:09,747
but someone.

573
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,950
Someone who knew Chet.

574
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:15,315
And someone I still don't trust.

575
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:17,088
What have you been doing?

576
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,457
Oh... this and that.

577
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:22,193
This being firing up
the celestial barbecue

578
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,695
so that you can grill another head?

579
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:27,065
No. I just needed to get cleaned up.

580
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,800
Get some air.

581
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,768
I was feeling a little claustrophobic.

582
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:34,639
Don't you just hate
being kept in the dark?

583
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,844
The good news is you found Amenadiel.

584
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:42,880
So we have the piece?

585
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,883
Yes. Well, interesting story, actually.

586
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,385
Why don't you tell her, Brother?

587
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,387
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no. This one's all you.

588
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:51,289
Brother, I insist.

589
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,392
Thank you.

590
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:55,827
Right. Well, uh,

591
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:57,295
upon careful consideration,

592
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,297
we've decided this
whole Flaming Sword plan

593
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:00,465
is a crap idea.

594
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,699
Yes, crap.

595
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:02,854
Mm. Have you ever considered

596
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,969
finding, well, I don't know,

597
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,237
a-a place of your own?

598
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,673
Yeah. Somewhere away from Dad, maybe?

599
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:09,640
Yes.

600
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,342
Somewhere familiar,

601
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:13,065
warmer, perhaps?

602
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:18,583
You want... you want me back in Hell?

603
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:20,384
Well, not in Hell, per se,

604
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,686
but in charge of Hell.

605
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,521
I mean, after all, it is a kingdom

606
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:24,922
without a ruler.

607
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,078
He is right.

608
00:25:26,081 --> 00:25:28,559
I mean, there's a great
opportunity for upward mobility.

609
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:31,114
Lick of paint here or there.

610
00:25:31,153 --> 00:25:32,763
The columns would look great in white.

611
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:36,634
Beige?

612
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,373
So it's true.

613
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:45,143
You are working against me.

614
00:25:45,178 --> 00:25:50,348
You never planned on
going with me to Heaven.

615
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,516
Wait.

616
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,518
How did you find out?

617
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:56,988
Well, I persuaded...

618
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:58,923
your little doctor.

619
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,092
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

620
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:02,560
What did you do?

621
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,263
Mum.

622
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:06,497
Mom.

623
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:07,965
Listen, I understand.

624
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,200
You're angry.

625
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,703
Oh, I'm not angry.

626
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,195
Just disappointed.

627
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,953
Give me the piece!

628
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,488
No, Mom.

629
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:34,258
You're gonna have to kill me.

630
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:42,579
Guess I'll have to find
another way, won't I?

631
00:26:47,057 --> 00:26:49,243
Well, now look what you've made her do.

632
00:26:49,284 --> 00:26:50,652
I've just had this tuned!

633
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:54,589
Me? How about you suggesting Hell

634
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,025
as a retirement home? Nice.

635
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,093
Maybe if you had just

636
00:26:58,128 --> 00:26:59,494
mentioned the pottery class

637
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:02,364
or water aerobics, she
would have gone for it.

638
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:03,965
Oh, and did you have a better idea?

639
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:06,968
Mom's coming undone, Luci.

640
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:10,271
- In every way.
- I know.

641
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:12,540
And she doesn't care
who she hurts anymore.

642
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:14,042
Linda.

643
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:15,343
I'll go check on Linda.

644
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:17,278
You go after Mom, she'll listen to you.

645
00:27:17,314 --> 00:27:19,347
But, Luci, don't you dare
promise her that piece,

646
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:21,082
because I won't give it to her.

647
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:38,557
Well, well. Someone's clever.

648
00:27:38,588 --> 00:27:40,368
How did you get me?

649
00:27:40,404 --> 00:27:42,537
Wasn't that hard. We tracked your phone.

650
00:27:42,572 --> 00:27:46,374
No, I mean, how did you
figure out I was the bad guy?

651
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,010
Did Little Miss Dandy Lyon tell you?

652
00:27:49,046 --> 00:27:50,812
It's over, Charlotte. Put your hands up.

653
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:52,547
Oh, don't worry, I'm
not going to resist.

654
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:54,816
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

655
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:57,285
I just have one small request.

656
00:28:02,092 --> 00:28:03,758
Detective.

657
00:28:03,794 --> 00:28:05,160
Any chance you've seen my Mu...

658
00:28:05,195 --> 00:28:06,728
Looking for little ol' me?

659
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:07,762
You were right, dear.

660
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:10,565
Your detective is quite good.

661
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:13,334
She caught me.

662
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,402
Where are you?

663
00:28:14,438 --> 00:28:15,637
Santa Monica Pier.

664
00:28:15,672 --> 00:28:17,458
Such a beautiful place.

665
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,140
So many people.

666
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:21,481
If you hurt anyone, Mum,

667
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:22,610
if you hurt her...

668
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:25,246
And if you and your brother
had just given me what I needed.

669
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:26,614
But who knows?

670
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,016
Maybe you still can.

671
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:30,218
Okay, that's enough.

672
00:28:30,253 --> 00:28:32,187
Mum!

673
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:34,155
Start talking.

674
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:36,733
Just the two of us.

675
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,159
If that's all right.

676
00:28:38,195 --> 00:28:41,062
I'd rather not put Daniel in...

677
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:42,530
an awkward position.

678
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:46,668
Hate to ruin all the
good ones we've been in.

679
00:28:48,171 --> 00:28:49,471
Can we go outside?

680
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:50,772
Mm-hmm.

681
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:52,500
I'll be fine.

682
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:04,652
I'll miss you, Daniel.

683
00:29:04,688 --> 00:29:07,322
You are my favorite human.

684
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:15,530
Hey. You find Mom?

685
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:18,266
She's on Santa Monica Pier,
and she wants the piece.

686
00:29:20,337 --> 00:29:22,537
We have to give it to her, Amenadiel.

687
00:29:22,572 --> 00:29:24,038
We've run out of options.

688
00:29:24,074 --> 00:29:25,333
Please.

689
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:27,175
Brother, please.

690
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,255
She... she has Chloe.

691
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:36,951
Linda! You here?!

692
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:38,853
I'm tracking Lucifer's mom,

693
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:41,823
and I think she might be on her way.

694
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:48,363
Oh, no.

695
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:50,999
No, no, no!

696
00:29:54,671 --> 00:29:56,604
Linda.

697
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,439
Hey. It's okay.

698
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:00,475
I'm here. Okay?

699
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,976
You're gonna be fine.

700
00:30:04,714 --> 00:30:07,115
She did this to you, didn't she?

701
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,785
She wanted to know what
Lucifer's plans were.

702
00:30:10,821 --> 00:30:12,787
I didn't want to tell her.

703
00:30:12,823 --> 00:30:14,989
I tried to resist. I'm so sorry.

704
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:17,025
It's not your fault, okay?

705
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,194
And you're going to be fine.

706
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:20,662
I promise.

707
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:22,197
I'm-I'm gonna fix you.

708
00:30:22,232 --> 00:30:23,832
Okay?

709
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:30,839
Help me.

710
00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:35,143
Hello, Daniel.

711
00:30:35,178 --> 00:30:36,110
Whoa!

712
00:30:36,146 --> 00:30:37,498
Whoa, whoa!

713
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:39,045
She kissed me.

714
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:40,481
Literally no idea what
you're talking about.

715
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:41,449
Just get your hands up.

716
00:30:41,484 --> 00:30:42,550
No, don't be silly.

717
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:43,985
I'm not gonna stab you.

718
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,286
I'm just looking for something.

719
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:47,322
Come on, up. Up!

720
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:52,060
What are you looking for?

721
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:53,194
Uh...

722
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,963
- Hello.
- Whoa.

723
00:30:54,998 --> 00:30:56,731
What the...?

724
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,733
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

725
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:00,201
Ah.

726
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:01,536
Ah-ah-ah. It's my brother's.

727
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:04,005
He left it there for
safekeeping, so thanks for that.

728
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,673
You're a lifesaver.

729
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:07,475
Okay, Charlotte, this
has been a great chat,

730
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,310
but are you gonna confess or what?

731
00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:11,279
I'll never understand
why you concern yourselves

732
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:14,616
with one little human, but... fine.

733
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:16,818
Yes, I was involved in Chet's death,

734
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:19,053
but not in the way you think.

735
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:21,022
Well, correct me if I'm
wrong. You killed him.

736
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:23,358
You hired a cleaner to
take care of the body.

737
00:31:23,393 --> 00:31:24,673
And then you killed the cleaner.

738
00:31:24,694 --> 00:31:26,060
Is that it?

739
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:27,428
The cleaner's dead?

740
00:31:27,464 --> 00:31:28,529
What?

741
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:30,031
Oh, that's unfortunate.

742
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:32,533
I certainly had nothing to do with that.

743
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:35,069
But if you didn't, then who did?

744
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:36,204
Mom!

745
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,806
I've got it.

746
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:40,615
Now let the detective go.

747
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:41,309
Lucifer,

748
00:31:41,344 --> 00:31:42,677
put down the knife.

749
00:31:42,712 --> 00:31:44,612
You can't protect your mother anymore.

750
00:31:44,681 --> 00:31:46,180
I'm not protecting her.

751
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:47,815
It's you I'm trying to save.

752
00:31:47,851 --> 00:31:49,684
Now, here it is, Mum.

753
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:52,620
I have the blade and the final piece.

754
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:55,990
You let the detective
go, and they are yours.

755
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:57,592
Let me go? Really?

756
00:31:57,627 --> 00:31:58,782
I'm the one holding her.

757
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:00,647
- Mum?
- No one's going anywhere!

758
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:04,332
Oh, I think we found our mystery killer.

759
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,367
How can you be so glib?!

760
00:32:06,436 --> 00:32:07,702
You were our lawyer!

761
00:32:07,737 --> 00:32:09,037
You betrayed us!

762
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:10,238
Put the gun down, Hector.

763
00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:12,667
Thank you for leading
me to her, Detective.

764
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,410
You promised to approach
this fairly, and you did.

765
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:17,612
But now I have to make
things right for my family.

766
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:18,646
Ah!

767
00:32:18,682 --> 00:32:20,315
A little wrinkle.

768
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,482
You shoot her

769
00:32:21,518 --> 00:32:23,217
and we're all dead, okay?

770
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:26,854
I need a hospital.

771
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,356
Yes.

772
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:29,557
Okay.

773
00:32:29,592 --> 00:32:31,526
It's too far, Maze.

774
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:33,293
She won't make it.

775
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:36,264
We need to do something.

776
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:39,334
We need more time.

777
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:42,003
We just need more time.

778
00:32:53,383 --> 00:32:55,750
What are you doing?

779
00:32:55,785 --> 00:32:58,353
Look, it's very difficult to explain,

780
00:32:58,388 --> 00:33:00,154
but believe me when I say

781
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,194
that there are many,
many lives at stake here.

782
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,095
So, please, just put the gun down, huh?

783
00:33:11,668 --> 00:33:13,001
No!

784
00:33:33,323 --> 00:33:35,323
Amenadiel.

785
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:37,692
You son of a bitch.

786
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:43,264
How?

787
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:45,266
Go.

788
00:34:07,757 --> 00:34:09,924
I'm sorry, Mum.

789
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:14,328
But I'm afraid that this ends now.

790
00:34:19,316 --> 00:34:22,494
You've hurt so many
people, Mum. It has to stop.

791
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,179
You know that everything I've
done, I've done for, for us,

792
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:26,237
for our family.

793
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,150
You used me.

794
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:29,852
Used Chloe.

795
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:31,520
Me?

796
00:34:31,556 --> 00:34:33,022
What about your father?

797
00:34:33,057 --> 00:34:36,058
He created Chloe just to manipulate you.

798
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,728
Lucifer, look.

799
00:34:39,764 --> 00:34:41,564
We have the sword.

800
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,334
Finally, finally, we can get revenge.

801
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:48,037
We can destroy him.

802
00:34:48,072 --> 00:34:49,678
We can take our home back.

803
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:51,807
I'm not leaving, Mum!

804
00:34:51,843 --> 00:34:53,476
Okay.

805
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:55,811
I can take care of it for both of us.

806
00:34:55,847 --> 00:35:00,883
Just give me the sword,
and I'll do the rest.

807
00:35:02,902 --> 00:35:05,069
Please, son. I just...

808
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:08,657
I just want a chance to start over.

809
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:12,228
But... going home?

810
00:35:14,283 --> 00:35:16,832
That's not starting over, that's...

811
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:18,901
that's going backwards.

812
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:23,372
And that's not good for anyone.

813
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,179
So it's time for you
to move forward, Mum.

814
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:35,484
Even if it means I'll
never see you again.

815
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,420
Lucifer.

816
00:35:38,456 --> 00:35:39,955
No!

817
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:45,628
Bloody hell, it worked.

818
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:50,099
I guess it can cut through
anything, even the world itself.

819
00:35:50,134 --> 00:35:51,967
What is that?

820
00:35:52,036 --> 00:35:53,602
It's-it's nothing.

821
00:35:53,638 --> 00:35:56,438
At least, for now.

822
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:00,743
This is the real way
to move forward, Mum.

823
00:36:00,778 --> 00:36:04,547
To create a whole new world,
your own world, without Father.

824
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:06,815
But what about you?

825
00:36:06,851 --> 00:36:09,318
Amenadiel? My children?

826
00:36:09,353 --> 00:36:11,820
You know that if we go back to Heaven,

827
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:13,722
then there will be a war.

828
00:36:13,758 --> 00:36:15,558
And in war,

829
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:18,661
there are always casualties.

830
00:36:20,531 --> 00:36:24,733
The last thing I want
is to hurt my children.

831
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:26,669
I know.

832
00:36:26,704 --> 00:36:28,971
So, please,

833
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:32,474
let there be light.

834
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:40,382
My angel.

835
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:45,154
I will miss you...

836
00:36:45,189 --> 00:36:47,289
so much.

837
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,520
Hey.

838
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:27,122
I'm sorry, Daniel. She didn't...

839
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:30,225
die.

840
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,829
Mum?

841
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:39,201
"Mom"?

842
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:42,237
My kids are... ten.

843
00:38:42,273 --> 00:38:44,707
Right, of course.

844
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:46,542
Charlotte.

845
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:50,095
What's... what's going on?

846
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:52,181
Uh, why am I at the beach?

847
00:38:52,216 --> 00:38:53,716
You fell off the pier.

848
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:55,951
I fell off the...?

849
00:38:55,986 --> 00:38:57,419
It's-it's okay. I got you.

850
00:38:57,455 --> 00:38:59,822
Who are you?

851
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:12,034
So what do you think
will happen to Charlotte?

852
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:15,782
Well, given her law firm's
track record, probably not much.

853
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,966
You know, the more I think
about it, the more I think

854
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:19,758
that Hector killed both victims.

855
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:21,421
What, you think he
killed his own brother?

856
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:23,108
I think you would be the first to agree.

857
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,481
You know, things between
families can get pretty heated.

858
00:39:26,484 --> 00:39:28,317
Yes. Heated.

859
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:30,786
Oh, and Ella found a Mondo
blowtorch in Hector's car,

860
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:32,788
- so there's that.
- Right.

861
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:35,557
The only thing I still
don't understand is

862
00:39:35,593 --> 00:39:37,960
you seemed to have some inkling of this

863
00:39:37,995 --> 00:39:40,028
from the very beginning, so...

864
00:39:40,064 --> 00:39:41,330
why didn't you let me in on it?

865
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:44,166
Well, you...

866
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:46,902
'Cause at this point, you
either trust me or you don't.

867
00:39:46,937 --> 00:39:48,472
Detective, I trust you...

868
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:50,672
Look, if you think that
I wouldn't forgive you

869
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,908
for your mistakes or your flaws,

870
00:39:52,943 --> 00:39:56,345
if you think that I don't
know who you really are by now,

871
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,746
you're wrong.

872
00:40:11,377 --> 00:40:12,961
Linda, look at you.

873
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:16,465
Lucifer.

874
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,618
I'm okay.

875
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,502
This is my fault.

876
00:40:20,538 --> 00:40:22,371
I-I should never have got you involved

877
00:40:22,406 --> 00:40:24,139
in any of this from the start.

878
00:40:24,175 --> 00:40:25,775
It's not like I didn't
know I was dealing

879
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:29,111
with the most powerful, well...

880
00:40:29,146 --> 00:40:31,146
the most dysfunctional family

881
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:33,248
in the universe.

882
00:40:35,953 --> 00:40:38,287
Lucifer.

883
00:40:38,322 --> 00:40:41,857
I walked into this
with my eyes wide open,

884
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:44,993
chose to be your friend

885
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:47,696
and face all that comes with that.

886
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:49,164
The good,

887
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
the bad and the crispy.

888
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,571
What?

889
00:40:55,606 --> 00:40:59,975
I just realized something
that I need to do.

890
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:04,880
But... let's focus on you, shall we?

891
00:41:04,915 --> 00:41:07,783
That's enough about me.

892
00:41:12,823 --> 00:41:16,058
Detective. Hello, it's me.

893
00:41:16,093 --> 00:41:18,093
Lucifer.

894
00:41:18,128 --> 00:41:20,863
Um, I just wanted to apologize

895
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:24,566
for being, well, for being so elusive.

896
00:41:24,602 --> 00:41:28,937
But I also wanted to say
that I am done hiding.

897
00:41:28,973 --> 00:41:33,275
So I'm coming over now to
tell you the truth about me.

898
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,144
'Cause I think it's time
I finally opened your eyes

899
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,716
as to why strange things
sometimes happen around me.

900
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:44,426
Why my brother's so saintly
and Maze is so... not.

901
00:41:45,565 --> 00:41:48,757
And I'm so... well, magnetic.

902
00:41:50,494 --> 00:41:52,728
No, but s-seriously, I...

903
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:55,831
I want to tell you everything.

904
00:41:55,866 --> 00:41:58,734
