00:00:01,503 --> 00:00:02,921
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,632
DAN: <i>You stalked your father's
murderer right before he was killed.</i>

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,967
CHLOE:
<i>I know this looks bad.</i>

4
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:08,927
<i>Whoever killed Joe Fields
killed my father.</i>

5
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,387
LUCIFER: <i>What, you think
the warden did it?</i>

6
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:11,721
CHLOE:
<i>This man killed my father.</i>

7
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,014
You tore

8
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:14,349
apart my family.

9
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:15,934
I can get you whatever you want.

10
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:17,477
All I want is for you to know

11
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:19,437
that John Decker's kid got you.

12
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,147
DAN: <i>His name is Boris Sokolov.
He connects criminals,</i>

13
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:22,565
<i>but he always keeps
his own hands clean.</i>

14
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:24,693
People call me
Human Lie Detector.

15
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,444
So, you point me
in the right direction

16
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:28,405
or I'm gonna make your
life a living hell.

17
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:30,740
Mom, this is Lucifer.
Lucifer, Mom.

18
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:31,992
Mama Decker.

19
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,035
You shall remain
right here

20
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:36,746
on Earth amongst the creatures
you so despise.

21
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:39,708
You're going to send me into
the life of Charlotte Richards?

22
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,960
I thought I'd dive
into my employment.

23
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:44,045
I was pretty surprised
when you called me.

24
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:45,588
MOM:
<i>You are fairly attractive.</i>

25
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,299
The only place I've ever felt

26
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:50,719
wanted or respected...

27
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:52,220
Is here with humanity?!

28
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,139
This is my home!

29
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,348
Deal with it, Mother!

30
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:56,891
MOM:
<i>You seem attached</i>

31
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,728
<i>to these creatures
and I can't figure out why.</i>

32
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:03,023
Let me at least buy you dinner
tonight to celebrate.

33
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,450
(beeping)

34
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:31,384
Excuse me.

35
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:32,302
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- I'll get it for you.

36
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,303
Thank you.

37
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,223
AMENADIEL:
You can't kill her, Mom.

38
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:39,559
Well, of course I can.

39
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:41,269
I just press this button.

40
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:42,854
Mom, please...

41
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,189
give me the detonator.

42
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:46,858
No.
This little bug is the reason

43
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,401
that Lucifer doesn't
want to go home.

44
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,361
Squash her, problem solved.

45
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,280
Are you really gonna make me
force it away from you?

46
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,533
Trust me,
you don't want to do that.

47
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:57,577
But I can't let you kill
Chloe, Mom.

48
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,954
(grunts)

49
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:00,997
Since when can you...

50
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:02,499
I tried to warn you.

51
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,918
Apparently, paltry
human flesh can't

52
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,961
contain my divinity.

53
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,838
Oh, here we go.

54
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,133
Bomb's in the car.

55
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:13,593
So exciting.

56
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,057
(giggles)

57
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,642
Mom, stop!

58
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,144
I am trying to help you.

59
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:25,063
I know Lucifer better
than he knows himself

60
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,564
and if you kill Chloe,

61
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,650
he won't rest
until he finds out who did it

62
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,318
and when he does, Mom,

63
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:31,778
he will hate you forever.

64
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,279
Come on.

65
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:36,825
One little human can't mean
more to him than his family.

66
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,868
He killed Uriel to protect her.

67
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:40,537
Well...

68
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:43,248
what's so damn special
about this one?

69
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:44,833
That I don't know.

70
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,334
But, Mom, the bottom line is

71
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:48,336
if we want Luci
to go home with us,

72
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:51,005
then we need to make sure
that it's his decision

73
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,215
to leave Chloe behind.

74
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:58,555
Well, that was anticlimactic.

75
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:00,014
(groans)

76
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,057
(shouts)

77
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:04,644
So, I need to find a more subtle way
to end Lucifer's silly crush.

78
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:06,604
(sighs)

79
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:08,481
LINDA:
<i>Tell me everything.</i>

80
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,649
Well, there's...

81
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:11,401
nothing to say, really.

82
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,195
You had a date...
with Chloe.

83
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:16,656
That's a big deal,
Lucifer.

84
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,324
I need to hear about it.

85
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,286
You know, as your therapist.

86
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:24,164
Well, for one, I wouldn't say
it was a big deal and...

87
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,083
it wasn't a date, just dinner...

88
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,002
more like a snack, actually,
between friends.

89
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,253
Oh, how was the food?

90
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,754
I've heard their branzino
is amazing.

91
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,300
Well, yeah, it's...
hard to say, really.

92
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:36,718
Too caught up in the moment
to notice?

93
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,428
Caught up, in-in a way, yes.

94
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:41,723
You chickened out, didn't you?

95
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,683
(laughing):
What?

96
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,143
I'm the Devil, Doctor.

97
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:46,895
I don't chicken out.

98
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:48,229
- Ah.
- I just simply
thought that she should

99
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:49,314
enjoy the food
without any...

100
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:51,399
distractions.

101
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:53,276
Listen, you
know, I get it.

102
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:54,944
Our last breakthrough
spooked you

103
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,696
and now you're running scared.

104
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:59,324
I don't "run scared"
any more than I "chicken."

105
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:01,034
(chuckles)
Not literally.

106
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,452
But you're avoiding
the truth.

107
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,620
Also known as lying.

108
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:05,914
That I know I don't do... ever.

109
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:06,748
But yet...

110
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:08,875
you are lying, Lucifer...

111
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:09,959
(laughs)

112
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,252
...to yourself.

I owe you an explanation.

119
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,020
Really? Why?

120
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:30,813
Was it for...

121
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,899
leaving me all alone
at a restaurant so the busboy

122
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,817
could give me pitiful
glances all night?

123
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,402
I know what your explanation is
and I don't want

124
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,279
to know her name,
especially not today.

125
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:40,073
Actually, Detective, that isn't
what I was going to say, I...

126
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,908
Look, Lucifer,
I don't have time for this.

127
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,493
I was just on my way out.

128
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,203
Besides, this is my fault.

129
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,914
I should've known how selfish
and thoughtless you can be.

130
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:48,957
Lucifer.

131
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:49,958
(chuckles)

132
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,376
How thoughtful.

133
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:52,460
Penelope.

134
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,337
You are the sweetest

135
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,881
to come support us
on such a difficult day.

136
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,882
- Oh.
- I bet you

137
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:59,259
an arm and a leg, Mom,

138
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:00,802
that he has no idea
what today is.

139
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,762
Well, that's rather unwise
of you to wager your lovely

140
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,305
extremities, Detective.

141
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:05,640
Particularly
as I'm perfectly aware

142
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:06,766
of what today is, actually.

143
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,726
It's a very difficult day...

144
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:09,811
because...

145
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,646
- Today.
- Today is...

146
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,356
- The first day
- the first day...

147
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,108
- of the
- of...

148
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,193
- trial of
- the trial of...

149
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,028
- my dad's killer.
- my dad's killer!

150
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,531
Nietzsche? No, wait.

151
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,032
Your dad's killer.
Yes, no, I knew that.

152
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,784
I knew that. That's why
I'm here, to support you.

153
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:26,828
Not talk about myself
'cause that would be selfish.

154
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:27,787
- Yeah.
- So...

155
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:28,830
consider me

156
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:29,998
an emotional jockstrap

157
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,041
for the Decker family jewels.
(chuckles)

158
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:36,129
(whistling)

159
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,213
Hey.

160
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:39,173
Hmm, someone's chirpy
for a Monday morning.

161
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:40,008
(chuckles)

162
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,217
Yes, I am.

163
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:42,844
Why?

164
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,178
What's going on?

165
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,014
What, do I need
an excuse to be happy?

166
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,349
Hmm, I mean,
you're whistling.

167
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,643
You've been...
working out lately.

168
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:51,686
- Mm.
- (sniffs)

169
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,730
Musk-scented aftershave.

170
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,149
Did you...

171
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:57,150
get laid?

172
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,151
(laughs)

173
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,193
(scoffs)
No.

174
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,029
Oh, no, no.

175
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,864
Don't waste your poker
face on me, buddy;

176
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,574
I know that grin.

177
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,201
I'm still in shock.

178
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,077
I knew it.

179
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:09,704
- She's gorgeous.
- Yeah, well,

180
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,205
- it's not like you're Quasimodo.
- No, no, no, no.

181
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:12,623
Trust me,
she is way out of my league.

182
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:13,708
I mean, she is

183
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,959
goddess-like.

184
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:16,878
And she came back for seconds.

185
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:20,214
Then maybe she's the one who
sent you the mystery package.

186
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:23,217
A mystery package?

187
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:24,302
Mm-hmm.

188
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:30,141
I don't recognize
the return address.

189
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,064
Oh, jeez.

190
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:37,065
God!

191
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:39,484
(sighs)

192
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,570
Wish I could say
it was my first.

193
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,743
That's Boris.

194
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,703
Chloe's gonna lose it.

195
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:58,252
So poised.

196
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,963
The detective obviously
gets her strength from you.

197
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,340
(scoffs)
This?

198
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,758
It's just acting.

199
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:07,178
Sadly, I've had... practice.

200
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,765
I played this role before,
16 years ago.

201
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,059
Well, maybe it's
like butt stuff.

202
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:15,603
Easier the second
time around.

203
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,942
(whispering):
The severed head
of Boris Sokolov

204
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,110
just arrived at the precinct.

205
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:23,569
(whispering):
That's horrible!

206
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:24,904
Who's Boris?

207
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,239
He's the prosecution's
key witness.

208
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,740
He's our key witness.

209
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,076
He was the only person
that could connect Perry

210
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,494
to the Russian gang.
I mean, without him,

211
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,162
the entire case
could fall apart.

212
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,580
Oh, God.

213
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,707
How very convenient
for Mr. Perry.

214
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,251
(sighs)

215
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:46,300

I had no idea
Charlotte Richards

228
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:31,554
was defending Perry.

229
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,598
Wishing we hadn't saved
her life about now.

230
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,057
Well, not to worry,
Detective.

231
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:36,517
I hear Charlotte
is a changed woman

232
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,019
since her
disappearance, so...

233
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:40,229
maybe she's not the
shark she once was.

234
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,190
At least not in the courtroom.

235
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:43,232
All rise.

236
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,692
Court is now in session.

237
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,736
The Honorable Judge Estrada
presiding.

238
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:48,863
Given the sudden death

239
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,573
of the State's
number one witness,

240
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,576
I assume the defense
is moving for a dismissal?

241
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,661
A motion for dismissal?

242
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:57,997
Why would I want that,
Your Honor?

243
00:08:58,206 --> 00:08:59,916
(chuckles)
Looks like Jaws

244
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:01,375
has been harpooned.

245
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:02,376
MOM:
My apologies.

246
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,045
I'm a little...
out of practice.

247
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,671
Um...

248
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,215
Oh, I see.

249
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,175
You're saying that
with Boris dead,

250
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:11,802
the State doesn't have
enough evidence to proceed?

251
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,679
So, if I don't
move for dismissal,

252
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,390
then he'll probably make
a complete fool of himself?

253
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,558
Your Honor,
our case was

254
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,644
and still is unshakable.

255
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,187
The State has plenty

256
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,773
of other evidence
that'll prove 16 years ago,

257
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:24,941
the defendant, Perry Smith,

258
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,776
murdered
Officer John Decker

259
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,028
and paid Joe Fields to go
to prison for that crime.

260
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:30,488
Oh, and when Fields
wanted out of their deal,

261
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:31,906
Perry also killed him.

262
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,115
Your Honor,
with all due respect,

263
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,116
granting a dismissal

264
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,409
would be ludicrous.

265
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,786
Boris Sokolov's death,

266
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,872
while undoubtedly tragic,

267
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,290
changes nothing.

268
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,293
Well, the defense agrees.

269
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:45,503
What?

270
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,297
His death doesn't
change a single thing.

271
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:50,883
With or without
Mr. Sokolov's testimony,

272
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,552
my client should never
have been charged

273
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,719
with these crimes.

274
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:55,930
Well...

275
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,349
seeing as both parties agree,

276
00:09:58,558 --> 00:09:59,976
the trial will proceed
immediately.

277
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:00,977
Actually, Your Honor,

278
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,311
the State would like to, uh,

279
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,729
request a continuance.

280
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,107
In light of the death
of our key witness,

281
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,526
our office needs time
to, uh, reexamine

282
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:09,819
its strategy.

283
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,153
But I'm confused,
Your Honor.

284
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:12,863
Didn't we just hear
the prosecution say

285
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,740
their case was
"unshakable"?

286
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,784
We did.

287
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:18,202
Request denied.

288
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,955
Session will resume after lunch.

289
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,087
What the hell are you doing,
Mother?

290
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:29,422
Oh, calm down, Lucifer.

291
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,048
This isn't pleasant
for me, either.

292
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,092
Oh, yes, I can see
you're suffering terribly.

293
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:35,344
I was good up there,
wasn't I?

294
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,763
Not sure why humans spend
so much time in law school.

295
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:38,806
Two nights seemed plenty.

296
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:39,765
Mum.

297
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,019
I had to find a way
to open your eyes.

298
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,062
You need to see that
this Chloe you so adore

299
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:46,105
isn't worthy of you.

300
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:47,064
(scoffs)

301
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:48,733
I admit I enjoy working
with her, but adore,

302
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:49,609
that's a bit much.

303
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:52,028
Oh, please. You've sacrificed
more for her

304
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,779
than you ever have
for anyone else.

305
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,657
Have you forgotten?
You killed your brother,

306
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,284
my son, to protect her.

307
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,537
Do you think there's anything
even remotely similar

308
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:02,538
that she would do for you?

309
00:11:03,623 --> 00:11:04,540
I suppose...

310
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,167
I don't know.

311
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,336
Well, if all goes according
to plan in that courtroom,

312
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:09,420
you will know.

313
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:11,005
Know that she doesn't
deserve you,

314
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,423
because she doesn't
care about you

315
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:13,966
like you care about her.

316
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:16,594
You need to see that you're
not meant to be together.

317
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,220
You belong with your family.

318
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:19,889
Which is why
I have to do this.

319
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,682
Do what, Mum?

320
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,354
What sort of evil plan
are you concocting?

321
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,731
And please don't tell me
it began by killing Boris.

322
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,775
Oh, actually, that was
just a happy twist of fate.

323
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,068
I was gonna
blow Chloe up,

324
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,361
but Amenadiel
talked me out of it.

325
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:34,862
You what?!

326
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,990
Mother, I swear,
if you hurt her, I will rip--

327
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,660
Well, looks like
your brother was right.

328
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:45,247
Just promise me that
you won't touch her.

329
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,752
I'm not going to hurt anyone.

330
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,468
Lucifer, you promise me,

331
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:00,096
whatever that was, that
it doesn't affect the trial.

332
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,431
First of all, Detective,
there is no "that."

333
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,518
And secondly, rest assured,
everything will be okay.

334
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,145
I've got this.

335
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,531
You looking for Boris'
forensics report?

336
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,532
(sighs)

337
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:20,908
Uh-huh.

338
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:22,326
Hasn't come in yet.

339
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:23,828
Ella should have it
any minute now.

340
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,789
I know this isn't my case,
but I'm freaking out, Dan.

341
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,416
I can't let Perry get
away with everything.

342
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:29,458
You won't.

343
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,627
You didn't see Charlotte
Richards in court today.

344
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:32,628
(high-pitched): Char--?
(clears his throat)

345
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:34,004
I'm sorry. Uh,

346
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,048
Charlotte Richards
is, uh, defending Perry?

347
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,133
Yeah.

348
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,135
Really?
She's that good?

349
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,053
Yes, she's
the best.

350
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,055
Which is why it would
be helpful if we could--

351
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:45,057
Well, if you could tie
Perry to Boris' murder.

352
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,601
Okay, well, motive
and M.O. line up.

353
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,437
Boris' tongue was cut out.

354
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,440
So the killer was sending
a really clear message--

355
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,567
loose lips get
their head clipped.

356
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,361
Perry did this so Boris
couldn't testify, I know it.

357
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,572
But hasn't he been behind bars
since you arrested him?

358
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,906
Yeah, but he could have
orchestrated it in prison.

359
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,074
It's also his M.O.

360
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,993
Exactly, and if Perry
is good at anything,

361
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,661
it's making other people
pay for his crimes.

362
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,580
Okay, well, whoever
Perry hired to do this

363
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:08,789
was one sharp dude.

364
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:11,500
The cut on Boris' neck
is extremely precise.

365
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:14,503
I'm thinking industrial-size
professional slicer.

366
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:18,340
Listen, I'm gonna do
everything I can to find him.

367
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,342
Even if I have to interview
the owner

368
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,052
of every single
meat slicer in L.A.

369
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:23,637
ELLA:
You won't have to.

370
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:27,141
There was also
non-human DNA on Boris.

371
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,517
Swine, to be exact.

372
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,020
A unique cross-bred
for its delicious meat.

373
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,481
And there's only
one place that sells it.

374
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,110
Ah!

375
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:39,403
Hi.

376
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,697
That's so sweet of you, but you
don't have to stick around.

377
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:43,157
- Trials can be so boring.
- Well,

378
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,116
not this one.

379
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,326
What do you mean?

380
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,494
Mr. Morningstar,

381
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:48,078
we're ready for you.

382
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,247
Wonderful.
Lovely. Right.

383
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:53,459
Off I go to shield you from
that Quid Pro Ho, Detective.

384
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:55,920
Lucifer, what are you doing?

385
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,047
Well, I figured
there's no reason for us

386
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,800
to lose our heads just
because Boris lost his.

387
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,971
I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

388
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,182
and nothing but the truth,

389
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,601
so help me Dad.

390
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,152
Mr. Morningstar,

391
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,947
you were there
when Boris was arrested.

392
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:25,032
Right? Working with
Detective Espinoza.

393
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,117
That is correct.

394
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,786
Except I call him
Detective Douche.

395
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,120
(laughter)

396
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:31,580
But that's another story.

397
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:34,708
So would you
please describe to us

398
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:35,876
what happened?

399
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,169
Yes, I'd love to, actually.

400
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:38,337
May-may I have the floor?

401
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:39,213
By all means.

402
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,548
LUCIFER:
Thank you.

403
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:43,050
I'm going to need...

404
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:44,802
Hello.

405
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,303
May I borrow your scarf?

406
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,639
Your Honor,
is this necessary?

407
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:50,850
Well, you want
the full story, don't you?

408
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,893
I mean, the Devil's
in the details.

409
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:55,145
Thank you ever so much.

410
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,066
Right. Myself
and Detective Douche--

411
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:00,776
sorry, Detective Espinoza--

412
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:02,444
were asked by the LAPD

413
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:03,863
to perform a sting operation.

414
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,197
Not the singer.

415
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,867
- (laughter)
- So we had to go undercover

416
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,034
at Boris' bathhouse.

417
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,578
Guns of steel...

418
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,413
Got up there...
(imitated slashing sound)

419
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,914
Walked over like
he's constantly got

420
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:15,499
a gun between his legs...

421
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,419
Boris looked me in the eye,
and he said,

422
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,504
(Russian accent): "People call
me human lie detector."

423
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:21,547
He was going to kill...

424
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,216
Shook my hand like
some kind of Roman warrior...

425
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:27,469
...and it was sealed, and I
handed over the investigation

426
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,680
to Detective Decker.

427
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,181
- Thank you.
- (laughter, applause)

428
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,516
♪ Stop draggin' me down ♪

429
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:33,726
♪♪

430
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,146
♪ Stop dragging me down, yeah. ♪

431
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,774
DAN:
I got a question.

432
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,735
Do you ever get the feeling
like you've been used?

433
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,571
You mean, by--
oh, I don't know--

434
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,575
the woman who's defending the
killer of your ex-wife's dad?

435
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:50,618
What?

436
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,494
Charlotte Richards is
the gorgeous lady

437
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:53,662
you slept with, right?

438
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,456
How the hell did
you know that?

439
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,042
Well, I saw a long,
honey-blonde hair

440
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,376
on your coat the other day.

441
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,629
It was curlier than Chloe's.
And then,

442
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,464
I spotted a smudge of lipstick

443
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,382
on your cuff--
burgundy shade.

444
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,552
Bold, but not too sexy.
Lawyer color.

445
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,054
Really?

446
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:12,765
No. I just saw
your butt pucker

447
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,142
when Chloe mentioned her name
in the lab this morning.

448
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,226
God.

449
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,771
Why are you so worried?

450
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,564
I mean, you didn't tell her
anything about the case

451
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,441
that she could
use in court, right?

452
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,693
- I don't think so, but...
- There you go.

453
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:26,987
- Mezcal cocktails, man.

454
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:28,948
Oof. Those sneak up on you.

455
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,991
She did keep wanting
to talk about our exes,

456
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,202
and all I thought was, you know
what, she's so easy to talk to.

457
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,328
She's so sympathetic.

458
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,746
God, I'm such an idiot.

459
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:37,831
- Hey...
- No, her taking Perry's case

460
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,333
right after we...

461
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,834
It can't be a coincidence.

462
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,002
Why not?

463
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,297
- Maybe she really
just likes you.
- Yeah.

464
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:46,924
- WOMAN: 44.
- ELLA: Hi. We'll take

465
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,468
the headless body of a dude
named Boris, please.

466
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,973
I was going
to call you guys.

467
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,058
I was just... scared.

468
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,394
A few days ago,
this guy approached me.

469
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,104
Big creepy dude.

470
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,106
He demanded the keys to use
the equipment after hours.

471
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:04,358
No questions asked,
unless I wanted

472
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,693
to end up in the sausage myself.

473
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,695
- Do you know his name?
- No.

474
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:09,947
Asian, big.

475
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,240
Very scary.

476
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:17,037
But the scar on his neck
it's very distinctive.

477
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:19,373
Thank you, Mr. Morningstar.

478
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,542
What a, uh, vivid picture.

479
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,378
It's almost as if Boris
himself just testified.

480
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,672
JUDGE: (quietly): Except
a more handsome version.

481
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,674
Oh, stop it, Judy.

482
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:29,717
(chuckles)

483
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:30,884
(clears throat)
Thank you.

484
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:32,761
Right actually,
to that,

485
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,263
I would like to add one
more thing, if I may...

486
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,557
I think we've had
enough, Your Honor.

487
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,392
Shh!
Please...

488
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,519
continue Luc--

489
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:42,980
Mr. Morningstar.

490
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,481
Thank you, my darling.

491
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,736
Yes, I'd just like to say,
for the record,

492
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:52,781
the LAPD, and Detective Decker,
in particular,

493
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,200
acted impeccably
on this case.

494
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,454
This whole courtroom,
nay, the entire city

495
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,081
can rest assured that
someone as honest,

496
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,585
trustworthy, and reliable
as Detective Decker

497
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,837
is out there
protecting them.

498
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:10,257
She is... truly good.

499
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:12,760
And I don't mean in bed.

500
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,011
I wouldn't know.

501
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:15,929
That's how good she is.

502
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:18,265
Thank you.

503
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,267
Miss Richards?

504
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:21,894
Your witness.

505
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,608
I have no questions
at this time.

506
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,487
(thunder crashes)

507
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:41,789
Hey!

508
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:42,790
That's Chloe's car.

509
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:43,874
What are you looking for?

510
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:44,917
Hey.

511
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,169
I was, um...

512
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:48,879
You.

513
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,631
I was looking for you.

514
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:52,382
Really?

515
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,759
Yeah, I've missed you.

516
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,055
It's true, I still
think about you, Maze.

517
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,433
Every day. And every time
that I see you, it's...

518
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,562
I miss you, too.

519
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,405
It's like fireworks, isn't it?

520
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,324
(chuckles)

521
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,326
But are you sure
that's the kind

522
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,661
you're looking for?

523
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:26,792
Or was it this?

524
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:35,175
One-- tell your mother no one
is hurting Chloe on my watch.

525
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,135
And, two--

526
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,719
don't ever lie
to me like that again.

527
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,114
STEDMAN:
And what did Boris have to say

528
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,199
when you interrogated him?

529
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,368
He confessed that he
routinely provided fall guys

530
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:04,163
for the Russian gang
that runs the prison

531
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,123
where the defendants worked
since the late '90s.

532
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,041
STEDMAN: And is there
anything else

533
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,044
that is remarkable
about this prison?

534
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,713
It is the very prison
whose corruption

535
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,089
John Decker was investigating

536
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:15,757
when he was murdered
16 years ago.

537
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,134
Holy cow.

538
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,970
It's all so coincidental,
isn't it?

539
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:24,016
Just like the odd timing
of Boris' murder.

540
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,018
I withdraw that,
Your Honor.

541
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,227
No further questions.

542
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:28,979
Thank you, Detective.

543
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,319
I have no questions
for this witness.

544
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,945
STEDMAN:
The prosecution rests,
Your Honor.

545
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,365
Your turn to shine,
Ms. Richards.

546
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,451
As its first witness,

547
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,329
the defense would like
to recall Lucifer Morningstar.

548
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,586
Oh, it's fine.

549
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,590
Just one small question,
Mr. Morningstar.

550
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,508
And please remember
that you're still

551
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,177
under oath.

552
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,012
Who was first on the
Fields crime scene?

553
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,599
First on the scene was
the detective, I believe.

554
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,601
I'm sorry, which detective?

555
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:08,602
Detective Decker.

556
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:10,896
MOM:
Are you sure?
How do you know?

557
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,397
LUCIFER:
Quite sure.
Yeah, she told me.

558
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,815
It's kind of strange,
isn't it,

559
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,442
for the man accused
of killing John Decker

560
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,070
to be found dead
by Decker's own daughter,

561
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:18,904
Chloe Decker?

562
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,364
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

563
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,448
I'm getting to that.

564
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:23,325
Would you please read who,

565
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,702
according to the
official police report,

566
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,371
was the first officer
on the scene?

567
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:31,250
(whispering):
What's wrong?

568
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:32,584
I'll tell you later.

569
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,753
Well, it says
Detective Espinoza.

570
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,673
I thought you said Chloe Decker
was an impeccable detective.

571
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,091
Objection, Your Honor!

572
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,259
No, I-I'd like
to answer that.

573
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,219
She is. That's why she

574
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,429
took herself off the
investigation immediately.

575
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,099
But not until after she'd found
her dad's killer dead?

576
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,558
- (groans)
- STEDMAN: Objection!

577
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,602
What's he objecting to--
air quotes?

578
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,438
I'm simply stating that
if what we just heard is true,

579
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,649
then there's a very plausible
alternative story

580
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,734
to the one that the State
is presenting.

581
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,320
Chloe Decker had motive,
opportunity,

582
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,990
and the LAPD to protect her
and help her frame

583
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,284
an innocent man
for her personal vendetta.

584
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:06,785
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

585
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,079
Chloe Decker
is not on trial here.

586
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,789
MOM: And my client
shouldn't be, either.

587
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,499
Because it appears
he is the victim

588
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,501
of the LAPD's incompetence.

589
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,922
Unless, of course,
the report is right,

590
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:22,217
and it is you that is lying,
Mr. Morningstar?

591
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:26,513
What you're implying
is preposterous.

592
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:28,348
The Detective
would never hurt anyone.

593
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,812
But yes.

594
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,689
What I said is the truth.

595
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,399
Under oath or otherwise.

596
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:39,526
I don't lie.

597
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:46,825
LUCIFER:
<i>Detective?</i>

598
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,411
- LUCIFER: Please.
- CHLOE: Trust me, you do not
want to talk to me right now.

599
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:50,996
You're right, I don't.
You look scary.

600
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:53,749
But look, I apologize
for my controversial testimony,

601
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,250
but I was clearly bamboozled.

602
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,878
You didn't expect me to lie
on the stand, did you?

603
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,173
It's not about your answers.

604
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,841
It's about Charlotte's
questions.

605
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,177
She wouldn't have even asked
them unless she already knew

606
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,803
I was first on scene.

607
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:08,764
Let's see.
Who could've told her?

608
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,474
Detective, I didn't.

609
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,059
You say that,
but you also said

610
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,062
your relationship with Charlotte
wouldn't affect this trial.

611
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,646
It just did.

612
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,068
Detective!

613
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,779
♪♪

614
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:30,619
Charlotte?

615
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,121
How could you do this to me?

616
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,414
What exactly?

617
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,166
I've done several things to you.

618
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,335
Did you sleep with me
to get Intel on this case?

619
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:41,254
Of course, but it's not like you
didn't get anything out of it.

620
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,882
"Mind altering,"
I believe you called it.

621
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,759
Yeah, literally, apparently.

622
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,345
Because I don't remember telling
you anything about this case.

623
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,057
- DAN: Did you roofie me or something?
- CHARLOTTE: I didn't need to.

624
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:55,143
I've learned sex puts your
gender into a mild coma.

625
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:57,729
Offered the perfect window
to go through your phone.

626
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,064
So, maybe...

627
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,191
next time, you should
put your phone away

628
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,567
before we have the sex.

629
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:03,443
"Next time"?

630
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:04,528
Mm-hmm.

631
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:05,904
Are you insane?

632
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,449
(whispers):
You tell me.

633
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:15,872
(sighs)

634
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,668
LINDA: I wish I could say
that I'm surprised

635
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,044
Maze blew up your car.

636
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,254
She is...

637
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,131
Maze.

638
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:25,298
I know, right?

639
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,092
Slightest provocation,

640
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,052
- and she turns into a little...
- LINDA: Hellion?

641
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,470
Exactly.

642
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:32,431
Let me ask you though...

643
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,142
Why do you think
that she reacted so...

644
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:36,977
passionately?

645
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,604
Because she's a complete maniac
fueled by rage and violence.

646
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,525
Now, as your friend,
not your... therapist,

647
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:47,279
you feel you did
nothing at all to anger her?

648
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,697
Well, s...

649
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,450
Maybe not nothing.

650
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,286
I may have obscured
the truth a bit.

651
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,912
- Otherwise known as lying.
- Linda,

652
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,498
I had no choice.
You have to understand that.

653
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,292
Oh, I do. Oh, I do.
You were... you were dealing

654
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,169
with matters
of great importance.

655
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:04,629
So important,
you feel justified

656
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,465
to act any way you see fit.

657
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:09,759
Even if that means hurting
people you care about.

658
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:12,637
You "did what you had to do."

659
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,389
(exhales)

660
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:16,683
That's, uh...

661
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:18,393
that's what I did to you.

662
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,064
I treated Maze the same way
that I treated you.

663
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,275
Yeah, except I'm
just your friend.

664
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:26,526
And Maze is...

665
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,446
well, more.

666
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,531
So, it's way worse.

667
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,074
And as my friend,

668
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:35,994
your advice is?

669
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:37,704
Apologize your ass off.

670
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:39,539
Or next time,
she might blow that up.

671
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:40,790
(sighs)

672
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:43,793
MAZE:
<i>Maybe you don't understand.</i>

673
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,671
Mommy Dearest
tried to kill Chloe.

674
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,715
Oh, I understand. She told me.

675
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:51,009
- MAZE: She did?
- LUCIFER: Yes. We're past that.

676
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,928
What I don't understand, though,

677
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,721
is how the detective
can think I'm the one

678
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,057
who leaked sensitive
information to my mum.

679
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:58,850
How could she?

680
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,936
Yeah, Chloe's the bad guy.

681
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:01,853
Mm.

682
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:05,023
- If only I knew who really gave
Mom that information.
- (elevator dings)

683
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,403
Right. If only.

684
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,073
Oh! Good. You came.

685
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,449
Yes, he did.

686
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:16,576
Thanks for coming, Dan.

687
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,911
Anything up lately?

688
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,246
I don't know. You tell me.

689
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,081
Lucifer called me here.

690
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:23,458
Yes. Well, I was thinking,
as my testimony didn't go

691
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,419
quite as planned, that it
might help fix things to prove

692
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,171
that Perry was behind
Boris' killing.

693
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,923
- DAN: Already working on it, man.
- LUCIFER: Fantastic!

694
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:31,633
Well then, please tell me you
have some scintillating

695
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,261
cop-speak on how to accomplish
that tiny task.

696
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:37,764
Well, uh, the guy who chopped
Boris's head off had this scar.

697
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:39,266
It's actually a brand.

698
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,476
Signature of the
Alhambra Triads,

699
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:42,978
they're a Chinese
crime syndicate.

700
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:44,771
Lots of them were
in the prison that Perry ran.

701
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:46,523
Triads hate the
Russians, so

702
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,275
makes sense to pit them
against each other.

703
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,610
Yeah. You should definitely
probe this angle.

704
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:52,904
Mm.
(sniffles)

705
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,615
Rumors are they use a Chinese
cultural center as a front.

706
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:58,118
Right. Well, let's start
there then, shall we?

707
00:26:59,077 --> 00:26:59,703
DAN:
<i>These guys</i>

708
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:01,288
are notoriously violent,
so let's try to get

709
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:02,706
in and out as quickly
as possible, all right?

710
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,207
Oh, speaking
of "in and out,"

711
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,586
this case really seems
to be touching you, Dan.

712
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,546
You know, in
a very personal way.

713
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,464
All right. Shh. Yeah.
It's personal, obviously.

714
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:12,882
Just try to keep it
down, all right?

715
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,593
Well, it's almost
like you want to take

716
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,595
Charlotte Richards
down yourself.

717
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:19,723
Like, way down,
and give her a hard time.

718
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,182
What are you trying
to say, Maze?

719
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,684
Yes, what are you
driving at, Maze?

720
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:23,768
"Driving at."

721
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:24,853
Good one.

722
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,479
N-No. I'm just...

723
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:30,775
really impressed with how
much Dan wants to penetrate

724
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,652
this thing from every

725
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,112
position.

726
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:35,989
You know?

727
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,907
- MAZE: Oh, yeah.
- LUCIFER: Know what?

728
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,784
I bet that's what she said,
didn't she? (titters)

729
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,870
Oh, yeah!

730
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,331
Oh,Dan!

731
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:45,832
- Big boy.
(growling):
- All right, all right!

732
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:46,958
Fine.

733
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,085
Yes. It's my fault.

734
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:51,546
I leaked the information
to Charlotte.

735
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,256
Among other things.

736
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:55,967
I'm why she knew Chloe
was first at the scene.

737
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,345
She must have looked at my
text messages after we...

738
00:27:58,553 --> 00:27:59,346
You what?

739
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,181
Made... love.

740
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,933
You slept with my... M-arlotte?

741
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,353
You bastard!

742
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,395
Whoa!

743
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,982

Oh, now look what you've done.

746
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,197
Wha--?

747
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,998
Da-da... Don't be a Dan.

748
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,583
I'll deal with this.

749
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,335
Right.

750
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,295
Which one of you chaps
is in charge?

751
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,173
Oh, very well.

752
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,592

753
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:39,135
DAN:
You speak Chinese?

754
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,054
- DAN: What...?
- LUCIFER: I'm the Devil.

755
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:42,847
Of course I speak Chinese.
I speak everything.

Right, Mom.
A real pro.

836
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,089

Don't you dare.

839
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,429
No father in the world was
more proud of his daughter

840
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:10,555
than your dad.

841
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,016

Justice is what
we all want, dear.

847
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:25,945
For your father,

848
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,530
and for my client.

849
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:32,577
You're a mother.

850
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:33,786
Aren't you?

851
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:35,121
Yes.

852
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,956
Then shame on you.

853
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,255
We need to talk.

854
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:51,429
Man, he better be here.

855
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,014
If we can convince him

No more talk

858

of that disgusting
offense, please.

859
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,398
I thought you said
you hadn't slept with her.

860
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:05,193
I haven't,
wouldn't ever.

861
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:06,945
I'm just upset
for the detective.

862
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:07,862
What, you think I'm not?

863
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,155
I would do anything
to right this.

864
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,199
(sighs):
I know you would.

865
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:20,875
LAPD! Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

866
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:26,172
Whoa!

867
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,426
Well, looks like
we found Boris,

868
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:32,178
at the head
of the table, ironically.

869
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:35,014
And that's Da Young.
I'd say we were right.

870
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:36,808
Perry hired him to go
behind the Triad's back

871
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:39,185
to kill Boris, knowing that
they'd punish him for it.

872
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,854
Clever Perry, killed two birds
with one stone.

873
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,273

the chicken.

CHLOE:
<i>You've got a lot of nerve.</i>

875
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,491
Yes, I've been told.

876
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:54,867
And legs for days.

877
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,328
Now, listen,
you're losing bad.

878
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,163
Without Boris, the
prosecution's evidence

879
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:00,456
is mostly circumstantial.

880
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:01,958
And, unfortunately for you,

881
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,501
Lucifer's testimony
basically handed me

882
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,044
a non-guilty verdict.

883
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:07,088
This trial is over.

884
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:08,798
Maybe.

885
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:11,342
But the investigation
into that monster

886
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:13,928
that you call a client
is ongoing.

887
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:15,805
So one way or another,

888
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:18,182
- he wi--

889
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,934
Hmm.

890
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:20,935
Bad news?

891
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:23,646
I may have a solution.

892
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:28,192
My client isn't fully
aware we're winning.

893
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,694
However, he is
more than aware

894
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,029
that he's facing
the death penalty.

895
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,281
And we both know
he's a coward.

896
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,950
I could use
the possibility

897
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,703
of a lethal injection
to get him to plead guilty.

898
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:39,871
You're supposed to be
on his side.

899
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:40,913
Why are you doing this?

900
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,498
Well, there is one condition.

901
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,043
You'd have to betray Lucifer.

902
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:47,795
So...

903
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,215
you want Perry to go to jail,

904
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,134
call Lucifer a liar.

905
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:55,219
"A liar"?

906
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:59,057
If there's one thing he cares
about more than anything,

907
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,184
it's his honor.

908
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:04,520
See you in court.

909
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,106
(clears her throat)

910
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:08,691
MOM:
<i>Detective Decker,</i>

911
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,110
Lucifer Morningstar
is your partner, correct?

912
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:11,944
Yes.

913
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:14,781
He's a civilian
consultant for the LAPD.

914
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:16,199
We work cases together.

915
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:18,242
And how is he qualified
for this role?

916
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,996
He is very, uh, intuitive.

917
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:25,374
He, um, understands
people's desires.

918
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,417
MOM: And in
addition to that,

919
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,419
I assume he studied
law enforcement?

920
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,715
Not to my knowledge, no.

921
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:34,717
MOM:
Oh, okay.

922
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:36,427
But he has
a professional background,

923
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:38,429
which is somehow relevant
to law enforcement?

924
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:39,722
He owns a nightclub.

925
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:41,474
MOM:
Okay, but then,

926
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:44,268
I'm sure his previous job
was more relevant to his role

927
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:46,187
as a civilian consultant
for the LAPD?

928
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,314
- Right?
- Mm.

929
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:50,983
Well, if you
believe his claims

930
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,068
that he used to run Hell...

931
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:54,487
(chokes, clears throat)

932
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:59,242
...then yes, he's accustomed
to punishing bad guys.

933
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,576
(muffled murmurs)

934
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:01,869
It's true.

935
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,579
I'm confused, Detective.

936
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:07,166
Are you suggesting your
partner is delusional,

937
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,252
or just lying?

938
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:17,301
Lucifer Morningstar
is many things,

939
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:20,263
but he is not a liar.

940
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,975
Everything that
Mr. Morningstar said

941
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,561
on this stand is
absolutely true.

942
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:29,564
I was the first person
on that crime scene.

943
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,358
And, yes, I shouldn't
have been anywhere near it.

944
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:35,111
But I...

945
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:38,197
let my emotions

946
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:39,949
get the best of me.

947
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:43,661
(clears her throat)

948
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,539
Lucifer is the...

949
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,209
...best partner

950
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:52,837
I have ever had.

951
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:57,258
And I can only hope that
he can count on me

952
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:00,344
as much as I count on him.

953
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:03,514
STEDMAN: Your Honor, we request
the jury be instructed

954
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:06,684
to disregard Detective Decker's
entire testimony.

955
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:09,061
We'll take a ten-minute recess.

956
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,204
(overlapping reporter chatter)

957
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:27,413
REPORTER: Harry,
are you surprised

958
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:28,706
by that "not guilty" verdict?

959
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:30,833
No. I'm never surprised
to see justice served.

960
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,335
I believe in our
legal system.

961
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:33,753
And now I can finally
return to my family

962
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:35,546
a free man, so,
if you'll excuse me.

963
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:36,964
(cameras clicking)

964
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:40,426
(reporters calling for Chloe)

965
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:45,306
(seagulls squawking)

966
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:06,202
I'm sorry to bother you,
um, I was, um...

967
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,329
I'm looking for Maze.

968
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,580
Do you know what apartment
she lives in?

969
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh, yes, but
she's not home.

970
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,420
Why, did you get
in a fight?

971
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:18,256
(laughs)

972
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:19,715
I'm sorry, it's
none of my business.

973
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:22,134
It's just, my husband...

974
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:27,265
always gave me flowers
after an argument.

975
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:30,726
- Are you all right?
- (sighs)

976
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,778
I used to believe

977
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,863
everything happens
for a reason.

978
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:45,992
But now,
I'm not so sure.

979
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:47,660
(chuckles)

980
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:49,161
Me, neither.

981
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,457
But I do know that
no matter how bad things get,

982
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:56,294
the true test is
how we choose to respond

983
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:57,837
to the pain we suffer.

984
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:01,299
Or inflict.

985
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:02,842
That's well said.

986
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,803
Maze is a lucky girl.

987
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:09,307
Hope she forgives you.

988
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:11,267
Ha! Huh.

989
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:18,524
I'm sorry, you...
you look really familiar.

990
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,152
I'm Chloe's mom?

991
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:22,820
Have we met?

992
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,242
No, I don't believe we have.

993
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,787

994
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,335

35 years ago, Father,

1041
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:03,314
He asked me
to come down here

1042
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:05,483
to bless a couple who was
unable to have a child.

1043
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:07,818
He had never asked me
to do anything of this sort,

1044
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:09,487
and He never did again.

1048
