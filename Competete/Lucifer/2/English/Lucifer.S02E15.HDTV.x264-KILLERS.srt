1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,000
- Previously on Lucifer...
- Still no sign of Lucifer?

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:05,773
It's been two weeks. He's gone.

3
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:06,840
Detective!

4
00:00:06,843 --> 00:00:08,273
Meet Candy Morningstar,

5
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:09,744
my wife.

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,512
Lucifer's concocting a plan.

7
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:13,315
What if there is no hidden agenda, Mom?

8
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:14,482
Why would I be surprised?

9
00:00:14,518 --> 00:00:16,484
You disappeared after I almost died?

10
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,287
Does Chloe know that you zagged Candy?

11
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:20,588
Everything I felt for her

12
00:00:20,624 --> 00:00:21,605
was smoke and mirrors,

13
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:22,729
courtesy of Dad.

14
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,525
So it's okay to ignore her feelings?

15
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:25,828
Feelings that aren't real.

16
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:26,862
But she doesn't know that.

17
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:28,863
Which is why I had to save her!

18
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:29,931
From you.

19
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:31,199
I manipulated him.

20
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:32,934
I pushed him too hard.

21
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,034
I did this.

22
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:35,803
The Oscar goes to Candy Morningstar.

23
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:37,238
You think they bought it?

24
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:38,714
My mother doesn't know what hit her.

25
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:39,974
Thank you for helping me

26
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,243
peek inside that scheming head of hers.

27
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:44,646
What if I told you that
the Flaming Sword is

28
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:45,958
Azrael's blade?

29
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:48,406
The weapon that can cut through
the Gates of Heaven itself.

30
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,520
We have everything we need to go home.

31
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:57,692
Azrael's blade.

32
00:00:57,728 --> 00:00:58,659
You're sure?

33
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:00,061
I am.

34
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:01,396
So if we could just get your brother

35
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:05,199
to stop drinking and
show us where he hid it...

36
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:08,636
I just wanted you to
tell him what you told me,

37
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:10,004
before I make a mess.

38
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,274
What mess are you going to...

39
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:16,693
That's where it's been this whole time?

40
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,681
Put it somewhere I
could keep an eye on it.

41
00:01:19,683 --> 00:01:21,149
Wouldn't want someone to incite another

42
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:22,583
stabbing rampage, now, would we?

43
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,119
Well, it's not my fault
humans can't handle the divine.

44
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:26,487
Besides, if I hadn't done that,

45
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:30,007
we wouldn't have found out
what that blade actually is.

46
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,693
And you really think that
this is the Flaming Sword?

47
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,956
I thought Father destroyed
it during my rebellion

48
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,264
so I wouldn't use it against Him.

49
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:37,762
Father said He destroyed it.

50
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,499
Apparently, He just
hid it in plain sight.

51
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:44,770
But it's so small and so... not flaming.

52
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:49,274
That's because only
you, my Lightbringer,

53
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,933
can ignite it.

54
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,269
Well, what am I supposed to do,

55
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:54,281
dip it in some whiskey
and light a match?

56
00:01:54,284 --> 00:01:57,316
Last time it caught
flame, you were angry,

57
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,318
so think about your
Father, that should do it.

58
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,189
All right.

59
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,860
No!

60
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,562
Right, back to my whiskey plan.

61
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,264
No, you're much too calm.

62
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,499
When it flamed before, you were furious.

63
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:17,748
So you're saying the blade
can sense my emotional state?

64
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:19,049
It's the most powerful weapon

65
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:20,182
in the universe, Mum...

66
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:23,074
The sword that guarded
Eden, not a groovy mood ring.

67
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,186
Maybe I should try it.

68
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,466
Your brother is the
Lightbringer, Amenadiel.

69
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:29,314
He just needs to apply
himself and get angry!

70
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,685
Well, I can't just get ang... Aah!

71
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:34,152
Bloody hell!

72
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,987
Well, it was worth a shot.

73
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,500
Right. Maybe Amenadiel should try it.

74
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:41,576
Here, why don't you hold it,
and I'll kick you in the...

75
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,395
Boys!

76
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:46,364
We need to work together on this.

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,733
We're so close now.

78
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:49,167
Are we, Mom?

79
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,869
Because our return home hinges

80
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:53,972
on Lucifer being able
to control his emotions.

81
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,974
Oh, you've no faith
in me, brother? Good.

82
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,143
Means I get to prove you wrong.

83
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,121
So the three of you plan
to use this... Flaming Sword

84
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:11,590
to cut through the Gates of Heaven

85
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:12,858
and go home?

86
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:14,526
That's the plan, yes.

87
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,928
Do you mean actual gates?

88
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,463
Like big and pearly?

89
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:19,931
Are we talking clouds?

90
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,569
Harps? Old dudes in white robes?

91
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:24,103
And my dad is Morgan Freeman?

92
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:26,705
Focus, Doctor. Now, come on.

93
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,841
I need you to help me
control my emotions.

94
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,710
Well, emotions can't
be controlled, Lucifer.

95
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:34,214
What? Isn't that your entire job?

96
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:38,070
My job is to help you
understand your emotions.

97
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:40,999
I can help you become aware
of what it is you're feeling,

98
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:44,858
or trying to avoid feeling.

99
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,889
Right, you've got that look on your face

100
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,330
when you're saying something insightful

101
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,131
and waiting for me to figure it out.

102
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,369
I think you married
her to hide something.

103
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,571
- Or from something.
- Right, look,

104
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,507
what I may or may not be hiding
is beside the point, Doctor.

105
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,509
Either way, I need the sword lit.

106
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,512
So, come on. Emotions. Chop, chop.

107
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,268
You clearly have a lot
of walls up, Lucifer.

108
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,982
Between yourself and your emotions,

109
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,451
and now between yourself and me.

110
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,225
If you're unwilling to
bring those walls down,

111
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:17,591
I can't help you.

112
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:29,968
What the hell, Decker?

113
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,236
No breakfast?

114
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:34,206
Oh, I forgot. Sorry.

115
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:35,307
You forgot?

116
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:37,344
Chloe Decker forgot?

117
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,612
Are you okay?

118
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,647
What did you do with my roommate?

119
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,317
She would never ask about my feelings.

120
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,952
Oh, feelings?

121
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:49,321
No, I was thinking brain tumor,

122
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:52,759
early-onset dementia, chlamydia.

123
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,396
Uh, well, yeah.

124
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,332
I guess I'm still a little upset

125
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:03,134
that Lucifer just disappeared on me

126
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,537
and got married just when we were...

127
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,672
You know, I don't know what we were.

128
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:12,978
And sure, he got it annulled
right away, but, you know,

129
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:14,512
that almost makes it worse.

130
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:20,051
Focus on Trixie.

131
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,020
And I'm-I'm worried about her.

132
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,257
Have you noticed anything?

133
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,959
You have?

134
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,364
Okay, I'm gonna adopt a dozen puppies,

135
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,833
and I'm gonna let them
sleep in your bedroom.

136
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,104
- Nice, Maze. Nice.
- Come on.

137
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,908
I'm sorry. Okay, I can't
deal with human emotions

138
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,776
on an empty stomach.

139
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,178
Makes me...

140
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,014
nauseous.

141
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,218
Of course. What did I expect?

142
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:56,421
Oh, come on.

143
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,464
Tall, non-fat almond milk latte

144
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,401
with sugar-free caramel
drizzle and no vodka this time.

145
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:10,769
What's the occasion?

146
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:13,005
Well, I thought we should
celebrate our first day together

147
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:14,706
as crime-solving divorcees.

148
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,848
Ah, making a joke you don't like. Check.

149
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:19,577
See? We'll be back to normal in no time.

150
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,747
Uh, not until you start whining
about how boring the case is.

151
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,183
Well, touché, Detective.

152
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,819
Our victim's name is Debbie Lang.

153
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,121
She worked as the head of
administrations of a very

154
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,857
prestigious elementary school
on the Westside called...

155
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,756
called Starford.

156
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,158
How could a career in
education pay for all this?

157
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:39,416
L.A. private schools are insane.

158
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,132
You know, money gets thrown around.

159
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,500
What do we have?

160
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,803
Well, poor Debbie was
stabbed in the back,

161
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,937
literally.

162
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,133
Maybe figuratively, too.

163
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,306
There was no signs of B&E,

164
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:50,179
which suggests she
knew who her killer was.

165
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:52,577
- Anyone recover the murder weapon?
- No, not yet.

166
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,601
You'd think knife, but the circumference

167
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:57,348
of the wound is unusually wide,

168
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,601
like it was a... fat knife.

169
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:01,398
PhD in psychology,

170
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,390
certificate for behavioral therapy.

171
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:04,823
I should have thought
this woman had figured out

172
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,425
human interaction, yet
she provoked someone

173
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:07,692
into killing her?

174
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,270
Therapists don't really
know anything, do they?

175
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:13,028
Ooh, Lucifer's projecting his
personal issues on the case.

176
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:14,424
Guess we're back to normal.

177
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,700
Ah, man.

178
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,036
I got into it with my
shrink a couple of weeks ago.

179
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,926
What? You see a psychologist?

180
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:22,145
I know. You wouldn't think so, right?

181
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:24,414
'Cause I'm so upbeat all the time.

182
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:27,379
But up here... lot of darkness.

183
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:29,609
- Really?
- Hey, guys?

184
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:31,159
What's this?

185
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,624
Well, where do I start?

186
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,693
Missing commemorative scissors.

187
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,925
Looks like we found our fat knife.

188
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:45,227
Or didn't find it,

189
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,355
but, you know.

190
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:48,166
So, weapon of convenience.

191
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:50,317
Could have been a crime of passion.

192
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,552
Vic knew the killer,

193
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,789
so we should go to the
school where she worked.

194
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,346
I, uh... I just can't believe it.

195
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:03,513
You know, Debbie was the best

196
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,081
head of admissions we've ever had,

197
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:08,386
the heart and soul of
the Starford community.

198
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,652
We're all devastated.

199
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:12,621
Is there any way we could see her office

200
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:14,790
or the last few things
she was working on?

201
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:15,591
Sure.

202
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,426
No phones on campus, please.

203
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:18,761
Sends a message

204
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:21,369
that our arms aren't actually
available to our children.

205
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:23,171
Right. Detective, this school is weird,

206
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:25,040
and, yes, this case is boring.

207
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:26,309
Not weird.

208
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:27,542
Unique.

209
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:29,869
Our groundbreaking pedagogical approach

210
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:32,637
focuses on emotional self-control.

211
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,579
Emotional self-control?
How'd you go about that, then?

212
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,010
Lucifer, can you go back to being bored,

213
00:08:37,012 --> 00:08:38,378
and not derail the conversation?

214
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:40,247
No, no, but this is fascinating,
Detective. The so-called expert

215
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:43,216
I just consulted insisted
emotions can't be controlled.

216
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,551
Well, we respectfully disagree.

217
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:47,987
Um, our children learn to
manage their emotions in no time.

218
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:51,059
Well, why didn't you say
so in the first place?

219
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:54,193
Let the schooling begin!

220
00:08:57,064 --> 00:09:03,001
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

221
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,145
You see, we make our students'
emotional needs the priority.

222
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,077
Whence our motto.

223
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,579
"Sentio ergo sum."

224
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:14,350
- "I feel, therefore I am."
- Hmm.

225
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,385
Fascinating.

226
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,086
Let's just stick to the case.

227
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:18,254
Hold on, Detective.

228
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,015
Debbie isn't going to un-die, is she?

229
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,425
Whereas I require immediate assistance.

230
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,761
Look, yes, how long
does it take for rug rats

231
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,279
to gain emotional self-control?

232
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:27,597
Oh, our methods work very quickly.

233
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:28,931
The parents see it for themselves

234
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,696
after sitting in on just one class.

235
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:33,302
Notice all the, um, testimonials.

236
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:35,004
Yes.

237
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,239
So, Debbie.

238
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,008
Did she have any enemies
here at work that you know of?

239
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:41,611
You see, our faculty practices the same

240
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,247
conflict-resolution
method as our children.

241
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,749
People in a conflict actually

242
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,384
present handmade gifts to one another.

243
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,820
This was Debbie's desk,

244
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,022
and, as you can see,
not a single macramé.

245
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,093
What about outside the faculty?

246
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,829
Any recent incidents with parents maybe?

247
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,515
Nothing like that would
ever happen Starford.

248
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,633
Oh, weird, 'cause heads of admissions

249
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,668
at other prestigious private schools

250
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:08,704
are practically stalked
by eager parents, so,

251
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,007
maybe the spots here at
Starford just aren't as coveted.

252
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:11,808
Not so.

253
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,109
No, parents go above and beyond

254
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,844
to get their children here at Starford.

255
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,725
And they go absolutely crazy
when they fail to land a spot.

256
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,784
Just the other day...

257
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,823
Well, perhaps there was one incident.

258
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,958
Debbie did get into a rather

259
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:31,294
ugly fight with the parents of a child

260
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,100
who'd been denied admission.

261
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:34,564
- It got vicious.
- Ooh.

262
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,532
Fisticuffs? Beat-down at the bike sheds

263
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:37,767
after the final bell?

264
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,802
No, verbally vicious.

265
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:41,404
- Ah, terrible grammar.
- Mmhmm.

266
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,506
Got you.

267
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:45,618
Did you see the fight?

268
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:46,727
Everyone saw it.

269
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,830
It happened right in
front of the school,

270
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:49,478
violating what we like to think of as

271
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:51,447
our safe space here at Starford.

272
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:53,082
What was said?

273
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:55,586
I will kill you.

274
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:58,967
That is what I said, yes.

275
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,656
But you have to understand.

276
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:03,626
I was furious that she'd
rejected our son, Wolfe.

277
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,995
If you have children,
I'm sure you can relate.

278
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:07,563
A Starford education

279
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,765
feeds almost directly to the Ivy League.

280
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:13,198
Debbie took our money and
crushed our son's future.

281
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:14,639
What do you mean? What money?

282
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:17,549
Well, she implied that a hefty
contribution to the school

283
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,685
would grease the wheels
on Wolfe's admission.

284
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,454
So you made the contribution
and Wolfe was still rejected?

285
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,588
Yes.

286
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:25,590
We felt we'd been... misled.

287
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:26,892
More like robbed.

288
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:28,553
And then, when we tried

289
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:31,062
to bring it up to
Debbie, she had the gall

290
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,465
to suggest that the school
hadn't received the donation.

291
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,167
But the check cleared!

292
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:36,169
Lying...

293
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:43,775
I know my husband's temper

294
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:45,977
suggests otherwise, but
we're dealing with this

295
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:48,847
the civilized way... Through our lawyer.

296
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:51,717
We could never kill anyone.

297
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,552
Then can you explain
why the murder weapon

298
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,155
was found in your pool house?

299
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,049
Are you Lucifer Morningstar?

300
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:25,283
I am, yes.

301
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:26,585
But sadly, I don't have the time

302
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:28,454
to give you the most
amazing night of your life.

303
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,989
I'm busy dealing with
this impenetrable book.

304
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:32,924
Mr. Morningstar, you're under arrest.

305
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:35,427
I am now, am I?

306
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,095
- On what charge?
- Ladies,

307
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,997
he's resisting arrest.

308
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,132
Cuff him.

309
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:41,733
My pleasure.

310
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,535
Right, why do you sexy detectives

311
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:45,839
look so disturbingly familiar?

312
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:50,275
Mum!

313
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,877
Mum, come on.

314
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:54,648
Come on out from
wherever you're snooping.

315
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,985
- What?
- Ah.

316
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:00,286
I tried to find ones that
resemble your detective.

317
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:02,621
Then again, all humans look alike to me.

318
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:05,098
No, you did, um, well, remarkably well.

319
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:06,600
But what on Earth for?

320
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:08,894
Since anger didn't
work, I wanted to incite

321
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,829
a different emotion.

322
00:13:10,865 --> 00:13:12,998
See if that would get
the sword fired up.

323
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:15,702
A foursome isn't an emotion, Mum.

324
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:17,969
Ladies, I'm sorry, but, uh,

325
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,805
it's hard for me to
enjoy a triple-decker

326
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,142
with my mum's hands all over it, so...

327
00:13:23,744 --> 00:13:26,980
Another time, maybe. Shame.

328
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:32,017
Don't look so glum.

329
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:33,852
It's just a matter of time before I get

330
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:36,121
a handle on my emotions.

331
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:37,923
I know it's a matter of time.

332
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,958
- That's the problem.
- What's the rush?

333
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:42,896
Not like eternity's got
a "best before" date.

334
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:46,932
You'd understand if you had children.

335
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:48,742
Many of which you haven't
seen in a millennia.

336
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,701
Yes.

337
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,705
That's it, Mum. You're right.

338
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:54,739
I need to have a child.

339
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:56,708
Right, have a gander at that.

340
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:58,778
See if you can learn a few things.

341
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:07,085
Mm-hmm.

342
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:10,188
Right, well, it seemed like
something wasn't adding up.

343
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,931
Yeah, okay.

344
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,801
Thanks, Ella.

345
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,295
Okay.

346
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,267
I am gonna tie a bell around
your neck at some point.

347
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:24,269
Oh, sounds like a fun bit of foreplay,

348
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:26,105
but I've more important
things to attend to first.

349
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:27,672
Yeah, I'm sure you do, but hold on.

350
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,040
Something's bothering me.

351
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,976
The killer wiped the
fingerprints off the handle,

352
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:32,611
but not Debbie's blood from the blade.

353
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,946
But the scissors were found
at their home, correct?

354
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:36,821
In the unlocked pool house,

355
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:38,589
so anyone could have
gained access to it.

356
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:40,493
So you think the killer
planted the murder weapon

357
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:42,494
on the couple last seen
fighting with the victim.

358
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:43,695
That's admirably devious.

359
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:45,798
Jon and Craig said that
their check cleared.

360
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,082
But Debbie told them the school
never received their money.

361
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:50,210
- So she's lying.
- But what if she wasn't lying?

362
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:52,081
What if somebody embezzled
the money at the school?

363
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,884
Debbie could have found out,
she could have confronted them.

364
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:55,085
They could be the killer.

365
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:57,120
So, you know, what we got
to do... check the books,

366
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:58,722
see if there's a record of a donation.

367
00:14:58,742 --> 00:14:59,815
Right.

368
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:01,739
Baby, why are you still in your PJs?

369
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:02,941
You're gonna miss the bus.

370
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,695
I don't have time to
drive you to school today.

371
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:05,462
Hold on.

372
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,030
Why don't you go and deal

373
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,632
with the donation thingy,

374
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:12,535
and I can, uh, take the little
sh... ugar plum fairy to school.

375
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:14,080
Are you sure?

376
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,140
For my partner? Yes, I can sacrifice.

377
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:19,142
You okay with that?

378
00:15:19,178 --> 00:15:21,711
Brilliant.

379
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,689
You're gonna be in trouble
if my mom finds out.

380
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:35,225
What? I said I'd drive you to school.

381
00:15:35,261 --> 00:15:36,893
I never specified which one.

382
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:39,396
So, play along, and I'll
deliver my end of the bargain.

383
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:40,689
- Mr. Morningstar?
- Yes.

384
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:42,265
- Hey. Mr. Taylor.
- Ah.

385
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:43,334
You're here for the Starford tour?

386
00:15:43,336 --> 00:15:44,834
I am indeed. I am indeed.

387
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,104
And this little creature,
who gets whatever she wants...

388
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,508
Trixie Morningstar.
Nice to meet you, sir.

389
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:52,995
Hi.

390
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,450
Ah, lovely.

391
00:15:57,396 --> 00:16:00,730
So, right upstairs there
is our plant-based kitchen.

392
00:16:00,766 --> 00:16:02,765
Uh, it's where the students
make their own lunch.

393
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:04,926
You know, instead of
packaged, preprocessed foods,

394
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,628
we, uh, we like them to bring in, uh...

395
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,098
Sorry, do we have to touch?

396
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,134
Don't you have a leash or
something for when we go out?

397
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,241
Do you want to sell this or not?

398
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:14,177
- It's a lot of fun...
- Yes, that's all quite riveting.

399
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:15,845
Um, where is it where children learn to,

400
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:17,613
you know, harness their emotions?

401
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,923
Uh... uh...

402
00:16:19,926 --> 00:16:21,184
Hold on.

403
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,236
Uh, sorry, this isn't my normal job.

404
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,754
I'm just filling in till we find
a replacement for poor Debbie.

405
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:27,723
Oh, well, what is it you normally do?

406
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,760
Uh, I'm the movement
and wellness mentor.

407
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:33,130
So you're the P.E. teacher. Lovely.

408
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:36,999
Okay, well, right here, this is

409
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:38,734
the, uh, meditation room.

410
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,303
Um, and then, right next door is, uh,

411
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,038
it's where the kids do
their justice circles.

412
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,006
I need you to show me
where they teach lessons

413
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,977
on controlling your emotions.

414
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:48,511
Oh.

415
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:51,113
She's having emotional problems?

416
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:52,315
Who?

417
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:53,449
Oh, the child.

418
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:54,951
Sure. Probably.

419
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:56,719
Listen, what would be really helpful is

420
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:59,924
turning feelings into
something, like a weapon.

421
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:03,593
Well, I think I know just the class.

422
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:05,428
You do? Wonderful.

423
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:07,363
Great.

424
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:08,899
Come on, child.

425
00:17:10,202 --> 00:17:15,711
And you want to look
through our ledgers... why?

426
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:17,907
Because we want to know if
Debbie was telling the truth

427
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:19,175
about the missing donation,

428
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:22,211
and it could tie into
the motive for the murder.

429
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,099
I knew it.

430
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:28,451
You got me.

431
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:31,220
No need to look at the books. I did it.

432
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:34,690
The donation never made
it into the school account.

433
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:36,459
I cashed the check.

434
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:37,727
You stole the money?

435
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:39,295
- Why?
- I guess I was

436
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:42,031
tired of feeling like I didn't belong.

437
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:43,833
Starford seemed so

438
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:45,935
nonjudgmental and inclusive.

439
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:48,037
But I'm-I'm under a lot of pressure

440
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:49,305
to look a certain way,

441
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:51,907
drive a certain car.

442
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:54,609
And my salary barely covers my rent.

443
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:57,480
Okay, so Debbie found out that you took

444
00:17:57,516 --> 00:17:59,393
Jon and Craig's donation money

445
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:01,584
and... did you kill her?

446
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,420
What? No, no.

447
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:09,125
Debbie assumed the parents
never extended the check.

448
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:10,559
They called her a liar,

449
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:14,363
got so upset, and they killed her.

450
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,766
But I'm to blame.

451
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:18,868
I'm sorry.

452
00:18:18,904 --> 00:18:20,136
Look, we're not

453
00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:24,607
real sure if Jon and
Craig killed Debbie.

454
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:26,131
Really?

455
00:18:30,882 --> 00:18:32,081
Oh.

456
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:35,584
If it's not related to
the murders, after all, um,

457
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,122
perhaps we could disregard...

458
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:41,691
that last exchange.

459
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:43,926
Uh, is everything okay in here?

460
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:45,699
Sounded like a child was crying.

461
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:49,065
We're just asking the
assistant dean some questions.

462
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:50,941
Uh, I am Detective Decker.
This is Detective...

463
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:53,002
Oh, you're Trixie's cop-mom, aren't you?

464
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:54,704
That's a great kid you've got.

465
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,706
Thank you. H-How do you know...

466
00:18:56,742 --> 00:18:58,007
How do you know my daughter?

467
00:18:58,043 --> 00:18:59,475
She's in Madison's class right now.

468
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:01,092
Yeah, her father brought her in.

469
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:04,180
Um... I'm pretty sure he didn't.

470
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:08,150
Uh, can you finish getting
the statement, please,

471
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:10,252
and I'll see whatever
the hell Lucifer is doing.

472
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:13,589
But the good news is bad feelings can be

473
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,858
harnessed into good actions.

474
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:18,896
My son Ranger knows this. Right, Ranger?

475
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:24,613
Would anyone else like to try?

476
00:19:24,616 --> 00:19:25,581
Yeah.

477
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:28,237
Would any of the children
like to volunteer?

478
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,043
For a progressive school,
it's rather ageist.

479
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:35,745
Trixie.

480
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:37,340
Do you have feelings you want to use?

481
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,081
I know it's only your first time, but...

482
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:41,447
I feel sad.

483
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,719
- Okay, why?
- Because...

484
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:46,178
my mommy almost died.

485
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:48,691
Her job is scary.

486
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:50,593
But she has helped so many other people

487
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:52,128
with their problems,

488
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:55,065
I don't want her to worry about mine.

489
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,746
So I pretend I'm okay.

490
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:00,269
Well...

491
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:03,606
welcome to the club of
parental deceit, child.

492
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:04,907
It's a lonely place,

493
00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:07,678
but, uh, that's the
price of being clever.

494
00:20:10,348 --> 00:20:11,614
Okay, now what?

495
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,750
How does one control that
juvenile angst usefully?

496
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:18,421
Trixie can channel her strong feelings

497
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:20,322
into something productive.

498
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:22,358
Okay, go on.

499
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:25,194
For example, she could...

500
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,328
write a poem.

501
00:20:26,364 --> 00:20:27,430
A poem?

502
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:28,731
I came here to learn how

503
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:31,461
to turn emotions into energy,
not to become Dr. Seuss.

504
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,769
Well, creative energy is energy.

505
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:35,938
Oh, come on. If I wanted
to attend an art class,

506
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:37,606
I would have at least had the sense

507
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:38,908
to take one with a nude model.

508
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:41,661
I suppose you're
channeling emotional despair

509
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:44,330
over not getting dessert
before your veggies, are you?

510
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:48,018
No. This is a picture of
my mommy stabbing Debbie.

511
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:52,623
Lucifer.

512
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:55,791
Detective.

513
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:57,159
Right, before you chastise me

514
00:20:57,195 --> 00:20:58,861
for kidnapping your offspring,

515
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:01,665
I've solved the case.

516
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:05,701
Okay, the boy's mother is Joy Sherman.

517
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:07,436
This is her contact info.

518
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:09,071
Okay, I'll look into it.

519
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:10,137
Is Trixie okay?

520
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,774
I'll talk to her.

521
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,909
I'll see you at the station, okay?

522
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:15,746
Yeah.

523
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:20,115
Ah, Detective.

524
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:21,851
You need to understand, I'm dealing with

525
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:23,252
a most challenging issue...

526
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:25,654
Yeah, I want to talk to
my daughter for a second.

527
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,856
Please don't be mad at him.

528
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:28,557
I should be the one in trouble.

529
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:31,627
Oh... I'm not mad at you.

530
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:33,195
You're not in trouble, Monkey.

531
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:34,864
I do want you to know

532
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,067
you can talk to me if
something's going on.

533
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:39,068
I know.

534
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:40,069
You know that?

535
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:42,471
You want to talk about something now?

536
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:44,940
I could tell you anything?

537
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:46,577
Yes.

538
00:21:48,313 --> 00:21:50,112
I'd like to ride with Lucifer.

539
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:52,014
I promise I'll make him take me

540
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,618
to my actual school this time.

541
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:58,254
Huh.

542
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,891
Um, yeah, okay.

543
00:22:03,328 --> 00:22:06,595
You are lucky my daughter
likes you so much.

544
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:09,798
Yes, I'm starting to respect
the deceptive little parasite.

545
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:11,719
Oh, well, that's nice.

546
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:13,969
Speaking of, a deal's a deal.

547
00:22:14,005 --> 00:22:15,039
What?

548
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:19,107
Oh, no.

549
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,144
I...

550
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,402
Driving lessons will have to wait

551
00:22:24,405 --> 00:22:26,304
until your mum's not looking.

552
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:28,672
Bye, babe.

553
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,537
Oh, kids.

554
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,458
Ah.

555
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:42,240
Wonderful, a mugger.

556
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,255
Come on, then. I fancy a bit of exercise

557
00:22:44,258 --> 00:22:45,392
after a frustrating day.

558
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:05,104
Mum?

559
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,941
Let me see the blade. Anything?

560
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:10,476
Since when can you hit so hard?

561
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:12,761
My strength has been growing steadily.

562
00:23:12,764 --> 00:23:14,681
As is your recklessness, it seems.

563
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:16,549
I mean, what did you expect me to do?

564
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:19,212
Stab you with the blade and
have it be ignited by my joy?

565
00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:21,287
I was trying to get you worked up.

566
00:23:21,323 --> 00:23:22,555
Anger and awakening

567
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:24,824
your sexual instincts didn't work.

568
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:28,227
I thought maybe if you
were afraid for your life...

569
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,863
Well, if you really wanted to upset me,

570
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:31,931
you should have just
thrown me into the Corvette.

571
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:33,166
Don't...

572
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:35,835
throw me into the Corvette.

573
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:38,771
Just trust me, Mum.
I'm dealing with this.

574
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:40,773
Clearly, not fast enough.

575
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:42,075
Why are you so angry?

576
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:43,242
I'm not angry!

577
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:44,676
Yes, you are.

578
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:45,744
Just...

579
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:48,982
really need to get
home, where we belong.

580
00:23:49,018 --> 00:23:50,284
Soon.

581
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:58,391
Hey, Chlo, we got that
kid's mom in inter...

582
00:23:58,427 --> 00:24:00,860
What's wrong?

583
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:03,228
Look at this e-mail.

584
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:05,299
Why are you being invited
to a "grieving gathering"

585
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:06,361
at Starford Academy?

586
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:08,402
'Cause Trixie's being
considered for admission.

587
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:10,503
Apparently, she impressed
some of the teachers there.

588
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:12,572
Or they were impressed
with Lucifer's bank account.

589
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:14,440
It's probably the only
thing they care about

590
00:24:14,443 --> 00:24:15,542
at that pretentious place.

591
00:24:15,545 --> 00:24:16,242
Well, I mean,

592
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:18,044
it is non-traditional, that's for sure.

593
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,901
Wait, are you actually considering it?

594
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:21,681
I mean, don't you think
that with the divorce

595
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:23,517
and the move and everything
that Trixie's had enough

596
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,018
- big changes lately?
- Exactly.

597
00:24:25,054 --> 00:24:27,020
Trixie's pretending
that she's fine, Dan.

598
00:24:27,056 --> 00:24:30,839
One morning at Starford,
and she's been opening up

599
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:33,844
like I haven't been able
to get her to do for months.

600
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,462
- You didn't see her.
- Yeah, well,

601
00:24:36,498 --> 00:24:38,231
it kills me to think that she, uh,

602
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:40,266
she's been keeping up an
act just to protect us.

603
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:42,423
When did our kid get so adult?

604
00:24:42,426 --> 00:24:44,826
She does still hide chocolate
cake under the bed, though.

605
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:46,273
Yeah, well, thank God for that.

606
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:47,674
Okay, well,

607
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,876
maybe we can consider sending
our daughter to that school

608
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:52,714
after we've solved the ongoing
murder investigation there.

609
00:24:54,112 --> 00:24:56,045
Can you explain to us why

610
00:24:56,048 --> 00:24:58,084
your son would draw this, Ms. Sherman?

611
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,354
I'm not sure what it even is.

612
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,489
He says it's you killing Debbie.

613
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:06,426
Oh, he was listening to me.

614
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:08,995
He never listens to me.

615
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:10,596
So you said that you killed Debbie?

616
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,067
No, I-I said I wanted to kill her.

617
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:16,335
Every morning, while
peeling the sticker off

618
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:18,571
some root vegetable I
got at the supermarket

619
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:20,440
for a third of the price
of the organic crap.

620
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:22,742
Rubbing it in dirt works
like a charm, by the way.

621
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:23,611
Hmm.

622
00:25:23,614 --> 00:25:25,078
Why would you say that to him?

623
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,347
Because I'm single
and I work full-time,

624
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:30,279
and Debbie had a million little ways

625
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:32,824
of making me feel like
a bad mom because of it.

626
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:34,520
- For working?
- Yeah.

627
00:25:34,523 --> 00:25:38,257
Well, that sounds like
a great environment.

628
00:25:38,293 --> 00:25:40,901
Apparently, I wasn't "involved enough."

629
00:25:40,904 --> 00:25:43,004
Like, I'm sorry that
my bake sale cupcakes

630
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:45,540
weren't gluten and dairy free, Debbie.

631
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,346
Joy, where were you two nights ago?

632
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:50,149
Tuesday?

633
00:25:50,185 --> 00:25:51,452
Mm-hmm.

634
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:55,533
Um, I was, I was with Mr. Taylor.

635
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:56,634
Mr. Taylor?

636
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:59,591
The wellness mentor?
What were you doing?

637
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:02,361
We weren't discussing
the French New Wave.

638
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:03,929
So you're having an affair

639
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:05,331
with the...

640
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:06,699
with the P.E. teacher.

641
00:26:06,735 --> 00:26:08,968
Only on Tuesday nights.

642
00:26:09,004 --> 00:26:11,038
He had a busy schedule.

643
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,440
Look, every mom at Starford knows

644
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:15,842
that the movement and wellness program

645
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:17,943
is one of the best
benefits of the school.

646
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:21,647
I mean, the man is as
dumb as a box of hair,

647
00:26:21,683 --> 00:26:25,584
but he does know how to move.

648
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,376
While I check into your alibi, uh,

649
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,178
can you tell us, are
there any other people

650
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:31,657
that you can think of that
had a grudge against Debbie?

651
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:33,125
Are you, are you kidding?

652
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:35,594
Who didn't hate the Wicked
Witch of the Westside?

653
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,397
She held the keys to the most
exclusive school in the city,

654
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:40,566
and she never let anyone forget it.

655
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:42,935
We were told that she
was very well loved.

656
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:46,572
Well, the hairlines and the perky boobs

657
00:26:46,608 --> 00:26:48,073
aren't the only phony things

658
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:49,208
at that school.

659
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:50,876
You want to know who killed her?

660
00:26:50,912 --> 00:26:54,346
You should go to that grieving
gathering they're throwing.

661
00:26:54,382 --> 00:26:56,550
All her frenemies will be there.

662
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:10,596
Never seen you so worried
about an outfit, Decker.

663
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:13,732
Not picking up the first
coat off the floor as usual?

664
00:27:13,768 --> 00:27:15,300
Nope.

665
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:16,802
No, I'm not.

666
00:27:16,838 --> 00:27:18,270
I am going

667
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:19,962
to a grieving gathering at the school,

668
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:23,275
and, well, you should
see the other parents.

669
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:24,643
They are very fancy.

670
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,211
It's...

671
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,713
You know what?

672
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:29,481
Never mind. I don't
want to make you sick

673
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:30,783
- with my feelings.
- No.

674
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:32,618
Come on. I'm listening, I promise.

675
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:33,988
No more earbuds.

676
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,658
Okay, Trixie might get
into this private school,

677
00:27:39,694 --> 00:27:41,760
and it could be really,
really good for her.

678
00:27:41,796 --> 00:27:43,228
But it's super exclusive,

679
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:45,998
and I'm not sure that I want
her in that kind of environment.

680
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:49,168
That's what you're so worried about?

681
00:27:49,204 --> 00:27:50,436
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

682
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:52,171
A school like that is great for Trixie.

683
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:53,272
You think so?

684
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:54,206
Yeah.

685
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:55,641
Fancy-pants rich kids?

686
00:27:55,677 --> 00:27:56,909
They're like vipers, okay?

687
00:27:56,945 --> 00:27:58,844
Trixie will learn to
slash them with her words.

688
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,014
Then I will teach her the knives.

689
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,916
Oh, okay.

690
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:06,185
I think... I know you're trying to help,

691
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:07,686
but, uh, I don't think

692
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:10,124
you can help me with... with this now.

693
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:19,731
Hi.

694
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,167
Uh, Chloe Decker. Uh, Trixie's mom.

695
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:23,868
Just you?

696
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,605
Alone?

697
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:28,874
Just me, alone.

698
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,109
Yeah.

699
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:31,310
Aw.

700
00:28:31,346 --> 00:28:32,945
That must be difficult.

701
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:35,649
Actually, she's with me.

702
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:41,687
Oh. Two mommies?

703
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:43,555
Oh, hell yeah.

704
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:45,824
- Um...
- Trixie's a handful,

705
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,200
definitely a two-woman job.

706
00:28:48,203 --> 00:28:49,497
Right, honey?

707
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,233
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

708
00:28:57,895 --> 00:28:59,460
What are you doing here?

709
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,855
Look, I'm not good at listening.

710
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:05,324
Or talking about emotion stuff.

711
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,292
But I do know you don't let your girl

712
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,095
go into enemy territory alone.

713
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:11,198
Thank you.

714
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:16,001
Oh, wow.

715
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:18,537
I guess networking is the new grieving.

716
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:19,706
Mm-hmm.

717
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,375
You're Trixie's moms, right?

718
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:25,611
- Mm.
- I'm the event coordinator here.

719
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:27,112
I just wanted to tell you

720
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:30,282
that we'd be so happy to have
you as part of the family.

721
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:32,951
Mid-afternoon yoga always
needs more volunteers.

722
00:29:33,986 --> 00:29:35,824
I would love to, but mid-afternoons,

723
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:36,655
I'm at my job.

724
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:37,890
- Oh.
- Yeah.

725
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:40,092
She's a homicide detective.

726
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:41,060
Oh.

727
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:42,694
She has a gun and everything.

728
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:45,664
A real pistol in the sack, too.

729
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,032
Oh!

730
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:48,667
Jokester.

731
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,469
I wish I had time for a job.

732
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:51,737
But you know what they say:

733
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:54,873
exceptional child, exhausted mom.

734
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:57,711
Mm-hmm.

735
00:29:59,286 --> 00:30:00,951
I've never heard anyone say that.

736
00:30:00,954 --> 00:30:02,981
Doesn't makes sense.

737
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:05,350
Maze, look at everybody.
Look at these parents.

738
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,386
Who has a kid and is this put together?

739
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:09,021
Use those detective skills, Decker.

740
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,223
Get out of your own head. Look around.

741
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:12,157
All right.

742
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:13,959
That entire table over there

743
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:16,128
is just waiting for that
couple to go nuclear.

744
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:18,464
Oh, when that woman walked in,

745
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,533
the entire room started
commenting on her cheek-filler.

746
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,235
- Hmm.
- They're miserable.

747
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:25,137
And waiting to tear each other apart.

748
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:27,439
Actually...

749
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:29,308
reminds me of home.

750
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,610
Hmm.

751
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:34,613
You know what? You're right.

752
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:36,915
They love gossip.

753
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:39,785
And the juicier, the better.

754
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:41,086
You know what?

755
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:43,323
Let's give them something to talk about.

756
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,259
Don't do that.

757
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,045
Careful, brother.

758
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:09,915
Too much of that will make you go blind.

759
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,151
Mom was right.

760
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:15,166
I can't make it work.

761
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:17,089
Ah, I see. You're up here

762
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,458
practicing a different kind
of self-flagellation, are you?

763
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:21,793
Hoping for a celestial spark?

764
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:23,195
You don't even have your powers.

765
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:25,497
Yeah, thanks for that reminder, Luci.

766
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,766
You know, I also don't seem

767
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:30,036
to have much of Mom's attention anymore.

768
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:32,004
Because, unlike you,

769
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,442
I don't have some glorious
destiny to wield the sword.

770
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:38,028
And what's so great

771
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:39,597
about Mum's attention?

772
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,666
She nearly killed me
in the car park earlier,

773
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:43,582
trying to help me achieve that destiny.

774
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:46,114
Oh, good job warning me she's
strong enough to lift a house,

775
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:46,852
by the way.

776
00:31:46,888 --> 00:31:49,188
Same old Luci, always the victim.

777
00:31:49,224 --> 00:31:51,990
Can't you just be grateful for once?

778
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:53,258
You're the Lightbringer!

779
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:54,092
Am I?

780
00:31:54,128 --> 00:31:55,561
Am I, indeed?

781
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:57,629
'Cause so far, it's
just Mum's word against,

782
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,299
well, reality.

783
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:02,534
What if she's wrong, brother?

784
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,370
She's been acting very odd recently.

785
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:06,838
On edge.

786
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:08,707
This obsession with getting home,

787
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:10,055
it's a bit much, don't you think?

788
00:32:12,193 --> 00:32:14,929
You see, I thought we
all wanted to go back.

789
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,082
You know I don't lie, brother.

790
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:20,719
So trust me when I say
nothing would make me happier

791
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:22,721
than Mum getting her wish.

792
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:25,682
Then you need to stop
fighting this, Luci,

793
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:26,854
and find a way

794
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:28,456
to get the sword to work.

795
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:32,798
Because whether we like it or not,

796
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:34,900
it is all on you.

797
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:37,070
Lightbringer.

798
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:45,939
You, uh, call this pÃ¢té, huh?

799
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:47,494
I know, right?

800
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:49,654
You know, say what
you will about Debbie,

801
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:52,486
but that woman knew
how to cater a party.

802
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:55,365
You're married to that cop, right?

803
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:57,368
Yeah.

804
00:32:57,803 --> 00:33:00,104
Actually, can you keep a secret?

805
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:03,638
My wife is very close

806
00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:06,230
to making an arrest.

807
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:09,254
We think the killer
might actually be here.

808
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:12,919
She found evidence just tonight.

809
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:14,087
DNA.

810
00:33:14,123 --> 00:33:16,256
It's in the car right now.

811
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:21,329
Somebody here is going to jail.

812
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:25,732
Oh, but keep that on the DL, all right?

813
00:33:25,768 --> 00:33:26,701
Knuckles.

814
00:33:34,844 --> 00:33:38,213
Five gossips down, a
couple more to be safe.

815
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:42,649
No, look, this is plenty.

816
00:33:42,685 --> 00:33:45,819
Let's hope they take the bait.

817
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:47,654
Okay, all I have to do now

818
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,390
is stake out the car,
if the killer is here,

819
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:52,360
they'll go out there for the evidence.

820
00:34:02,338 --> 00:34:03,303
Ah.

821
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:05,071
Just the person I'm looking for.

822
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:06,773
- Mr. Morningstar.
- Yes.

823
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:09,242
Look, I'm willing to give
your Kumbaya curriculum

824
00:34:09,278 --> 00:34:10,744
a second look.

825
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,113
Perhaps if I'm more specific
about what I want out of it:

826
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:15,115
uh, less watercolors,

827
00:34:15,151 --> 00:34:17,283
more, sort of, heavenly flames?

828
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:18,885
Are you following me?

829
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:20,988
Sorry, do you need something
out of the detective's car?

830
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,823
Uh, uh, yeah, she-she asked
me to grab something for her.

831
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:24,691
Ah.

832
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:26,226
Well, let's get that over with,

833
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:28,966
so we can focus on what's important: me.

834
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:33,800
Uh, don't tell her I,
uh, got a copy made.

835
00:34:33,836 --> 00:34:36,770
She gets all fussy about
things like illegal duplicates.

836
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:39,242
So, uh, do you do private tutoring?

837
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:40,774
'Cause I'm free most of the time.

838
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,075
Specifically now.

839
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:43,410
Yeah.

840
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:45,945
Lucifer, what are you doing?

841
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:48,548
Uh, Madison said she needed
something from your car.

842
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:49,916
What?

843
00:34:49,952 --> 00:34:51,184
She's the killer.

844
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:53,837
That's quite a leap, Detective.

845
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:55,623
No, it isn't. Lucifer, please, she...

846
00:34:58,427 --> 00:35:01,061
My gun's in the car.

847
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:04,130
Well, why didn't you
tell me all this earlier?

848
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,943
Put your hands up.

849
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:09,899
Stay back!

850
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:13,994
- Stay back!
- Madison,

851
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,829
- put down the gun.
- Yes.

852
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:17,165
Perhaps if you channel your feelings

853
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:18,566
into something other than bullets,

854
00:35:18,602 --> 00:35:20,067
that might...

855
00:35:20,103 --> 00:35:21,136
Okay.

856
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:24,271
I said stay back!

857
00:35:24,307 --> 00:35:26,475
Okay, got it.

858
00:35:27,444 --> 00:35:28,811
Oh, you!

859
00:35:30,413 --> 00:35:32,413
This is all your fault!

860
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:33,681
With your stupid

861
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:36,579
handsome face and your chiseled abs

862
00:35:36,582 --> 00:35:37,714
and your huge...

863
00:35:37,717 --> 00:35:39,687
You slept with the P.E. teacher, too?

864
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:42,022
Well, the movement and wellness
mentor, Detective, but...

865
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:45,159
Madison, if I've learned
anything here tonight,

866
00:35:45,195 --> 00:35:47,861
it's that everyone here has secrets.

867
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,196
No one's perfect.

868
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:50,464
Okay?

869
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,433
But we didn't have sex.

870
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:53,634
Well, I mean, okay, one time.

871
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,369
But, come on, that was, like, years ago.

872
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,004
One time was all it took.

873
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,374
This is about your son, isn't it?

874
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,650
What? You mean the boy

875
00:36:01,678 --> 00:36:03,944
in the class with the special
diet of boogers and paste?

876
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,945
Lucifer.

877
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:05,813
I...

878
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:07,615
God knows I love Ranger,

879
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:11,118
but he's not very smart.

880
00:36:11,154 --> 00:36:12,720
My husband is,

881
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:15,522
and that witch Debbie
put two and two together.

882
00:36:15,558 --> 00:36:17,491
And she told you that she was gonna

883
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:19,493
expose Mr. Taylor as Ranger's

884
00:36:19,529 --> 00:36:20,694
real father.

885
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,563
She hated how all the moms loved him.

886
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,798
My husband would've left me.

887
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,300
Madison, I understand.

888
00:36:26,336 --> 00:36:28,335
You were just thinking
of your son's future.

889
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:30,471
I-I get it. I-I'm a mother, too.

890
00:36:30,507 --> 00:36:32,940
Um, maybe you remember
Trixie, my daughter.

891
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:34,176
Th-The little girl who was sad

892
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,076
because her mom had such a scary job.

893
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:37,945
That's me. She's my daughter.

894
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:40,382
So, please,

895
00:36:40,385 --> 00:36:43,018
Madison, put down the gun.

896
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:49,390
I'm so sorry.

897
00:36:49,426 --> 00:36:50,958
I-I got so angry,

898
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:52,993
I couldn't control myself.

899
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:54,228
What? Hold on.

900
00:36:54,264 --> 00:36:56,363
All this talk about
controlling your emotions

901
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:59,800
and harnessing them for
creation was all just a sham?

902
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:02,202
I tried so hard to make it real.

903
00:37:02,238 --> 00:37:04,805
We can't control our emotions.

904
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:06,607
We just have to keep try...

905
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:17,017
Listening to feelings,
it's not my thing.

906
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:18,520
Right, honey?

907
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,221
You know, if I were you,

908
00:37:21,257 --> 00:37:23,390
I'd take my child out of this school.

909
00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:24,560
Terrible place.

910
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:27,428
Wait.

911
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:28,964
I'm a father?

912
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:33,869
That's awesome.

913
00:37:38,274 --> 00:37:40,209
Here you go.

914
00:37:42,746 --> 00:37:44,713
How cute this guy is.

915
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,749
So...

916
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:51,285
I went back to that school today.

917
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:54,280
And I think they'd let
you in if you wanted to go.

918
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:56,451
So how do you feel about that?

919
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:01,230
Well, can I tell you how
it made me feel being there?

920
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,411
Well, at first,

921
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:07,501
it made me feel insecure and worried.

922
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:10,003
I mean, the school is so fancy,

923
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,906
and all the other
mommies seemed so perfect.

924
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:15,008
But guess what I found out.

925
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:15,809
What?

926
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:18,145
That the other mommies,

927
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:20,948
they were just as worried as I was.

928
00:38:20,984 --> 00:38:23,684
And they were just
pretending to be perfect.

929
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,054
Is it bad to pretend?

930
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:29,356
No, not always, Monkey.

931
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,392
I mean, sometimes people feel like...

932
00:38:34,764 --> 00:38:37,131
like they have to pretend
that everything's okay.

933
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:38,499
But...

934
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:42,369
And this is the most important part...

935
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:44,104
You and me,

936
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,475
we never have to

937
00:38:46,478 --> 00:38:49,113
pretend with each other.

938
00:38:51,447 --> 00:38:54,014
I really didn't like that school.

939
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,216
I didn't like it either.

940
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,025
Thanks for telling me, Monkey.

941
00:39:09,582 --> 00:39:11,681
It turns out you were right, Doctor.

942
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:14,518
It's impossible to
control your feelings.

943
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:17,020
And anyone who does risks
turning into a murderous lunatic

944
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:19,457
with a child of below-average
intelligence, so...

945
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,774
Yeah, well, I'm sure

946
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,644
at least some of that,
that's inaccurate.

947
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,714
But I'm glad you've come around.

948
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:30,450
Are you ready to be
more forthcoming now?

949
00:39:31,654 --> 00:39:33,754
Yes, I suppose.

950
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,490
If that's what it takes
to get you to help me.

951
00:39:36,526 --> 00:39:38,826
So...

952
00:39:38,862 --> 00:39:39,993
um...

953
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:42,529
I wasn't lying before, obviously.

954
00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:44,898
I do intend to use the Flaming Sword

955
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:46,800
to cut through the Gates of Heaven.

956
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:48,435
But what you left out...?

957
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:50,070
Is that once I do that,

958
00:39:50,106 --> 00:39:52,439
I plan on kicking Mum into Heaven

959
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:54,874
and slamming the gates on her backside.

960
00:39:54,877 --> 00:39:57,277
But she'll be trapped there,

961
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,379
on her own.

962
00:39:59,415 --> 00:40:01,179
Won't God destroy her?

963
00:40:01,182 --> 00:40:03,282
Hopefully, they tear each other apart.

964
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,350
Then they'll both get what they deserve.

965
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:06,452
What's that?

966
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,253
Punishment.

967
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:09,855
For manipulating me.

968
00:40:09,891 --> 00:40:11,290
I mean, Dad set a trap for me,

969
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,559
but Mum was the one who made
sure that I fell into it.

970
00:40:13,595 --> 00:40:17,064
She was the one that
made sure that I felt...

971
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:20,999
that I...

972
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:23,735
that I felt things that I
don't want to feel anymore.

973
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:24,937
That, right there,

974
00:40:24,973 --> 00:40:28,874
that what you stopped
yourself from feeling,

975
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,709
that's exactly what you need to feel.

976
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:31,910
What, the anger?

977
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:33,512
Oh, I feel it.

978
00:40:33,548 --> 00:40:36,448
Not the anger.

979
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:37,683
The pain.

980
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,918
That's what you've been suppressing.

981
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:43,388
All the pain and heartbreak

982
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:46,059
that you have over what
happened with your mother.

983
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:50,427
And Chloe.

984
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:57,603
I know it's difficult.

985
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:00,272
But the only way to
get over that pain...

986
00:41:01,576 --> 00:41:03,113
is to go through it.

987
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:10,649
So you think you've figured it out?

988
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:12,151
Yes.

989
00:41:12,187 --> 00:41:14,119
And you're sure this time?

990
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:14,920
Just...

991
00:41:14,956 --> 00:41:17,925
let me do it, Mum, please.

992
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:00,966
That's it?!

993
00:42:01,002 --> 00:42:02,768
You must not be feeling enough!

994
00:42:02,804 --> 00:42:04,636
Trust me.

995
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,770
That's it. That's all I've got!

996
00:42:06,773 --> 00:42:08,973
You have to try harder.

997
00:42:08,976 --> 00:42:10,409
- What?
- Try harder!

998
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,844
Mom! That's enough!

999
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,513
I'm not broken.

1000
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:16,481
The sword must be.

1001
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:17,816
Okay.

1002
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:19,411
Okay, then we'll fix it.

1003
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:20,485
There's plenty of time.

1004
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:23,722
Of course.

1005
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:25,457
You're right, son.

1006
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:28,393
There's plenty of time.

1007
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:56,323
Just not for me.

1008
