You realize you're late, yeah?

182
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,024
Oh, and you're eating
possible evidence.

183
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,525
- What?
- Give me that.

184
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,278
(mouth full):
Surely all this food
can't go to waste, Detective.

185
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,572
- You look like hell.
- (snickers)

186
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,574
(imitates rimshot)
Not heard that before.

187
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:48,659
- Are you drunk?
- I wish.

188
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,662
Pesky supernatural metabolism
keeps getting in the way.

189
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:53,956
Still doesn't stop me
trying, though.

190
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:54,916
No!

191
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,418
No drinking at a crime scene.

192
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:58,586
Fine.

193
00:06:58,795 --> 00:06:59,921
What murder
are we solving today?

194
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,172
I mean, everyone here
looks dead.

195
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,591
We have an injured
groom and a deceased bride.

196
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,343
Oh, they got to that
"till death do us part"

197
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:06,928
nonsense quickly,
didn't they?

198
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,055
The bride suffered a
gunshot wound to the chest.

199
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,099
Chest? Shooter didn't go
for the head?

200
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,101
First rule of zombie killing.
(sniffs)

201
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,895
Do you want to work
this case with me or not?

202
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,647
Of course I do.

203
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,274
Every killer must be punished.

204
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,609
Good.

205
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,277
Then you stay here.

206
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,404
Find some water.

207
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,114
Calm down.

208
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:27,615
I'm gonna talk
to some witnesses,

209
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:29,450
and pull yourself together.

210
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,078
You look like a
homeless magician.

211
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,081
(sighs)

212
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,458
Well...

213
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,460
hello, bridesmaids.

214
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,923
So, which one of you
horrifying zombettes

215
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,633
wanted the bride
dead then, hey?

216
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,593
Surely she put each
of you through hell.

217
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:48,928
All brides do, am I right?

218
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:50,513
(chuckles)

219
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,973
Yeah, let me guess.

220
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,516
She wanted you lose weight,

221
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,643
didn't she?
You to cover your tattoos.

222
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,895
Forced you to buy a
tea-length dress

223
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:59,814
that does nothing
for your cankles.

224
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,607
And did any of you
want to wear this...

225
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,484
hideous zombie makeup?

226
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,528
- (sobs)
- Oh, hello.

227
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,655
You look suspicious.

228
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:10,908
Tell me, what did you want
to do to our corpse bride?

229
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:14,537
I wanted to ruin her wedding.

230
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,080
Ah-ha, right.

231
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,665
Let me guess, you were
in love with the groom.

232
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:19,000
This is always about
jealousy, isn't it?

233
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,960
- No!
- It was Peggy.

234
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,753
Oh, much more
interesting, go on.

235
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:25,965
She was so disgustingly
perfect, I hated it.

236
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:27,800
How could anyone compare?

237
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,844
So remove the
competition, got it.

238
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:32,054
I told her ex-boyfriend Jason

239
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,806
- where the wedding was gonna be.
- Hmm.

240
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:37,477
Hoping he'd... I don't know,
show up and make a scene.

241
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:38,603
Oh.

242
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,647
But I never imagined
that he would kill her.

243
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:44,192
(crying):
This is all my fault.

244
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,527
Oh. No, no, no,
no, come, come.

245
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:47,778
Don't do that.

246
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:49,530
Guilt is such
a useless emotion.

247
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,575
It's completely unflattering
on such a beautiful face.

248
00:08:55,203 --> 00:08:56,204
You...

249
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:58,539
you think I'm beautiful?

250
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:00,416
- (chuckles)
- Oh!

251
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,337
(moaning and squealing)

252
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,339
Lucifer, what
are you doing?

253
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,257
Detective,
I've found you a lead.

254
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,342
Where-- in her mouth?

255
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,718
Yes, actually!

256
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:12,094
Imagine what I can find
in other orifices.

257
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,472
- Ooh!
- (chuckles)

258
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,473
Okay.

259
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:18,726
- I apologize.
- I'm just being thorough.

260
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,562
Call me. Easy!

261
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:26,359
(indistinct chatter)

262
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:27,860
CHLOE:
What has gotten into you?

263
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,403
I thought you were getting
the hang of this.

264
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,072
LUCIFER:
I got you a lead, didn't I?

265
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,865
The ex-boyfriend,
you looking into him?

266
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,909
Yeah, Dan's on it, but
that's not the point.

267
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,745
This whole new thing, you
making out with witnesses?

268
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:39,080
Completely inappropriate.

269
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,415
When are you going to get it?
Inappropriate is what I do.

270
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:42,959
You've always been
a pain in the ass, Lucifer,

271
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,669
but I've never
seen you like this.

272
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:46,879
What's going on?
What happened?

273
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,422
Just enough of the questioning,
Detective.

274
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,840
Reprimand me
or let's get on with it.

275
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:50,841
(scoffs)

276
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,552
DAN:
Wow.

277
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,844
Can I talk to you, please?

278
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,514
(groans)
Pull your pants up.

279
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,057
- Hi.
- Hey, what's up with him?

280
00:09:58,266 --> 00:09:59,475
Looks like he just rolled out
of bed or something.

281
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:00,309
CHLOE:
I don't know.

282
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:01,143
There's just something

283
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:01,978
completely off
about him today.

284
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:02,812
Yeah, well, there's something

285
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,729
really off about him every day.

286
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,064
No, no, it's different.

287
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:06,857
He's missing his usual...

288
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:08,943
extreme glee.

289
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,737
- He-he just seems really dark.
- Look, is he gonna be a problem?

290
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,322
'Cause you know I wouldn't mind
if you send him home.

291
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,615
- Nope, not a problem.
- You sure?

292
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:15,950
Yep, got it.
I can handle it.

293
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,243
What'd you get from ballistics?

294
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,369
I confirmed

295
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:20,454
large caliber bullet
from a rifle; long-range.

296
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,999
I have a team searching a wider
perimeter for more evidence.

297
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,000
(door swings open)
And I finished

298
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,710
the background check
on everyone at the wedding.

299
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,420
All clean.

300
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,130
But the ex-boyfriend,
Jason Myers, he's not.

301
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,340
He's got one aggravated assault,
two weapons violations.

302
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:32,925
I have him waiting in
interrogation for you.

303
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:45,563
Well...

304
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:48,482
hello, bad guy.

305
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,027
♪♪

306
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,828
DAN: Lucifer,
open the damn door!

307
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:01,746
- (banging on door)
- CHLOE:
Lucifer!

308
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,789
Lucifer, open this
door right now!

309
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,667
(sobbing)

310
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:10,963
Lucifer, what
are you doing?

311
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:12,089
(sighs)

312
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:13,716
Just having a little
chitchat

313
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,051
with our friend here.

314
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,761
Care to know
what I've learned?

315
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,429
You get out
of there now.

316
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,932
Oh, she's so demanding.

317
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:30,066
Well... he's innocent.

318
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,151
CHLOE: Oh, did you
figure that out

319
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,694
before or after
you tortured him?

320
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:34,737
You tortured a suspect?

321
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,697
I didn't lay a finger
on the spineless cretin.

322
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,282
Come on, the guy's
sitting on the floor crying.

323
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:40,076
Crying because
of a woman,

324
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,370
not me-- the bride,
to be specific.

325
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:43,871
However, he did not
kill her.

326
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,414
And you know that how?

327
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,416
He said he couldn't take
seeing the bride so happy,

328
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,710
so he ran off, crying--
surprise, surprise--

329
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,587
well before
the shooting started.

330
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,381
And you believed that?

331
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,007
- Of course not.
He had an alibi.
- Really?

332
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,426
Yes. Leaving the park
on the service road,

333
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,387
he bumped into
a wedding musician.

334
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,098
Didn't get a name, but he had
a buzz cut and a guitar case.

335
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:04,517
A guitar? No.

336
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,268
They booked a DJ,
not a live band.

337
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,938
Trust me, crying guy
isn't lying.

338
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:11,816
Maybe, but maybe there wasn't
a guitar in that case.

339
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,985
Oh, so you think our musician
might be the shooter.

340
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,571
He's pretty shaken up,
but he's gonna be okay.

341
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,447
You're lucky.

342
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,116
Okay, I still have
to question him properly.

343
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,618
But there's a possibility
that Jason saw our shooter,

344
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:25,037
and he may have been carrying
his rifle in a guitar case.

345
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,081
Last seen
on the park service road.

346
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:29,083
I'm on it.

347
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,130
- You're welcome.
- Excuse me?

348
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,216
What you just did in there
is incredibly inappropriate.

349
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:38,759
Are you trying
to get in trouble

350
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,177
or are you trying
to piss me off?

351
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,554
I did what I had to do.

352
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,055
Got results, didn't I?

353
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:45,182
If you pull one more
stunt like that,

354
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:47,601
I don't care how
effective you are,

355
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,769
I will bench you.

356
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:08,956
(single note resonates)

357
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,544
I take it you heard about Uriel?

358
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:19,633
Is Lucifer here?

359
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,719
No, he's out.

360
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:24,263
Probably in the middle
of some three-way,

361
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:25,973
like nothing happened.

362
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:28,684
Not everyone grieves
the same way.

363
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:32,438
Lucifer, he's never
been one to...

364
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,273
face his emotions.

365
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,527
Instead of looking in,
he acts out.

366
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:40,654
You know,
a rebellion here,

367
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:41,947
an apple there?

368
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:45,826
But you...

369
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:47,244
How are you doing?

370
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,249
Come on, tell your mom.

371
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,044
When I first heard
of Uriel's death,

372
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,378
I wanted to blame Lucifer

373
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,757
but... then I realized
I was just as much to blame,

374
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,801
if not more.

375
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,220
None of this
would have happened

376
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,513
if I still had my...

377
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,515
Your powers.

378
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:10,935
How did you know?

379
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,520
A mother knows.

380
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,443
But I also know
it's possible

381
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:22,029
to regain your strength.

382
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:24,365
That we both can.

383
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,575
No, Mom, it's too late.

384
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:27,993
Uriel would...

385
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:32,373
He would still be alive
if it wasn't for me.

386
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,462
Come, there's something
you need to see.

387
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,849
Okay, so we found something
near the service road.

388
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:52,726
Look at this.

389
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,898
It's a nice little hiding
spot behind some bushes.

390
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:58,858
Disturbed ground.

391
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:00,234
Clear view of the stage.

392
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,861
Someone with a rifle
could've made this shot.

393
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:03,404
What's that?

394
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,406
That...

395
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,491
is a pastry napkin
from a Dutch food truck.

396
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,493
"Freddy's Dutch Oven"?
(sniffs)

397
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,328
Love this place.
Unfortunate name,

398
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,122
but best stroopwafel
in Hollywood.

399
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,124
The napkin is
definitely from today.

400
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,500
The syrup is still
wet to the touch.

401
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,335
And undoubtedly tasty.

402
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,963
So if the shooter bought this
stroop--whatever you call it--

403
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,090
with his credit card,
we can track his identity.

404
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:24,341
So we need to
get to the food truck

405
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,593
and talk to the owner.

406
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:26,635
I will put out a BOLO.

407
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:27,928
What is it with you
and BOLOs?

408
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,972
Why don't you just use
Freddy's Dutch Oven app?

409
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,640
Gives you their
current locale.

410
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,058
You never know
when you're in the mood

411
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,476
for a good strooping.

412
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:40,149
♪ You better mount up ♪

413
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:44,486
♪ You better ride on ♪

414
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,740
♪ You better run ♪

415
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,034
♪ Run away ♪

416
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,994
♪♪

417
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:53,621
You know what?

418
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:54,622
You stay here.

419
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,665
Don't move.
I'll do the talking.

420
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,418
Fine by me.

421
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,921
Detective Decker, LAPD.
Are you the owner?

422
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,340
Alfred Loomis, but
you can call me Freddy.

423
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,258
And let me guess.
You look like

424
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,677
a "chocolade hagelslag"
kind of girl. Am I right?

425
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,304
Sir, earlier today
you served a man

426
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,264
with a buzz cut, possibly
carrying a guitar case.

427
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,140
Does that ring a bell?

428
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:15,851
If I may, one order
of "oliebollen,"please.

429
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:17,269
What?

430
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:18,312
Oliebollen.

431
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,980
Literally means
"oily balls."

432
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,815
Tastes better than it sounds,
believe me.

433
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,817
- Thank you.
- No, sorry, Detective,

434
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,694
I don't remember
anyone like that.

435
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,488
But I wasn't here
during the morning shift.

436
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,740
Um, Freddy, I forgot
to tell you

437
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,201
a guy like that was
here when I opened.

438
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,244
He was asking when
you'd be around.

439
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,913
Asking for me specifically?

440
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,748
Actually, you know what?
Make the two orders, please.

441
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:38,749
- I'm famished.
- (impatient groans, murmurs)

442
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,542
- Lucifer--
- (gunshots)

443
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:43,170
- Everybody down!
- (panicked screams)

444
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,008
(sirens approaching)

445
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,677
Shooter on the roof.
Victim in the truck.

446
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:50,719
Secure the scene!

447
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:53,931
Bloody hell!

448
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,408
(seagulls cawing)

449
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:36,015
(distant siren wailing)

450
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,100
Not very polite
of Mr. Shooter to leave

451
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,601
without saying good-bye.

452
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,729
His bullets are saying plenty.

453
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,272
Well, why shoot
Food Truck Freddy,

454
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,773
just 'cause you were
questioning him?

455
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,776
No, this was premeditated.

456
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,403
The shooter came here
to find him,

457
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,863
then went to shoot the bride,

458
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,990
then came back when
he knew Freddy would be here.

459
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,330
This guy's got a list.

460
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,207
God, who's next?

461
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,835
(chuckles)
<i>He's</i> not gonna tell you.

462
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,634
Come bloody on!

463
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:15,679
(sighs)

464
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,264
(banging on machine)

465
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:19,641
What are you doing?

466
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,518
That's twice now today
I've been denied snacks.

467
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:22,561
You got change
for a hundie?

468
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,937
Oh, God.

469
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,273
All right, ballistics confirmed
the same rifle was used

470
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:29,568
in both shootings, but no prints
were found on the rooftop.

471
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,361
This guy paid cash
at the food truck.

472
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,113
He really covers
his tracks.

473
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,366
If I could just
find a connection

474
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,577
between our two victims.

475
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:40,412
But Peggy Russo
and Freddy Loomis

476
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,081
seem to have
nothing in common.

477
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,540
LUCIFER:
Apart from being dead.

478
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:46,293
Uh, maybe they were
just randomly chosen.

479
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:49,254
Mm, my gut says no.
This guy is too calculating.

480
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:50,631
Deliberate.

481
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,716
Until we find a link
between these t--

482
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:55,344
Teeny-tiny doughnuts,
or cool ranch puffs?

483
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,638
Lucifer, you can't
just steal food

484
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,014
in the middle
of the precinct.

485
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:00,849
Why? Are you gonna put me
on the naughty step,

486
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,267
so I can have a think
about what I've done?

487
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,311
(cell phone rings)

488
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,687
Hey, Monkey.

489
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,440
Yes, yeah, I-I'm
really sorry.

490
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:09,817
Work got busy.

491
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,778
Yes, I really, really want
to take you trick-or-treating.

492
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,072
But if Mommy or Daddy
can't make it home in time,

493
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,449
Babysitter Shelly might
have to take you, okay?

494
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,118
Oh, she already left.

495
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,328
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

496
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,122
But when she went
into Maze's room,

497
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,790
she ran out screaming.

498
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,291
It was hilarious.

499
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,961
- Who's watching you now?
- Maze.

500
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,255
Can she take me
trick-or-treating?

501
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,423
- No.
- Mommy, please?

502
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:34,591
I promise I'll be good.

503
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,635
Yeah, babe, it's not you
that I'm worried about.

504
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,762
Please, please,
please, please?

505
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,097
(huffs)

506
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,349
All right, put
Maze on the phone.

507
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:46,812
Yeah?

508
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,230
What did you do
to the babysitter?

509
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,064
Me?

510
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,107
She's the one
who didn't knock.

511
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,692
I had no time
to hide my toys.

512
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,319
Okay, Maze, look,
I have a favor to ask you.

513
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,863
That's Lucifer's thing.

514
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,157
I know, but I'll never
find a sitter this late.

515
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,161
And trick-or-treating is really
important to Trixie, Maze.

516
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,704
Will you please
take her for me?

517
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,499
Sure, I'll take your
offspring for a walk.

518
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,501
Well, she's not a dog,
but thank you.

519
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,462
Okay, don't let her
out of your sight,

520
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,673
please check her candy,
and take her early,

521
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,383
- like 3:00.
- Great.

522
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,343
Best after-parties don't start
till 3:00 anyway.

523
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,512
Not 3:00 a.m., 3:00 p.m.

524
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:21,847
I want her home before dark.

525
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,807
And do not take her
to any parties.

526
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:25,017
(scoffs)
Lame.

527
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,185
But whatever, your kid.

528
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:27,853
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

529
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,063
Oh, oh, did you see the costume?
I laid it on the bed.

530
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:32,900
Uh...

531
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:37,696
What's wrong?

532
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,116
I told Mommy I wanted to be
a princess when I was seven.

533
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,367
Now I'm eight.

534
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,036
And?

535
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,829
Halloween's supposed to be
the one night you get

536
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,706
to be whatever you want.

537
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,172
What do you want to be?

538
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,556
Where did he go?

539
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:07,893
Hey. I've been talking to
the food truck owner's wife.

540
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,436
She doesn't recognize
the zombie bride,

541
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,730
and doesn't think she has
any connection to her husband.

542
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,568
Two victims, two
devastated spouses.

543
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,113
Maybe we're looking
at this the wrong way.

544
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:28,038
Mrs. Loomis, I'm sorry.

545
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:29,331
I know you're going
through a lot.

546
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,583
I have one more
question for you, okay?

547
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,210
Do you recognize this man?

548
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,796
Yes, that's Edgar... Romero.

549
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:36,880
How do you know him?

550
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,131
We've worked together.

551
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,883
I'm a doctor.
He's a lawyer.

552
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,094
He handles many

553
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,929
of our hospital's
malpractice suits.

554
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:45,639
He's married

555
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,057
- to the other victim?
- Yes, but

556
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,434
the connection we've been
looking for isn't between them;

557
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,144
it's between you, the spouses.

558
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,604
So, you think
the shooter's upset

559
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,523
because of one of these
malpractice suits?

560
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,399
CHLOE:
Maybe.

561
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,985
Maybe he's taking it out
on their loved ones.

562
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,570
Can you give us a list
of all the cases

563
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,114
that Edgar litigated for you?

564
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,579
CHLOE:
When are you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

565
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:10,539
Do you want to talk about it?

566
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:11,498
LUCIFER:
Why would I want to do that?

567
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:12,749
'Cause that's
what partners do.

568
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:13,583
They talk.

569
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,210
I can tell you
about my headaches

570
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,753
living with Maze
and you can tell me

571
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:17,879
what's going on with you.

572
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:18,839
Pass.

573
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:21,300
Lucifer,

574
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:22,467
seriously,

575
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,136
whatever you're going through...

576
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,804
I don't know, maybe I can help.

577
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,139
(snorts)
How?

578
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:28,807
By giving me a warm, fuzzy hug?

579
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,976
They won't release
the damn case files.

580
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,729
Some crap about new HIPAA laws
requiring extra warrants.

581
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,814
It could be days before we get
a judge to sign off on that.

582
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,983
Oh, well, it looks like
Detective Douche is the one

583
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,860
who needs a hug.
Mm, come here, Daniel.

584
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,528
- Mm.
- Get off me, man.

585
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,572
Uh, Daniel, if you want
to talk about your feelings,

586
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,032
Detective Decker is offering.

587
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,158
Why don't give
you two a minute

588
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,159
so you can
talk about your

589
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,161
earth-shattering problems.

590
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:51,913
- What was that?
- I told you

591
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,165
something's going on with him.

592
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:54,624
- I'm getting worried.
- Yeah, well,

593
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:55,917
honestly, Chloe,
we have bigger things

594
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,419
- to worry about right now.
- I know.

595
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:58,962
I'll see if I can expedite
the warrants,

596
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,881
and, uh, call the lieutenant.

597
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,175
Right. Here you go.

598
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,509
Merry Christmas.

599
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,386
Or should I say,
Happy Halloween.

600
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:07,346
Are these the files?

601
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,597
Where did you get these?

602
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,182
Well, if you ask permission,
people can say no,

603
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,850
but flash a badge
to the right sap

604
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,060
and voilà.

605
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:15,645
This is mine.

606
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:17,189
All right, chill out, Daniel.

607
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,982
What's a little badge borrowing
between friends?

608
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,026
I mean, at least I didn't have
to use this.

609
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,861
You stole my gun and my badge?

610
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,945
What the hell is
the matter with you?!

611
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,322
Hey, guys...

612
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,531
Are you gonna take his side
in this right now?

613
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,991
- Is that what you're doing?
- Well, I got the files,

614
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,201
didn't I?
I did what I had to do.

615
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,994
Oh, please,
don't give me that crap.

616
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:32,204
You never do
what you have to do,

617
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,163
Lucifer.

618
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:34,873
You only ever do
what you want to.

619
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,583
That is not true.

620
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,877
There's a lot of things
that I didn't want to do.

621
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,003
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

622
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,172
Because if I only ever did
what I wanted to do,

623
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:43,673
then right now, I'd do this.

624
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,759
(Daniel groaning)

625
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:49,638
What the hell is wrong
with you?!

626
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,306
Why are you so surprised,
Detective?!

627
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,266
I'm the Devil, remember?
I'm evil!

628
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,726
No, what you are
is off this case.

629
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,895
You go home now.
You're done.

630
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:00,690
Go!

631
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,117
CHLOE:
Are you okay?

632
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,411
- Not really.
- All right, well...

633
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:15,330
let's get you checked out
and return the files.

634
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,873
What if we hold off for a bit?

635
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,751
I don't agree
with what Lucifer did.

636
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,337
But there's still
a killer out there.

637
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,048
And these files might be
the key to stopping him.

638
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,050
Are you suggesting we keep them?

639
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,593
More like borrow.

640
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,304
AMENADIEL:
Where are we going, Mom?

641
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:32,848
You'll see soon enough.

642
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,724
But first, we need to get
something straight.

643
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,519
Uriel's death was
not your fault.

644
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,020
How can you say that, Mom?

645
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,942
Do you remember when
you boys were young?

646
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,778
Uriel always playing
pranks on Lucifer

647
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:48,405
to get your
Father's attention?

648
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,449
Annoying little runt.

649
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,284
And he never got
in trouble for it

650
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,077
because you
took the blame.

651
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,705
Just looking out for
my little brother, Mom.

652
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,582
No, it's more than that.

653
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,626
You have welcomed responsibility
your entire life.

654
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,962
Don't you think
you deserve a break?

655
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,465
Mom, you just don't understand.

656
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,758
Don't you think I
feel responsible, too?

657
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:10,969
All of this
fighting has been

658
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:12,429
over me.

659
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,849
Uriel is gone forever
because of me,

660
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:17,267
not you.

661
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,102
How can you say that, Mom?

662
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:20,562
You did everything

663
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,813
that you could do.

664
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,190
You volunteered
to go back to Hell.

665
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:25,192
You stepped up
and did the right thing.

666
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,610
Isn't that all
you've been doing?

667
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,528
Trying to please
your Father

668
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,405
by doing what you
think is right?

669
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,782
You shouldn't be punished.

670
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,410

both Dr. Loomis and

Six settled, three pending
and that last one there

708
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,384
was recently dismissed.

709
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:17,095
Wrongful death suit thrown out
for lack of evidence.

710
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,430
That's frustrating.

711
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,140
- Could be motive.
- Yeah. I don't know.

712
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,058
Maybe our plaintiff was pissed
about the dismissal,

713
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,060
decided to settle his grievances
another way.

714
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:27,355
Let's see... plaintiff,
Wes Williams.

715
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,024
He sued for his wife
Cassandra's death

716
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,692
after she lost a battle with--

717
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,944
oh man, I can't
even pronounce this--

718
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:36,281
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis?

719
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,033
- Yeah. Lung disease.
- Yeah, well, it looks like

720
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,618
Wes blamed
Cassandra's physician,

721
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,536
our Dr. Sidney Loomis,
and the hospital's lawyer,

722
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,163
Edgar Romero,
got the case thrown out.

723
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,831
It's no one's fault
for a disease like that.

724
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,792
Yeah, well, apparently,
Wes didn't feel that way.

725
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:50,045
What's wrong?

726
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:51,379
Nothing, I just...

727
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,423
I kind of feel bad for the guy's
situation, you know?

728
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:58,762
I mean, I-I don't know
what I would do if my wife...

729
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:01,097
Yeah, right.

730
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,224
Well, what you wouldn't do
is start revenge killing

731
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,726
a bunch of innocent people.

732
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:07,437
Good point.

733
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:10,649
Okay, let's see if our Wes
Williams is in the system.

734
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:15,487
(computer beeps)

735
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:16,905
No criminal record.

736
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,990
But he fits the description.

737
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:21,951
Look at that.

738
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,162
He's an ATF agent.

739
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,580
Nicknamed "The Ghost."

740
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:27,624
He served multiple
assignments in Mexico

741
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:28,625
trying to take down
the cartels.

we could've detected it sooner.

889
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,674
She would still be alive.

890
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,342
Yes.

891
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:02,680

It's punishment.

Hey.

896
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:27,455
How did you find us?

897
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:29,957
Just called the station chief.

898
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,250
Got all the details.

899
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:34,253
What you just did was
extremely reckless and stupid.

or that you're evil,
or you're the Devil,
