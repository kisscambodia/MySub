Lucifer,
you brought a surprise.

47

I most certainly did not bring
any surprises.

Oh, she's beautiful.

(elevator bell dings)

53
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:04,459
Listen, Mum,
I know I chose

54
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,336
not to return you to Hell,
yet...

55
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,379
- Which I appreciate.
- But that doesn't mean

56
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:10,924
you can just waltz in here
and accost my guests.

57
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,092
I apologize.

58
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,427
It's just that all
these human rules

59
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,888
and customs are
so confusing.

60
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,558
Remember, I'm still getting
used to this earthly skin sack.

61
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,435
Yes, yes, you used
to be a goddess.

62
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:24,062
I know, but things
are different now.

63
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,730
And I will figure it out.

64
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:27,941
Now that we're
together again,

65
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,692
I just want to be
part of your lives.

66
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,027
Not this part!

67
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:33,696
Out of bounds.

68
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,159
Wait. What do you
mean by "lives"?

69
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:41,121
I want to see Amenadiel.

70
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:43,373
(laughs):
What?

71
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:45,333
It's time.

72
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:47,877
I am not
going to live

73
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:49,921
in fear of my own son.

74
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,631
We may have had
our differences...

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,049
He literally
carried you to Hell.

76
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:54,968
But I created him.

77
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,553
Certainly that has to
count for something.

78
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,596
It doesn't. Bummer, right?

79
00:02:58,805 --> 00:02:59,806
One look at you,
and he'll take you

80
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,099
right back where you came from.

81
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,144
I'm surprised he hasn't
come sniffing around already.

82
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,729
Well, what am I supposed to do,
just sit here and hide?

83
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:08,898
See a movie, go to a museum.

84
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,651
Catch up on what's happened over
the past few thousand years.

85
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,819
You'd be surprised.

86
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,279
Yes. I suppose
a lot has changed.

87
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:15,446
I mean, who would've predicted
you would've

88
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:17,323
taken on this human job?

89
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:20,535
I'm a punisher, Mother.
It's what I've always done.

90
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,745
The only thing that changed
was the locale.

91
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:24,372
(scoffs)

92
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:31,880
I know what you're thinking,

93
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,090
but I was assisting on a
stakeout that went long,

94
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:36,301
and I'm really sorry,
but I promise you,

95
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:38,011
I will make it
up to you, okay?

96
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:40,471
How?

97
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:45,560
Double fudge, your favorite.

98
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,397
You're lucky I like you.

99
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:53,651
(sighs)

100
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,111
Hey.

101
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,987
Hey.

102
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,615
Thank you for letting me
do the pickup here at work.

103
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:01,576
I've just been running around
a lot since the demotion.

104
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:02,619
You know, helping out

105
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:03,828
on everyone else's cases.

106
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:05,705
Yeah. It's fine, it's fine.

107
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:07,874
Are we still going
on our family camping trip?

108
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,459
Oh, uh...

109
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,962
We're still ler... working
out the logistics of that.

110
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,631
Of the trip.

111
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:18,509
(clears throat)

112
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:20,386
Look, I know that
you're still mad at me.

113
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:21,804
I deserve it.

114
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,432
But this stuff between us is
starting to affect Trixie.

115
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,810
So I think that we
need to talk later.

116
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:29,854
(phone ringing)

117
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,522
Yeah, yeah. We should.

118
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,024
You're right.

119
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:34,275
Uh, Decker.

120
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,945
Okay, yeah.
Two seconds.

MAN:

122
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:43,117
And I'm sorry.

123
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,204
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

124
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,873
Victim's name was
Nicholas Sands, 35.

125
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:52,043
Worked as an exec at the
Internet startup called Wobble.

126
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:53,336
Wobble?

127
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,546
Please tell me that's
a pornography site.

128
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:58,383
Oh, no, no. Wobble's like
a next gen Facebook, you know?

129
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:00,635
People post updates,
photos, links.

130
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,804
Mine's mostly slo-mo videos
of me doing cannonballs

131
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,389
onto inflatable pool toys.

132
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:05,932
You should check it out.

133
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,892
I'll pass, but thank you.

134
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,186
Nick's confession was posted
to his Wobble account

135
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:12,605
six hours ago,
right around the time of death.

136
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:15,525
Which means whoever did this
wanted us to find that video.

137
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,152
So we could see how weepy
this chap was before he died.

138
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,529
Now, that is cruel.

139
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,573
Ella, do we know
how the fire started?

140
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:24,284
Any chemicals
we can trace?

141
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,869
So far, all we've got
is paraffin oil.

142
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,706
Which is highly flammable,
but also, like, everywhere.

143
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:32,709
Even in crayons, so
color at your own risk.

144
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,836
Doesn't help us
narrow the suspects.

145
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,129
Yeah, but this might.

146
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:37,755
Okay, so based
on the burn pattern,

147
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,966
which is pretty gnarly
in this case,

148
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,385
it looks like the highest
concentration of accelerant

149
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:43,970
was placed, well...

150
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:45,471
here.

151
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:50,643
LUCIFER:
Goodness gracious,

152
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:52,353
great balls of fire.

153
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:53,938
- Lucifer.
- I mean, I've heard
of hot pants,

154
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:55,148
but this really
brings new meaning

155
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,941
- to the term "fire
crotch," doesn't it?
- Lucifer.

156
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,026
Wait. I have more.

157
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,235
Smokey Bobinson.

158
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,403
Weekend at Burnie's.

159
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:01,487
His burning bush?

160
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,781
Oh. Very good.
(chuckles)

161
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:05,616
That was actually me,
by the way,

162
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,160
- so don't tell anyone.
- CHLOE: Hey, guys?

163
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:08,536
Dead body.

164
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,371
Can you please
take this seriously?

165
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,291
I assure you, Detective,
I'm taking this very seriously.

166
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:14,334
Look at this.

167
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,711
Our killer was clearly
punishing his victim.

168
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:19,505
And?

169
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,716
And punishing is my job.

170
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:22,842
So if there's
someone out there

171
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:25,136
stealing my jam,
I need to find out who.

172
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,848
It's game bloody on.

173
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,934
♪♪

174
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:43,654
CHLOE: Do not touch
the charred crotch.

175
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,492
Is a sentence I never
thought I'd say out loud.

176
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:49,911
It's vicious work.

177
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:51,454
I mean, I reserve
this kind of treatment

178
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,206
for the truly terrible
in Hell.

179
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,458
Pedophiles, Nazis.

180
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,460
People who put their
seats back on a plane.

181
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,506
Uh-huh. Seeing as the nature
of the crime is so specific,

182
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:03,841
we need to figure out
who had a personal grudge

183
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,676
- against the victim.
- Hmm.

184
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:11,140
Uh, by the way, you've
skipped a spot, there.

185
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:12,767
Oh. (chuckles)

186
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,352
Yeah, it's not like you

187
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,312
to miss a step in the
clothing department.

188
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,688
Yes, well, I had to rush out
this morning.

189
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:20,066
I've got an unexpected
houseguest I can't get rid of.

190
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,151
Oh, right. New lady friend
that you can't shake.

191
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,070
A rather old one,
actually.

192
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:28,991
Yeah, I know how...
complicated exes can be.

193
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,660
What? She's not an ex.

194
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:32,370
OFFICER: You should
see this, Detective.

195
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:33,913
Thanks.

196
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,081
What is it?

197
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,792
E-mails from Nick's
supervisor at Wobble.

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,710
A woman by the name
of Leila Simms.

199
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,837
Let me guess,
something riveting

200
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,296
about the latest
quarterly report?

201
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:43,464
"How could you?

202
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,049
"I should have
known better.

203
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:46,676
You won't get
away with this."

204
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:49,053
"I'll burn you
starting with your man parts"?

205
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,140
No. (sighs)

206
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,225
- Still, that's a pretty
good lead.
- Yep.

207
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:00,523
CHLOE:
Do not... touch...

208
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,024
the charred crotch.

209
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:08,865
And Nick was so...
sweet and charming.

210
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,117
How could someone do
such a thing?

211
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,119
So, Leila, you were
his supervisor.

212
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,454
How well did you
know him?

213
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:16,497
We dated briefly,
a while ago.

214
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:17,790
LUCIFER:
Oh.

215
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:21,127
(sighs)

216
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,337
Would you say
things sort of flamed out,

217
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:24,172
or did they end in more of

218
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,548
a blaze of glory?

219
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,300
- Lucifer.
- You're right, far too subtle.

220
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,260
Why did you torture
the poor young man to death?

221
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:31,554
Torture him?

222
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,056
Oh, God.

223
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,058
You think I had
something to do with this?

224
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,643
Well, we know about
the angry e-mails.

225
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,395
I was pissed off.

226
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:41,689
He shared pictures
of us together.

227
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:43,065
Mm, mid-coitus?

228
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:44,859
If so, we'll have to
confiscate those immediately.

229
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,277
No.

230
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:47,361
Just of us

231
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,404
at-at dinner.

232
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,031
But I'm his boss,

233
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,116
and inter-office romance
is frowned upon here.

234
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:53,242
Well, it hardly
seems worthy

235
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,495
of lighting a man's
Johnson on fire.

236
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:57,955
Wait.

237
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,500
Is that how he died?

238
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:03,044
There's something
you should see.

239
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:06,714
(intercom beeps)

240
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:08,674
Ray, can you come in here,
please?

241
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:12,512
Ray, I'm gonna need you
to pull up the video

242
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,680
of Tommy at the
company retreat.

243
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,098
RAY:
<i>The</i> video of Tommy?

244
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:17,767
Ray's head of our H.R.

245
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,477
Being protective is
part of his job.

246
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:20,978
Do it, Ray.

247
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:25,566
Nick was a charmer,
but he had a tendency

248
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:27,527
to be a little harsh
with interns.

249
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,695
Aka, he could be a real dick.

250
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:32,573
As you'll see.

251
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:39,664
Aah! Aah!
(laughter)

252
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,582
My balls! Get it off!

253
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,126
(laughter continues)

254
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:45,878
(laughing)

255
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:49,131
Come on,
that is quite funny.

256
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,300
LEILA: Nick posted the video
shortly after the retreat,

257
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:53,302
and even though
it was quickly taken down,

258
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:54,845
everyone saw it.

259
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,847
Tommy was a
laughingstock.

260
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:58,849
He quit pretty soon after.

261
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,685
Certainly looks like motive.

262
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:03,104
Huh.

263
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,609
What can you tell me
about Nick Sand's death?

264
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:11,404
Just that the bastard
finally got what he deserved.

265
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:14,156
Okay. And why did
he deserve it?

266
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,534
As soon as I took
the job at Wobble,

267
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,452
Nick made it
his personal mission

268
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,912
to make my life hell.

269
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,748
Sabotaging my work,
terrorizing me,

270
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,959
making me the butt
of all of his jokes.

271
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,752
Or the <i>balls,</i> in this case?

272
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:29,797
TOMMY:
That stupid video was

273
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:31,382
my breaking point.

274
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,635
Everyone saw it.
Everyone laughed at me!

275
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,512
No one's laughing now, Tommy.

276
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:39,265
So after everything
that happened, what,

277
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,934
you-you wanted to
make him feel your pain?

278
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:43,853
He deserved
what happened to him.

279
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,188
Yeah, but you're not
answering the question.

280
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:49,650
Did you kill Nick?

281
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,571
LUCIFER: I understand
punishment all too well, Tommy,

282
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,948
and Nick deserved
to be punished.

283
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:58,492
He did, didn't he?

284
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,536
LUCIFER: Mm. He took your
dignity, and so you had to

285
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,704
take your revenge.

286
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,457
There was no other way to get
your proverbial balls back.

287
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:06,876
So tell me...

288
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,129
...did you desire...

289
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:11,339
I killed him.

290
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,007
Oh.

291
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,925
Well, that took

292
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:16,510
all the fun out of it.

293
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:21,932
That did not go how I expected.

294
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:24,018
Oh, come now, Detective.
He obviously wanted people

295
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,478
to know that he got
his revenge.

296
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,855
Now our would-be punisher's
brought to justice,

297
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,024
and the field is mine again...

298
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,819
What on earth is she doing here?

299
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:35,154
CHLOE:
Charlotte Richards.

300
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,239
The defense attorney
we saved, remember?

301
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:40,159
She must be back here
defending some scumbag.

302
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:43,204
But why are they
all being so... chummy?

303
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,040
CHLOE: Well, she used to be
a cop, and, oh, yeah,

304
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,708
'cause she's a knockout.

305
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,877
Personally, I'm surprised
that you haven't tried...

306
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:52,546
Pardon me, pardon me.
Excuse us.

307
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:55,216
Charlotte, hello. Do you mind
if we have a quick word?

308
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,301
(chuckles)

309
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,554
(quietly): What are you
doing here, Mother?

310
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,139
I thought we agreed
you'd do something constructive

311
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:04,266
with your time, like
mall walking or a studio tour,

312
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:05,643
perhaps, but...

313
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,395
How did you even find
your way here?

314
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,105
Well, it wasn't difficult.

315
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:12,316
I simply smiled at a male human
and asked him to take me.

316
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:15,194
Need I remind you that Charlotte
Richards has a husband out there

317
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:17,154
who's wondering
where she popped off to.

318
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:19,407
And you have a son who wants
to take you back to Hell.

319
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,450
So drawing attention
to yourself in a police station

320
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:24,495
in this little... getup,
not a good idea.

321
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:27,123
But I had to see
it for myself.

322
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,500
My boy, working,
toiling,

323
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,335
amidst humanity's muck.

324
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,295
Well, I hope it's everything
you imagined and more.

325
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,631
Now go see <i>Cabaret.</i> I'm sure
you'll find it riveting.

326
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:37,675
I just don't understand.

327
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,177
Of all the things that
you could do with your talents,

328
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:41,762
law enforcement?

329
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,973
Have you considered I might
enjoy exploring humanity?

330
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,099
(elevator bell dings)

331
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,143
They eat, darling.

332
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,686
All they do is eat.

333
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,021
And then afterwards,
the food comes out changed

334
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,399
and not for the better.

335
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,153
Detective.

336
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,905
I didn't realize

337
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:01,532
you and Charlotte knew
each other so well.

338
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:04,952
Oh, we do and we don't.
It's a long story, really.

339
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:06,912
Right, shall we
go somewhere

340
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,956
to, uh, celebrate
solving the case?

341
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:10,416
No. Not yet.

342
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:12,835
Tommy was humiliated.

343
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,420
Makes sense
why he'd want to kill Nick.

344
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,880
But something
just doesn't sit right.

345
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:18,340
Detective, you, of all people,
should know how good it feels

346
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,134
to punish someone
who's wronged you.

347
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,886
- How so?
- Oh, come now.

348
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,889
You may not be roasting
Dan's chestnuts-- yet--

349
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,433
but a shoulder shrug here,
a dismissive look there

350
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,185
- could be just as effective.
- Okay, fine.

351
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,353
Maybe I've been a little hard on
Dan lately, but he deserves it.

352
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,355
And I'm sure
you found it very satisfying.

353
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,482
But have you considered

354
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,150
for just one moment

355
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,903
how your fighting affects
those caught in the middle?

356
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,404
You mean Trixie?

357
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,156
What? No, I mean me.

358
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,533
Think how terribly
bored I am by it all.

359
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,535
Ah, look, there he is.
Now's your chance

360
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,662
to stop with your "will they,
won't they" nonsense.

361
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:49,955
It's not that simple.

362
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,624
I'm avoiding
a difficult conversation.

363
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:52,625
Well, I...

364
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:54,543
Hi.

365
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:55,878
There's something
you got to see.

366
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:58,297
Another apology video dropped
along with another body.

367
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,132
MAN:
I know it was wrong!

368
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,884
I shouldn't have posted
that video!

369
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:05,930
She didn't deserve
to be humiliated like that.

370
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,389
(sobs):
I'm sorry.

371
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,351
♪♪

372
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,543
CHLOE:
(sighs) Two murders.

373
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:36,877
Same M.O.

374
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,547
But Tommy was already in custody
when this guy was killed.

375
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:40,881
There's no way
he did this.

376
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,591
LUCIFER: Tommy wanted
his dignity back.

377
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,093
Whoever did this

378
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,595
clearly had a much grander
objective in mind.

379
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:48,973
Ladies and gentlemen,

380
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:51,141
it looks like we're
tracking a serial killer.

381
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,940
Victim's Adam Wiser, 29,

382
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,025
worked as an assistant
at a local bank.

383
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,611
Time of death was two hours ago,
but apparently he's been missing

384
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,904
for almost two days.

385
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,073
Ooh, that's a long time
on a sex rack.

386
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:08,117
Not a record,
but quite impressive.

387
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,202
Ella, we know
the cause of death?

388
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,830
Well, he's got broken ribs,
a ruptured spleen

389
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,875
and possible cranial bleeding,
which would all totally suck.

390
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,793
And yet, this dude asphyxiated.

391
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:20,212
He was choked
with an apple?

392
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:21,297
No.

393
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,425
More like an orchard.

394
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:26,886
We're gonna have to cut
him open to get the rest.

395
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:28,387
That's messed up.

396
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:30,890
Certainly brings new meaning
to the term "deep throat."

397
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,391
Why not just
kill the guy?

398
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,393
Why all the pomp
and circumstance?

399
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,896
Well, our punisher's
clearly sending a message.

400
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,564
Perhaps if we find the
video that Apple Boy

401
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,108
is apologizing for,
we'll know what that message is.

402
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,736
- Hold this.
- What are you doing?

403
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,447
The original video was filmed
on Nick's phone, right?

404
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:47,740
What if Adam's doing
the same thing?

405
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:48,949
(dialing)

406
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,826
(phone beeps)

407
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:53,871
(ringtone playing)

408
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,127
Be careful, Detective.

409
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,587
Might be a booby trap.

410
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:02,922
(ringtone continues)

411
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,423
(sighs)

412
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:13,265
The video's already cued up.

413
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,186
Look at this.

414
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,199
Notice anything familiar?

415
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:31,784
The ball gag's
amaranth.

416
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,243
Just like the apple.

417
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:36,664
What, so our killer's paying
homage to a bloody sex tape?

418
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,166
He's recreating the crimes
he's punishing for.

419
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,043
First lighting Nick's
groin on fire, now this.

420
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,252
He's upping his game.

421
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,545
Yeah, but what's
with the outfit?

422
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,506
I mean, other than giving me
super creepy flashbacks

423
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,133
to Catholic school,
it doesn't add up.

424
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,386
And the woman is not
wearing one in the video.

425
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,763
She certainly looks too old
to be in school.

426
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,016
Unless she
teaches at one.

427
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,145
(siren whoops)

428
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,691
Her name's
Sarah Aiken, 27.

429
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,693
- Third grade teacher.
- Cute.

430
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,529
Not hot, but extra points
for proclivities.

431
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:09,989
When she broke things
off with Adam,

432
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,491
he uploaded his
revenge porn to Wobble.

433
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,411
Some teachers caught wind
of it, and she was fired.

434
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,080
Well, maybe she took out both
Nick and our loathsome ex.

435
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,873
You know, no harm, no foul.

436
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,835
- And no dice because she had
no connection to Nick.
- Oh.

437
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:26,171
And shortly after she lost
her job, she killed herself.

438
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,757
What, so our poor,
sexy teacher's dead,

439
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,343
and our apple-chomping
schoolboy's responsible?

440
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,721
And the only other connection
we were able to find

441
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,640
is that both victims posted
their illicit videos to Wobble.

442
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,852
So, maybe some sicko
saw both videos

443
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,770
- and decided to take action.
- "Sicko"?

444
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:44,356
Sounds to me like someone's
doing our job for us.

445
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,859
We don't exact
vengeance, Lucifer.

446
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,110
Well, maybe we should.

447
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,695
As far as I'm concerned,

448
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,613
these little wankers
got exactly what they deserved.

449
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:52,698
See you later.

450
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,867
Hey, where are you going?

451
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,577
We have to find out
who did this.

452
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:57,619
Well, I thought
someone out there

453
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,538
was stealing my job,
but far be it for me

454
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:01,206
to stand in the way
of excellent work.

455
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:02,708
I'm off for a drink.

456
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,669
♪ Hey ♪

457
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,588
♪ Hey ♪

458
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,673
LINDA (chuckles):
No.

459
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,759
Honestly, I'm impressed.

460
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,553
It's hard going out on your own.

461
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,473
Changing old habits.

462
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,141
I admire the steps
you're taking.

463
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,060
Well, don't
admire too much.

464
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,103
I'm still coming to Lux.

465
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:24,354
Hmm, yes.

466
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,856
Baby steps are fine.

467
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,943
Plus, the view here is... nice.

468
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:30,778
(chuckles softly)

469
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,908
The real key
is to avoid setbacks.

470
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:42,414
(sighs) Setbacks that are tall,
blond and have a special place

471
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:43,457
- in Hell?
- Mm.

472
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,333
Hi, Maze.

473
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:46,919
Hi, human.

474
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,424
I need to get rid
of that bitch.

475
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,927
Now I know
why you're still here.

476
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:56,929
Why?

477
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,849
You and Lucifer are very close.

478
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,977
It's normal that you be
jealous of a new girlfriend.

479
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,229
(laughs)

480
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,689
- I'm not jealous.
- Ah. Mm-hmm.

481
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,525
- And she's not his girlfriend.
- (chuckles)

482
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,110
She's just toxic.

483
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,612
Lucifer doesn't
see it, but I do.

484
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:15,447
Oh, so you want
to protect him?

485
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,784
I want her to get
what she deserves.

486
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,286
Which, at the very
least, is a head-butt.

487
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,329
I'll be right back.

488
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:23,330
Okay, okay.

489
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,457
(chuckles):
Okay, maybe...

490
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,459
we should start
with our words.

491
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,962
Perhaps as Lucifer's friend,
you can talk to him.

492
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,381
Express how you feel.

493
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,049
He won't listen.

494
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,553
But maybe someone else will.

495
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:40,222
Where are you going?

496
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,015
Taking your advice.

497
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,642
Hey, Man Bun.

498
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,060
Take care of my friend.

499
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:47,896
(sighs)

500
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,149
Why do I even try?

501
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,234
Because you're
an incredible woman.

502
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,486
Oh.

503
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,904
Thanks.

504
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,076
So, I reached out to Wobble
to cross-reference who saw

505
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,619
both Nick and Adam's videos.

506
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,663
- And?
- They lawyered up.

507
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,874
Hid behind privacy laws,
and without a warrant,

508
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,501
Wobble won't let us anywhere
near their viewership data.

509
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,547
Okay, pull the warrant,
and I'm on my way there.

510
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,758
No problem.

511
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:17,926
Dan.

512
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:19,845
Um...

513
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,597
So I've been thinking
about the trip,

514
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:22,848
and, um...

515
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,185
I don't think it's
fair to put Trixie

516
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,187
in the middle of our
problems, you know?

517
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,147
So you want to skip it.

518
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,941
No, I want to spare us
all heartache and...

519
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,277
I just feel like if
we go on the trip

520
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,362
and, you know, we pretend
everything's fine,

521
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,364
then we're just lying to her.

522
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:40,824
Yeah.

523
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:43,493

Excuse me. Mom.

537
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:17,653
Oh.

538
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:18,904
What do you think
you're doing?

539
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,572
I'm taking your lead, son.

540
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,282
Learning about
your beloved humanity.

541
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,951
By dancing at my club?

542
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,077
Well, I saw all the people

543
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,120
on the tables smiling
and I wanted to discover

544
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,914
what they were so happy about.

545
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,833
Oh, is it possible it's
the money that I pay them?

546
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,168
It's possible.

547
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,546
But I have to admit
that when I started dancing,

548
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,715
rubbing up against
the other humans,

549
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:40,968
I got a tingling
sensation...

550
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,427
Okay, that's enough.

551
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,554
Excuse me, excuse me, thank you.

552
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:45,889
I don't understand.

553
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:47,432
I thought you'd be
pleased by my effort.

554
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,434
Disturbed is more like it.

555
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,312
Are you actually trying
to systematically disrupt

556
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:54,189
- every part of my life?
- No.

557
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:57,109
I'm trying to <i>learn</i> about
every part of your life.

558
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:57,985
Oh, right.

559
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,444
How's that going for you so far?

560
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,613
Well, quite
illuminating, actually.

561
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,033
I understand now why you
have this provocative club.

562
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,327
I understand why
you amused yourself

563
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,329
- with that
curvaceous savage.
- (sighs)

564
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:10,956
But what I don't
understand...

565
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,416
Is my human job. Yes, I know.

566
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:15,669
It's very simple:
I'm a civilian consultant.

567
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,338
But why do you
still punish people?

568
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,257
It's what I've always done.

569
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,466
That's not true.

570
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,844
That's who your father
wanted you to be.

571
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:28,015
Are you still trying
to win him over?

572
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:29,558
Careful, Mother.

573
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,143
Why?

574
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,728
Are you going
to punish me?

575
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:50,829
LEILA:
I'm sorry, Detective.

576
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,956
I looked into
the two videos in question,

577
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,958
and unfortunately,
there was no overlap.

578
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,376
CHLOE:
Doesn't make any sense.

579
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,462
I'll need a list of everyone
who saw the videos.

580
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,715
Sadly, we don't track people,
just I.P. addresses.

581
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,926
(sighs) Maybe I'm looking
at this the wrong way.

582
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,846
Can you take me through how
your video process works?

583
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,390
Well, our users can upload
anything they want.

584
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,392
And if we find that
the content's inappropriate--

585
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,687
uh, anything from
animal cruelty to beheadings--

586
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,064
it gets taken down.

587
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,398
By who?

588
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,233
Our content moderators.

589
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,276
Huh.

590
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,195
LEILA: Most of them
only last a few months.

591
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:24,237
Frankly, most people

592
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,448
can't stomach something
so dark or upsetting.

593
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,576
- Right.
- (Lucifer laughing)

594
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:31,203
LUCIFER:
God, that has got to smart.

595
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,287
(Lucifer laughs)

596
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,247
Can I see that again?

597
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:36,666
Lucifer?

598
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,585
Oh, Detective.
You're here.

599
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,170
Did you know that this room

600
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:42,005
collects all the best parts
of the Internet?

601
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,715
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, yeah.

602
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,675
But you got to see this--
a-a naked man

603
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,469
thinks he can jump
on the back of a rhino.

604
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,930
(laughs): You'll never
guess what he lands on.

605
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:51,431
Actually, you probably will.

606
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:53,809
What? You've seen it already?

607
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:57,145
(sighs)

608
00:23:58,355 --> 00:23:59,189
What are you doing here?

609
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:00,857
Trying to catch our killer.

610
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,442
- Duh.
- I thought you didn't care

611
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,986
- whether this sicko
was brought to justice.
- Oh, I don't.

612
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,155
But then I realized that
our killer may have the answer

613
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,449
to a question that I'm,
you know, struggling with.

614
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,492
Mm.

615
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,035
Why does he punish?

616
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:13,495
That's it?

617
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,956
First you want to teach
this vigilante a lesson,

618
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,874
- and now you want to
have a talk with him?
- Yes.

619
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,543
And lucky for me, I found out
where you were headed.

620
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,170
(chuckles): I mean,
these videos are enthralling.

621
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,047
CHLOE: No, I-I can't.
I can't watch these.

622
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,549
- (growling)
- LUCIFER:
Oh, I've seen worse.

623
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:27,968
But never so many collected
in one single room.

624
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,302
You know, if I ever
go back to Hell,

625
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,138
I am getting me
one of these.

626
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,598
Selfish bastards
get to see everything.

627
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,518
(woman screaming over video)

628
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,562
- (scoffs)
- Yeah.

629
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:41,273
They do.

630
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,275
I know where
the overlap is.

631
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,865
♪♪

632
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:17,476
(sighs)

633
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,187
(knock on door)

634
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:23,607
MAZE: Amenadiel,
I know you're in there.

635
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,068
(vacuum whirring)

636
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:28,236
Open up!

637
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:32,782
(vacuum stops)

638
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:35,619
Hey.

639
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,209
What are you hiding?

640
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:44,419
Nothing.

641
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:45,378
(chuckles)

642
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,051
(laughs):
Oh.

643
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:56,097
I see what's going on with you.

644
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,935
- You do?
- Sure.

645
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,812
Humans say that rebound sex
is important after a breakup.

646
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,690
You don't have to hide
that you're getting some.

647
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:07,234
(laughs)

648
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:08,652
I'm not.

649
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,280
Right.

650
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,450
Of course. I didn't want you
to feel awkward.

651
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:17,244
Silly me.

652
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,456
(sighs)

653
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:24,042
So what are
you doing here?

654
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,546
I have a problem.

655
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:29,089
I need your help.

656
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,508
There's a new...

657
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,052
woman in Lucifer's life.

658
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:37,472
I want her gone,
but he won't listen to me.

659
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,182
And why do you care?
I thought you were

660
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,767
stepping away
from both of us.

661
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:41,768
I am.

662
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:46,398
- But before I do,
I need you...
- I'll talk to him.

663
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:47,482
Yeah.

664
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:52,904
Well, that was easy.

665
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:54,614
I'm his big brother, Maze.

666
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,825
I really should start looking
out for him more often.

667
00:26:58,994 --> 00:26:59,911
Okay.

668
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,706
Thank you.

669
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,001
All right. Thanks.

670
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:07,961
Dan's working with
Wobble to trace

671
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,754
what moderator may have
pulled both videos.

672
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,006
Hopefully, we'll
have an answer soon.

673
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,215
Then why are you
so sure the killer's

674
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:13,675
one of these misanthropes?

675
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,051
CHLOE:
Well, serial killers

676
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,469
usually start with
someone they know.

677
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,221
If the killer worked
here, they knew Nick,

678
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,015
saw how much the
prank hurt Tommy.

679
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,850
So you think
seeing someone they recognized

680
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:24,644
in one of these twisted videos
finally made them snap?

681
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:26,813
Maybe it awakened
something in them.

682
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,233
Something that was always there,
just fighting to get out.

683
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,235
(chuckles) But...

684
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,572
they were just
trying to do a job.

685
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,866
Job no one else wanted.

686
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,659
Well, maybe they chose
that for a reason.

687
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,829
No one chooses
to be a sin-eater, Detective.

688
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,291
No one wants
to be custodian

689
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,168
of the world's filth.
Why would they?

690
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,796
Absorbing the worst humanity has
to offer, day in and day out.

691
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:53,840
Changes you.

692
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,425
So you think
it's the job's fault

693
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:56,593
that they started to punish?

694
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,261
People don't
arrive broken.

695
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,805
They start with passion
and yearning

696
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:04,434
till something comes along that
disabuses them of those notions.

697
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,186
Hmm.

698
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,940
Which means... that none
of these people did it.

699
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:12,233
Okay. I'm not following.

700
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,110
Well, look at Tim there,

701
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,446
with the photos
of his ugly children.

702
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,157
Ivan and his flowerpots.

703
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:21,368
Poor Andrea's still hoping
Destiny's Child

704
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:22,452
get back together.

705
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:23,662
Don't you see?

706
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,122
These people still have hope.

707
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,793
- CHLOE: Excuse me.
- Yeah.

708
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:32,337
- Who's had this
job the longest?
- Um...

709
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,630
maybe me.

710
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,382
I've been at it
two whole months.

711
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,300
- Huh.
- Oh. Anyone else?

712
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:38,259
No.

713
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:39,928
Other than Leila, of course.

714
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,555
- Leila, your boss?
- Yeah. She started
as a moderator

715
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,057
before the company blew up.

716
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,059
She was the first of us.

717
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:47,560
Thanks.

718
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,064
Leila knew Nick, she had
access to the videos.

719
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:52,190
If she's behind this...

720
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,567
She's known what we've been
doing every step of the way.

721
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,780
Dan, I need you to see if
you can trace the videos

722
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,699
to one person in
particular now.

723
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,785
(sighs) We're looking
at Leila Simms.

724
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,584
I can't believe we had the
killer right under our nose.

725
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,086
And she's gone.

726
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,632
Touché, Leila. Touché.

727
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,016
Luci?

728
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,103
Luci, you home?

729
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,022
♪♪

730
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,360
He's not here.

731
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:40,780
He left in quite
the hurry before.

732
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,783
Think it was
something I said.

733
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,371
I'm sorry.
Are you his latest, uh...?

734
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,791
Trust me,
I'm not his latest anything.

735
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,042
All right.

736
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,588
So, what <i>are</i> you
doing here, then?

737
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:57,714
I'm having a bit of

738
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,467
an existential crisis,
I suppose.

739
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,178
I've been known
to be a good listener.

740
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:05,472
Okay.

741
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,347
Uh...

742
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,392
I'm having some trouble
with my kids.

743
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,478
Needed to get away from them
for a little bit?

744
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:13,563
No, the opposite, actually.

745
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:15,982
I'm trying
to get closer to them,

746
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,067
but I'm not having much luck.

747
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,197
Tell me.

748
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,741
Are you a good son?

749
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:27,368
I try to be.

750
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:29,996
Well, then perhaps
you can explain.

751
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:32,916
Would a good son

752
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:36,878
blindly take his father's side
in a divorce?

753
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,131
Would a good son

754
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:42,342
send his mother to Hell?

755
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:45,720
And would a good son

756
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,681
stand here right before me,

757
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:52,769
without a care in the world,
plotting to send me back?

758
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,357
Mom?

759
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:02,529
I thought I would come to Earth
to be with my sons.

760
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:06,866
Instead, Lucifer is obsessed
with his human job,

761
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,244
and you're still
your father's loyal soldier.

762
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,956
I'm tired of fighting for things
that I'm never gonna have.

763
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:16,376
So just take me back, Amenadiel.

764
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:17,335
I'm ready.

765
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:20,338
(sighs)

766
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:25,009
(sniffles)

767
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,679
No matter what happens,

768
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:31,933
I will <i>always...</i> love you.

769
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,476
Always.

770
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:36,771
(sighs)

771
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:38,898
Leila took down
both videos,

772
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,567
killed Nick and Adam,
and then led us

773
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,527
by the nose until she
had time to escape.

774
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,737
Why didn't I
realize it was her?

775
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,030
Because as a punisher,
she's quite adept

776
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:47,490
at avoiding
her own medicine.

777
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:49,117
Quite impressed, really.

778
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:50,326
(computer beeps)

779
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:54,581
CHLOE:
Hey, Dan.

780
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,749
Yeah, I just saw it.
I'm already working on a trace.

781
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,167
LUCIFER:
"Judgment Day"? Oh.

782
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:00,086
People should really be careful
how they use that phrase.

783
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,255
It isn't actually due
for another couple of years.

784
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,632
She's gonna kill herself
live on the air.

785
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,886
What?
Well, that won't do at all.

786
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:09,679
How am I supposed
to talk to her if she's dead?

787
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,681
Glad you have
your priorities in order.

788
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,808
Thought we were dealing with
someone smart and clever,

789
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,768
who tortured with
a brutal sense of irony,

790
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:16,769
but killing herself

791
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,563
whilst humiliating
her company...

792
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,315
Doesn't fit the pattern.

793
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,651
Hey, Sharon, can you pull up the
video of Leila driving again?

794
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,777
Yeah. Sure.

795
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:28,364
Pause it there.

796
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,949
What are you
looking for, Detective?

797
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:30,950
Zoom in

798
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:32,201
to the edge of the seat.

799
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:34,329
Can you go in tighter?

800
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:41,711
Well, I know
images can be deceiving,

801
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,880
but that looks an awful lot
like a gun, doesn't it?

802
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,215
CHLOE:
Leila's not our killer.

803
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:47,634
She's in danger.

804
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:49,886
You understand this
sicko pretty well.

805
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,179
Where do you
think he's going?

806
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:54,140
Well, somewhere linked
to her sins, I suppose.

807
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:55,934
We barely know Leila.

808
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,310
Who knows what the killer
thinks she's done?

809
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:58,978
Well, she runs
the company that hosts

810
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:01,356
humanity's worst depravities,
but we know she's not there.

811
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:03,232
Hey, Dan,
how's the trace coming?

812
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,652
The I.P. just keeps pinging
back to Wobble's main server.

813
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,070
It's got to be
a mistake.

814
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:14,035
Unless it's not
a mistake at all.

815
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,084
You know, if you take
away the blinky lights

816
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,168
and add some lost souls,

817
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,671
this place bares a striking
resemblance to Hell.

818
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:27,465
Shh. Listen.
(Leila speaking quietly)

819
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,927
LEILA:
My name is... Leila Simms.

820
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,764
I'm one of
the co-founders of Wobble.

821
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:39,602
I wanted to apologize
to anybody who's watching

822
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:42,897
for... for creating a forum...

823
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:47,527
...where evil and hate
sought a refuge.

824
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,571
And there's
Queen Wobble herself.

825
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,573
Yeah, but where's
the killer?

826
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:55,410
And tonight I go down
with the ship.

827
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:56,995
(sobs softly)

828
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,288
Right alongside
all of those awful sins

829
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:02,667
that-that I helped
give a voice to.

830
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:05,670
(crying) Please, please.

831
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,880
P-Please, please.

832
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,758
D-Don't make me do this.

833
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,260
Please.

834
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,475
(whispering):
There's Ray, the HR rep.

835
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:22,770
Oh, goodness me,
I should have known.

836
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:24,897
Halitosis--
first sign of evil.

837
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:26,357
He had all the access
he needed

838
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,943
to find his targets
and frame Leila.

839
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,615
(sobs)

840
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,119
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him.

841
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,371
If he drops that lighter,
he'll kill her.

842
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,956
I don't have a shot.

843
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,880
(Leila crying softly)

844
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,097
Okay, Detective, this next
part will be much easier

845
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:00,558
if you're not here, so I'm gonna
politely ask you to leave, okay?

846
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:01,768
I'm not going anywhere.

847
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,187
We're gonna figure this out.
Just give me a second.

848
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,438
(sighs)

849
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:08,900
(Leila crying)

850
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,902
All right, no rush.

851
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,071
Whilst you're pondering,
I'm gonna go and have a word

852
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,363
with our killer.

853
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:15,490
That's a great idea.

854
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:18,451
Sorry, say that again.

855
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,163
I never meant to cause anybody
any pain.

856
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,209
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

857
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,419
Yeah.
(whimpering)

858
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,338
Hello, Raymond.

859
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,466
Hate to, uh,
blow up your spot,

860
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,343
but I have a question
to ask you before you complete

861
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,428
this twisted little
mise-en-scene.

862
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:38,513
Stay back.

863
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:40,598
I swear I will drop this,
and she is dead.

864
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,350
Oh, gosh,
there's the halitosis.

865
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:43,434
It travels, doesn't it?

866
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:45,520
You should really get that
looked at, but first,

867
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,564
indulge me this one
simple query.

868
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:50,858
Why?

869
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:55,154
What?

870
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,406
Why are you a punisher?

871
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:00,535
I understand
the longing for justice

872
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,703
or the joy
of sweet revenge,

873
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,123
but no one's forcing you
to do this,

874
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,875
so why would you
take it upon yourself?

875
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,338
Because I couldn't
take it anymore.

876
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,298
All that evil

877
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:15,383
is constantly spreading.

878
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:16,676
I had to do something.

879
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,304
I had to punish them.

880
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:22,598
You're wrong.

881
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:25,059
You didn't have
to do anything.

882
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:26,519
You <i>wanted</i> to punish them.

883
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:28,062
No, that's not true.

884
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,398
Yes, it started with Nick--
that was impulsive.

885
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:32,316
But then you got
a taste for blood,

886
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:33,985
and it felt good, didn't it?

887
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,194
I was doing my part.

888
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:36,279
You had big plans

889
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:37,613
to go on vengeance quest

890
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:39,323
until we came
nipping at your heels,

891
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:41,784
at which point
poor Leila took the fall.

892
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:43,369
- An innocent!
- No, you're wrong.

893
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:44,579
And then what,
you'd stop?

894
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,497
Get away Scot-free?

895
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,041
(chuckles)

896
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,753
We both know you can't stop
because you love it!

897
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,922
Just like the people
you punished.

898
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:56,424
I don't! I...

899
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,263
I do.

900
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:09,562
I-I like seeing them
beg for forgiveness.

901
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:11,647
You see, the difference
between us

902
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,609
is that you became
part of the problem, Ray.

903
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:17,361
Someone deserving
punishment.

904
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:20,865
You're right.

905
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:24,285
I do.

906
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:27,705
We all do.

907
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:30,666
No, wait!

908
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:36,255
(fire alarm blaring)

909
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,473
(alarm stops)

910
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:51,896
Man, you really don't shut up.

911
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,689
Congratulations, Detective.

912
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:56,776
I suppose you could say
I look quite extinguished.

913
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:58,903
Right.

914
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:00,821
Shall we get you untied?

915
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,244
Burning the midnight oil?

916
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,205
Ha, ha, what can I say?

917
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,374
Being everybody's
bitch really sucks.

918
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,417
Yeah, well,
it won't last forever.

919
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,545
So I've had some time to think,

920
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:20,299
and, um... I realize that

921
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:22,218
I've been really harsh lately.

922
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:23,094
It's okay...

923
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,845
No, let me finish,
please.

924
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:28,557
I've been really hard on you
for a while now.

925
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:29,934
And I've been...

926
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,396
so upset and so angry.

927
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:37,400
And... I did,
I felt really betrayed.

928
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:38,776
I know.

929
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:40,861
But I realize you've...

930
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:43,656
you've been working so hard
to make it right,

931
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:47,159
and I feel like,
for the sake of Trixie,

932
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:48,577
that we should go on the trip.

933
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:50,955
You know, we should go,

934
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,498
like we always have.

935
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:56,585
I can't do that.

936
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,046
Wh... What do you mean?

937
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,301
You were right before.

938
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:07,179
We shouldn't lie
to our daughter.

939
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:08,806
Okay.

940
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,103
Look, I-I'm always gonna be
Trixie's dad.

941
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,607
And I'm always gonna be
part of your lives.

942
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,569
But we've been living
in the past for too long.

943
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:27,450
We're no, we're no good
for Trixie

944
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:29,285
if we're no good for each other.

945
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,916
But I think we both
know the truth.

946
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,674
It's time we get a divorce.

947
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:56,103
(elevator bell dings)

948
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,778
Hello, Luci.

949
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:09,867
Tell me you didn't do it.

950
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:11,494
Do what?

951
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:13,037
Don't play stupid with me.

952
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,081
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

953
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:16,832
Easy, Lucifer.

954
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,793
Your brother didn't
send me to Hell,

955
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,503
if that's what
you're worried about.

956
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:23,714
But you were so adamant.

957
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,383
I told you, Lucifer,

958
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:27,760
a mother's love counts
for more than you think.

959
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:30,346
My time on Earth
has helped me to realize

960
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:33,099
that Father has a tendency
to overreact.

961
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,434
So you're going
against Dad?

962
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:39,021
Things change, brother.

963
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:40,523
Do they?

964
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:44,318
Well, I for one am grateful
that we're all just

965
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:47,780
in the same room, together,
as a family again.

966
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:50,366
Yes, not so fast, Mother.

967
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,118
You see, I did
make a promise,

968
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:53,994
and I am a man of my word.

969
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,996
I told you that you
could stay here

970
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:57,206
until I figured out how to

971
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:59,125
reconcile my
deal with Dad,

972
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,418
and now I have.

973
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:02,628
So you're going to
punish me anyway?

974
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:04,463
I am, indeed.
And not because

975
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:07,466
I've been brainwashed by Dad
or I'm trying to prove anything.

976
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:10,261
I punish because I'm good at it.

977
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:13,431
I like giving people their due.

978
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:16,684
Makes me happy.

979
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:20,062
I suppose I can't ask
for a better reason.

980
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:21,564
(scoffs softly)

981
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:24,275
Which brings me
to your sentence.

982
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,487
Mother... (inhales sharply)

983
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:31,615
you shall remain
right here on Earth

984
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:34,201
amongst the creatures
you so despise...

985
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:35,870
as one of them.

986
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:37,705
Wait.

987
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:39,373
You're going to send me

988
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:41,459
into the life of
Charlotte Richards?

989
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:42,918
Mm-hmm.

990
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:45,337
- Well, how's that
supposed to work?
- Not my problem.

991
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:46,881
And what if I refuse?

992
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:49,091
You can't fight this;
you're human now.

993
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,468
But that husband...

994
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:52,011
And there's children, right?

995
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,554
They're going to <i>need</i> things.

996
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,306
Oh, I'm counting on it.

997
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:57,600
But if you truly want
to be with your sons,

998
00:41:57,808 --> 00:41:59,810
then that's the price
that you have to pay.

999
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:11,989
So be it.

1000
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:29,465
(gasps)

1001
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:30,716
(grunting)

1002
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:32,510
Your money or your life, bitch.

1003
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,345
I-I choose money.

1004
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:37,515
Does anyone choose life?

1005
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,391
- That doesn't very...
- Come here!

1006
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,685
I'll give you what you want!
Just hold on.

1007
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:43,646
I said, hold on!
