1
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:03,855
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- Roommates?

2
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:05,123
You and Detective Decker?

3
00:00:05,126 --> 00:00:06,257
I think it's gonna be fine.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,393
With a short adjustment period.

5
00:00:08,396 --> 00:00:11,396
You made a deal to return Mom
to hell, in exchange,

6
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:13,664
Chloe's life was spared.

7
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,734
What if Dad decides to take
back his side of the deal?

8
00:00:16,737 --> 00:00:17,969
Hello, brother.

9
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:19,070
Uriel.

10
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:20,839
You have 24 hours,

11
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,740
or I'll finish what I
started with your detective.

12
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:25,510
- Uriel is here?
- He's after Chloe,

13
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:27,712
- or that bitch you call Mom.
- Well, worry not,

14
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:29,814
because Uriel won't be a problem.

15
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:30,915
We have a nuclear weapon.

16
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:33,851
How did he beat you, brother?

17
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:35,553
I no longer have my powers.

18
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:37,221
I'm letting Uriel take me back to hell.

19
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:38,756
There is always another way.

20
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,035
That's Azrael's blade.

21
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,193
You're not planning on
taking Mom back to hell.

22
00:00:42,196 --> 00:00:44,829
Because you made it so difficult,

23
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:47,743
now I'm gonna take out
Mom and the detective.

24
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:50,401
I killed him.

25
00:00:50,404 --> 00:00:52,103
What have I done?

26
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:09,921
We are gathered here
today to mourn a great loss.

27
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:12,490
Peggy, Edgar.

28
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:15,026
Your single life is dead.

29
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:21,732
But your life of wedded bliss

30
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:23,568
is just beginning.

31
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:26,337
She's gorgeous even as a freakin' zombie.

32
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,307
I hate her.

33
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,243
If anyone objects to
this unholy matrimony,

34
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:33,678
speak now

35
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:35,980
or forever hold your peace.

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,451
Edgar!

37
00:01:40,454 --> 00:01:41,819
Oh, my God, help!

38
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:43,087
Someone call the ambulance!

39
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,088
Please, this is real!

40
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:46,157
Somebody call an ambulance, please!

41
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:35,506
Howdy, gang.

42
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:38,376
Martini, extra dry, just like I like it.

43
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,077
Lucifer?

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,812
Doctor!

45
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,315
Come to join the party?

46
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:45,750
No, I'm here to check on you.

47
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:47,952
- You didn't show for our session.
- Yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:49,246
I know, I canceled that.

49
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:51,255
Yeah, which is odd,
because you never cancel.

50
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,590
Is everything okay?

51
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:54,025
Mm!

52
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:56,460
It's fine, just a little
family drama, that's all.

53
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:57,562
Nothing to worry about.

54
00:02:57,565 --> 00:02:59,230
- Family drama?
- Mm.

55
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,331
My brother died.

56
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,332
Amenadiel?

57
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:02,033
Mm!

58
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:04,101
No, no.

59
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:05,770
No, I... another brother.

60
00:03:05,773 --> 00:03:06,871
I have many.

61
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:08,639
Lucifer, I'm so sorry.

62
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:10,641
Oh, it's fine, what's done is done, eh?

63
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:11,642
Whiskey?

64
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:14,412
No, no, you... Lucifer, patients

65
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:15,646
often avoid sessions

66
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:17,548
precisely when they need it the most.

67
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:20,084
When the feelings are too painful.

68
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:22,086
Are you sure you don't need to talk?

69
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:23,688
Well, I think there's a few
other things I'd rather do,

70
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:24,855
- you know.
- No, no.

71
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:26,657
- Okay, Lucifer, no, no, no.
- Come on.

72
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,160
No, we're not doing that anymore,
and you know that.

73
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:30,261
Now, I'm here

74
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:32,029
if you want to talk about
your brother's death,

75
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:34,098
but in a...

76
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:35,800
in an appropriate manner.

77
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:36,901
Oh, what's the point?

78
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:37,902
You wouldn't understand me, anyway.

79
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:39,637
You think everything I say is a metaphor.

80
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,305
Now if you don't mind,

81
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:42,473
you're killing my buzz.

82
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:43,474
Ladies.

83
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:44,809
Well, if you change your mind,

84
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:46,310
my door is always open.

85
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:49,447
Well, feel free to shut it.

86
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,441
Look, Mommy, I'm swinging!

87
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:20,312
Hey, baby, get off of that.

88
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:23,047
Hey.

89
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,582
Can you let Maze and
Mommy talk for a minute?

90
00:04:24,585 --> 00:04:25,650
- Please?
- Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:26,951
Okay.

92
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:28,719
Seriously?

93
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:29,687
A sex swing?

94
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,255
I know, right?

95
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:32,857
You want to hop on?

96
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,525
Okay, if we're gonna live together,

97
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,127
we need to have some house rules.

98
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,062
Rule number one, and I can't
believe I'm saying this,

99
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:39,363
no sex swing.

100
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:42,533
You said I could bring my furniture.

101
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:44,335
A sex swing is not furniture.

102
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:47,004
We have to agree on what's gonna
be in the common area, Maze.

103
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:49,106
Fine, I don't agree with
your cheesy decorations.

104
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:50,775
You don't like Halloween?

105
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:52,009
Of course I do.

106
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:54,645
Slutty outfits, humans
abandoning their inhibitions,

107
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,914
masquerade orgies.

108
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:57,915
That's great.

109
00:04:57,918 --> 00:04:59,617
But that's not our Halloween.

110
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,052
You live with a child now.

111
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,987
You're gonna have to rethink
how you look at things.

112
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,222
Oh.

113
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:06,692
Do I?

114
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,830
Maybe living together was a bad idea.

115
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,434
Now that's something we can agree on.

116
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:18,602
Decker.

117
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,407
This is Peggy Russo.

118
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,676
She's a movie makeup
artist from Studio City.

119
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,578
Died from a single shot to the chest.

120
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,080
Still waiting on ballistics,
but it looks like

121
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,816
it's a large caliber bullet,
most likely from a rifle.

122
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:33,784
- Anyone see the shooter?
- Ah, we're still combing through

123
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:35,686
the guest list, but so far, no.

124
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,254
Everyone was focused on the ceremony.

125
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:40,097
- What about the wait staff?
- Questioned them first, nothing.

126
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:42,026
But we're running everyone's info,
see if we have any priors.

127
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:43,894
Great.

128
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:45,563
Dead center shot.

129
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:47,264
You said, the... what?
The groom was hit in the arm?

130
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,299
- Yeah.
- So he botches the first shot,

131
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:50,334
and aces the second?

132
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:51,702
Maybe the bride

133
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:53,871
was the intended target,
and the groom just got in the way.

134
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:56,040
Where is he now?

135
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:57,775
Uh, he's over with the medics.

136
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,547
I can't believe she's gone.

137
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,582
Why would anybody

138
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:06,050
want to do this?

139
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:08,586
Did Peggy have problems with anyone?

140
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:10,888
Anyone you know of that
would've wanted to hurt her?

141
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:14,191
No.

142
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:15,793
Peggy's amazing.

143
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:17,328
She's beautiful

144
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:18,996
and smart

145
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:20,331
and funny.

146
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:23,100
Sorry. I'm sorry I have to
ask you these questions.

147
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:26,070
Oh! Devil's food cake.

148
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:28,874
I've definitely come to the right place.

149
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:31,776
There we go.

150
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:32,943
Oh, Lucifer.

151
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:34,145
So good of you to show.

152
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:35,819
You realize you're late, yeah?

153
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:37,748
Oh, and you're eating possible evidence.

154
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:39,817
- What?
- Give me that.

155
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,851
Surely all this food

156
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:42,486
can't go to waste, Detective.

157
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:44,555
You look like hell.

158
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:46,857
Not heard that before.

159
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,425
- Are you drunk?
- I wish.

160
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:51,896
Pesky supernatural metabolism
keeps getting in the way.

161
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:54,165
Still doesn't stop me trying, though.

162
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:55,699
No!

163
00:06:55,702 --> 00:06:57,635
No drinking at a crime scene.

164
00:06:57,638 --> 00:06:58,803
Fine.

165
00:06:58,806 --> 00:07:00,004
What murder are we solving today?

166
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,459
I mean, everyone here looks dead.

167
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:03,841
We've have an injured
groom and a deceased bride.

168
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:05,843
Oh, they got to that
"till death do us part" nonsense

169
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:06,977
quickly, didn't they?

170
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,113
The bride suffered a
gunshot wound to the chest.

171
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:11,048
Chest? Shooter didn't go for the head?

172
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:13,385
First rule of zombie killing.

173
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,220
Do you want to work this
case with me or not?

174
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,522
Of course I do.

175
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:20,624
Every killer must be punished.

176
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:21,892
Good.

177
00:07:21,895 --> 00:07:23,527
Then you stay here.

178
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,495
Find some water.

179
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:26,263
Calm down.

180
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,898
I'm gonna talk to some witnesses,

181
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:30,167
and pull yourself together.

182
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,404
You look like a homeless magician.

183
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,741
Well...

184
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:39,610
hello, bridesmaids.

185
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:43,647
So, which one of you horrifying zombettes

186
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,816
wanted the bride dead then, hey?

187
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:47,818
Surely she put each of you through hell.

188
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:48,986
All brides do, am I right?

189
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,256
Yeah, let me guess.

190
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,390
She wanted you lose weight,

191
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:55,826
didn't she? You to cover your tattoos.

192
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:58,141
Forced you to buy a tea-length dress

193
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,997
that does nothing for your cankles.

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,932
And did any of you want to wear this...

195
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:03,634
hideous zombie makeup?

196
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,769
Oh, hello.

197
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:07,671
You look suspicious.

198
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:11,909
Tell me, what did you want
to do to our corpse bride?

199
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:15,079
I wanted to ruin her wedding.

200
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:16,247
Ah-ha, right.

201
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,848
Let me guess,
you were in love with the groom.

202
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:19,183
This is always about jealousy, isn't it?

203
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:21,218
No! It was Peggy.

204
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:23,020
Oh, much more interesting, go on.

205
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,421
She was so disgustingly

206
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:26,056
perfect, I hated it.

207
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:27,958
How could anyone compare?

208
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:30,261
So remove the competition, got it.

209
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:32,363
I told her ex-boyfriend Jason

210
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:33,931
- where the wedding was gonna be.
- Hmm.

211
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:37,568
Hoping he'd... I don't know,
show up and make a scene.

212
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:38,836
Oh.

213
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,306
But I never imagined
that he would kill her.

214
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,408
This is all my fault.

215
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,810
Oh. No, no, no, no, come, come.

216
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:47,945
Don't do that.

217
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:49,580
Guilt is such a useless emotion.

218
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:53,817
It's completely unflattering
on such a beautiful face.

219
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,487
You...

220
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,722
you think I'm beautiful?

221
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:01,525
Oh!

222
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:06,530
Lucifer, what are you doing?

223
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,499
Detective, I've found you a lead.

224
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:09,700
Where... in her mouth?

225
00:09:09,703 --> 00:09:10,801
Yes, actually!

226
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:12,336
Imagine what I can
find in other orifices.

227
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,905
Ooh!

228
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:16,307
Okay.

229
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,443
I apologize. I'm just being thorough.

230
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:21,313
Call me. Easy!

231
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:28,018
What has gotten into you?

232
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:29,553
I thought you were
getting the hang of this.

233
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:30,854
I got you a lead, didn't I?

234
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:33,023
The ex-boyfriend, you looking into him?

235
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:35,059
Yeah, Dan's on it, but
that's not the point.

236
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:38,023
This whole new thing,
you making out with witnesses?

237
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:39,399
Completely inappropriate.

238
00:09:39,424 --> 00:09:41,732
When are you going to get it?
Inappropriate is what I do.

239
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:43,033
You've always been a
pain in the ass, Lucifer,

240
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:45,469
but I've never seen you like this.

241
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:47,220
What's going on? What happened?

242
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:48,651
Just enough of the
questioning, Detective.

243
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,074
Reprimand me or let's get on with it.

244
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:52,376
Wow.

245
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:54,745
Can I talk to you, please?

246
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:56,180
Pull your pants up.

247
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:57,214
Hi.

248
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:58,349
Hey, what's up with him?

249
00:09:58,352 --> 00:09:59,550
Looks like he just rolled
out of bed or something.

250
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:00,551
I don't know.

251
00:10:00,554 --> 00:10:01,418
There's just something

252
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:02,519
completely off about him today.

253
00:10:02,522 --> 00:10:03,520
Yeah, well, there's something's

254
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:04,688
really off about him every day.

255
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:05,656
No, no, it's different.

256
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:07,091
He's missing his usual...

257
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:09,159
extreme glee.

258
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:12,162
- He-he just seems really dark.
- Look, is he gonna be a problem?

259
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:13,831
'Cause you know I wouldn't
mind if you send him home.

260
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:14,765
- Nope, not a problem.
- You sure?

261
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:16,233
Yep, got it. I can handle it.

262
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:17,501
What'd you get from ballistics?

263
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:18,902
I confirmed

264
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:20,671
large caliber bullet from a rifle,
long-range.

265
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:23,044
I have a team searching a wider
perimeter for more evidence.

266
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:24,074
And I finished

267
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:25,976
the background check on
everyone at the wedding.

268
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,644
All clean.

269
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:29,146
But the ex-boyfriend,
Jason Myers, he's not.

270
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:31,582
He's got one aggravated assault,
two weapons violations.

271
00:10:31,585 --> 00:10:33,305
I have him waiting in
interrogation for you.

272
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,697
Well...

273
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,337
hello, bad guy.

274

275
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:01,556
Lucifer, open the damn door!

276
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,724
Lucifer!

277
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,594
Lucifer, open this door right now!

278
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:12,033
Lucifer, what are you doing?

279
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,836
Just having a little chitchat

280
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,071
with our friend here.

281
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:17,806
Care to know what I've learned?

282
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:20,041
You get out of there now.

283
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:23,079
Oh, she's so demanding.

284
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:31,152
Well... he's innocent.

285
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,821
Oh, did you figure that out

286
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:34,789
before or after you tortured him?

287
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,024
You tortured a suspect?

288
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,892
I didn't lay a finger
on the spineless cretin.

289
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:39,361
Come on, the guy's sitting
on the floor crying.

290
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,129
Crying because of a woman,

291
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:43,431
not me... the bride, to be specific.

292
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,166
However, he did not kill her.

293
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:46,334
And you know that how?

294
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:47,936
He said he couldn't take
seeing the bride so happy,

295
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:50,772
so he ran off, crying...
Surprise, surprise...

296
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,937
Well before the shooting started.

297
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,376
And you believed that?

298
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,144
- Of course not. He had an alibi.
- Really?

299
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:58,480
Yes. Leaving the park
on the service road,

300
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:00,448
he bumped into a wedding musician.

301
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:03,151
Didn't get a name, but he had a
buzz cut and a guitar case.

302
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:05,520
A guitar? No.

303
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:07,355
They booked a DJ, not a live band.

304
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:09,991
Trust me, crying guy isn't lying.

305
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:12,894
Maybe, but maybe there
wasn't a guitar in that case.

306
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:15,997
Oh, so you think our musician
might be the shooter.

307
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,066
He's pretty shaken up,
but he's gonna be okay.

308
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:19,134
You're lucky.

309
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,136
Okay, I still have to question properly.

310
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,638
But there's a possibility
that Jason saw our shooter,

311
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:26,107
and he may have been carrying
his rifle in a guitar case.

312
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,143
Last seen on the park service road.

313
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:30,212
I'm on it.

314
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:35,183
- You're welcome.
- Excuse me?

315
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:38,156
What you just did in there
is incredibly inappropriate.

316
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:39,154
Are you trying

317
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:40,288
to get in trouble or are you trying

318
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,456
to piss me off?

319
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,791
I did what I had to do.

320
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:43,962
Got results, didn't I?

321
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:46,227
If you pull one more stunt like that,

322
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,663
I don't care how effective you are,

323
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:49,932
I will bench you.

324
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:14,657
I take it you heard about Uriel?

325
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,029
Is Lucifer here?

326
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:22,797
No, he's out.

327
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,367
Probably in the middle
of some three-way,

328
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,968
like nothing happened.

329
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:29,704
Not everyone grieves the same way.

330
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:33,508
Lucifer, he's never been one to...

331
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:36,244
face his emotions.

332
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:39,547
Instead of looking in, he acts out.

333
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,850
You know, a rebellion here,

334
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:44,487
an apple there?

335
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,055
But you...

336
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:48,858
How are you doing?

337
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:53,328
Come on, tell your mom.

338
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:56,131
When I first heard of Uriel's death,

339
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:57,465
I wanted to blame Lucifer.

340
00:13:57,468 --> 00:14:00,869
But... then I realized I
was just as much to blame,

341
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:04,105
if not more.

342
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:05,273
None of this would have happened

343
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,208
if I still had my...

344
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:08,978
Your powers.

345
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:12,046
How did you know?

346
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:14,350
A mother knows.

347
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:20,522
But I also know it's possible

348
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:24,259
to regain your strength.

349
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:25,460
That we both can.

350
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:27,662
No, Mom, it's too late.

351
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:30,632
Uriel would...

352
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:33,502
He would still be alive
if it wasn't for me.

353
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:39,575
Come, there's something you need to see.

354
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:50,986
Okay, so we found something
near the service road.

355
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,423
Look at this.

356
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:58,326
It's a nice little hiding
spot behind some bushes.

357
00:14:58,329 --> 00:14:59,727
Disturbed ground.

358
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,229
Clear view of the stage.

359
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:03,398
Someone with a rifle
could've made this shot.

360
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:05,133
What's that?

361
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,301
That...

362
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:08,036
is a pastry napkin from
a Dutch food truck.

363
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:10,505
"Freddy's Dutch Oven"?

364
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,414
Love this place. Unfortunate name,

365
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:14,142
but best stroopwafel in Hollywood.

366
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:16,110
The napkin is definitely from today.

367
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:17,612
The syrup is still wet to the touch.

368
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:19,380
And undoubtedly tasty.

369
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:22,050
So if the shooter bought this stroop...
whatever you call it...

370
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:24,152
With his credit card,
we can track his identity.

371
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:25,453
So we need to get to the food truck

372
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:26,688
and talk to the owner.

373
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:27,689
I will put out a BOLO.

374
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:28,890
What is it with you and BOLOs?

375
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,059
Why don't you just use
Freddy's Dutch Oven app?

376
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:32,694
Gives you their current locale.

377
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:34,128
You never know when you're in the mood

378
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:35,598
for a good strooping.

379
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:54,349
You know what?

380
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:55,650
You stay here.

381
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:57,719
Don't move. I'll do the talking.

382
00:15:57,722 --> 00:16:00,722
Fine by me.

383
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:02,957
Detective Decker, LAPD.
Are you the owner?

384
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,360
Alfred Loomis, but you
can call me Freddy.

385
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:07,295
And let me guess. You look like

386
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:08,730
a "chocolade hagelslag" kind of girl.

387
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:09,731
Am I right?

388
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:11,232
Sir, earlier today you served a man

389
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:13,114
with a buzz cut,
possibly carrying a guitar case.

390
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,301
Does that ring a bell?

391
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:16,905
If I may, one order
of "oliebollen," please.

392
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:18,239
What?

393
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:19,274
Oliebollen.

394
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:20,975
Literally means "oily balls."

395
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:22,844
Tastes better than it sounds, believe me.

396
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:25,179
- Thank you.
- No, sorry, Detective,

397
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:26,414
I don't remember anyone like that.

398
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:28,516
But I wasn't here during
the morning shift.

399
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,818
Um, Freddy, I forgot to tell you

400
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:32,854
a guy like that was here when I opened.

401
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:35,323
He was asking when you'd be around.

402
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:36,925
Asking for me specifically?

403
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:38,760
Actually, you know what?
Make the two orders, please.

404
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:39,761
I'm famished.

405
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,597
Lucifer...

406
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,300
Everybody down!

407
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:50,738
Shooter on the roof. Victim in the truck.

408
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:51,874
Secure the scene!

409
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,283
Bloody hell!

410
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,153
Not very polite of Mr. Shooter to leave

411
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:40,722
without saying good-bye.

412
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,757
His bullets are saying plenty.

413
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,258
Well, why shoot Food Truck Freddy,

414
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:45,827
just 'cause you were questioning him?

415
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,863
No, this was premeditated.

416
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:50,565
The shooter came here to find him,

417
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:51,933
then went to shoot the bride,

418
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:54,136
then came back when he
knew Freddy would be here.

419
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,643
This guy's got a list.

420
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:03,144
God, who's next?

421
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:05,981
He's not gonna tell you.

422
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:16,052
Come bloody on!

423
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:21,458
What are you doing?

424
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:23,093
That's twice now today
I've been denied snacks.

425
00:18:23,096 --> 00:18:24,161
You got change for a hundie?

426
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:25,562
Oh, God.

427
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:28,165
All right, ballistics confirmed
the same rifle was used

428
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:31,101
in both shootings, but no prints
were found on the rooftop.

429
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:33,134
This guy paid cash at the food truck.

430
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,339
He really covers his tracks.

431
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:37,941
If I could just find a connection

432
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:40,143
between our two victims.

433
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:42,012
But Peggy Russo and Freddy Loomis

434
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:43,613
seem to have nothing in common.

435
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,115
Apart from being dead.

436
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:48,051
Uh, maybe they were just randomly chosen.

437
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:49,252
Mm, my gut says no.

438
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:50,887
This guy is too calculating.

439
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,122
Deliberate.

440
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,224
Until we find a link between these t...

441
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:57,096
Teeny-tiny doughnuts,
or cool ranch puffs?

442
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:59,283
Lucifer, you can't just steal food

443
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:00,997
- in the middle of the precinct.
- Why?

444
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,365
Are you gonna put me on the naughty step,

445
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:04,234
so I can have a think
about what I've done?

446
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:07,938
Hey, Monkey.

447
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:09,539
Yes, yeah, I-I'm really sorry.

448
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,741
Work got busy.

449
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:14,311
Yes, I really, really want to
take you trick-or-treating.

450
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:16,646
But if Mommy or Daddy
can't make it home in time,

451
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:19,049
Babysitter Shelly might have
to take you, okay?

452
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:20,617
Oh, she already left.

453
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,852
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

454
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:24,354
But when she went into Maze's room,

455
00:19:24,357 --> 00:19:26,356
she ran out screaming.

456
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,857
It was hilarious.

457
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,527
- Who's watching you now?
- Maze.

458
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,762
Can she take me trick-or-treating?

459
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:35,206
- No.
- Mommy, please?

460
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:36,567
I promise I'll be good.

461
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,481
Yeah, babe, it's not you
that I'm worried about.

462
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:40,370
Please, please, please, please?

463
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,041
All right, put Maze on the phone.

464
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,378
Yeah?

465
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:50,000
What did you do to the babysitter?

466
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:50,513
Me?

467
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:51,615
She's the one who didn't knock.

468
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:53,216
I had no time to hide my toys.

469
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:56,119
Okay, Maze, look, I have
a favor to ask you.

470
00:19:56,122 --> 00:19:57,287
That's Lucifer's thing.

471
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,723
I know, but I'll never
find a sitter this late.

472
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:03,693
And trick-or-treating is really
important to Trixie, Maze.

473
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:05,295
Will you please take her for me?

474
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:09,065
Sure, I'll take your
offspring for a walk.

475
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:11,034
Well, she's not a dog, but thank you.

476
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:14,004
Okay, don't let her out of your sight,

477
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:16,473
please check her candy,
and take her early,

478
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,774
- like 3:00.
- Great.

479
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:19,943
Best after-parties don't
start till 3:00 anyway.

480
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:22,112
Not 3:00 a.m., 3:00 p.m.

481
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,380
I want her home before dark.

482
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:25,282
And do not take her to any parties.

483
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:26,650
Lame.

484
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:27,550
But whatever, your kid.

485
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:29,452
Thank you. Thank you so much.

486
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:31,689
Oh, oh, did you see the costume?
I laid it on the bed.

487
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,525
Uh...

488
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:39,763
What's wrong?

489
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:42,732
I told Mommy I wanted to be
a princess when I was seven.

490
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:43,967
Now I'm eight.

491
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,435
And?

492
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:47,404
Halloween's supposed to
be the one night you get

493
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:49,340
to be whatever you want.

494
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:56,847
What do you want to be?

495
00:21:04,123 --> 00:21:06,056
Where did he go?

496
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,526
Hey. I've been talking to
the food truck owner's wife.

497
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:10,994
She doesn't recognize the zombie bride,

498
00:21:10,997 --> 00:21:13,364
and doesn't think she has any
connection to her husband.

499
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:18,202
Two victims, two devastated spouses.

500
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:21,772
Maybe we're looking at
this the wrong way.

501
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:28,945
Mrs. Loomis, I'm sorry.

502
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:30,747
I know you're going through a lot.

503
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,183
I have one more question for you, okay?

504
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:34,784
Do you recognize this man?

505
00:21:34,787 --> 00:21:37,387
Yes, that's Edgar... Romero.

506
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,521
How do you know him?

507
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:39,723
We've worked together.

508
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:40,757
I'm a doctor.

509
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,991
He's a lawyer.

510
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:43,693
He handles many

511
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:45,528
of our hospital's malpractice suits.

512
00:21:45,531 --> 00:21:47,364
He's married

513
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:48,665
- to the other victim?
- Yes, but

514
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:49,866
the connection we've been looking for

515
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:51,067
isn't between them,

516
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,002
it's between you, the spouses.

517
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:54,170
So, you think the shooter's upset

518
00:21:54,173 --> 00:21:55,538
because of one of
these malpractice suits?

519
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,141
Maybe. Maybe he's taking it out

520
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,643
on their loved ones.

521
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,145
Can you give us a list of all the cases

522
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:03,781
that Edgar litigated for you?

523
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:11,020
When are you gonna tell
me what's going on with you?

524
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:12,343
Do you want to talk about it?

525
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:12,956
Why would I want to do that?

526
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:13,990
'Cause that's what partners do.

527
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:14,958
They talk.

528
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:16,493
I can tell you about my headaches

529
00:22:16,496 --> 00:22:18,261
living with Maze and you can tell me

530
00:22:18,264 --> 00:22:19,429
what's going on with you.

531
00:22:19,432 --> 00:22:21,364
Pass.

532
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:22,599
Lucifer,

533
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,067
seriously,

534
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,769
whatever you're going through...

535
00:22:25,772 --> 00:22:27,337
I don't know, maybe I can help.

536
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,772
How?

537
00:22:28,775 --> 00:22:30,373
By giving me a warm, fuzzy hug?

538
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:32,575
They won't release the damn case files.

539
00:22:32,578 --> 00:22:35,178
Some crap about new HIPAA
laws requiring extra warrants.

540
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:37,747
It could be days before we get
a judge to sign off on that.

541
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,716
Oh, well, it looks like
Detective Douche is the one

542
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:41,418
who needs a hug. Mm, come here, Daniel.

543
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:43,086
- Mm.
- Get off me, man.

544
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:44,988
Uh, Daniel, if you want to
talk about your feelings,

545
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:46,623
Detective Decker is offering.

546
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:47,724
Why don't give you two a minute

547
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:48,725
so you can talk about your

548
00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:51,551
earth-shattering problems.

549
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:53,296
- What was that?
- I told you

550
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,731
something's going on with him.

551
00:22:54,734 --> 00:22:56,132
- I'm getting worried.
- Yeah, well,

552
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:57,434
honestly, Chloe, we have bigger things

553
00:22:57,437 --> 00:22:58,835
- to worry about right now.
- I know.

554
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:00,570
I'll see if I can expedite the warrants,

555
00:23:00,573 --> 00:23:02,540
and, uh, call the lieutenant.

556
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:04,741
Right. Here you go.

557
00:23:04,744 --> 00:23:06,009
Merry Christmas.

558
00:23:06,012 --> 00:23:07,944
Or should I say, Happy Halloween.

559
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:08,945
Are these the files?

560
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:10,413
Where did you get these?

561
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,781
Well, if you ask permission,
people can say no,

562
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:13,082
but flash a badge to the right sap

563
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:14,718
and voilà.

564
00:23:15,922 --> 00:23:17,220
This is mine.

565
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:18,721
All right, chill out, Daniel.

566
00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:20,523
What's a little badge
borrowing between friends?

567
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:22,659
I mean, at least I didn't
have to use this.

568
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:24,427
You stole my gun and my badge?

569
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,829
What the hell is the matter with you?!

570
00:23:25,832 --> 00:23:26,996
Hey, guys...

571
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:27,997
Are you gonna take his
side in this right now?

572
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,265
- Is that what you're doing?
- Well, I got the files,

573
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:31,034
didn't I? I did what I had to do.

574
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:32,302
Oh, please, don't give me that crap.

575
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:33,837
You never do what you have to do,

576
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,038
Lucifer.

577
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,473
You only ever do what you want to.

578
00:23:36,476 --> 00:23:38,041
That is not true.

579
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:40,410
There's a lot of things
that I didn't want to do.

580
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:41,578
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

581
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:43,680
Because if I only ever
did what I wanted to do,

582
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:45,281
then right now, I'd do this.

583
00:23:49,055 --> 00:23:51,254
What the hell is wrong with you?!

584
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:52,922
Why are you so surprised, Detective?!

585
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:53,990
I'm the Devil, remember?

586
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:55,024
I'm evil!

587
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:56,674
No, what you are is off this case.

588
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:58,966
You go home now. You're done.

589
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:02,489
Go!

590
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,312
Are you okay?

591
00:24:12,337 --> 00:24:14,478
- Not really.
- All right, well...

592
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:17,581
let's get you checked
out and return the files.

593
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:19,116
What if we hold off for a bit?

594
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,818
I don't agree

595
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:22,686
with what Lucifer did.

596
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:25,089
But there's still a killer out there.

597
00:24:25,092 --> 00:24:27,324
And these files might be
the key to stopping him.

598
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:29,259
Are you suggesting we keep them?

599
00:24:29,262 --> 00:24:30,895
More like borrow.

600
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:33,564
Where are we going, Mom?

601
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:34,998
You'll see soon enough.

602
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:36,934
But first, we need to
get something straight.

603
00:24:36,937 --> 00:24:39,770
Uriel's death was not your fault.

604
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:41,432
How can you say that, Mom?

605
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,510
Do you remember when
you boys were young?

606
00:24:46,513 --> 00:24:49,012
Uriel always playing pranks on Lucifer

607
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:50,681
to get your Father's attention?

608
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:52,616
Annoying little runt.

609
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:54,518
And he never got in trouble for it

610
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:56,353
because you took the blame.

611
00:24:56,356 --> 00:24:58,856
Just looking out for
my little brother, Mom.

612
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:00,758
No, it's more than that.

613
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:03,827
You have welcomed
responsibility your entire life.

614
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,063
Don't you think you deserve a break?

615
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:08,632
Mom, you just don't understand.

616
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:10,934
Don't you think I feel responsible, too?

617
00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:13,203
All of this fighting has been

618
00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:15,672
over me.

619
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:17,875
Uriel is gone forever because of me,

620
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:19,476
not you.

621
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:21,378
How can you say that, Mom?

622
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:22,780
You did everything

623
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:23,847
that you could do.

624
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,382
You volunteered to go back to Hell.

625
00:25:25,385 --> 00:25:27,400
You stepped up and did the right thing.

626
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,819
Isn't that all you've been doing?

627
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:30,721
Trying to please your Father

628
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:32,623
by doing what you think is right?

629
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:35,893
You shouldn't be punished.

630
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:37,928
You should be rewarded.

631
00:25:41,034 --> 00:25:42,800
You really think so?

632
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:47,070
If your Father was down here...

633
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,275
...he would see that.

634
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:19,570
This is where Lucifer
buried your brother.

635
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:44,236
Uriel?

636
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:51,835
I am... so sorry.

637
00:26:51,838 --> 00:26:53,070
Oh, no.

638
00:26:53,073 --> 00:26:54,037
No worries.

639
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,772
It's not your fault.

640
00:27:07,854 --> 00:27:09,386
Okay, so, these are all
the cases that involve

641
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:13,390
both Dr. Loomis and
our zombie groom Edgar.

642
00:27:13,393 --> 00:27:15,158
Six settled, three pending
and that last one there

643
00:27:15,161 --> 00:27:16,560
was recently dismissed.

644
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:19,329
Wrongful death suit thrown
out for lack of evidence.

645
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:20,631
That's frustrating.

646
00:27:20,634 --> 00:27:22,332
- Could be motive.
- Yeah. I don't know.

647
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:24,268
Maybe our plaintiff was
pissed about the dismissal,

648
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:26,270
decided to settle his
grievances another way.

649
00:27:26,273 --> 00:27:29,239
Let's see... plaintiff, Wes Williams.

650
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:31,275
He sued for his wife Cassandra's death

651
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:33,410
after she lost a battle with...

652
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:35,345
Oh man, I can't even pronounce this...

653
00:27:35,348 --> 00:27:38,749
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis?

654
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:40,250
- Yeah. Lung disease.
- Yeah, well, it looks like

655
00:27:40,253 --> 00:27:41,685
Wes blamed Cassandra's physician,

656
00:27:41,688 --> 00:27:43,687
our Dr. Sidney Loomis,
and the hospital's lawyer,

657
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,589
Edgar Romero, got the case thrown out.

658
00:27:45,592 --> 00:27:46,790
It's no one's fault for
a disease like that.

659
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:48,392
Yeah, well, apparently,

660
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,727
Wes didn't feel that way.

661
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,262
What's wrong?

662
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:53,730
Nothing, I just...

663
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:55,813
I kind of feel bad for the
guy's situation, you know?

664
00:27:57,938 --> 00:28:01,204
I mean, I-I don't know what
I would do if my wife...

665
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:03,740
Yeah, right.

666
00:28:03,743 --> 00:28:05,442
Well, what you wouldn't
do is start revenge killing

667
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:07,611
a bunch of innocent people.

668
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:09,613
Good point.

669
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:12,951
Okay, let's see if our Wes
Williams is in the system.

670
00:28:17,757 --> 00:28:19,156
No criminal record.

671
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,259
But he fits the description.

672
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:24,962
Look at that.

673
00:28:24,965 --> 00:28:26,463
He's an ATF agent.

674
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:28,067
Nicknamed "The Ghost."

675
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:29,866
He served multiple assignments in Mexico

676
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:30,901
trying to take down the cartels.

677
00:28:30,904 --> 00:28:32,336
Specializes in...

678
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,605
long-range marksmanship.

679
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:36,707
Let's go.

680
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,175
Go! Other side.

681
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:39,811
Hallway clear.

682
00:28:41,848 --> 00:28:42,947
Clear!

683
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:46,584
Clear! Clear.

684
00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:55,325
He's making counterfeit badges

685
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:57,996
for Strode Pharmaceuticals.

686
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:28,651
Trick or treat!

687
00:29:28,654 --> 00:29:31,921
Oh, and what are you, young lady?

688
00:29:31,924 --> 00:29:33,989
She's the president of Mars.

689
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:35,291
Duh.

690
00:29:35,294 --> 00:29:36,292
Yeah...

691
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:37,893
duh.

692
00:29:37,896 --> 00:29:41,163
President of Mars!

693
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,231
All right.

694
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:14,998
Isn't this fun?

695
00:30:16,368 --> 00:30:18,468
I expected worse.

696
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,540
I wish you wore a costume.

697
00:30:24,176 --> 00:30:26,542
Well, I, uh...

698
00:30:26,545 --> 00:30:29,446
I did bring something.

699
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:32,548
Do you want to see it?

700
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:33,783
Yeah.

701
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,620
Turn around.

702
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:41,024
I'm ready.

703
00:30:46,298 --> 00:30:47,863
Cool!

704
00:30:49,268 --> 00:30:50,861
We're gonna get so much candy.

705
00:31:29,908 --> 00:31:31,307
Why?

706
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,976
Why did you bring me here?

707
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:35,577
You have been so focused on blame...

708
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,380
you haven't let yourself grieve.

709
00:31:38,383 --> 00:31:40,215
This isn't right.

710
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:42,551
None of it.

711
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:43,986
Why did he do this?

712
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:45,087
Lucifer was just trying...

713
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,188
No, Mom.

714
00:31:46,191 --> 00:31:48,525
Not Lucifer, Father.

715
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,862
How did He let this happen?

716
00:31:53,865 --> 00:31:56,032
Son, it's okay.

717
00:31:56,802 --> 00:31:58,334
Just let it out.

718
00:31:58,337 --> 00:32:01,671
Let it all... out.

719
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:22,725
I blame Father for this.

720
00:32:22,728 --> 00:32:24,593
You're right, Mom, where is he?

721
00:32:24,596 --> 00:32:26,528
If he wanted to, he could've prevented

722
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:28,430
all of this from happening.

723
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:32,068
All the misunderstandings, all the pain.

724
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:34,603
Well, I'm done.

725
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:38,541
I'm done trying to please
someone who isn't ever here.

726
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:06,568
Out.

727
00:33:06,571 --> 00:33:09,004
All of you out! Go on!

728
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:10,774
Go!

729
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:34,363
Anything connecting our shooter

730
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:36,198
- to Strode Pharmaceuticals?
- Yeah. Right here.

731
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:38,801
Wes Williams' took part in one
of their clinical drug trials.

732
00:33:38,804 --> 00:33:40,502
A "promising new treatment"
for her lung disease.

733
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:42,004
Not promising enough to save her.

734
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:43,939
No. Turns out she was
in the placebo group.

735
00:33:43,942 --> 00:33:46,041
Is that why he's pissed off?
Who put her there?

736
00:33:46,044 --> 00:33:48,010
No one, really. It was a double-blind,

737
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:50,446
so just like the doctor and the
lawyer, no one's at fault here.

738
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:51,947
So who does our
shooter think is at fault?

739
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,981
Who ran the trials?

740
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:54,917
Dr. Jack Peterson.

741
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,685
And since Williams is targeting spouses,

742
00:33:56,688 --> 00:33:58,420
if we find Mrs. Peterson, assuming...

743
00:33:58,423 --> 00:34:00,055
- No, wait... crap.
- What?

744
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:02,691
It also says that the trial was
run by a Dr. Sally Peterson.

745
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:03,992
They're a husband and wife team.

746
00:34:03,995 --> 00:34:05,828
Great. Who's the target?

747
00:34:05,831 --> 00:34:07,896
Well, it could be either one.
We got to get to both of them.

748
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:09,432
Yeah, before he does.

749
00:34:11,203 --> 00:34:12,201
Dr. Peterson?

750
00:34:12,204 --> 00:34:13,368
- LAPD.
- Your wife, Sally.

751
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:14,982
- Where is she?
- What's going on?

752
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:16,639
I'll explain later. Where's your wife?

753
00:34:16,664 --> 00:34:18,240
Probably getting a coffee from

754
00:34:18,243 --> 00:34:19,308
the coffee cart in the lobby.

755
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:20,409
Okay, you stay with him. I'll find her.

756
00:34:20,412 --> 00:34:22,644
- You be careful.
- Right.

757
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:23,512
You stay put.

758
00:34:23,515 --> 00:34:25,982
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

759
00:34:33,646 --> 00:34:35,913
I know you're out there, Mr. Sniper!

760
00:34:45,504 --> 00:34:46,936
Oh, come on!

761
00:34:48,106 --> 00:34:50,473
You can do better than that!

762
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:54,544
Shoot me!

763
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,663
Well, go on, then!

764
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,665
What are you waiting for?

765
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:07,633
Just shoot me right now. Please!

766
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:09,468
- Lucifer, what are you doing?
- Uh-oh!

767
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:10,770
Police are here!

768
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:13,106
Gonna have to hurry up, Mr. Shooter, sir.

769
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:19,668
Seriously? I mean,
I'm standing right here.

770
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:26,652
Right. You're just embarrassing
yourself, now.

771
00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:29,089
I mean, could you be any worse of a shot?

772
00:35:34,797 --> 00:35:36,430
Oh, come on.

773
00:35:39,168 --> 00:35:41,735
Che... It's like he's not even trying.

774
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,209
Not her, you idiot... me!

775
00:35:50,212 --> 00:35:51,611
Shoot me!

776
00:35:56,385 --> 00:35:58,485
Drop your weapon now.

777
00:36:15,037 --> 00:36:17,503
You.

778
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:18,838
Why didn't you shoot me?

779
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:20,906
- Shoot you?
- I was standing

780
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:23,142
right here, fair game.
Why didn't you do it?

781
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:24,710
Because you didn't deserve it.

782
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:27,046
How do you know what I deserve?

783
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:29,248
I was trying to scare you away from her.

784
00:36:29,251 --> 00:36:31,851
I only wanted the people who
killed Cassandra to suffer like...

785
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:33,085
What...?

786
00:36:33,088 --> 00:36:35,888
Like I'm suffering.

787
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:37,390
You idiot!

788
00:36:37,393 --> 00:36:38,891
- Lucifer.
- The doctor,

789
00:36:38,894 --> 00:36:40,793
the lawyer, that woman...
They didn't kill your wife!

790
00:36:40,796 --> 00:36:42,262
They aren't responsible!

791
00:36:43,232 --> 00:36:44,964
But you know that.

792
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:48,300
You hold someone else
accountable, don't you?

793
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:51,471
If I hadn't been on mission so long...

794
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:55,374
Been home when Cassandra needed me...

795
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:57,543
we could've detected it sooner.

796
00:36:57,546 --> 00:37:00,613
She would still be alive.

797
00:37:00,616 --> 00:37:02,715
Yes.

798
00:37:02,718 --> 00:37:04,784
So it's not vengeance you want.

799
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:06,253
It's punishment.

800
00:37:11,093 --> 00:37:13,459
Well, now you've got it.

801
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:15,195
Good for you.

802
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,936
I got this.

803
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:26,873
Hey.

804
00:37:29,578 --> 00:37:31,010
How did you find us?

805
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:33,284
Just called the station chief.

806
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:34,839
Got all the details.

807
00:37:34,864 --> 00:37:38,395
What you just did was
extremely reckless and stupid.

808
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,319
But you saved that woman's life.

809
00:37:40,322 --> 00:37:42,922
I couldn't care less
about that woman's life.

810
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:45,892
So, what, you were just
trying to get yourself killed?

811
00:37:46,862 --> 00:37:48,227
No.

812
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:49,737
I don't buy it.

813
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,006
Every time you say that you don't care,

814
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:54,342
or that you're evil, or you're the Devil,

815
00:37:54,345 --> 00:37:56,202
I know that's not who you really are.

816
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:58,947
You don't know a thing about
who I am, Detective.

817
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,315
Or what I've done.

818
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:03,752
You weren't just talking about
Wes back there, were you?

819
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:07,834
You want to be punished for something.

820
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,991
That's why you've
been acting out recently.

821
00:38:09,994 --> 00:38:13,094
Just talk to me, Lucifer, please.

822
00:38:13,097 --> 00:38:15,563
Just tell me what's going on.

823
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:17,900
I'm here for you, okay? I...

824
00:38:19,604 --> 00:38:21,937
I just want to understand.

825
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:26,475
You can't understand, Detective.

826
00:38:28,613 --> 00:38:31,446
And you never will.

827
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:36,117
Well, if you won't talk to me, then...

828
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,753
please, talk to someone else.

829
00:38:38,756 --> 00:38:41,389
You have a therapist.

830
00:38:41,392 --> 00:38:44,826
Talk to her, before it eats you alive.

831
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,583
Now...

832
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:30,940
I'm glad you changed your mind.

833
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:37,780
Are you ready to talk about your brother?

834
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:43,385
His name is...

835
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:47,256
was Uriel.

836
00:39:48,192 --> 00:39:50,725
And ever since he died,

837
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:53,127
I've been having this... strange feeling.

838
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,764
Something I've never felt before.

839
00:39:56,767 --> 00:39:58,801
Guilt.

840
00:39:59,737 --> 00:40:03,072
Why do you feel guilty?

841
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:08,444
Uriel didn't just die.

842
00:40:09,814 --> 00:40:11,813
I killed him.

843
00:40:11,816 --> 00:40:13,848
I've never...

844
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:16,784
killed anyone before. Only
punished those already dead.

845
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:20,521
You know, back when I used to run Hell.

846
00:40:20,524 --> 00:40:22,156
But...

847
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,360
A stubborn Uriel...
he-he gave me no choice.

848
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:27,495
He came down from the Silver City

849
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:29,597
to collect on the deal that
I made with Dad.

850
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,334
Intent on killing the detective
or smiting Mum out of existence.

851
00:40:33,337 --> 00:40:35,055
- Lucifer...
- He brought Azrael's blade with him,

852
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,372
which is a... a divine dagger
that destroys your soul,

853
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,806
it doesn't just kill you.

854
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:40,743
- It... wipes you out...
- Lucifer, enough.

855
00:40:44,181 --> 00:40:46,315
I can't do this anymore.

856
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:50,785
I can't keep track of all
these elaborate metaphors.

857
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:52,553
But it's not a metaphor,

858
00:40:52,556 --> 00:40:54,155
Doctor.

859
00:40:54,158 --> 00:40:55,590
You need to take me seriously.

860
00:40:55,593 --> 00:40:58,026
You need to believe what I'm saying.

861
00:40:58,029 --> 00:41:00,129
Otherwise, you'll never understand...

862
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:04,465
I'm a monster.

863
00:41:04,468 --> 00:41:07,235
A monster who... deserves to be punished.

864
00:41:07,238 --> 00:41:09,637
I believe you feel that way.

865
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:12,840
And I want to understand.

866
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:14,609
I truly do!

867
00:41:14,612 --> 00:41:16,544
But, Lucifer, you have to help me.

868
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:18,946
I need you to be honest with me.

869
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:21,517
Completely honest...

870
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:25,053
...about who you are.

871
00:41:25,056 --> 00:41:27,755
Completely honest?

872
00:41:27,758 --> 00:41:29,223
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

873
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:31,559
Yes, I'm sure.

874
00:41:31,562 --> 00:41:33,995
That's what all of these sessions...

875
00:41:33,998 --> 00:41:37,065
Our entire relationship... Is all about.

876
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:40,802
Getting to know the real Lucifer.

877
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,639
No more lies.

878
00:41:44,642 --> 00:41:46,808
No more metaphors.

879
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:48,776
Very well.

880
00:42:11,235 --> 00:42:13,368
Yes...

881
00:42:14,705 --> 00:42:16,805
Doctor?

882
00:42:22,513 --> 00:42:24,067
Uh...

883
