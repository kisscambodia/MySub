What does Maze think
of your plan?

8
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:16,935
Well, I don't know;
I haven't told her.

00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,603
So what, are you
going on a vacation?

10
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:20,689
Lucifer didn't tell you.

What-- Can it wait?
I'm busy keeping an eye

28
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:12,449
on our mercurial mother.

29
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,618
No, it's important.
I think you might be in danger.

00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:24,544
She's angry with you, brother.

00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:27,547
(laughs) Well, is it
Tuesday already?

36
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,591
Anger is Maze's
default setting,

37
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,634
sort of baked into
her demon DNA.

38
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:33,636
No, this is
different, Luci.

39
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:35,930
I think you really need
to talk to her.

40
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:38,516
She'll get over it;
she always does.

41
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,185
Right now, we have bigger
issues to deal with,

42
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:42,437
like whether or not
Mum is wasting our time.

43
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:45,648
If she believes her client

44
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:48,485
has found another piece
of the Flaming Sword, so do I.

45
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:52,197
Oh, such a loyal son.

46
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:53,907
But Mum hasn't
adapted to this world

47
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,075
as well as you
might think.

48
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,702
This chap could be conning her.

49
00:01:59,037 --> 00:01:59,913
I think I'm gonna
go make sure...

50
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,332
She seems
to be doing just fine.

51
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,088
That's not the money, is it?

52
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,131
Of course not. She wouldn't
bring it to the meeting.

53
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:12,342
Oh, no. Of course not.

54
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,927
I mean, that would be
absurd, wouldn't it?

55
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,929
She's just showing it to him.
I mean, it's not like

56
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,806
she's gonna hand it to him
before she...

57
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,182
gets the piece.

58
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,266
That's great.

59
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:24,312
And now she's letting
him leave. Marvelous.

60
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:29,943
Well, that went well.

61
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:31,152
LUCIFER:
Oh, you think so,

62
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:32,737
- do you?
- I do.

63
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,532
He has what we need in his safe
in the back room.

64
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,574
Oh.

65
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,076
He's going to get it right now.

66
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,912
Mum, you just handed him
a briefcase full of cash

67
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:42,747
with no proof whatsoever
he has what we need.

68
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:44,415
- And?
- You've been conned.

69
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:47,418
(scoffs) He's a client
of mine, darling.

70
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:48,253
I don't think

71
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,130
- he'd be that foolhardy.
- Oh.

72
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,510
Well, I'm sure
he'll be right back.

73
00:02:58,138 --> 00:02:59,639
Maybe we should go check
just to be sure.

74
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:01,307
I think that's a good idea,
don't you?

75
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:03,643
Oh.

76
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,109
Huh. See?
He didn't con me.

77
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,736
Look, instead he's dead,
and someone robbed him

78
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,864
of what's ours--
much better.

79
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:19,826
Well, the good news is,
after this spectacular bungling,

80
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,203
I happen to work with
a homicide detective.

81
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,830
If you find the killer,

82
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,373
then you'll find our piece
of the Flaming Sword.

83
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:26,457
Hey, but, Mom...

84
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,084
The challenge is making sure
we catch the case

85
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,586
before some other detective.

86
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:31,171
- But what about...
- I may be able to help.

87
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,756
Really?
I'm all ears.

88
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:35,717
(door closes)

89
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:44,893
Is everything all right here?

90
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,020
Yeah, everything's fine, Maze.

91
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,647
You can, uh, you-you can
put away the knives.

92
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,277
We'll be in touch,
Dr. Martin.

93
00:03:59,157 --> 00:03:59,908
Excuse me.

94
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,328
Uh, Maze.

95
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:05,496
Maze.

96
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:07,457
Oh, my Lord.

97
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:10,710
Who the hell was that?

98
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,215
<i>That</i> was the chairman
of the ethics review board.

99
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:16,257
Are you okay?

100
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:17,467
No.

101
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:19,844
No, I am not.

102
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,513
No, Maze. No, no,
no, don't, don't.

103
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:23,890
That won't do any good.

104
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:25,892
What happened?

105
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,893
A couple of weeks ago,

106
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,311
I maybe, sort of...

107
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:32,023
helped Lucifer break out
of a mental institution.

108
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,067
Using my own name.

109
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:36,194
It's my fault, really.

110
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,780
No, it is not your fault.
It is Lucifer's fault.

111
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,740
It's always
Lucifer's fault.

112
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,493
First, I find out he's
ditching me to go to Heaven,

113
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,578
and now he's hurting you.

114
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,581
Look, I'm gonna fix this, Linda.

115
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:51,501
And then him and I are gonna
have a little talk.

Hear me out.

136
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,593
A client of
mine called.

137

138
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,431

in terrible danger.

139
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,765
Oh, that's awful.

140
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:49,183
Detective, we should
do something.

141
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:50,184
He's at a bar downtown.

142
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,354
Would you come with me
and make sure that he's okay?

143
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:54,731
Nope.

144
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:56,024
Nope?

145
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:57,358
I'm a homicide cop.

146
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,653
I do not go around
checking on worried criminals

147
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,280
like a nanny, Charlotte.

148
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,700
- So if we're done here.
- I heard... things.

149
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:09,245
On a...

150
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:10,997
On-on the phone call.

151
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:12,540
Like?

152
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,378
Fingers... pointing.

153
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,547
You heard

154
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:21,591
fingers pointing?

155
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,010
Very angrily.

156
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,345
Yes.

157
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,432
Also, a gunshot.

158
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,225
Sounded like he was...

159
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:33,436
dying, or, um...

160
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,271
melting?

161
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,483
It's hard to tell.

162
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:39,901
Charlotte...

163
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,486
It sounds worth our time,
actually.

164
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:42,987
Agreed.

165
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,031
Why didn't you just
lead with that?

166
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:53,081
The lock's damaged.

167
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,248
LUCIFER:
Is it?

168
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,212
CHLOE:
Looks like you're right.

169
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:01,881
He's been dead
about an hour.

170
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,674
Oh? Impressive guess,
Detective.

171
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:07,804
Uh, I'm assuming
from the... discoloration.

172
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,849
Well, that wasn't
a complete Dumpster fire,

173
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:14,060
but now that we're finished,
you can see yourself out.

174
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,937
I'll do nothing of the sort.

175
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:18,272
Fine. I'll show you out,
if you insist.

176
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,233
I'm not going anywhere.

177
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:23,528
But the detective and I have
got everything handled now.

178
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,280
This is far too important
to leave to just the two of you.

179
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:27,615
I will stick around.

180
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:28,574
Mum.

181
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:29,909
Besides,

182
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,452
we'll get to work together.

183
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,121
Won't that be fun?

184
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,583
♪♪♪♪

185
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,677
ELLA: We're running tests for
gunshot residue and cocaine.

186
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,262
Should have those
in, like, five minutes.

187
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,304
Okay. Good.

188
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,015
(siren wailing in distance)

189
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:54,225
Oh, Charlotte.

190
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:56,978
- You're still here, huh?
- Well, he was my client.

191
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,105
I thought I might be
of help to the case.

192
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,524
But if not, we could always
get her to shoo along

193
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:02,650
and we can carry on
with our business.

194
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:04,527
No. I'm sure she could be
very helpful.

195
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:05,862
So tell me,
why does Zeke Moore,

196
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,030
a manager at
an import/export company,

197
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,407
have you representing him?

198
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,617
- Because I'm the best.
- At getting criminals off.

199
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:12,910
Well, that's not true.

200
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,871
I haven't slept with
any of my clients.

201
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,705
What?

202
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:16,998
- (sighs)
- You represent

203
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,040
the worst of the worst.

204
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,792
So why was Zeke a client?

205
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,586
Because he works
for Bianca Ruiz.

206
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:22,795
What? The tequila magnate?

207
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:25,006
Bianca's tequila empire
is a front.

208
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,342
She uses the distribution routes
to sell guns, drugs,

209
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,470
and, oh, yeah, people.

210
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,972
So we've been after her
for a long time.

211
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:34,348
Who do you think did this?

212
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,434
A rival of some sort?

213
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,269
CHLOE: Well, that's actually
a good question.

214
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:39,604
Ella, what do we have?

215
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:41,564
ELLA:
Well, no smoking gun,

216
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,317
but poor Zeke here
got shot twice.

217
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,651
First in the thigh--

218
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,904
bullet winged him--
and then another

219
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,657
went through his hand
hitting him in the chest.

220
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,993
Probably trying
to defend himself.

221
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:55,995
Too bad you can't catch bullets.

222
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,455
Well, he can't maybe.

223
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,123
I don't think this was
a professional hit.

224
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:00,833
Maybe a robbery gone wrong.

225
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,919
And idea of
what was taken?

226
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,588
ELLA: Well, trace elements
point to cash,

227
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:09,050
cocaine, gunpowder residue
indicating weapons--

228
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,177
all your basic bad guy stuff.

229
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,054
No sign of forced entry, though.

230
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:15,681
CHLOE: Which means the killer
either knew the combination,

231
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:18,100
or he just waited for the Vic
to open it to strike.

232
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:19,060
ELLA:
Mm-hmm.

233
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:22,188
Hey, I got something here.

234
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:25,691
Cell phone.

235
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,694
No dust on it,
so it hasn't been there long.

236
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:30,947
Well, Zeke had his phone on him,

237
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,657
so this one could be
the killer's.

238
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,450
Maybe he dropped it
during the fight

239
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:37,161
or just didn't have time
to retrieve it.

240
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,538
Passcode protected,

241
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:39,872
of course.

242
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,417
But the home screen is...
two eyes?

243
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:44,585
Human female breasts.

244
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:47,046
No. That is a woman's
perfectly freckled rump.

245
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,507
CHLOE: So our lead
on the killer

246
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,010
is a pair of butt-boob-eyes.

247
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,096
It's a great start.

I'm not having
sex with you here.

is the label's logo.

LUCIFER:
And they choose

278

to publish this music
of their own free will?

279
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,720
It's a vanity label.
It exists only to make

280
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,972
- this one guy's music.
- CHLOE: Okay, well,

281
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:21,891
who owns it?
And can you please turn it off?

282

(music stops)

283
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:24,810
Chet Ruiz.

284
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,395
Bianca's youngest son.

285
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:28,648
Half our billing
goes to keeping him out of jail.

286
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,566
CHLOE:
So Bianca's own son

287
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:34,236
robbed and killed
one of her most loyal soldiers?

288
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,656
The files barely mention Chet.
I didn't know he was actually

289
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,532
- part of the family business.
- MOM: He's not.

290
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:41,369
Bianca tries to keep him as far
away from it all as possible.

291
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,829
Maybe he started to resent that,
decided to make a play?

292
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,207
And then dropped his phone,
proving just how right

293
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,500
his mother was
about him. (chuckles)

294
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,668
CHLOE:
Well, if Chet is the killer,

295
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,712
this could be our chance to
take down Bianca, as well.

296
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,422
Cut off the head
of her entire operation.

297
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,924
This could be huge.

298
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,968
Yeah. Bummer is the phone proves
that Chet was in the room

299
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,805
but doesn't definitively
tie him to the murder.

300
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,973
Dan, why don't you work
on hacking the passcode.

301
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:04,433
I'll have a chat with Chet.

302
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,894
And, Charlotte, thank you
so much for your help.

303
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:08,270
But now that
one of your clients

304
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:10,439
is our main suspect,
it's best you go.

305
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,233
I don't think
I have to go quite yet.

306
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:13,901
Maybe not,
but I think you should.

307
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:15,903
Bianca's having a party today.

308
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:17,071
It's the launch

309
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,447
of her new tequila.

310
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,157
I'm sure
Chet will be there, and...

311
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,326
I'm invited.

312
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,577
Why do you want to help us now?

313
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,079
Because we all want
the same thing:

314
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,206
to find out
who robbed and killed Zeke.

315
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:28,916
DAN: You know, Chloe,
it would be

316
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,710
a good chance for us
to go undercover.

317
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,920
Gather some Intel before they
even know we're onto them.

318
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,714
(clears throat) All right.

319
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,382
Fine. Good. It's settled.

320
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,759
The detective and I will go, so
thank you so much for your help.

321
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,177
I don't think so.

322
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,304
The invitation
is under my name.

323
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:43,514
I will go.

324
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:47,143
Perhaps Detective Espinoza
should join me.

325
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,645
No. Yes, that's not happening.

326
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:50,896
Uh, very well.
I'll go with you...

327
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,523
- No, I'll go with Charlotte.
- But, Detective...

328
00:12:52,732 --> 00:12:53,816
No more argument.

329
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,694
Very well.
But I suggest you go shopping.

330
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,238
This isn't the kind of place
you can attend in pajamas.

331
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,325
This is ridiculous.

332
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:05,578
Pajamas?

333
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,329
What if Ella goes to the party?

334
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,914
That sounds like a great idea.

335
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,375
Oh, my God. Thank you so much
for thinking of me.

336
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:13,335
But you know what? I'm so busy.

337
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:14,962
I have been sidelined

338
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,214
by my own mother
and the detective.

339
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,841
(chuckles):
It's absurd.

340
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,092
I won't stand for it.

341
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,428
I am gonna find a way
into that party.

342
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,930
MAZE: Do you always
whine like this?

343
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:27,349
I don't know
how she puts up with it.

344
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,435
Where's Dr. Linda?

345
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,811
Suspended.

346
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,396
Because of you.

347
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:34,482
Because you have
been a terrible,

348
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,358
selfish friend.

349
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,569
To her.

350
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:40,905
Now you're gonna fix it.

351
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,283
Well, gladly, once I figure
a way back onto the case.

352
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:46,911
No, Lucifer.

353
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:48,329
Now!

354
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:51,665
But I suppose they can
handle things without me

355
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,918
for the time being. (chuckles)

356
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,044
What's the plan?

357
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,342
It'll take two hours
to scan the phone.

358
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:04,762
I'll come to you.

359
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,931
I'll kill some time
till it's done.

360
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,474
See you soon.

361
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:13,604
Hey, man.

362
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:14,855
You looking for your brother?

363
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,690
Or my m... um...

364
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:17,733
Charlotte?

365
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,276
Listen, um...

366
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,195
are they here? Because I haven't
been able to reach them.

367
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,446
No, they took off.

368
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:23,781
Couple hours ago.

369
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,074
Of course they did.

370
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,867
And why would they bother
to let me know?

371
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:28,953
I could try
to call them for you.

372
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,538
Don't worry about it, Dan.

373
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,289
I mean, with a brother
like Lucifer,

374
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,208
I really should be
used to this, right?

375
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:35,626

I'm not the same woman I was

00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,331
Hmm. Did you have
a change of heart?

408
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,707
No, the same heart.

409
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,417
Completely different soul,
though.

410
00:15:59,084 --> 00:15:59,960
Hmm.

411
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,212
There's Chet.

412
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,505
I'll go talk to him.

413
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,133
MOM: You know, that's wise.
You seem more his type

414
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:08,135
than me, and you're not
particularly intimidating,

415
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:10,012
- so that should help.
- Help what?

416
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,056
Well, in seducing him,
of course.

417
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,100
I'm not gonna seduce him,
Charlotte.

418
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,977
Not with that posture
you're not.

419
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,187
Fine.

420
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,605
- I'll do it.
- No. No.

421
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,106
There's gonna be no seducing.

422
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,942
We just need
to get Chet to talk,

423
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,610
have him incriminate himself,

424
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,779
then we can arrest him
and flip him on Bianca.

425
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:29,198
MOM: You expect him
to betray his own mother?

426
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,534
One that's given him
everything he's ever wanted?

427
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,995
Not all kids appreciate what
their parents have given them.

428
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,288
Well, that I agree with.

429
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,749
I just think with
a little pressure, he'll crack.

430
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,043
Oh, bodyguard.

431
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,420
Maybe he's not as easy
to get to as I thought.

432
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,464
MOM: Why would
an overprotective mother

433
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:48,092
bring her murderous son
to a tequila-fueled party?

434
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,677
Well, if her son
killed Zeke,

435
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,136
she has no idea.

436
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,394

You can't do this to her.

Well, I'm afraid that she
brought this on herself.

So, unless
there's something...

Is there a-a point to this?

455
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,183
Yes, I'm wondering
the same thing.

456
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,978
The point is,
despite all of that,

457
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,355
she went out of her way
to help him.

458
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:44,773
Yeah, she's right.

459
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:45,899
The doctor has

460
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,068
seen a side to me that I hide

461
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,112
because it's, well, terrifying.

462
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,656
But she accepted me nonetheless,
and she's helped me

463
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,867
through issues
that I thought insurmountable.

464
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,579
I appreciate the testimonial,

465
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,457

into the notes.

Well, she's generous.

470
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,633
As a, as a therapist,
as a lover,

471
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,010
- a friend...
- Wait.

472
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,389
- You slept with your therapist.
- What?

473
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,266
O-Only in the beginning.
Then she decided

474
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:20,976
that I shouldn't
pay for therapy with sex.

475
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,728

Oh, no, no, she saved my life.

479
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,026

she killed me first,

Smuggling up
rare artifacts on the side.

Improv?

536
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,538
Really?

537
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,583
(both laugh)

538
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,294
Come on, man, you promised me
you wouldn't laugh.

539
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,338
(chuckles)

540
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:55,297
I went through a lot

541
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,381
this last year.

542
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:00,093
And improv sort of helped me
reorient myself.

543
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:01,929
How?

544
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,807
Well, it took stepping
outside of myself

545
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,726
to figure out
who I really was.

546
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,896
You know, stop defining myself
by other people.

547
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,774
Chloe. Lucifer.

548
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,525
I see.

549
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,903
So you think I'm defining myself
by my brother, yeah?

550
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,196
Well, I know from experience,

551
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,406
the dude casts
a pretty big-ass shadow.

552
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,743
Well, if there is one constant
in the universe,

553
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,286
it's that
Lucifer's the favorite.

554
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:28,830
No matter what I do.

555
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,458
No matter how hard I work
or how much he screws up.

556
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,836
It's never gonna change.

557
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,760
You guys must have competed
over everything, huh?

558
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,095
(chuckles)

559
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,513
I mean, he would never
admit it, right?

560
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,349
But yeah. Yeah, everything.

561
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,059
Even women?

562
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:51,645
Eh, I just noticed that

563
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,355
you and Lucifer
have a weird relationship

564
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,564
with Charlotte Richards.

565
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:55,482
I just thought maybe you guys...

566
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,359
No, Dan, we are not
competing over Charlotte.

567
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,152
Trust me.

568
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,073
At least,
not in the way you think.

569
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,993
And if we are,
well, obviously I lost.

570
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,787
Because I'm here, with you.

571
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:09,913
(laughs)

572
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,665
- No offense.
- (phone chimes)

573
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,125
Yeah, none taken.

574
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,752
Oh, man.

575
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,838
They couldn't
crack the passcode.

576
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,382
But, uh, for what it's worth,

577
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,677
I like you a hell of a lot
more than I like your brother.

578

00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,982
I know everyone here except you.

581
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,401
What are you doing here?

582
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:42,070

Dan. Hey. Look, that phone--

606
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,576
I think it is way more important
than we thought.

607
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,953
It might be the key
to taking down Bianca.

608
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,333
Great. Now that
we've solved that,

609
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,876
I can get back
to the case and...

610
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,545
Ooh! God! What?!

611
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,839
What? You just
made everything worse.

612
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,592
Why am I surprised?
Just leave.

613
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,886
Since that's been your plan
all along anyway.

614
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,180
Is that what all
this has been about?

615
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,431
(short laugh)

616
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,601
Amenadiel told you about our
trip back to Heaven, didn't he?

617
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,144
Don't you blame him.

618
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,437
- You...
- Aah!

619
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,523
- ...should have told me.
- Well, if you understood

620
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:00,857
the full picture...

621
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:01,858
Oh!

622
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,443
Stop hitting me.

623
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:04,736
Then explain.

624
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,696
Well, I'd like to, but
you have a tendency

625
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,073
to get emotional
about things.

626
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,032
Aah!

627
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:10,742
Case in point.

628
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,786
So I needed to be controlled,
is that it?

629
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,540
What the hell am I, Lucifer--
a pawn in some plan of yours?

630
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:17,999
No, I wouldn't put it like that.

631
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,293
Of course <i>you</i> wouldn't,
because that would actually

632
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,588
require you understanding
how you affect people.

633
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,383
- How you hurt them.
- Oh! Aah!

634
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,802
You seem to be the one doing
the hurting at the moment.

635
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,388
You don't care about anyone
other than yourself.

636
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,890
Unless they can be
of use to you.

637
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:36,935
Sound familiar?

638
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,813
Tread very carefully, Maze.

639
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:45,444
You're just like your parents.

640
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,159
Aah!

641
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:58,665
(yelling)

642
00:24:58,874 --> 00:24:59,958
(growling)

643
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,090
(panting)

644
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:14,181
Maybe... maybe we should

645
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,600
just take a time-out so that...

646
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,226
you can catch your breath.

647
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,270
Yeah, so you can
catch your breath.

648
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,065
And then, I'll get back
to kicking your ass.

649
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:27,861
(groans)

650
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:28,904
See, now...

651
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,741
I had no idea that
you were this mad at me.

652
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,121
You were gonna leave me.

653
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,792
I would never do that.

654
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,630
But you told Amenadiel
and your mom

655
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:49,591
that y... you were
going with them to Heaven.

656
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,511
Well, I didn't say how long for.

657
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:53,970
Huh?

658
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,556
Or what I was gonna do
when I got there.

659
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,479
You're playing your own angle.

660
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,943
(both laugh)

661
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:10,278
And you didn't tell me...

662
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,783
...because you needed me
to be angry with you

663
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:17,452
- (laughs)
- so you could sell your story.

664
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,996
Exactly! (laughs)

665
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,791
So, all this...

666
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,209
was for nothing.

667
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,669
(laughs)

668
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,465
Lucifer, that's even worse.

669
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,101
ELLA:
<i>This phone</i>

670
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,728
could be the key to taking down
the entire Ruiz empire.

671
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,565
- Yeah, but how do we crack it
if cyber couldn't even do it?
- Time.

672
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,316
That idiot
didn't install a program

673
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:49,901
that can remotely
wipe the phone.

674
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,862
And it's an older phone
with just a four-digit code.

675
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,364
So, what, we just
keep trying till we get in?

676
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:55,198
How long will that take?

677
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,783
There are only 10,000 options.

678
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:57,951
Well, actually,

679
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,328
9,996 now--
I took a couple stabs.

680
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,289
So, hey, making progress.

681
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:03,999
I would say maybe a month.

682
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:06,126
Well, we can't arrest 'em till
we know what's on that phone.

683
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:07,836
- And if they decide
to make a run for it...
- All right.

684
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,337
Let's just try to speed it up.
Let's look into

685
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,256
Chet's background, let's try
and come up with number

686
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,425
combinations that might be
meaningful to him, all right?

687
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:14,259
Let's go.

688
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:19,472
Did you guys...

689
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,891
kill the chairman
of the review board?

690
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:23,685
Please tell me you
didn't kill him.

691
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:25,395
Not that he
didn't deserve it,

692
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,106
- the smug, insufferable...
- LUCIFER: No, no.

693
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,734
No one's dead.
We did this to each other.

694
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,193
Though... (sighs)

695
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:34,654
when it comes to your case,
I fear I may have, um...

696
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:36,615
complicated things.

697
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:39,618
Lucifer told him
you used to screw.

698
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,786
- Among other things.
- Oh?

699
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:43,705
Oh.

700
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,084
Well, I guess that's that.

701
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,086
No, that isn't that.
I want to know why

702
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:51,379
she's still upset with me.

703
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,048
Since I'm not currently
a practicing

704
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,841
doctor of psychiatry,
I don't have to lead you

705
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,677
on this path of realization;
I can just tell you.

706
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:01,222
Maze is pissed at you
because you used her.

707
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,974
Sure.

708
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,685
But for the greater good
of our debauchery here in L.A.

709
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:07,812
Did you even once think
of how this affected her?

710
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,356
Of course I did.

711
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,816
Thought about how
she might ruin everything

712
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:15,278
by disemboweling my mum
or castrating my brother.

713
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:16,946
I meant her feelings.

714
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:18,073
What?

715
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,282
She thought

716
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,242
you abandoned her.

717
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,580
That you didn't care
how that affected her.

718
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,541
But those sort of things
never bothered her be...

719
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:33,797
...before.

720
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:37,300
Oh.

721
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:42,514
Mazikeen.

722
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,016
I didn't realize...

723
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,272
I should have realized.

724
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,614
Well, my work
here is done.

725
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,410
Literally.

726
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,037
So, if you'll excuse me,

727
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:09,958
I'm going to find
a very stiff martini.

728
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:19,592
Linda.

729
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,429
I'll take care of this.

730
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,180
I promise.

731
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:38,194
Bianca.

732
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,238
Has something happened?

733
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:42,449
Yes.

734
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,119
My son robbed and killed Zeke,
as you know.

735
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,537
But then he showed me

736
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:48,872
what Zeke was smuggling.

737
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:50,999
And for whom.

738
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,543
Now I have it.

739
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:57,046
And I think it's very important
to you, isn't it?

740
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,674
- It is.
- Then let's make a deal.

741
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,260
I'll give it to you
if you get

742
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:03,762
my son's phone from the police.

743
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:04,804
(scoffs)

744
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:06,306
That's not possible.

745
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:07,724
You'll find a way.

746
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,977
Otherwise, I'll make sure
that what you want...

747
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,438
disappears forever.

748
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:31,998
ELLA:
Birthday reverse. Nope.

749
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:34,876
Double 69.

750
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,337
Oddly relieved
that's not it.

751
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,089
Ms. Lopez.

752
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,426
We haven't really
had the chance to meet.

753
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:46,930
I know. I've been looking
forward to a formal "hey-ya."

754
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:49,098
S... Uh, no,
I see you're still

755
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,517
working on the phone.

756
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:52,977
I knew Chet well.

757
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:56,147
Perhaps I could borrow it,
maybe try some combinations?

758
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:58,900
I see through you.

759
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,279
I know you are
waiting around

760
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:04,489
for my boy Dan.

761
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:06,199
Oh.

762
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,117
Caught me red-handed.

763
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:10,495
And even though
most everybody

764
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:11,454
is all like,

765
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,164
(clicks tongue)
"She a shark,

766
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,458
those dead eyes,
don't trust her,"

767
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:17,585
when I look at you...

768
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:19,712
I see a light.

769
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,673
Did my bandage come undone?

770
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:25,552
So, for now,
benefit of the doubt.

771
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,763
But if you ever
hurt Dan again,

772
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:30,765
I'll have someone
break your legs.

773
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:36,020
(phone vibrating)

774
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,107
Oh, that's my brother.
I've been trying

775
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:40,733
to get ahold
of him forever.

776
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:43,361
Can you watch
the phone?

777
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:45,113
Sure.

778
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:46,364
Thanks.

779
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:50,159
See? Light.

780
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:53,538
(chuckles)

781
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:58,877
Start talking.

782
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,672
(sighs)

783
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:06,467
<i>(piano playing dark melody)</i>

784
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:14,767
(elevator bell dings)

785
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:17,478
Ah!

786
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:21,149
(plays Britney Spears'
"Oops!... I Did it Again")

787
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:22,483
What happened to you?

788
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,570
Oh, this. It's just a little
fisticuffs between friends.

789
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:28,031
I just had
a very enlightening conversation

790
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,198
with Charlotte Richards.

791
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:30,867
Ah. Well, I've had my fill

792
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:32,994
of enlightening conversations
for today, thank you.

793
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:36,581
Lucifer, she told me
who she really is,

794
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,124
and how you two are related.

795
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,210
I somehow doubt that.

796
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:42,921
It all makes sense.

797
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:44,464
Why you were so disgusted

798
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,716
when I suggested you two
had slept together.

799
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,635
Why you act so weird
around her in general.

800
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:50,803
She... really told you.

801
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,263
What did she tell you?

802
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:54,807
That she's your father's ex.

803
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,395
Right, yes, no.
That's-that's true.

804
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:00,605
Right, yeah.

805
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:02,106
I mean, the way
she talked about your dad

806
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,567
and-and what he put her through.

807
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,612
Mm-hmm. Betrayal,
torture, Hell, et cetera.

808
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,197
- All true.
- Mm-hmm.

809
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:12,742
I just cannot imagine raising
kids with someone like that.

810
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,452
Sympathy for the
goddess, Detective?

811
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:15,620
(sighs)

812
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:18,247
Why didn't you just tell me
she was your stepmom?

813
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:22,126
Well, it didn't seem
that simple to explain.

814
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:24,629
I mean, how did this
all come about, anyway?

815
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,589
Well... (sighs)

816
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:29,801
I... I caught Charlotte
trying to steal evidence

817
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,302
for Bianca Ruiz.

818
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:32,595
What?

819
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:33,930
Why would she do that?

820
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,473
Well, apparently
Bianca figured out

821
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:37,600
that Charlotte and I were
working together at the sting.

822
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,018
Bianca threatened
Charlotte's family.

823
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:40,770
I mean, she threatened you
if she didn't help.

824
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,107
Well, that sounds plausible,
yes.

825
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,817
I don't know.

826
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,027
Something about it
doesn't feel right.

827
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:49,821
I don't know if
I can trust her.

828
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,240
Well, I mean, I know I'm biased,

829
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,283
but one thing's for certain,
Detective:

830
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:56,160
Charlotte Richards
will stop at nothing

831
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,453
to protect her children.

832
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,290
You can trust that.

833
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:02,458
Hmm.

834
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,420
Did you bring me
what I asked for?

835
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:06,796
Mm.

836
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:09,882
As promised.

837
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:14,512
Make sure it's real.

838
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,056
That it wasn't cloned.

839
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:26,190
(liquid pouring)

840
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:34,449
To the things a mother will do
for her children.

841
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:36,117
I'll drink to that.

842
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:39,245
BIANCA:
I can't even count the times

843
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:40,455
that Chet has come close

844
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:42,081
to destroying everything
I've built.

845
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:44,876
MOM: Children always find
new ways to test us.

846
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:46,627
She's talking
about Amenadiel.

847
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:48,713
MOM:
Put us through... hell.

848
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,173
That one's me.

849
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:52,050
BIANCA:
And yet we still protect them.

850
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:53,801
MOM:
Always.

851
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,014
(computer trilling)

852
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,772
Now for your side
of the bargain.

853
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:07,774
(gasps)

854
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:08,983
(clears throat)

855
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:13,237
(static crackling)

856
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:14,822
We lost the feed.

857
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:16,199
- She's up to something.
- Well, no, no, no.

858
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:17,366
She may have just
shorted the bug.

859
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:19,243
No. Charlotte Richards
is either screwing us over

860
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:20,495
or she's in trouble.

861
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:21,829
Guys, get ready to go in.

862
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:23,372
And she better
be in trouble.

863
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:29,587
This opens a
safety deposit box.

864
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,048
Inside you'll find what Zeke
was smuggling for you.

865
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:33,841
This isn't what we agreed to.

866
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,969
How do I know you'll hold up
your end of the deal?

867
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,638
Because I always do.

868
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:40,890
And quite honestly,
I don't see why

869
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:42,975
- you put so much value in...
- (door opens)

870
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:44,477
Freeze!
See your hands!

871
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,481
LAPD. Bianca Ruiz,
you're under arrest.

872
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:50,149
This is absurd.

873
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:53,027
Charlotte. Charlotte.

874
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:55,530
Will no longer be
representing you.

875
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,908
You're making
a terrible mistake.

876
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,869
Don't touch me.

877
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,747
Charlotte, are you okay?

878
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:05,998
- Yes.
- Lucifer, don't.

879
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:07,333
Step away.
I need to search her.

880
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:09,460
Well, I don't think
that's necessary, Detective.

881
00:36:09,669 --> 00:36:12,755
- Well, I do.
- It's okay, son.

882
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:13,840
Fine.

883
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,258
Arms out.

884
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:19,762
Hmm.

885
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:22,765
Oh, you're being
incredibly thorough.

886
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,643
I like it.

887
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:28,396
(clears throat)

888
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,898
- She's clean.
- Well, I told you, Detective,

889
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:32,358
she's got nothing to hide.

890
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:34,193
MAN: The phone
was still unlocked.

891
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:35,403
We have everything.

892
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:37,905
Seems like we do.

893
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:40,992
Let's, uh...

894
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:58,217
A book?

895
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,887
That's what Zeke smuggled
for me?

896
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:04,307
Is this a joke?

897
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,184
Well, if it were, I would have
chosen something funnier,

898
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:08,269
like Douglas Adams or Freud.

899
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:11,147
Are you certain that this is
all that was in

900
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:12,815
- the safety deposit box?
- (sighs)

901
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:15,276
Well, how is a book supposed
to ignite the sword?

902
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:17,320
Maybe it's
an instruction manual.

903
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:22,200
MOM: In an ancient language
I can't read.

904
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,868
Wonderful.

905
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,785
Here.

906
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:26,913
Wh-- I can't read it.

907
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,956
But you speak every language.

908
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:30,416
Speak, not read.

909
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,293
I've always found tongues
much more useful than books.

910
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:33,711
So whatever
language this is...

911
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,213
It's Sumerian.

912
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:38,758
Unlike some of us who had
everything handed to him,

913
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,968
I actually spent
my youth studying.

914
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:43,262
(chuckles):
Excellent.

915
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:45,181
My smart boy.

916
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:49,435
How-how quickly
can you translate it?

917
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:51,812
Um, should only
take me a few days.

918
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:53,439
- (chuckles)
- Days?

919
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,399
I don't have that kind of time.

920
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:58,319
Mum, why have you got your
knickers in such a twist?

921
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,655
Is there a reason why you're
in such a rush lately?

922
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:03,824
I-I'm just anxious to see
the rest of the family.

923
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,912
Please start translating.

924
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,001
There's something
going on with her.

925
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:17,380
Yeah. Or it's just that
time of the millennium.

926
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:21,884
What?

927
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,478
Excuse me.

928
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:34,981
Not this time.

929
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:40,444
(knocks)

930
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:41,988
- Hey.
- Hey.

931
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,198
Congrats on nabbing
Queen Tequila.

932
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:46,784
Well, Chet's still out there,

933
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:49,370
so this isn't over
until I find him.

934
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:51,247
You and Charlotte Richards--

935
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,708
that is the most awkward team-up
of the century.

936
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:57,295
(chuckles) Actually, it wasn't
as bad as I expected.

937
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:59,755
I learned a lot of
eye-opening things about her.

938
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:02,341
That's for sure. Like her
being Lucifer's stepmom.

939
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,051
- Had no idea...
- Wait a minute.

940
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:06,387
She-- Stepmom?

941
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:07,430
Yeah.

942
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,514
Yes.

943
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,475
That makes a weird amount
of sense, actually.

944
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,479
Dan, I want you to be
careful with her.

945
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,939
There's something about her
I don't trust.

946
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:19,233
I'm gonna be fine, Chloe.

947
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:22,987
- Wait.
One more thing.
- Yeah.

948
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:25,406
If you married her,

949
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,367
you'd kind of be
like Lucifer's dad.

950
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:30,369
(laughs)

951
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:31,954
- Oh, my God.
- Right?

952
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:34,582
It's so, so messed up.

Well, come on.

958
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:04,820
Hand it over. I need
what Zeke really smuggled.

959
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:07,239

Who knew translating could be

(sighs) Listen, I think
I found something.

980
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:13,347
Huh?

981
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:16,767
God shattered the Flaming Sword
into three distinct pieces.

982
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:18,519
"The Blade of Death."

983
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:19,728
LUCIFER:
Azrael's.

984
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:21,522
AMENADIEL:
"The Medallion of Life."

985
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,524
LUCIFER:
Johnson's belt buckle.

986
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,819
And the key that binds them
all together.

987
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:32,408
Well, keys don't bind,
they unlock.

988
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,994
I think someone needs to go
back to translation school.

(gentle melody continues)

990
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:40,541
And guess who has the key.

991
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,671
Well, don't leave me
in suspense.

992
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:46,881
Who is it, brother?

993
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:48,799
It says that God
entrusted the key

994
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:50,759
to his favorite son.

995
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,220
(sighs)

996
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,891
Of course he gave it to you.

997
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:00,436
It's always you, isn't it?

998
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:01,812
Well, what are
you talking about?

999
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:03,272
The only keys
I've got are these.

1000
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:05,399
(plays notes)

1001
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:07,860
What else did you bring
with you to Earth, Luci?

1002
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:09,195
(chuckles softly)

1003
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,696
Your ring.

1004
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:13,574
I've never seen you without it;
maybe that's the key.

1005
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:16,452
Well, the key to completing
my ensemble maybe.

1006
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:17,828
Here.

1007
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:20,247
Try and attach your ring
to this.

1008
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:22,166
- Brother.
- Just do it.

1009
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,751
And we'll confirm
what we already know.

1010
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:25,794
- Brother...
- That Father's favorite,

1011
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,213
despite everything
that you have done,

1012
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:28,881
is and always has been you.

1013
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,633
Look down.

1014
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:32,468
(gasping)

1015
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:36,889
LUCIFER:
Is that the key around your neck

1016
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:39,183
or are you just
happy to see me?

1017
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:46,065
He entrusted it...

1018
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,693
to you, brother.
