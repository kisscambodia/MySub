Our victim's name
is Maddie Howard.

103
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,914
She was attacked when
she left her apartment.

104
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:07,498
The assailant chased
her down the alley

105
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:08,917
and stabbed her
repeatedly.

106
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:10,835
19 times, to be exact.

107
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:13,379
CHLOE: Overkill is usually a
crime of passion-- they probably

108
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:14,214
knew each other.

109
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:15,632
She was killed
in broad daylight?

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,674
There must have been witnesses.

111
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:18,384
Yeah, a bunch,
but depending on who you ask,

112
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,345
the killer was a male
who's either Hispanic,

113
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,931
Caucasian or black, short
or tall, brown or blond hair,

114
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,307
or completely bald.

115
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,476
So we're dealing
with a shapeshifter.

116
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:28,937
Well, eyewitness testimonies
can be unreliable.

117
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,439
Yeah, people's <i>ojos</i> go a little <i>loco.</i>

118
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,900
Evidence, however,
does not lie.

119
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,653
We got substantial bruising
to the skin,

120
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,822
blade penetrated not only
soft tissue but also bone.

121
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:41,950
So the killer was
big and strong.

122
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:45,828
Also, blond head hair,
so odds are really good

123

00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,310
to Earth might lead
to such destruction?

181
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,895
Ooh, I like the smug.

182
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:17,480
Much sexier than the earnest.

183
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,940
I'm just surprised that
you would actually take

184
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,358
a little bit of responsibility.

185
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,360
I thought an unmarked grave
in the middle of nowhere

186
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:23,319
would be safe enough.

187
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:24,612
Clearly I was wrong.

188
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:27,490
But... I clean up my messes.

189
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:28,783
(chuckles)

190
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,953
Well, good luck, you two.

191
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,037
(chuckles)

192
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,497
You'll want to help, Maze.

193
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,790
No, thanks.

194
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,626
Let me remind you, I have a job.

195
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:41,963
And let me remind you that the
blade doesn't just kill humans.

196
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,465
It also obliterates
celestial beings,

197
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:45,967
including demons.

198
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,302
So, say the detective were to
find it and bring it home...

199
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,471
I get snuffed out
for not doing the dishes.

200
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,305
Which is why

201
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,433
the detective can't be part
of this investigation.

202
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,517
Now,

203
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,812
I'll need you two
to move Uriel's body.

204
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,189
Somewhere it won't be
found this time.

205
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:04,861
Very well.

206
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:06,195
And one note,

207
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,614
you're to do so without
disturbing the grave site

208
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,617
in the slightest, specifically
that footprint there.

209
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,286
MAZE:
Why?

210
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,372
Because I'm going to get an
expert to help me examine it.

211
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,294
ELLA:
<i>You need a favor?</i>

212
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:25,173
Yes, your scientific expertise
on a discreet matter.

213
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,174
Mm.

214
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:28,050
Paternity test?

215
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,011
What? Do I look like someone
who'd be so irresponsible?

216
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,431
Uh, regardless, if
you do this favor for me,

217
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,016
then I'll do a favor
for you in return.

218
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,809
Lucifer,

219
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:40,062
the whole point of a favor is
to do it for free, okay?

220
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:43,483
And then you just trust the love
will come back to you somehow.

221
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:44,942
Favors are about faith.

222
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:47,320
Ugh. Please don't
ruin favors for me.

223
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,446
Look, come on, I insist.

224
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:49,447
Tit for tat.

225
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:53,534
Fine, um...

226
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:55,953
Well, there is something
that I would like.

227
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:57,455
Mm?

228
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,582
But I'm not sure
you can handle it.

229
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,918
Oh, well, now I'm intrigued.

230
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,586
I mean, it might be a little...

231
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,172
inappropriate among colleagues.

232
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,216
Oh, right, even better.

233
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,009
Well, why don't you, uh...

234
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:11,802
Well...
(whispering): Okay, so...

235
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:14,096
(whispers indistinctly)
- Oh.

236
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,689
Oh, no, no.
Definitely not.

237
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,441
You're the one
who wanted tit for tat.

238
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,193
(chuckles) Yes, if only
it were that simple.

239
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,655
(sighs)

240
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,323
All right, fine.

241
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,283
You have a deal.

242
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:36,577
Gosh, you're a nasty
little nerd, aren't you?

243
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:39,288
♪♪

244
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:40,540
♪ Oh, oh ♪

245
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,792
♪ So beautiful ♪

246
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,418
♪ Like a love song ♪

247
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,128
♪ You got me singing. ♪

248
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:48,548
Right. Here we are.

249
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,217
Does your favor
involve killing me?

250
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,677
(Lucifer chuckles, Ella yelps)

251
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,053
I'm just kidding, no.

252
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,680
I need you to do
your forensic whatnots

253
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,516
and work out
what disturbed this area.

254
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,643
Uh, you mean this empty grave?

255
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:01,602
Look,

256
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:03,896
you said to me that favors
were about faith, right?

257
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:04,981
Yeah.

258
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,899
Well, I'm asking you
to have faith in me.

259
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,402
And know that I wouldn't ask
anything untoward of you.

260
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:14,031
You know, when you use my own
words against me like that,

261
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,408
it's actually
really hard to say no.

262
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,325
I know.

263
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:18,494
There's some very interesting
footprints over there.

264
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,957
ELLA: Well, it looks like
we got a man's sneaker.

265
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,501
Okay, I'll take a mold,
but assuming

266
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,461
it's one of the major brands,
I mean, you're looking at a pool

267
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,380
of, like, two million dudes
in L.A.

268
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,842
Maybe 10,000 robust ladies.

269
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,428
Well, I was hoping for something
a little more specific.

270
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,264
That's not how
analytical science works.

271
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,224
Whoa.

272
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:43,394
Someone tried to burn something.

273
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,607
It looks like there's
writing on one s...

274
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,400
- side.
- (chuckles)

275
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:52,069
Yeah, I should be able to
reconstruct this at the lab.

276
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:53,988
Ah, excellent.

277
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,365
Right, whilst you do that,
I'll get back to the detective.

278
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,367
Oh, and remember...

279
00:10:58,868 --> 00:10:59,910
Yeah, don't tell anyone

280
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,121
about your super creepy
non-grave grave.

281
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,372
Got it.

282
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,712
CHLOE:
<i>So you worked here
with the deceased?</i>

283
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:11,464
We didn't just work together.

284
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,591
I mean, Maddie was a friend.

285
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,427
The person who introduced me
to the Glory Way.

286
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,973
God, I can't believe
that she's dead.

287
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,308
I'm sorry.
The glory what?

288
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,476
The glory hole.

289
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:24,518
The Glory Way.

290
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:25,686
- Ah.
- Developed by

291
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:27,980
our guru, Jenson Glory.

292
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:32,193
The Glory Way is a mind
and body sensibility system

293
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,862
designed to reveal what we call

294
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,197
the "home you."

295
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,366
Right. Do people
actually believe

296
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:39,950
the word salad that
you're selling?

297
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,285
(laughing):
'Cause, I mean, look,

298
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:43,579
I enjoy a taut,
spandex-wrapped backside

299
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:44,747
as much as the next chap,

300
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,541
but that was one large helping
of spiritual gobbledy-gook.

301
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,795
Follow Jenson's teachings and
you <i>will</i> uncover your true self.

302
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:51,629
And what if

303
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,757
your true self is a 400-pound
nimrod with flatulence issues?

304
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:58,052
Just saying. Some things
are better left buried.

305
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,054
CHLOE:
Given the specifics
of the murder,

306
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:03,224
we're looking for someone who
had a real hatred for Maddie.

307
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:04,767
Does anyone come to mind?

308
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:08,729
No. Maddie was a wholesome
soul, a true light.

309
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,147
What about petty grievances?

310
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:12,358
Perhaps Maddie drank
someone's probiotic smoothie

311
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,902
or did one too many peacock
poses for someone's taste?

312
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:15,736
- Lucifer.
- No.

313
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:17,321
Just... think.

314
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,532
There must be
some little disagreements.

315
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,033
So why don't you
write us up a list?

316
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,577
Anyone who so much as raised
a patchouli-scented eyebrow

317
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,246
in Maddie's direction
could be the killer.

318
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:26,789
- See...
- Excuse us.

319
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,251
That's not the profile

320
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,002
of the murderer
we're investigating.

321
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,504
I'm just being
thorough, Detective.

322
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:36,465
Like you said, "Shake the bushes
until the truth flies free."

323
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,884
I don't think
I've ever said that before.

324
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,678
- No?
- Uh-uh.

325
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,888
Oh. Perhaps it was Ms. Lopez.

326
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,434
Mm. You've been spending
a lot of time with Ella.

327
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,894
You know, working
together, I mean.

328
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,771
- (clears her throat)
- LUCIFER: Not particularly.

329
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:52,440
Hmm.

330
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:54,525
Shall we see
how this list is getting on?

331
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:55,651
Mm-hmm.

332
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:01,073
(humming)

333
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:02,575
Glad to see you're
hard at work.

334
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,537
You know, studies show that the
brain does some of its best work

335
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:07,872
when it's not trying.

336
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,291
That's why great ideas come
in the shower.

337
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,001
- For me, it's
usually women.
- Hmm.

338
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,461
Any progress so far?

339
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,171
- Damn straight.
- Hmm.

340
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,467
I rehydrated that burnt
piece of paper

341
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,010
we found
at your super creepy place

342
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,720
using polyvinyl acetate.

343
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,639
- Oh, it's easy
for you to say.
- I ran these pieces

344
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,183
through a pattern
recognition program,

345
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,434
and I found two things.

346
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,102
First...

347
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,815
what looks to be a map

348
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,402
leading from downtown L.A. to
that exact spot you took me to.

349
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:40,571
Right. What was
the second thing?

350
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,032
Some business logo
of a law firm.

351
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,075
What law firm?

352
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:49,997
(computer trilling, beeps)

353
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,458
Bloody hell.

354
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:57,254
(door slams)

355
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,591
I said no interruptions,
so unless

356
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,635
you're that broad-shouldered
intern from this morning...

357
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:03,844
LUCIFER:
Hello, Mum.

358
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,679
Oh. (laughs)

359
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:06,722
Hello, son.

360
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,058
It appears you've been busy.

361
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,859
I was getting bored
with my mate and offspring,

362
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:21,821
so I thought
I'd dive into my employment.

363
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:24,323
Not that hard
once you read the law books.

364
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,533
What law books?

365
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:26,867
Well, all of them.

366
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:30,788
Took less than a weekend <i>with</i> time
to teach the hubby new tricks.

367
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,125
Have you ever heard of something
called the reverse cowgirl?

368
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,418
Well, I'm thrilled,

369
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,128
Mum, really, I am.

370
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,549
Here you are studying law
<i>and</i> the Kama Sutra.

371
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,844
And drawing maps
to Uriel's grave!

372
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,556
(laughs)

373
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,391
Did someone find the blade?

374
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,060
Oh, so you admit
that you led a human to it?

375
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,895
Well, not <i>a</i> human.
More like ten.

376
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,897
- Ten?
- Maybe 12. Uh...

377
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:58,065
- But...
- 15?

378
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,733
Only my craftiest clients.

379
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,527
I mean, I had to make sure
that someone would actually

380
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,612
follow through
and dig the damn thing up.

381
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:06,031
Why in the world
would you tell people?

382
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,575
What is wrong with you?!

383
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,452
Me? If you didn't want
the blade found,

384
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,746
you shouldn't have left it
in a hole in the ground!

385
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:15,916
A filled-in hole in
the middle of nowhere,

386
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,128
which no one would've possibly
found if not for <i>you.</i>

387
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,755
Yes. Well... there's that.

388
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,883
Besides, where else
am I gonna hide it?

389
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:27,303
Lux? You know how many people
traipse through there each week?

390
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,430
Well, I don't know.
Your bedroom, then.

391
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:30,431
Worse.

392
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,933
Yes... You are
sexually prolific.

393
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,393
(laughs)

394
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:36,103
Turns out, you get that from me.

395
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,230
Oh, Mum, why?

396
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:43,110
Why would you release
Azrael's blade into the world?

397
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,195
(sighs)

398
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,325
Because I wanted
to get your father's attention.

399
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,287
Your brother,

400
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,332
Uriel-- my son-- died.

401
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,251
Do you think it's crazy
that I wanted to talk about it?

402
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,003
Mourn with him, maybe?!

403
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,631
- I...
- So I reached out,

404
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,674
and guess what I got back.

405
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,343
Nothing.

406
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,345
Yes.
Like always.

407
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:13,849
So I figured that if his toys
started stabbing each other

408
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,977
with a celestial blade, that
maybe he might take a moment.

409
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:18,979
Humans are dying because of you.

410
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,857
Well, humans die.
They all do eventually.

411
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,734
It's what they were
designed to do.

412
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:25,778
Yes, but not
like this.

413
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,159
Your vacation here
has changed you.

414
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,870
You seem attached
to these creatures,

415
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:40,501
and I can't, for the life of me,
figure out why.

416
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:44,964
Look, you say you want
to stay here on Earth,

417
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,508
to live with your sons, right?

418
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:52,513
So, a choice: willingly help me
get the blade back,

419
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,183
or I'll send Maze over here
to give you some inspiration.

420
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,397
Hmm. Fine.

421
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,399
You're killing
my reverse cowgirl high.

422
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,109
I...

423
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,822
CHLOE:
LAPD investigation,
that's right.

424
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,701
Uh, just your whereabouts
around 7:00 a.m. this morning.

425
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,786
Okay. Can you prove that?

426
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:17,579
Right.

427
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:18,789
Thank you.

428
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,582
So the guy that complained

429
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,251
Maddie didn't have enough
cool-down time was

430
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,212
at an ashram in Sedona,
so, not our guy.

431
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:27,172
My pudding's gone.

432
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:28,757
I'm sorry?

433
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,092
In the break room fridge,
my pudding--

434
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,844
clearly labeled "Dan"--
it's gone.

435
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,679
Not the first time, either.

436
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,515
Wow. Do you want me
to put some unis on it?

437
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:39,184
- Want me to schedule a stakeout?
Are you even okay?
- No, Chloe.

438
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,228
I'm just saying that a man's
snacks-- they're sacred, okay?

439
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,564
- Okay.
- What up, detective people?

440
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,149
- Hey.
- Hey.

441
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,610
Are Lucifer and Ella working on
a case that I don't know about?

442
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,404
Mm. Why?

443
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,533
No reason, they just seem to be
spending a lot of time together.

444
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,244
Is someone jealous?

445
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:58,245
What?

446
00:17:58,454 --> 00:17:59,246
No.

447
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,415
No way.
Gross.

448
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:02,583
'Cause you can
tell me if you are.

449
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,876
I mean...

450
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,670
we can be there for
each other, as friends.

451
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:09,256
Even... even if
it's about another guy.

452
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,884
Right, but Lucifer's not
another guy.

453
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:12,926
He's a weirdo.

454
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,762
This is about partnership,
nothing more.

455
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,305
Partners don't keep secrets.

456
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:17,598
Well, maybe with Ella,

457
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,183
it's more than just
sex, maybe it's...

458
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,726
a little more serious.

459
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,227
Huh?

460
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,229
No, it's not like Lucifer--
I don't think he...

461
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,898
"Not like Lucifer" wha-what?

462
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,984
Likes poker.

463
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,279
Dan has a monthly game.

464
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,448
Oh, no, I love a good gamble.
Count me in.

465
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,825
Right, where's that list of
grievances against poor Maddie?

466
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,452
- CHLOE: Oh, it's the...
- DAN: Yeah.

467
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,746
- CHLOE: There-- all right, there you go.
- LUCIFER: Lovely, thank you.

468
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:41,580
Why would you do that?

469
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,957
- CHLOE: Okay, now you're making it
weird.
- DAN: You're making it weird.

470
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,417
- CHLOE: You're making it weirder.
- DAN: Sorry.

471
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,336
CHLOE:
I'll make it weird on your face.

472
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,671
Duncan Watts is our killer.

473
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:50,923
What makes you say that?

474
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,132
Well, just a hunch.

475
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,512
Duncan Watts.

476
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,847
His offices are upstairs
above the yoga studio.

477
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,141
Oh, and he's Maddie
and Corrina's landlord.

478
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,645
DAN:
Duncan was apparently upset that
Maddie kept parking in his spot.

479
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,481
He also tried to have the yoga studio
evicted a few months ago.

480
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,067
Neither of which is really
a reason for 19 stabs.

481
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,152
Yes, but just look at
his stabby mug, hmm?

482
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,114
Blond hair, thick neck, which
suggests Cro-Magnon strength.

483
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,324
Just as our dear
Ella guesstimated.

484
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,243
Ah, "dear Ella," hmm.

485
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,369
Where you going?

486
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,037
I'm just off to see
this Duncan chap.

487
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:22,871
No.

488
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,165
We will go together
like partners, okay?

489
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,836
Right, yes, I-I just need to
make a quick phone call first.

490
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,213
Oh, okay. No worries.

491
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,173
Private phone call, Detective.

492
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,842
Just give me a moment.

493
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,051
Yeah, sure.

494
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,638
- (loud clattering)
- MAZE: You sure this
is the right place?

495
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:40,806
AMENADIEL:
Duncan Watts, Maze.

496
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,850
That's the name Lucifer gave me.

497
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,442
I got nothing.

498
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:53,902
Yeah, me neither.

499
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,697
Even if we find the blade,
it's a temporary fix.

500
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:57,948
Your mom is the problem.

501
00:19:58,157 --> 00:19:59,408
(scoffs)

502
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,451
She released the blade
to create chaos,

503
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,245
and you two respond
by coddling her.

504
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,038
Nobody's coddling her,
all right?

505
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,748
Tell yourself whatever you want,

506
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:10,043
but you know it's true,
and it explains a lot.

507
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:11,837
Explains what?

508
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,505
(soft chuckle)

509
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,340
Doesn't really matter anymore,

510
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,969
but, just so you know,
this whole mama's boy thing?

511
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,888
Kind of a turnoff.

512
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,472
Oh, yeah?

513
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,934
Well, your whole "skintight leather,
hot body everywhere" thing?

514
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,854
- Mm-hmm?
- It's really not that...

515
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:33,066
It's not-- it's not
that-that great.

516
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,736
Yeah, it is.

517
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,487
(car pulling up)

518
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,947
They're here.

519
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,034
Yeah, we should probably
warn Lucifer.

520
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,333
- LUCIFER: Well?
- AMENADIEL: There's no blade.

521
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,710
(sighs)
Right, use the back way out.

522
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:53,253
(scoffs)

523
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,088
Ah, Detective,

524
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,673
you know, after reflection,
I think you're right.

525
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,842
Parking space thievery is
no motive for murder.

526
00:20:59,051 --> 00:20:59,676
(chuckles)

527
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:01,136
What is going on with you?

528
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,721
First, you're so
eager to get here,

529
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,848
you practically jump out
of my car before I've parked,

530
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:06,099
and now you want to leave.

531
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,601
What are you hiding?

532
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,519
Hiding?
What would I be hiding?

533
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,438
Blood.

534
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,232
What?

535
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,370
This is Unit 831
requesting backup.

536
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,373
Soul Depot,
15534 Hillgreen Drive.

537
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,721
It's Duncan.

538
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:48,141
Oh, must've been
some parking space.

539
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,147
Uh, Detective.

540
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:55,440
Yeah.

541
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:59,653
Seems this class took corpse
pose quite literally.

542
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,206
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

543
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,875
(camera shutter clicking)

544
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,919
So, no sign of
the murder weapon?

545
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,129
Uh-uh.

546
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,714
Are you sure?

547
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,717
Right. Nothing left for us
to do here then, I suppose.

548
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,219
Except for figuring out
how six people were killed.

549
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,305
I'm thinking the
primary killer was Duncan.

550
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,598
Killing Maddie didn't satiate
his anger,

551
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,560
so he went after her clients
and probably got stabbed

552
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,103
when one of them
defended themselves.

553
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:35,022
I doubt it. More likely
the weapon was passed

554
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,106
from one person to the next

555
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,066
in a game of
murderous hot potato.

556
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,067
That's insane.

557
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:40,360
I know, right?

558
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,864
Totally insane and probably
exactly what happened.

559
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,949
I say this with huge
respect for the dead,

560
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:47,701
but this case is totally
gonna be a panel

561
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,119
at the next
forensic conference.

562
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:50,787
Okay. So based
on my preliminary

563
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,164
assessment of
the wounds,

564
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,083
it looks like Duncan
came through the door,

565
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,336
attacked victim number two
with the same weapon

566
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:58,962
used to kill Maddie Howard.

567
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:02,007
But Duncan had ligature
marks on his neck,

568
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,258
like someone
strangled him

569
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,718
from behind with
a yoga strap.

570
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,595
Like... this, here.

571
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,929
- Oh.
- Right?

572
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,140
Which is when
he attacked

573
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,184
victim number three.

574
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,728
But victim number three
had defensive wounds

575
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,104
that matched skin flecks

576
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:18,023
under the fingernails
of number four,

577
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,441
so I'm thinking Duncan

578
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,068
dropped the knife...

579
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:24,696
Okay, number four
picked it up, right?

580
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:28,200
- ELLA: Attacked number three,
like this.
- LUCIFER: Mmm.

581
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,785
Right, and then
at some point,

582
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,495
number five
got involved.

583
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,081
And so on and so on,
until full yoga massacre.

584
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,999
Oh, that will be
what the panel's called,

585
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,250
Full Yoga Massacre

586
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,752
- 2016.
- LUCIFER: Very good.

587
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,921
Okay, so, say that all happened
like you just said it did,

588
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,339
which is crazy.

589
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,174
There are seven mats
and seven bodies.

590
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:45,592
Yeah. So?

591
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,344
So Duncan was the
pissed off landlord,

592
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:48,804
not the class attendee.

593
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,972
Subtract him,
we're missing one yogi.

594
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,307
Okay, well, all of
the bodies were situated

595
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:55,936
around these six mats--
the student mats.

596
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:01,400
So that could be
the teacher's mat, maybe.

597
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,860
The teacher must
have been here.

598
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:05,946
Get this.

599
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,823
Teacher training taught by

600
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,991
Jenson Glory himself.

601
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,244
I mean, his body's not
among the dead.

602
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,662
Could be our
missing victim.

603
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,705
Slash attacker.

604
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,085
CHLOE:
Guy's a piece of work.

605
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:23,338
Jenson Glory, his real
name is Jamie Ostrowski.

606
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,507
Soul Depot is the latest
in a long line of

607
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,342
failed fitness enterprises.

608
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,553
Glory has five fraud lawsuits,

609
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,972
two sexual harassment claims
working their way

610
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,014
through the court system.

611
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:34,975
Sexual harassment?

612
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,018
Yeah, former assistants.

613
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:39,229
Both beautiful young women,
like Maddie.

614
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:41,022
Oh, and look at the contract
that they sign

615
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,649
when students join Soul Depot.

616
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,943
"I surrender myself
to Soul Depot,

617
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,611
"body, mind and soul,

618
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,572
"and to the only true guru
of health and serenity,

619
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,699
Jenson Glory." Wow.

620
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:51,992
Pretty much a cult.

621
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,201
Think he brainwashed
his students

622
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,328
into a Jonestown
type thing?

623
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:56,830
Kind of a stretch, right?

624
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:58,498
That a yoga pun?

625
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,168
No. It's an honest question.

626
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:04,546
I mean, drinking cyanide juice
is one thing,

627
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,923
but a bunch of people
stabbing each other?

628
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,800
Totally insane!

629
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,386
A magic blade in Los Angeles

630
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:14,264
which belongs to
the Angel of Death?

631
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,600
Now, in the hands
of a yogi shyster

632
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:19,102
who's apparently touchy-feely
in more ways than one.

633
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,562
Okay, can we go back

634
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,230
to the Angel of Death?

635
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,815
Is he... uh,

636
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,275
is he another one of
your brothers?

637
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,027
Sister, actually.

638
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,738
The Angel of Death is a chick?

639
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,115
Yes, I sort of wish we were
back to talking in metaphors.

640
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,201
- LINDA: That makes two of us.
- LUCIFER: Because I do actually

641
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,244
have things that I'd like
to talk about, Doctor.

642
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,455
Oh. Oh, yes. I'm so sorry.

643
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,748
Yes. Please.

644
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:40,999
Right.

645
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,793
So, my mum asked me why
I care so much

646
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,045
about these people dying

647
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,923
and I'm not sure I know.

648
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,800
I mean, it's not like
I know them personally,

649
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,677
and Maze is right--

650
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,013
even without Azrael's blade,
humans are capricious.

651
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:56,640
(laughing):
Hell,

652
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,183
they're willing to
trade their souls

653
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,060
to lose unsightly
tummy fat, but...

654
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:02,729
So...
(sighs)

655
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,190
why should I feel bad?

656
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,483
Why should I feel responsible?

657
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:07,943
And... why

658
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,694
am I doing my
own therapy?

659
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,321
Lucifer, I'm sorry.

660
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:16,326
I'm trying to digest this
whole thing myself. And, well,

661
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:20,455
there is no listing in the DSM-5
for Azrael's Blade Anxiety.

662
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:21,540
- (phone buzzes)
- Oh.

663
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:22,707
Excuse me.

664
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,545
Ah,

665
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,506
the guru with the doo-doo juju
has been picked up.

666
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,925
So, I'm afraid that's all we've
got time for today.

667
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:37,347
Just... call me if you
need to reschedule.

668
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,475
I wasn't even
at the studio, actually.

669
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,644
That's not what
the schedule says.

670
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,771
May I have a tea?

671
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,023
Siberian ginseng
if you have it.

672
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:49,526
Well...

673
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:51,319
Hello, Richard Simmons.

674
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:52,404
Sorry I'm late.

675
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:53,989
Where's the knife?

676
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,575
Who is this tense man?

677
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:57,867
Okay,

678
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,411
back to the teacher
training class.

679
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,829
Can you prove that
you weren't there?

680
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,956
Of course, there's
a computer system--

681
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,874
all of the teachers have
to swipe a key card.

682
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,668
Even me. Check it.

683
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:08,378
So, where were you?

684
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:09,379
Home.

685
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,173
I missed the
last few classes, actually.

686
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,301
I've been... sick.

687
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:16,511
Obsessing over a
new toy, more like.

688
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:17,971
What are you talking about?

689
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,473
I'm talking about something
that's probably beckoning you

690
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:21,808
as we speak.

691
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,853
Whispering to you
to do terrible things.

692
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,230
Wretched, sinful deeds.

693
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,650
That-- that's true...

694
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,569
I-I want...

695
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,112
Go on, tell me. Tell
me what you want,

696
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:35,864
what you really,
really want.

697
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:37,157
I want...

698
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,661
a raspberry cream cheese muffin.

699
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,371
And-- and-and

700
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,123
to take this thing...

701
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:46,124
off!

702
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,542
- Oh, my...
- Oh.

703
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,002
Expecting twins, are we?

704
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,671
Hey, I backslid
a little bit, all right?

705
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:53,673
Carbs are the
Devil's spawn, man.

706
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,342
Don't blame your
weaknesses on me.

707
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:56,718
- Huh?
- Is that why you
didn't show up

708
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,720
to the class? Because
you gained weight?

709
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,348
Of course. No one's gonna
find their "home self"

710
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,933
from a guru who looks like he
ate all the furniture.

711
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,393
Well, I think I'd
rather be chubby

712
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,771
than a handsy dipstick
in a corset.

713
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,022
That's it.

714
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,191
I want my lawyer now.

715
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:12,901
Well, don't eat him.

716
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,528
♪♪

717
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,200
All right, listen,
we searched Glory's house,

718
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,243
his car,
his other car...

719
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,079
there is no blade.

720
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,789
We did find a safe
in the basement.

721
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,378
Pop-Tarts.

722
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,421
Which... you stole?

723
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,923
Ah, I figured
it's a win-win.

724
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,258
I'm saving the evil guru
from future fat,

725
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,218
and, you know,

726
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,136
Pop-Tarts.

727
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,224
Mr. Glory has a second
home in Ventura.

728
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:45,392
If you wouldn't mind.

729
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,851
Okay, we'll check it out,

730
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,769
but...

731
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,854
Luci, if he's the one
with the blade,

732
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,690
he's much more likely
to go on a killing spree

733
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:52,857
than to stash it.

734
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:55,819
(elevator bell dings)

735
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:04,661
(elevator bell dings)

736
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,957
Ah. Come back
for your processed pastries?

737
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:10,625
Ms. Lopez!

738
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,794
Well, this is
a surprise.

739
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,337
Have you found something new?

740
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,548
Oh, I found something all right.

741
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,342
Proof of Bigfoot?

742
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:20,969
Tread on the shoes
Duncan Watts was wearing

743
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,429
when he was found dead.

744
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:23,930
Tread that you showed me

745
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,932
at your super weirdo
hole in the ground.

746
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,811
They match, which means
that this case

747
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:30,812
and your favor

748
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,480
are connected.

749
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:33,940
Start talkin', dude.

750
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,613
Do you have something to do
with these murders?

751
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:42,449
(Sighs)

752
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,034
Come clean with me.

753
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,537
Or I can't keep this
a secret anymore.

754
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,748
You see, that's just it.

755
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,000
The last person
I came clean with

756
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,543
became a tad untethered.

757
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,795
Dude, I grew up in Detroit.

758
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,757
Look,
all I can tell you is

759
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:01,301
I'm dealing with a matter
of cosmic importance

760
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,179
and I ask you to indulge me
for just a little longer.

761
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:05,305
You mean have faith?

762
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,515
(scoffs)
Tomato, tomahto.

763
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,978
Well, I guess faith
isn't faith unless it's tested.

764
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:14,230
- (chuckles)
- Bring it in.

765
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,024
What? Oh.

766
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:19,652
(elevator bell dings)

767
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:23,865
- CHLOE: Ella.
- LUCIFER: Detective.

768
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:27,368
ELLA: Oh, um...
I was just...

769
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,370
uh, you see,

770
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,040
there's this, uh, store
that has really special...

771
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,041
soap.

772
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,876
And, you know,

773
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,045
but I should really
get going now and...

774
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,756
clean stuff with the soap.

775
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,925
- ELLA: Bye!
- LUCIFER: Enjoy your shower.

776
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,470
LUCIFER: So, um...

777
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:47,555
to what do I owe
this pleasure?

778
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,517
Jenson's home security system
shows video of him sleeping

779
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,894
during the murders,
so he wasn't lying about that.

780
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:55,021
We checked the key card system
at Soul Depot,

781
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,731
and guess who was
subbing for Jenson.

782
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,108
Corrina,
Maddie's co-manager.

783
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,027
Right, and where's
Corrina now?

784
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,988
We checked her house,
she wasn't there. Forensics confirms

785
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:05,365
that she didn't kill anyone
at Soul Depot,

786
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,325
so she's either running,
hiding or scared.

787
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:08,868
I put out a BOLO.

788
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,913
Yeah, I don't think Corrina's
the one running this time.

789
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,248
What?

790
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:14,833
Where are you going?

791
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,544

Anyone here yielding a
deadly, celestial blade?

799
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,485
Huh? Anyone?

800
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,155
Well, that'll be
a resounding yes.

801
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:51,661
I-- I don't know what happened.

802
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:54,831
I was in class
and Duncan barged in.

803
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:56,958
It was horrible.

804
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:59,210
All that killing...

805
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,838
and the knife was
on the ground.

806
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,756
It started calling you.

807
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,012
Did I do that?

808
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,263
Yes.

809
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,433
You got retribution
for a grudge, I believe.

810
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:16,936
But it wasn't an
insignificant grudge, was it?

811
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,397
Did he harass you
like the others?

812
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,152
Or was it worse
than that?

813
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,029
Years ago.

814
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,324
We were alone
in the studio.

815
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,411
I-I-- I said no.

816
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,080
I swear, but he
wouldn't stop.

817
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,500
I-I... I tried to forget. I...

818
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,711
You tried to bury it deep,
get on with your life.

819
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,297
You might have
succeeded, if not for...

820
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:45,548
(sighs)

821
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:46,841
...the blade.

822
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,177
LAPD, hands in the air.

823
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:51,012
DAN: Move away from
the body, Corinna.

824
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,306
- Now!
- I... I-I killed him.

825
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:54,390
I-I did this. I...

826
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,517
Acted in self-defense.

827
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:59,854
Mr. Glory attacked Corrina
first. She had no choice

828
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,856
but to wield that
knife, Detective.

829
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:04,943
I think, in this case, justice
has actually been served.

830
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,115
Henderson, take her statement.

831
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:12,951
Come with me.

832
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,287
Where's the
murder weapon?

833
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,289
What?

834
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,375
Unis shouldn't have bagged
it without taking photos.

835
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,001
They couldn't help themselves.

836
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:24,212
Anyone else feeling
a murderous urge?

837
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:27,674
No? The need to slice and dice?

838
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:29,175
Anyone?

839
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,260
Oh, God.

840
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,977
Oh, no.

841
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:46,275
Detective Douche...
Daniel. Dan.

842
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,695
Why don't you
put down the knife, hmm?

843
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,530
Bury the proverbial hatchet
and all that?

844
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:53,157
I mean, I know we've had our
differences in the past, but

845
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,742
we're friends now, right?

846
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,625
You ruined my marriage.

847
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:06,671
I'll take that as a no.

848
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:13,511
My life went to hell
when I met you!

849
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,263
Hey! Well, technically, that's
not true, but I understand

850
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:16,514
the basic metaphor.

851
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:17,807
(yells)

852
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,769
Easy with the blade,
Detective.

853
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:24,605
One deep cut, and yours truly
could be wiped from existence.

854
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:26,232
Prayers answered.

855
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:28,026
- (yells)
- (slices)

856
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:29,986
What...

857
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,447
Okay, Detective,

858
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,992
I can assure you your current
mood will be rectified

859
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,453
by simply putting down
the knife.

860
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:41,956
My entire life imploded
because of you.

861
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:43,458
- What?
- My marriage!

862
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:44,500
(grunts)

863
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:45,752
My job.

864
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:48,004
My snacks.

865
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,005
What?

866
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,965
I know you ate my pudding.

867
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:52,300
(grunts)

868
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:54,052
You're really
going to smite me

869
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,012
over a tub of sweetened goo?

870
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,555
(yells)

871
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:00,141
You're damn right I am.

872
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,436
Dan... Dan.

873
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,938
Recent friend.
Growing compatriot.

874
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:08,316
Your marriage
was already on the rocks.

875
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:11,527
You started cutting procedural
corners way before I arrived,

876
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:12,570
and as for your pudding...

877
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:15,364
(exclaims)
As for your pudding, I...

878
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:16,824
Okay, yes.

879
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,118
I sometimes lay waste
to the precinct fridge.

880
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:20,328
But have mercy, Daniel.

881
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,121
How was I supposed
to know it was yours?

882
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,665
Because it was labeled!

883
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:33,508
You're fighting the blade,
which indicates a strength

884
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:36,844
I didn't know you had.

Your marriage.

887
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,226

00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:46,312
No.

No.

Chloe even met you.

891
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:52,401
And your career?

892
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,488

00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,285

is that the truth?
