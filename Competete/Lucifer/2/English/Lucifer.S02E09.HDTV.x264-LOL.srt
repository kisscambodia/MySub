1
00:00:01,187 --> 00:00:02,637
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:04,445
I was worried I'd never see you again.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,605
I've had patients who revealed a new side

4
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:08,808
of themselves, but not so much

5
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:10,876
the actual devil.

6
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:12,847
- We're good, right?
- Yeah. Really good.

7
00:00:12,872 --> 00:00:14,680
We could be there for each other as friends

8
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:16,148
even if it's about another guy.

9
00:00:16,154 --> 00:00:17,116
What is she doing here?

10
00:00:17,122 --> 00:00:19,051
Charlotte Richards, the defense attorney.

11
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:21,287
Thought I'd dive into my employment.

12
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:22,721
Humans are dying because of you.

13
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:24,523
I'm stronger than you'd think.

14
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:27,059
You seem attached to these creatures,

15
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:29,495
and I can't figure out why.

16
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:31,397
We shouldn't be here!

17
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:35,201
The only place I've ever
felt wanted or respected.

18
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:36,836
Is here with humanity?

19
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:38,846
This is my home!

20
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:40,076
Deal with it, Mother!

21
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:55,521
Sunshine. Beautiful people.

22
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:57,099
Expensive cars.

23
00:00:57,124 --> 00:01:00,632
The glamorous life.
Get ready to see the real

24
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:02,995
Los Angeles on this thrill

25
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:04,163
ride tour.

26
00:01:04,169 --> 00:01:05,831
Well, it appears I've been misled.

27
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:07,533
Whoever put together this brochure

28
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:09,301
should get special treatment in Hell.

29
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:11,770
I don't need you to show
me around the city.

30
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,405
Well, of course you do.

31
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,407
This is an exciting time, brother!

32
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:17,351
Now that we're making
Los Angeles our home,

33
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:19,572
the City of Angels can
finally earn its name.

34
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:21,714
You are making it a home.

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,416
Mom and I are gonna find a way
to get back to the Silver City.

36
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:26,685
- One way or another.
- But why?

37
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,471
When Los Angeles has so much to offer?

38
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:30,789
On your right,

39
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:32,375
you'll see the famous shop,

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,828
Pooch Pouch, the store that sells purses

41
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:38,030
for purse-sized dogs.

42
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:40,466
Clearly.

43
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:42,301
- Don't get it confused with the store
- Excuse me. Sorry.

44
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:43,669
that sells dogs in the shapes of purses.

45
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:45,204
Sorry, I do apologize.

46
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,206
- That's on your left...
- Pardon me, excuse me.

47
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:48,874
Yeah, thank you.

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,209
Please. That's your corner.

49
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:53,145
Ah. Right. Forget everything

50
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:54,313
you just slept through.

51
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,848
Welcome to Los Angeles,

52
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:58,183
city of reinvention, where you can become

53
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:00,052
whomever you want.

54
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:01,754
Uh, if we look over here...

55
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,822
That humungous house in
the distance, the owner,

56
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:06,892
he moved out here with just
ten dollars and a dream.

57
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:08,327
Within three years, he was running

58
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,663
the largest underground
sex club in the country.

59
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,465
Los Angeles is also a place
where you can do

60
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:15,868
whatever you want.
To your right hand side over here,

61
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:18,537
this folically challenged man...
That's Sleepy Pete. Hello, Pete.

62
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:19,905
Give us a wave.

63
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:20,940
Everyone wave at Pete.

64
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:25,678
He will sell you the
best Molly in the city.

65
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,301
Don't buy his cocaine, though.

66
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:30,440
It's got enough baking
soda in it to make a cake.

67
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:33,018
It's not a bad idea, as I think about it.

68
00:02:33,024 --> 00:02:36,288
To your right again... My nightclub, Lux!

69
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:38,724
The city's crowning achievement.

70
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,097
My brother and I are celebrating...

71
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:48,100
I don't understand him.

72
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:51,103
Why won't Amenadiel embrace
this city like I have?

73
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:54,239
Well, people often need time
to adjust to change.

74
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:56,308
And he's only been here for a few months.

75
00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:57,676
And if what you say is true...

76
00:02:57,682 --> 00:02:59,912
What? That he's got a
stick so far up his ass

77
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,256
you can see it when he yawns?

78
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,148
That he's a fallen angel.

79
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:04,683
Oh, yes, that, too.

80
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:07,620
Then this could be about more
than finding a home for him.

81
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:09,254
But we're here to talk about you.

82
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,591
Why did you recently decide
that this was your home?

83
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:15,694
Well, I said it when I was
in a row with my mum.

84
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,808
I didn't realize how true it was
until I yelled it in her face.

85
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,995
Yes, your mother,

86
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,235
who is a literal goddess of all creation.

87
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:25,504
Still haven't quite wrapped
my brain around that one.

88
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,139
Yes, well, anyway, her and Amenadiel want

89
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:31,374
to get back to the Silver City,
but it's not my home.

90
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,277
It never was.

91
00:03:32,283 --> 00:03:33,579
And neither was Hell.

92
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:35,080
No. No, that was somewhere

93
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:36,582
I was sent as a punishment.

94
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:38,984
Like the DMV, but less screaming.

95
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,154
So would you say that
this is your first home?

96
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,889
Yes, I suppose it is.

97
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:45,591
And why do you think that's the case?

98
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:48,447
Well, I don't know, Doctor. You tell me.

99
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:49,662
I find that people

100
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:52,998
make Los Angeles their home
for one of two reasons.

101
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:55,067
Either they're running from something,

102
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:57,369
or looking for something.

103
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,904
Oh, and which one are you?

104
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,773
I'm not the one on the couch, Lucifer.

105
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:03,509
So ask yourself...

106
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:05,611
Which is it?

107
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:07,913
Running or looking?

108
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,716
Lucifer? Lucifer?!

109
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:12,718
Get out of the chair.

110
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,053
Oh, come on, Detective.

111
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:16,388
It's been ages since
I've sat in a throne.

112
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:18,657
Oh, there's a lot of personality
here, isn't there?

113
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:20,325
Appalling personality,

114
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:22,061
but quantity over quality, I suppose.

115
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:26,765
Genuine Medieval knights
costume in a Bel Air mansion?

116
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:29,034
This man's home definitely
was his castle.

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,336
Well, it couldn't keep him
safe from invaders.

118
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:34,110
Crime scene. Let's go.

119
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:37,643
Hang on.

120
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,579
That's Dean Cooper, the
Los Angeles real-estate tycoon!

121
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:41,880
Yeah, owns the whole block,

122
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:44,149
and most of the biggest
developments in the city.

123
00:04:44,155 --> 00:04:46,085
Including the entire
block that Lux is on.

124
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:47,219
Deeply unpleasant man.

125
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:49,054
You wouldn't believe the deal I had

126
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,556
to strike for my lease.

127
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:52,157
All completely legal.

128
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:55,694
If somewhat, well,
let's say "morally ambiguous."

129
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,230
Well, that moral ambiguity
that he was so famous for

130
00:04:58,236 --> 00:04:59,898
may have finally caught up with him.

131
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:01,400
Ella, cause of death?

132
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:04,570
Explosive exsanguination from

133
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:06,305
the carotid, punctured

134
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:10,075
by this.

135
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,643
Like from a champagne flute.

136
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:14,113
Mm-hmm. Someone really popped his cork.

137
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:17,216
You know like...

138
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:19,051
You guys, like, the blood's the champagne.

139
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:21,453
Like when you open a bottle,
his neck was the...

140
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:22,488
We got it.

141
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:24,256
Did you get any prints?

142
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:25,724
Killer wiped it clean.

143
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,192
Okay, well,

144
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:28,694
maybe he didn't wipe the glass clean

145
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,362
before it broke. Ella, are any of

146
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:32,998
these pieces here big enough
to get a partial from?

147
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:34,967
Probably not.

148
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:39,260
But, hey, someone invented
glue for a reason. Right?

149
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:41,221
You're going to reassemble
all those pieces?

150
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:43,375
I'm fairly certain there are
people in Hell being forced

151
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:45,410
- to do exactly that right now.
- Oh, I was the kind

152
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,846
of kid who did jigsaw
puzzles picture-side down.

153
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,915
- That's fascinating.
- Mm.

154
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:51,283
Oh.

155
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:52,651
What's wrong?

156
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:54,753
Maze. Problem at Lux.

157
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,922
Problem? What? One of the
Brittanies stub her toe?

158
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:58,590
You're leaving?

159
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:00,692
Lucifer, Cooper was one
of the most hated men

160
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:03,128
in the city. We have tons
of suspects to go over.

161
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:04,763
And if I don't get there soon,

162
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:07,299
Maze will undoubtedly fix the
problem herself, which usually

163
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:08,500
- involves knives.
- But...

164
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:09,535
So unless you want to be blamed

165
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,275
for a four-toed Brittany...

166
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:22,447
Uh... hello?

167
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:23,882
We're closed.

168
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:26,852
Hi, okay, we've got some anomalies here,

169
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:29,188
especially with the quarterlies...

170
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:31,256
Maze, did you forget

171
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,365
to bribe the inspectors this month?

172
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,294
Are you the proprietor?

173
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,129
I am, yes.

174
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:39,965
And who are you, lounging
around like you own the place?

175
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:42,334
Oh, I actually do own the place.

176
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,204
Lucifer Morningstar,

177
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,943
you're being evicted.

178
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:55,199
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

179
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:02,228
All right, explain what you
mean by "evicted,"

180
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:04,631
and do it carefully as
your life may depend on it.

181
00:07:04,637 --> 00:07:07,467
Okay, Mr. Morningstar.
My name is Eric Cooper.

182
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:10,203
I've assumed all of Cooper's holding

183
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,272
and assets, Lux among them.

184
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:14,707
You're Dean Cooper's son.

185
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:17,410
Your father was just brutally
murdered, and here you

186
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,345
scant hours after you were notified,

187
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:20,880
divvying up the spoils.

188
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:23,783
I don't know whether to
be horrified or impressed.

189
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,953
What happened to my
father was unfortunate.

190
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,929
Yes.

191
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:30,957
But business is business.

192
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:34,460
Well, impressed it is.

193
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,363
Your father and I made a
deal for me to live here,

194
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:39,299
so I'm sure you and I can
come to some agreement.

195
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:43,436
Tell me, Eric, what is it you desire?

196
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:48,009
I want my father to turn
over in his grave.

197
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,109
Hated the old man, eh?

198
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:51,200
Well, I can relate to that.

199
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:53,046
My father's not on my
Christmas card list either.

200
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:56,216
In fact, I moved here
to get away from him.

201
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:58,218
Surely you can understand that.

202
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:01,354
No, not really.

203
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,023
And I saw your "lease"...

204
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:07,427
It was written in lipstick
on a stripper's thong.

205
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:10,663
- Not exactly legally binding.
- Hm.

206
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,398
Well, maybe we can write
the new one in blood.

207
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:13,900
I find that to be quite binding.

208
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:15,468
Let's not.

209
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:17,237
You have no legal right to be here,

210
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:18,972
so if you don't vacate,

211
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:20,073
I'll have you removed.

212
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:23,943
It's not that easy to remove me.

213
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:25,478
Last time, it took the power of God.

214
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,972
What do you have... A few
expensive lawyers?

215
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:30,283
Or are you gonna do it yourself?

216
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,189
Not in front of all of these humans.

217
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:36,556
If I were you, I'd leave.

218
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:37,991
That's fine.

219
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:40,297
This is a police matter now.

220
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:43,596
Let's go.

221
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:45,665
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go, man.

222
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:47,901
It's not like you to get in the way

223
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,402
of a good eviscerating, Maze.

224
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:50,297
What was that about?

225
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:53,306
You'd be eviscerating the wrong person.

226
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:54,440
This is your mother's doing.

227
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:57,176
Mum? How?

228
00:08:57,182 --> 00:09:00,113
You told her you want to
stay here on Earth.

229
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:03,082
Now someone's trying to
take Lux away from you.

230
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:04,317
Don't be absurd, Maze.

231
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:06,586
I just saw American Psycho's father.

232
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:09,055
The man wasn't destroyed
by the Goddess of Creation.

233
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:11,424
He was killed in a fit of human passion.

234
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,726
But that greasy weasel might be right.

235
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:15,662
This is a police matter. Lucky me.

236
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:16,863
Don't act like your mother

237
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:18,665
isn't capable of this, Lucifer.

238
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:21,100
Ah, that's enough help from
you today Maze, thank you.

239
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,835
All right, fine.

240
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:25,705
You can't see it,
I'll find someone who will.

241
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:27,540
I don't see it.

242
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:29,676
Of course you don't.

243
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:32,345
So after you said you'd "handle things,"

244
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:34,247
you're hiding behind her skirt again?

245
00:09:34,253 --> 00:09:36,115
I am handling things, Maze.

246
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,951
Mom and I are trying to
find a way back home.

247
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:39,686
So why would she murder some human?

248
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:40,753
That woman is

249
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,890
dangerous, duplicitous...

250
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:46,263
And she's standing right
behind me, isn't she?

251
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:48,728
Pardon my interruption,

252
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,596
but what am I being blamed for now?

253
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:52,065
I know what you're doing,

254
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:54,500
trying to take away
Lucifer's home on Earth,

255
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,736
so he can help you get back

256
00:09:56,742 --> 00:09:58,338
to the Silver City.

257
00:09:58,344 --> 00:09:59,639
It won't work.

258
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:01,074
The demon is talking,

259
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,709
but not making any sense.

260
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,377
Typical, I suppose.

261
00:10:04,383 --> 00:10:05,812
She thinks you killed the man

262
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:08,081
who owns Lux to get Lucifer evicted.

263
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,585
Mazikeen.

264
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:15,421
If I did come up with such a plan,

265
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:19,225
do you think it would be
you who figured it out?

266
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:21,260
Whatever you're up to,

267
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,166
I will find out.

268
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:32,205
Oh, she thinks she's smart.

269
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:34,407
Mom?

270
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:36,542
You weren't actually
involved in that man's death,

271
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,478
- right?
- Well, of course not.

272
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:42,482
But it might be able to
be used to our advantage.

273
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:47,053
Maybe Lucifer will agree
to come home with us now.

274
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,488
Right.

275
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:51,991
All my sons are important.

276
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:54,027
It isn't about Lucifer.

277
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,428
It's about our family.

278
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,830
I've already lost a son.

279
00:10:57,836 --> 00:11:01,601
I will not leave another one behind.

280
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,736
It doesn't matter, Mom.

281
00:11:03,742 --> 00:11:06,339
Lucifer loves that place.

282
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:08,041
And no human is gonna make him give it up

283
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:10,043
as long as it's still standing.

284
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:12,018
Is that so?

285
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,716
Careful...

286
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:29,362
And that is how we do it!

287
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:31,998
Ta' vonlu!

288
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:33,900
Ta' von what?

289
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:36,035
It's Klingon for "the king is trapped."

290
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,905
In Star Trek, they play
three-dimensional chess.

291
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:40,706
Okay.

292
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:44,043
And I'm gonna check this for prints now.

293
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,597
- Great.
- No problem.

294
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:46,950
Hey.

295
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:48,781
All our info on Dean Cooper.

296
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:51,584
No rap sheet, which,
quite frankly, is pretty amazing

297
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,086
considering his reputation.

298
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:54,520
Great. Thank you.

299
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:57,056
Hey, are you busy?
I could use an assist on this case.

300
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:58,391
Nah, Vice has me wrapped up

301
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:00,359
on a bomb-making case.
I got to rush back.

302
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:01,894
Where's Lucifer?

303
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,564
Something came up at his club.
I don't think he's coming back.

304
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,599
Oh, well, don't worry, Chloe.
He never stays away

305
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:08,396
for too long, right?

306
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:09,569
Hmm?

307
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,404
Huh.

308
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,872
Hey, Lucifer. So, did you splint

309
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:15,575
the stubbed toe, or did you
kiss it and make it better?

310
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:18,954
Well, that's an interesting theory,
but we don't have any evidence

311
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:20,446
that Eric Cooper's the killer.

312
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:23,116
Mm, actually we do.

313
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,502
Prints just came back.

314
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,823
Eric Cooper.

315
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,021
How did you...?

316
00:12:29,027 --> 00:12:32,758
Never mind. I'll meet you
at the Cooper building.

317
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:41,368
So wonderful that you agree
with me for a change, Detective.

318
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,635
Perhaps you're getting smarter.

319
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:43,636
I don't agree with you.

320
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:45,304
I have actual evidence on Eric Cooper

321
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,339
that I need to look into.

322
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:47,974
- What do you have?
- Motive.

323
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,709
Little shark liquidated his father

324
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:51,477
so he could liquidate his assets.

325
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,146
How do you know he's liquidating assets?

326
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:54,881
Because he's trying to evict me from Lux

327
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:56,949
and sell off the building.

328
00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:58,718
You're saying that Dean Cooper's son

329
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:00,286
is making deals just an hour

330
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:02,255
- after his father was found dead?
- Exactly.

331
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:05,024
- What could be more suspicious?
- Hey.

332
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,119
When were you gonna mention that you're

333
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:07,734
personally involved in the case?

334
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,028
When you asked me.

335
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:09,946
Nope.

336
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,797
This an extremely high profile case.

337
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:12,965
We are doing this by the book.

338
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:14,400
I cannot have you terrorizing him.

339
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:15,768
I would never.

340
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:17,503
Or threatening to tear his arms off.

341
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:18,871
That happened one time.

342
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:19,972
Or hanging him from a window.

343
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:21,638
I solemnly promise that the man's feet

344
00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:23,062
will remain firmly on the ground.

345
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:28,614
What's that?

346
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,416
Somebody call an ambulance...

347
00:13:30,422 --> 00:13:31,617
Check this out.

348
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:33,553
There's a guy on the car!

349
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:36,689
Is he alive?

350
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,560
That's Eric Cooper.

351
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:43,333
Just to be clear, that wasn't me.

352
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:56,394
I mean, who leaps from the seventh floor?

353
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,392
13th, minimum. This is the man
forcing me from my home,

354
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:01,227
he can't even make a proper suicide jump.

355
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,716
- Lucifer.
- Is this really necessary?

356
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,698
Well, witnesses saw him
jump off a balcony

357
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:07,066
by his own free will.

358
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,006
He was distraught.

359
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:09,536
That doesn't make him a killer.

360
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,489
Well, it points to a guilty conscience.

361
00:14:11,514 --> 00:14:13,540
Christi, I know this might
be hard to hear, but...

362
00:14:13,546 --> 00:14:16,109
we have evidence that Eric
was in his father's house

363
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:17,243
before he died.

364
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:18,711
We live in the same compound.

365
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:21,381
I'm sure there's DNA or
whatever all over the house.

366
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:24,651
You can't actually think that
he killed his own father.

367
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,453
Well, I mean...

368
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:27,487
Let's not forget

369
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:28,888
Eric's insatiable lust

370
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:30,623
for Daddy's cold hard cash.

371
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,459
If he's willing to do
something as monstrous

372
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:33,493
as turning me out of my house,

373
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:34,928
then killing his father

374
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:36,596
isn't such a stretch, is it?

375
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:38,164
Ooh!

376
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,933
My Left Foot's trying to speak.

377
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:40,934
N-No...

378
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,202
money.

379
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,670
Shh, baby.

380
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:44,838
Don't talk.

381
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:46,239
What are you trying to say, Eric?

382
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:47,507
Dad...

383
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,713
ran the business into the ground.

384
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,078
We were buried in debt.

385
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,880
I thought making emergency sales

386
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:55,582
could save us, but...

387
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,584
But what, baby?

388
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,853
There's nothing left.

389
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,120
I'm sorry, I...

390
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:03,089
I couldn't live with disappointing you.

391
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:04,724
Well, if this is about money,

392
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,994
you should have called me first,
before taking that swan dive.

393
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,629
Perhaps you'd like to renegotiate now?

394
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:10,630
I can't.

395
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:11,703
The deal is made.

396
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:13,700
How could a sale be made so fast?

397
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:15,368
Dean Cooper died yesterday.

398
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,437
Is this that deal for all
the property on the strip?

399
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:21,207
There's been a buyer
interested in that for years.

400
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,009
Eric's dad had it all drawn up and then

401
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:24,410
just let it sit on his desk.

402
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,112
He just wanted to torture the buyer.

403
00:15:26,118 --> 00:15:28,348
So, you made the sale as
soon as you heard

404
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:29,716
your father was gone?

405
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:32,018
Dad couldn't block it anymore.

406
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:34,053
But it didn't matter.

407
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,055
It wasn't enough.

408
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,124
What we have is enough.

409
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,093
You and me.

410
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:42,128
We don't need money for that.

411
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:43,396
What a wonderful day.

412
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,999
Potentially homeless and
definitely nauseated.

413
00:15:46,005 --> 00:15:48,265
Well, whoever bought Lux stood to gain

414
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,003
from Dean Cooper's death.

415
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:51,871
Yes. This man,

416
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:53,673
the person who owns Lux now.
What's his name?

417
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,376
Her. It's Eleanor Bloom.

418
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:58,678
Detective, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

419
00:15:58,684 --> 00:16:00,113
I doubt it.

420
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,515
But let's go talk to Eleanor Bloom.

421
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:03,650
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

422
00:16:03,656 --> 00:16:05,151
Thank you.

423
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,820
Oh, God...

424
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,201
I think you're in the wrong place, lady.

425
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,804
- You're Kevin Burnick.
- I am.

426
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,840
Why? You come to take
a peek at the legend?

427
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:30,043
According to the docket,
one of your clients

428
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:31,844
is a known explosives expert

429
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,913
named Patrick O'Neil.

430
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,348
I need his help

431
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:37,617
to get my son to come back home with me.

432
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:40,353
You look hot and sound crazy,

433
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,455
which is totally my type.

434
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,525
But I don't talk about
my clients out of court.

435
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:46,993
It's a lawyer thing.

436
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,629
Oh, you misunderstand me.

437
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,064
I'm his lawyer now.

438
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,532
You can go home.

439
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:53,967
Look, lady.

440
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:55,768
I don't know what you've heard about me,

441
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:58,171
but when the K-Dog gets a bone,

442
00:16:58,177 --> 00:16:59,739
he doesn't let go.

443
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:01,674
Touch me, and I will sue you

444
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,042
so hard...

445
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,786
Oh...

446
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:20,320
So, you think I had something
to do with Dean Cooper's death?

447
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:23,129
Well, barely an hour after he was
killed, you closed on a deal

448
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:24,731
he'd been obstructing for years.

449
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:25,680
Sounds convenient.

450
00:17:25,705 --> 00:17:28,067
- Sounds like good business to me.
- Cooper intentionally

451
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:30,003
gave you businesswoman blue balls

452
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:31,471
just to torture you.

453
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:32,905
- It's rather cruel.
- And I bought

454
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:34,741
his favorite golf course
last year and turned it

455
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:36,609
into a landfill for medical waste.

456
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:38,177
Oh, I see. Well played.

457
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,279
So, you're saying this was all

458
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:41,141
a multi-million dollar prank war?

459
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:43,516
I'm saying I didn't kill him over a deal.

460
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:46,036
Besides, I just flew in from
Macau this afternoon.

461
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:47,987
Check with the airstrip.
You have any other questions,

462
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:49,355
you can ask my lawyer.

463
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,890
Not so fast, Mommy Warbucks.

464
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:52,558
I have some questions for you myself.

465
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:54,148
Lucifer, you promised
that you wouldn't...

466
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:55,695
Detective, this woman has my home.

467
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,530
If you're gonna give me some sob story...

468
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:58,831
Oh, far from it.

469
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:00,967
I know your type.
You don't respond to emotion,

470
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:02,435
or intimidation.

471
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:05,004
The only thing that gets
you going is a deal.

472
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,910
So, let's make a deal, shall we?

473
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,809
What do you desire?

474
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:11,548
Tell me and it's yours.

475
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:15,815
I want everything Dean Cooper has.

476
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:17,717
Well, Cooper owned Lux.

477
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,085
So, how about everything apart from that?

478
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:19,952
Everything.

479
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,689
All I want is what was his.

480
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:24,657
And then to destroy it.

481
00:18:24,663 --> 00:18:27,137
So, you're gonna tear
down all of his properties?

482
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:29,162
I'm a developer.
I'm gonna knock everything down

483
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:30,329
and then rebuild.

484
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:31,254
Even Lux?

485
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,579
Especially that place.

486
00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:34,000
That's prime real estate.

487
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:35,702
I'm gonna build a mega-mall.

488
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,803
A "mega-mall"?

489
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:38,413
Yeah, you know, Gymboree, Sunglass Hut...

490
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:40,707
Bulldozers get rolling as
soon as my people finish

491
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:41,974
emptying the buildings.

492
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,443
You know,

493
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:47,284
a murder investigation can tie
up a development for years.

494
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:50,183
I know you know more
than you're telling us.

495
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:52,324
So, if there is any way,

496
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:55,088
at all, that you can
help this investigation,

497
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:57,356
that would be wonderful.

498
00:18:57,362 --> 00:18:59,392
She's good.

499
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:01,414
I could use a few of her on my team.

500
00:19:02,468 --> 00:19:05,364
The accountants I had
looking over the deal

501
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,734
did find several unreported payments.

502
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,036
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

503
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,537
You don't hide money like that

504
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:13,276
unless you don't want anyone to find it.

505
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:20,947
Bloom was right.

506
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,149
Dean Cooper was making
large off-the-books payments

507
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:25,284
and hiding them from his company.

508
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,753
Well, could be anything.

509
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,221
Drugs, blackmail.

510
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:30,623
There's no shortage of bad
deeds in Dean Cooper's life.

511
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,959
I'm gonna try and trace
where these payments went.

512
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,694
Maybe our killer's on the other end.

513
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,854
Oh, delightful.

514
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,475
Whilst you do that, I'm gonna return

515
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:39,911
to Eleanor Bloom's office
and get my home back.

516
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,446
Not sure she's interested in selling.

517
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:43,247
Well, maybe she'll change her mind

518
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:45,932
after I turn her world into a
sphincter-loosening nightmare.

519
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:47,752
Ew. Lucifer.

520
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:49,676
I'm sorry about your home. I am.

521
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:51,841
But you have to promise me you're
not really gonna hurt this woman.

522
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:54,392
Well, then, help me,
Detective. Arrest her!

523
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:56,027
I mean, isn't contributing to homelessness

524
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:57,662
in Los Angeles a crime?

525
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:59,664
Lucifer, the law is on Bloom's side here.

526
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,066
I want to help you,
but we have to find a legal solution.

527
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:04,268
Okay. So I'm on my own, am I?

528
00:20:04,274 --> 00:20:05,340
That's not what I...

529
00:20:17,187 --> 00:20:21,152
We know you build bombs
for the mob, Patrick.

530
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:22,687
That's ridiculous.

531
00:20:22,693 --> 00:20:24,793
I... I deliver pizzas.

532
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:27,068
Yeah.

533
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,668
We cracked your code.

534
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,628
"Hoping to get a delivery

535
00:20:30,634 --> 00:20:32,463
at Slauson and La Brea tomorrow night.

536
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:35,633
Enough pepperoni to
feed a family of four."

537
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:38,036
The mafia, the cartels,

538
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:40,505
when they hear that we
have you in custody,

539
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:43,141
and they think for a second about your...

540
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:45,476
ingenious pizza code,

541
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:47,845
they're gonna want to keep you quiet.

542
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:49,080
So, uh...

543
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:50,982
you can help me out, right?

544
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:52,884
Depends.

545
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,020
Hmm! Hands off my client, Officer.

546
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,825
You're not his lawyer.

547
00:21:00,831 --> 00:21:02,827
The accused has a constitutional right

548
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,696
to be counseled by whomever they choose.

549
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:07,269
She can be my lawyer.

550
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:11,502
I understand your confusion.

551
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:13,137
You're very attractive.

552
00:21:13,143 --> 00:21:14,872
I've found that can also mean

553
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:16,678
you're not very intelligent.

554
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,901
I've already posted your bail.

555
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:32,916
No. Wait, wait, wait.
I-I can't afford that.

556
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:35,626
Oh, don't worry, I take payment in trade.

557
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:38,433
Is it true that you know
how to make bombs?

558
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:41,899
That's what I'm accused of.

559
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:43,101
Yeah?

560
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:45,670
Have you ever brought
down a building before?

561
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:47,939
I know how it's done.

562
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:53,014
I need you to destroy a nightclub for me.

563
00:21:57,655 --> 00:21:59,773
Let's get out of here, guys.

564
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:01,592
Hands off...

565
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:03,627
- my piano!
- Hey, man,

566
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:05,662
we're just doing a job.
We don't want any trouble.

567
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:07,631
You think you can come in
here and take apart my life

568
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:09,032
without any trouble?

569
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:10,825
You gentlemen

570
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,903
have no idea who you're
dealing with, do you?

571
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:14,304
Well...

572
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,174
let me show you.

573
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,373
This building was supposed to be empty.

574
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:51,141
Oh, you know Lucifer, Mom.

575
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:53,644
He wasn't gonna let this
place go without a fight.

576
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,312
Or a drink.

577
00:22:55,318 --> 00:22:56,947
This is what humans call

578
00:22:56,953 --> 00:22:58,215
a "sit-in."

579
00:22:58,221 --> 00:23:00,259
What are you doing here?

580
00:23:00,284 --> 00:23:02,552
Well, I was gonna blow
the building up with C4.

581
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:04,021
- Mom, you can't.
- I know.

582
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:05,756
My client is a coward.

583
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:08,421
And very difficult to convince
him to kill this many people.

584
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:11,128
- No, Mom, that's-that's not what I...
- I may be able to

585
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:12,567
use this to my advantage.

586
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:32,215
To what do I owe the honor

587
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:33,784
of your presence?

588
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,603
I disagree with you wholeheartedly

589
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:37,888
about wanting to stay here.

590
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,322
But a mother doesn't have to

591
00:23:39,328 --> 00:23:42,759
agree with her son in
order to support him.

592
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,728
So...

593
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:47,064
what is it exactly
I'm supposed to sit in?

594
00:23:48,204 --> 00:23:49,666
Mum.

595
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:51,435
You're actually being a good mum.

596
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:54,104
We may have our disagreements,

597
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,173
but you're still my son.

598
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:58,542
I don't want to lose you again.

599
00:23:59,782 --> 00:24:01,712
Oh! Doctor!

600
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:04,514
Mum, this is my therapist, Dr. Linda.

601
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,417
Doctor, this is my mom in
a disturbingly hot body.

602
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:08,252
Lucifer,

603
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:09,567
I'm sure that sounds strange

604
00:24:09,592 --> 00:24:11,221
to her human brain.

605
00:24:11,246 --> 00:24:13,645
Oh, no, don't worry, Mum,
Dr. Linda's had a crash-course

606
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:14,758
in celestial beings.

607
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:16,660
Only melted her brain for about a week.

608
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,129
Now, if you'll excuse me,

609
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:21,131
I have guests to get back to.

610
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:24,008
I'm sure you'll get on
like a house on fire.

611
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:36,079
So... you're, uh...

612
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:37,514
God's wife.

613
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,116
Ex-wife.

614
00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:40,083
Oh.

615
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:42,167
I prefer to not be defined by Him.

616
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:45,222
Oh, of course, of course.

617
00:24:45,228 --> 00:24:48,125
Well, I just want to say,

618
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:50,393
it's an honor to meet you.

619
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:53,330
Thank you for...

620
00:24:53,336 --> 00:24:58,072
for all of... this.

621
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:02,172
Existence.

622
00:25:02,178 --> 00:25:04,508
And I wanted to thank you

623
00:25:04,514 --> 00:25:06,743
for taking such good care of my son.

624
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:09,295
You're so welcome.

625
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:12,516
Our relationship must give
you a lot to talk about.

626
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:14,688
Mm.

627
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:19,960
I'm not telling you
anything about our sessions.

628
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:33,804
Simon Halbrooks, of Private
Investigative Solutions.

629
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,372
That's my company.

630
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:36,506
Built it myself.

631
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,276
Hmm. Dean Cooper made
several off-the-books

632
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:41,545
six-figure payments to
you in the last few weeks.

633
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:44,381
Those payments were off
of his books, not off mine.

634
00:25:44,387 --> 00:25:45,258
I'm legit.

635
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:46,716
What kind of legit business has clients

636
00:25:46,722 --> 00:25:48,118
hide their payments to you?

637
00:25:48,124 --> 00:25:50,382
Do you trust your fellow
officers, Detective?

638
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:51,382
Excuse me?

639
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:53,223
Do you know for sure they
wouldn't take a bribe?

640
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:55,192
Rat you out for the right price?

641
00:25:55,198 --> 00:25:57,794
How can you know who to trust?

642
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,629
I'm the guy who answers those questions.

643
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:00,986
And how do you do that?

644
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:04,734
Think of me as a professional tempter.

645
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,203
People hire me to find out

646
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:08,572
if their R&D guy would sell secrets.

647
00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:10,482
Or if a famous couple's nanny

648
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:13,410
could be bribed for
pictures of their kids.

649
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:15,912
So whose loyalty were you
testing at Cooper's company?

650
00:26:15,918 --> 00:26:17,351
That's privileged information.

651
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:22,628
I just thought you'd want
to know, we got calls

652
00:26:22,653 --> 00:26:24,387
about some kind of an
illegal party at Lux.

653
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:28,195
Oh... thanks.

654
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:44,140
Oh!

655
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:46,376
Stormtroopers have arrived, everyone.

656
00:26:46,382 --> 00:26:48,345
Don't worry,
I'll deal with the boys in blue.

657
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:50,525
You are the boys in blue, aren't you?

658
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,782
The strippers aren't due
for another hour.

659
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:57,287
Detective.

660
00:26:57,293 --> 00:26:58,889
What are you doing with them?

661
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:00,924
I know him. I'll handle this.

662
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,925
You sure, Detective?

663
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:03,426
I can reason with him.

664
00:27:03,432 --> 00:27:05,295
This doesn't need to be a scene, I got it.

665
00:27:05,301 --> 00:27:07,364
Okay, guys, let's go.

666
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,204
Thanks, guys.

667
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,411
Lucifer, what the hell were you thinking?

668
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:20,210
I...

669
00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:24,180
Turn the music back on,
this place is dead.

670
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:27,889
Well, you heard the lady.

671
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:28,852
Crank it up!

672
00:27:30,593 --> 00:27:32,656
Detective,

673
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:34,257
does that mean you're on my side now?

674
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:37,527
Lucifer, this is your home,
I've always been on your side.

675
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:38,895
Well,

676
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:40,497
if you're gonna stay, come on, stay.

677
00:27:40,503 --> 00:27:42,132
- No, I don't want to dance.
- No, no, no, come on.

678
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:43,566
- You're the guest of honor now.
- I don't want to...

679
00:27:43,572 --> 00:27:44,768
Come on!

680
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,720
He really does love this place, doesn't he?

681
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:04,888
Yeah.

682
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:06,690
This place.

683
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,040
My son was right about you, Doctor.

684
00:28:24,046 --> 00:28:25,241
You are

685
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:27,081
quite insightful.

686
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,341
You know, for a moment there,

687
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,510
you were actually having fun, Detective.

688
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,645
Ooh.

689
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,079
Obviously it was temporary insanity

690
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:44,349
as now you're back at work.

691
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,051
Well, as any parent knows the
best time to get things done

692
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:48,791
is when everyone else is asleep.

693
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,490
So, what have we got?

694
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,859
Well, I've been going
through these payments

695
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,228
to our professional tempter,
and none of them match up

696
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,464
to the timing of any of
Cooper's new hires.

697
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,601
I just can't figure out who
they were investigating.

698
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,204
Riveting, but I meant what
have we got to prevent my club

699
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,673
from being bulldozed into a Cinnabon?

700
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,410
Lucifer, I'm sorry but that
trick that I pulled last night

701
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,011
is only gonna work once.

702
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,414
I can't see another way to save this place.

703
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,450
Well, then, we need to
look harder, Detective.

704
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,018
This is about more than me.

705
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,521
I mean, do you know the
history of sin in this place?

706
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,722
It was a, an institution

707
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,191
decades before I ran it.

708
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,259
Th-that crack

709
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,527
in that mirror there.

710
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,995
That crack is still there

711
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,098
from when Ava Gardner threw a
scotch glass at Sinatra's head.

712
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,466
Hmm.

713
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,269
Underneath here there's
prohibition tunnels everywhere.

714
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,304
Howard Hughes used to use
them to sneak his mistresses

715
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,540
away from his other mistresses.

716
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,041
And that stool that you're sitting on,

717
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,676
that very stool, Detective,

718
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,144
this may disturb and titillate you...

719
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,946
We have to go see Simon Halbrooks again.

720
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,081
I think I know

721
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,516
- who he had Cooper looking into.
- Well, I'm sorry,

722
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:53,485
I can't leave Lux undefended.

723
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,120
Really?

724
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,259
Okay.

725
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,692
Eleanor Bloom's entire

726
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,428
moving crew is passed out on your floor.

727
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:07,165
The police aren't gonna be
here for at least another day.

728
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:10,035
Lux is fine.

729
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,504
I really need your help here.

730
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,073
Really?

731
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:28,587
You don't trust her, either, do you?

732
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,122
It's not what you think, Maze.

733
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,490
Listen, when I first came to Earth,

734
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,725
I made certain mistakes, all right?

735
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,337
I'm just making sure Mom
doesn't make the same ones.

736
00:30:36,343 --> 00:30:37,796
That's it. I'm protecting her.

737
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:40,784
Right.

738
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,569
She didn't tell you who she
was meeting, did she?

739
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:46,471
So who do you think it is, hmm?

740
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,006
An assassin?

741
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,308
A terrorist?

742
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,311
I'm quite sure it's no one so dramatic.

743
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,052
Oh...

744
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,721
I did not see that coming.

745
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:11,797
I saw a sadness in you.

746
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,498
A sadness and a strength.

747
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,000
Look, I know this is

748
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,501
forward of me but...

749
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,136
you want to grab a drink in my room?

750
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:22,274
I mean I probably shouldn't.

751
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,076
Oh, you definitely shouldn't.

752
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,444
I mean, I'm all for

753
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,045
examining your innermost desires,

754
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,514
but at least examine your options first.

755
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,849
Uh, hey, buddy.

756
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:31,990
I'm working here.

757
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,919
Indeed you are, in that it's literally

758
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,153
your job to seduce her,

759
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,388
and report back to her fiancée's

760
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,756
wealthy parents.

761
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,858
Or am I wrong?

762
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,194
Mm.

763
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,995
Oh, something I said?

764
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:46,365
You don't just tempt potential
employees, Simon.

765
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,034
You also go after potential spouses.

766
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,535
Dean Cooper's payments started

767
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,971
to you just after his son
got engaged to Christi.

768
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,577
Care to explain?

769
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:58,643
It's true.

770
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:00,746
Old Man Cooper didn't trust Christi.

771
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,280
She came from Nowheresville, Michigan,

772
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:04,486
where they put cars on blocks in yards.

773
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:06,184
So Dean Cooper thought she
was after his son's money,

774
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,720
and hired you to prove that
she was just a gold digger?

775
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:09,955
And I approached her.

776
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:13,258
Rented Bentley, fake Rolex,
the whole nine yards.

777
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,559
I laid it on thick.

778
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:15,861
And? Did she sleep with you?

779
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,529
She passed.

780
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,864
She stayed faithful.

781
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,899
What, you couldn't seduce
her with your fake Rolex?

782
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,734
Well, color me shocked.

783
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,936
Hey, man, my success rate is pretty high.

784
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:27,072
She was really in love with her fiancée.

785
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,526
It happens sometimes.

786
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:30,887
So if she didn't cheat, then what
happened with Dean Cooper?

787
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:32,377
I told the old man the truth.

788
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,045
But it didn't matter, he didn't like her.

789
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:36,283
Even if there was no
evidence of her cheating,

790
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:39,551
he wanted me to... make some.

791
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:40,719
"Make some?"

792
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,254
I photoshopped pictures of her

793
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,454
in some compromising positions.

794
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,058
What?

795
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:48,305
It was a lot of money.

796
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,228
So Dean Cooper tried to blackmail Christi

797
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,630
into breaking off her engagement

798
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,265
with fake proof of her cheating?

799
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,534
That's some serious motive for murder.

800
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,269
The poor girl was just trying to find

801
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,403
a place to belong.

802
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,572
And you, you vile insect,

803
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,174
took that away from her.

804
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,341
If you ask me, she killed the wrong man.

805
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:04,743
Lucifer, come on.

806
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:05,977
All right. Detective,

807
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,547
this man is a professional homewrecker!

808
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,681
And when it gets out, what he's done,

809
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:10,816
he will be out of business.

810
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,084
That will have to be punishment enough.

811
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,886
Please.

812
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,193
Very well, Detective.

813
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,197
I'm not gonna lie.

814
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,364
I was, um...

815
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,834
I was pretty surprised
when you called me.

816
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,402
Even more surprised

817
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,170
you actually invited me out.

818
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,273
You know, as soon as I walked
into that interrogation room,

819
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,446
I felt a spark between us.

820
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,246
Yeah?

821
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,714
Me, too.

822
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,416
I'm surprised you're still single.

823
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,456
Lucky me.

824
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,493
Look, I'm gonna be honest with you,

825
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:52,491
I've been a little bit gun-shy

826
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,959
about the whole dating thing.

827
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,794
You know, since my split.

828
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,296
No, I understand.

829
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:01,366
I went through a bad breakup, myself.

830
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,335
Honestly, I was in Hell

831
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:04,669
for what felt like forever.

832
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,444
I've only recently come back.

833
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,678
What happened with you two?

834
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,013
Was there someone else?

835
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,348
No, no.

836
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,383
No, nothing like that.

837
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,684
But...

838
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,790
But?

839
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,591
Well, there's this-this guy

840
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,460
that she spends a lot of time with.

841
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,296
And he definitely has
a thing for her, but I...

842
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,299
I mean, I don't know if
it's reciprocated, but...

843
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,406
- you know, I...
- Go on.

844
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,706
I think you were right, Maze.

845
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,643
They must be discussing
some evil, terrible plans.

846
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,977
And we must stop them.

847
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,813
No, let's let it play out.

848
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:49,652
Just to be safe.

849
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,154
Wow. You know,

850
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,890
I haven't really had anyone to...

851
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,992
talk about my ex with.

852
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,894
And it feels really good to get it out.

853
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,764
Yes, it certainly does clarify things.

854
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,699
Whoa, whoa, uh, wait,

855
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:08,700
I'm so sorry.

856
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,468
I, um,

857
00:35:10,474 --> 00:35:12,637
I totally over-shared, didn't I?

858
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,364
I...

859
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:15,707
I haven't done this in a while.

860
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,375
And...

861
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,511
I screwed it up.

862
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:23,285
Well, I suppose I do have some time and...

863
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:26,384
...you are fairly attractive.

864
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,525
What?

865
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,964
Oh...

866
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:43,119
Oh, that's a keeper.

867
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:45,437
Come on, let's go.

868
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,738
I know where he lives.

869
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,840
I'm not gonna go watch my
mother make out with Dan!

870
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,342
They're not gonna make out.

871
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,544
They're gonna...

872
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,946
I know what they're gonna go do, Maze!

873
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,982
Fine. I'll report back.

874
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,350
Maze, stop.

875
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,818
This is just a...

876
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,786
an innocent date.

877
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,154
An innocent date?

878
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,724
- With Chloe's ex?
- Yeah, they're colleagues.

879
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,158
She was in Hell for thousands of years,

880
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,184
and he's a good enough looking... guy.

881
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,895
Please don't make me
explain this any more.

882
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:14,703
But it is so
much fun to torture you.

883
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,235
Look,

884
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,070
I'm not gonna interfere with my mother

885
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,806
enjoying a little bit of happiness.

886
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,912
Please.

887
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,513
Fine.

888
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,548
It's not like I wanted to watch, anyway.

889
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:32,150
Even I have my limits.

890
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:54,005
It's me.

891
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,775
Forget the building,
I need a smaller charge.

892
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,314
For say, one person.

893
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:02,147
Don't worry about that.

894
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,753
I'm going to do this one myself.

895
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:22,486
Mr. Cooper, sorry to bother you.

896
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,040
We just have a few more questions.

897
00:37:24,046 --> 00:37:25,808
Can your fiancée vouch for
your whereabouts

898
00:37:25,814 --> 00:37:27,577
the morning your father was killed?

899
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:31,547
No, she was out looking for
a venue for the wedding.

900
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:32,481
Why?

901
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:34,116
- Well...
- What is this?

902
00:37:34,122 --> 00:37:36,219
I thought Eric had been
cleared of the charges.

903
00:37:36,225 --> 00:37:37,386
Oh, he has.

904
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:38,654
Because we now know that you're the one

905
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,274
who killed your father-in-law, Christi.

906
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,123
What?

907
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:42,925
Eric's father created fake evidence

908
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:45,428
that you were cheating and tried
to blackmail you into leaving.

909
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:46,495
And then he had

910
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:49,265
a little champagne toast
to evil while he did it.

911
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:51,312
No wonder you wanted to
jam it down his throat.

912
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:52,134
I...

913
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,603
No.

914
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:54,808
No, I did it.

915
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:57,173
My father, he-he showed me the evidence

916
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:59,842
and I knew it was fake.

917
00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:01,711
Christi would never...

918
00:38:01,717 --> 00:38:04,180
And-and the fact that he would...

919
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:07,383
stoop so low, I couldn't help myself.

920
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:08,784
I flew into a rage.

921
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,453
Well, if that's the case,

922
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:12,088
Eric Cooper, you're under arrest...

923
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:13,260
No!

924
00:38:14,496 --> 00:38:16,592
It was me. It happened

925
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:17,793
all like you said.

926
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:19,028
Christi...

927
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:20,963
I'm-I'm the one who did it, not Eric.

928
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:22,031
I think he did it.

929
00:38:22,037 --> 00:38:23,966
You two realize that if
you confess to this crime,

930
00:38:23,972 --> 00:38:25,839
there's a good chance
you both will go to jail?

931
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,205
Whatever we face,

932
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:31,574
we face together.

933
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,154
I don't understand.

934
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,902
The one of you who didn't do it,
you'll lose everything.

935
00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:40,887
No, we won't.

936
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,859
No one was willing to stand next to you

937
00:38:49,865 --> 00:38:51,260
in front of the bulldozers?

938
00:38:51,266 --> 00:38:53,696
No.

939
00:38:53,702 --> 00:38:55,331
No, I sent everybody home.

940
00:38:56,605 --> 00:38:59,869
Thought I'd say my good-byes on my own.

941
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,804
Good-byes?

942
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,050
I thought you were gonna
fight for this place.

943
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,475
Well, it occurred to me that

944
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:08,678
much as I love this place, uh,

945
00:39:08,684 --> 00:39:11,447
I can always build a new one.

946
00:39:11,472 --> 00:39:13,792
I mean, it wasn't the walls
that made it my home.

947
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:15,851
The people.

948
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:16,852
Yes.

949
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:18,487
Well, the women.

950
00:39:18,493 --> 00:39:21,157
But they'll flock to any new
place I go to, so...

951
00:39:21,163 --> 00:39:22,291
Hmm.

952
00:39:22,297 --> 00:39:27,300
Well, that makes this
sort of anticlimactic.

953
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,099
But Lux has been named

954
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:33,102
a Heritage Site by Los Angeles County.

955
00:39:33,108 --> 00:39:34,070
Detective, is this...

956
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:35,871
I had a friend in the city council

957
00:39:35,877 --> 00:39:36,872
push it through.

958
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:38,107
And I used your, uh,

959
00:39:38,113 --> 00:39:40,076
little history lesson as inspiration.

960
00:39:40,082 --> 00:39:41,844
Lux is protected now.

961
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,680
It can't be demolished for development.

962
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:47,083
Detective, you...

963
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:51,424
you saved my home.

964
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:53,856
Well, you'd still have to buy it back

965
00:39:53,862 --> 00:39:56,559
from Eleanor Bloom,
I'm sure well above market price.

966
00:39:56,565 --> 00:39:58,794
But...

967
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,829
you can afford it.

968
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:04,500
I...

969
00:40:04,506 --> 00:40:06,369
I-I mean, I simply don't
know what to say.

970
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,104
I'm-I'm normally the one
doing the favors.

971
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,006
And for a price.

972
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:12,278
Friends help each other out.

973
00:40:15,017 --> 00:40:16,012
Yeah, well,

974
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:18,414
let me at least buy you dinner tonight.

975
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,415
To celebrate.

976
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:21,417
I know this amazing steakhouse

977
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:23,619
and-and the chef's an absolute
artist in the kitchen.

978
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:24,954
I mean, he's also a degenerate gambler

979
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,059
and owes me a favor.

980
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:28,691
Otherwise, you'll just go home

981
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:30,450
and eat one of those poisonous sandwiches

982
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:32,228
you get from the vending machine at work.

983
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:34,730
Come on, Detective.

984
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:36,536
Friends help each other out.

985
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:39,101
She saved Lux.

986
00:40:39,107 --> 00:40:41,137
No strings attached.

987
00:40:41,143 --> 00:40:43,139
I-I didn't even ask.

988
00:40:43,145 --> 00:40:44,607
Well, Chloe saw that your home

989
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:46,909
is a very important place to you.

990
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:48,978
Does it really surprise you

991
00:40:48,984 --> 00:40:50,911
that she'd want to help you protect it?

992
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:52,314
Well, I...

993
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,649
People make gestures like that

994
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:54,950
all the time.

995
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:57,653
You just saw two people
go to jail for each other.

996
00:40:57,659 --> 00:40:59,622
But those people were clearly insane.

997
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:01,426
Now their home is a jail cell.

998
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:04,827
You realized earlier that "home"
meant more to you than Lux.

999
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,262
That you could lose Lux

1000
00:41:06,268 --> 00:41:07,730
and still have a place here.

1001
00:41:07,736 --> 00:41:09,398
Because Los Angeles is my home.

1002
00:41:09,404 --> 00:41:10,666
Lux or no.

1003
00:41:10,672 --> 00:41:13,469
Are you sure that's what
you were really looking for?

1004
00:41:13,475 --> 00:41:15,571
Well, what else would it be?

1005
00:41:15,577 --> 00:41:16,972
Something occurred to me

1006
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:18,307
when you introduced me to your mother.

1007
00:41:18,313 --> 00:41:19,942
Why is it that

1008
00:41:19,948 --> 00:41:21,710
I'm the only human in your life

1009
00:41:21,716 --> 00:41:23,712
who knows who you really are?

1010
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:25,481
Because you asked me, remember?

1011
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:27,249
You insisted that I show you.

1012
00:41:27,255 --> 00:41:30,152
Detective Decker has
asked you many times.

1013
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:31,620
And I always tell her the truth.

1014
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:33,456
But you know she doesn't believe you.

1015
00:41:33,462 --> 00:41:35,191
You could show her

1016
00:41:35,197 --> 00:41:37,460
your true face,

1017
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:38,932
but you don't.

1018
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:42,235
Why is that?

1019
00:41:44,206 --> 00:41:45,835
Do you think it's because

1020
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:48,037
you might be afraid

1021
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:49,505
of how she might react?

1022
00:41:49,511 --> 00:41:51,440
Because you care

1023
00:41:51,446 --> 00:41:53,876
that much about what she thinks of you?

1024
00:41:53,882 --> 00:41:55,478
No, I-I-I'm sorry.

1025
00:41:55,484 --> 00:41:56,879
Doctor, I don't really understand

1026
00:41:56,885 --> 00:41:58,080
where you're going with this.

1027
00:41:58,086 --> 00:42:00,683
I think you did come to Los Angeles

1028
00:42:00,689 --> 00:42:02,151
looking for something.

1029
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:05,087
But I also think you've stopped.

1030
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:08,094
Because maybe you've found it.

1031
