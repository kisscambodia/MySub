1
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:04,214
<i>- Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- I was worried
I'd never see you again.

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,716
I've had patients who
revealed a new side

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,468
of themselves,
but not so much

4
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:10,595
the actual devil.

5
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:12,597
- We're good, right?
- Yeah. Really good.

6
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:14,432
We could be there for
each other as friends

7
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,809
even if it's about
another guy.

8
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:16,851
What is she doing here?

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,812
Charlotte Richards,
the defense attorney.

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,939
Thought I'd dive
into my employment.

11
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:22,482
Humans are dying because of you.

12
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:24,317
MOM:
<i>I'm stronger than you'd think.</i>

13
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:26,695
<i>You seem attached
to these creatures,</i>

14
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:29,155
and I can't figure out why.

15
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:31,157
We shouldn't be here!

16
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:34,869
The only place I've ever felt
wanted or respected.

17
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,496
Is here with humanity?

18
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:38,415
This is my home!

19
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:39,708
Deal with it, Mother!

20
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:44,045
♪ Oh, oh ♪

21
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:47,590

MALE TOUR GUIDE (over P.A.):
Sunshine. Beautiful people.

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,933
Expensive cars.

26
00:00:57,142 --> 00:01:00,520
The glamorous life. Get
ready to see the real

27
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,689
Los Angeles on this thrill

28
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:03,857
ride tour.

29
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,525
Well, it appears
I've been misled.

30
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,193
Whoever put together
this brochure

31
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:09,029
should get
special treatment in Hell.

32
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:11,406
I don't need you to
show me around the city.

33
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,074
Well, of course you do.

34
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,201
This is an exciting time,
brother!

35
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:16,911
Now that we're making
Los Angeles our home,

36
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,205
the City of Angels can
finally earn its name.

37
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:21,458
You are making it a home.

38
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,127
Mom and I are gonna find a way
to get back to the Silver City.

39
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:26,504
- One way or another.
- But why?

40
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:29,215
When Los Angeles
has so much to offer?

41
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:30,550
TOUR GUIDE:
On your right,

42
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,177
you'll see the
famous shop,

43
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:35,930
Pooch Pouch, the
store that sells purses

44
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:37,724
for purse-sized dogs.

45
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,851
- Clearly.
- (mutters)

46
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,062
- Don't get it confused
with the store
- Excuse me. Sorry.

47
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,313
that sells dogs in the
shapes of purses.

48
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:44,898
Sorry, I do apologize.

49
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,900
- That's on your left...
- Pardon me, excuse me.

50
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,526
Yeah, thank you.

51
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:49,903
Please. That's your corner.

52
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,781
Ah. Right. Forget everything

53
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:53,948
you just slept through.

54
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,575
Welcome to Los Angeles,

55
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:58,328
city of reinvention,
where you can become

56
00:01:58,703 --> 00:01:59,746
whomever you want.

57
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,372
Uh, if we look over here--

58
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:03,583
that humungous house in
the distance, the owner,

59
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,586
he moved out here with just
ten dollars and a dream.

60
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:08,004
Within three years,
he was running

61
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:10,423
the largest underground sex club
in the country.

62
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:13,218
Los Angeles is also a
place where you can do

63
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,553
whatever you want. To your
right hand side over here,

64
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:18,181
this folically challenged man--
that's Sleepy Pete. Hello, Pete.

65
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,599
Give us a wave.

66
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:20,600
Everyone wave at Pete.

67
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,435
(camera shutters clicking)

68
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:25,313
He will sell you the best
Molly in the city.

69
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:26,773
(Lucifer chuckles)

70
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,024
Don't buy his cocaine, though.

71
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,026
It's got enough baking soda
in it to make a cake.

72
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,487
It's not a bad idea,
as I think about it.

73
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:36,282
To your right again--
my nightclub, Lux!

74
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,284
The city's crowning achievement.

75
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,662
My brother and I are
celebrating...

76
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,794
<i>I don't understand him.</i>

77
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,839
Why won't Amenadiel embrace
this city like I have?

78
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,008
Well, people often need time
to adjust to change.

79
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,969
And he's only been
here for a few months.

80
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,428
And if what you say is true...

81
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:59,597
What? That he's got a stick
so far up his ass

82
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,015
you can see it when he yawns?

83
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,809
That he's a fallen angel.

84
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,435
Oh, yes, that, too.

85
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:07,313
Then this could be about more
than finding a home for him.

86
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,982
But we're here
to talk about you.

87
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:12,277
Why did you recently decide
that this was your home?

88
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:15,530
Well, I said it
when I was in a row with my mum.

89
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:18,491
I didn't realize how true it was
until I yelled it in her face.

90
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,742
Yes, your mother,

91
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:22,996
who is a literal goddess
of all creation.

92
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:25,206
Still haven't quite wrapped
my brain around that one.

93
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,833
Yes, well, anyway,
her and Amenadiel want

94
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,129
to get back to the Silver City,
but it's not my home.

95
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:31,963
It never was.

96
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:33,256
And neither was Hell.

97
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:34,966
No. No, that was somewhere

98
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,342
I was sent as a punishment.

99
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,720
Like the DMV,
but less screaming.

100
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:41,931
So would you say
that this is your first home?

101
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,641
Yes, I suppose it is.

102
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,351
And why do you think
that's the case?

103
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,271
Well, I don't know, Doctor.
You tell me.

104
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:49,355
I find that people

105
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:52,692
make Los Angeles their home
for one of two reasons.

106
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,777
Either they're running
from something,

107
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,030
or looking for something.

108
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,656
Oh, and which one are you?

109
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,491
I'm not the one on the couch,
Lucifer.

110
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,203
- (laughs, sighs)
- So ask yourself--

111
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,038
which is it?

112
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,832
Running or looking?

113
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,376
CHLOE:
<i>Lucifer? Lucifer?!</i>

114
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,378
Get out of the chair.

115
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:13,713
Oh, come on, Detective.

116
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,715
It's been ages
since I've sat in a throne.

117
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,301
Oh, there's a lot of
personality here, isn't there?

118
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,011
Appalling personality,

119
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,721
but quantity
over quality, I suppose.

120
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,473
- (sighs)
- (laughs)

121
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,476
Genuine Medieval knights costume
in a Bel Air mansion?

122
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,770
This man's home
definitely was his castle.

123
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,272
Well, it couldn't keep
him safe from invaders.

124
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,024
Crime scene. Let's go.

125
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:36,986
Hang on.

126
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,240
That's Dean Cooper, the
Los Angeles real-estate tycoon!

127
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,574
Yeah, owns the whole block,

128
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:43,868
and most of the biggest
developments in the city.

129
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:45,745
Including the entire block
that Lux is on.

130
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,580
Deeply unpleasant man.

131
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:48,706
You wouldn't believe
the deal I had

132
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:50,250
to strike for my lease.

133
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,876
All completely legal.

134
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,713
If somewhat, well,
let's say "morally ambiguous."

135
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,341
Well, that moral ambiguity
that he was so famous for

136
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,884
may have finally
caught up with him.

137
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,010
Ella, cause of death?

138
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:04,264
Explosive exsanguination from

139
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,516
the carotid,
punctured

140
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:09,352
by this.

141
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:11,312
Like from a
champagne flute.

142
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:13,815
Mm-hmm.
Someone really popped his cork.

143
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,609
You know like... (makes
explosive, hissing sounds)

144
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,279
You guys, like,
the blood's the champagne.

145
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,114
Like when you open a bottle,
his neck was the...

146
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,156
We got it.

147
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:23,908
Did you get
any prints?

148
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:25,368
Killer wiped it clean.

149
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,911
Okay, well,

150
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,454
maybe he didn't
wipe the glass clean

151
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:30,123
before it broke.
Ella, are any of

152
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,458
these pieces here big enough
to get a partial from?

153
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:33,960
Probably not.

154
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:38,298
But, hey, someone invented glue
for a reason.

155
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,967
- Right?
- You're going to
reassemble all those pieces?

156
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:41,801
LUCIFER:
I'm fairly

157
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,094
certain there are people in Hell
being forced

158
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,179
- to do exactly that right now.
- Oh, I was the kind

159
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,307
- of kid who did jigsaw puzzles
picture-side down.
- (phone ringing)

160
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:48,599
- That's fascinating.
- Mm.

161
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:50,977
Oh.

162
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:52,312
What's wrong?

163
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,480
Maze. Problem at Lux.

164
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:56,899
Problem? What? One of the
Brittanies stub her toe?

165
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:58,318
You're leaving?

166
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,403
Lucifer, Cooper was one
of the most hated men

167
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,989
in the city. We have tons
of suspects to go over.

168
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,490
And if I don't get there soon,

169
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,993
Maze will undoubtedly fix the
problem herself, which usually

170
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,161
- involves knives.
- But...

171
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,454
So unless you want to be blamed

172
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:10,872
for a four-toed Brittany...

173
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:21,799
Uh... hello?

174
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:23,593
We're closed.

175
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,221
Hi, okay, we've got
some anomalies here,

176
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,848
especially with

All right, explain what
you mean by "evicted,"

187
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,424
and do it carefully as
your life may depend on it.

188
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:06,552
Okay, Mr. Morningstar.
My name is Eric Cooper.

189
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,097
I've assumed all
of Cooper's holding

190
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:11,099

Your father was just
brutally murdered, and here you are,

193
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,272
scant hours after
you were notified,

194
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:19,857

be horrified or impressed.

196

What happened to my father
was unfortunate.

197
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:26,697
Yes.

198
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,950

Well, impressed it is.

200
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:36,290
Your father and I made a deal
for me to live here,

201
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,251
so I'm sure you and I
can come to some agreement.

202

Ooh.

206
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:48,970
Hated the old man, eh?

207
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:49,971
Well, I can relate to that.

208
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,931
My father's not on
my Christmas card list either.

209
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,059
In fact, I moved here
to get away from him.

210
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,520
Surely you can understand that.

211
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,273
No, not really.

212
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,984
And I saw your "lease"--

213
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:06,404
it was written in lipstick
on a stripper's thong.

214
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,657
- Not exactly legally binding.
- Hm.

215
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,325
Well, maybe we can
write the new one in blood.

216
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,035
I find that to be quite binding.

217
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,162
Let's not.

218
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,164
You have no legal right
to be here,

219
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:17,874
so if you don't vacate,

220
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:18,958
I'll have you removed.

221
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,710
(laughs)

222
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:22,962
It's not that easy to remove me.

223
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:24,505
Last time,
it took the power of God.

224
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:26,799
What do you have--
a few expensive lawyers?

225
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,260
Or are you gonna do it yourself?

226
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,846
Not in front of all
of these humans.

227
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,475
If I were you, I'd leave.

228
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:36,476
That's fine.

229
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,103
This is a police matter now.

230
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:41,898
Let's go.

00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:43,774
All right, let's go.

232
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:44,775
Let's go, man.

233
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:47,195
It's not like you
to get in the way

234
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,321
of a good
eviscerating, Maze.

235
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,197
What was that about?

236
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,616
You'd be eviscerating
the wrong person.

237
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:53,451
This is your mother's doing.

Mum? How?

239
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,998
You told her you want
to stay here on Earth.

240
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:02,001
Now someone's trying to
take Lux away from you.

241
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,336
Don't be absurd, Maze.

242
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,546
I just saw
American Psycho's father.

243
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,007
The man wasn't destroyed
by the Goddess of Creation.

244
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,384
He was killed in a fit
of human passion.

245
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,720
But that greasy weasel
might be right.

246
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,639
This is a police matter.
Lucky me.

247
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:15,848
Don't act like
your mother

248
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,558
isn't capable
of this, Lucifer.

249
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,061
Ah, that's enough help
from you today Maze, thank you.

250
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:21,854
- (smacks bar)
- All right, fine.

251
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:24,607
You can't see it,
I'll find someone who will.

252
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,442
I don't see it.

253
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:28,611
Of course you don't.

254
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,280
So after you said
you'd "handle things,"

255
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:33,157
you're hiding
behind her skirt again?

256
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,076
I am handling things, Maze.

257
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,953
Mom and I are trying to
find a way back home.

258
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,579
So why would she
murder some human?

259
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:39,664
That woman is

260
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,874
dangerous, duplicitous...

261
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:45,127
And she's standing
right behind me, isn't she?

262
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:47,630
Pardon my interruption,

263
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,549
but what am I being
blamed for now?

264
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,092
I know what you're doing,

265
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,844

Lucifer's home on Earth,

Typical, I suppose.

272
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:04,772
She thinks you
killed the man

273
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,024
who owns Lux to
get Lucifer evicted.

Whatever you're up to,

Mom?

- right?
- Well, of course not.

But it might be able
to be used to our advantage.

to come home with us now.

I would never.

355
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,422
Or threatening
to tear his arms off.

356
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,757
That happened one time.

357
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:18,966
Or hanging him from a window.

358
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,551
I solemnly promise
that the man's feet

359
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,052
will remain firmly
on the ground.

360
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:23,679
(man screams)

361
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:25,723
(car alarms ringing)

362
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:27,558
MAN:
What's that?

363
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,310
WOMAN:
Somebody call an ambulance...

364
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,603
MAN 2:
Check this out.

365
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,438
MAN 3:
There's a guy on the car!

366
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,440
(car alarm continues ringing)

367
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,649
WOMAN:
Is he alive?

368
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,693
(groaning)

369
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:39,111
That's Eric Cooper.

370
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,198
Just to be clear,
that wasn't me.

371
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,454
♪♪

372
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,627
I mean, who leaps
from the seventh floor?

373
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,463
13th, minimum. This is the man
forcing me from my home,

374
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,298
he can't even make
a proper suicide jump.

375
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:02,134
- Lucifer.
- Is this really necessary?

376
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,803
Well, witnesses saw him
jump off a balcony

377
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,137
by his own free will.

378
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:05,971
He was distraught.

379
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,598
That doesn't make him a killer.

380
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,475
Well, it points
to a guilty conscience.

381
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,685
Christi, I know this
might be hard to hear, but...

382
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,146
we have evidence that Eric
was in his father's house

383
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,356
before he died.

384
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,857
We live in the same compound.

385
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,527
I'm sure there's DNA or whatever
all over the house.

386
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:22,154
You can't actually think
that he killed his own father.

387
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,532
LUCIFER:
Well, I mean...

388
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,491
Let's not forget

389
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:26,992
Eric's insatiable lust

390
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,702
for Daddy's cold hard cash.

391
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,496
If he's willing to do
something as monstrous

392
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:31,539
as turning me out of my house,

393
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,040
then killing his father

394
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:34,708
isn't such a stretch, is it?

395
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,210
- (grunts)
- LUCIFER:
Ooh!

396
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,003
My Left Foot's trying to speak.

397
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,088
N-No...

398
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:40,297
money.

399
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:41,757
Shh, baby.

400
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:42,800
Don't talk.

401
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,343
What are you
trying to say, Eric?

402
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:45,636
(grunts)
Dad...

403
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:47,680
ran the business
into the ground.

404
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,140
We were buried in debt.

405
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,226
I thought making emergency sales

406
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,811
could save us, but...

407
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:55,646
CHRISTI:
But what, baby?

408
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,523
There's nothing left.

409
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,358
I'm sorry, I...

410
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,193
I couldn't live
with disappointing you.

411
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:02,778
LUCIFER:
Well, if this is about money,

412
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:05,865
you should have called me first,
before taking that swan dive.

413
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,658
Perhaps you'd like
to renegotiate now?

414
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:08,742
I can't.

415
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:09,785
The deal is made.

416
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,787
How could a sale
be made so fast?

417
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:13,539
Dean Cooper died yesterday.

418
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,541
Is this that deal for all
the property on the strip?

419
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,917
(grunts)

420
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:19,336
There's been a buyer
interested in that for years.

421
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,046
Eric's dad had it all
drawn up and then

422
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:22,423
just let it sit on his desk.

423
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,216
He just wanted
to torture the buyer.

424
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,427
So, you made the sale
as soon as you heard

425
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,720
your father was gone?

426
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,097
Dad couldn't block it anymore.

427
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:31,640
But it didn't matter.

428
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,018
It wasn't enough.

429
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,186
What we have is enough.

430
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,230
You and me.

431
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,190
We don't need
money for that.

432
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,483
What a wonderful day.

433
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,069
Potentially homeless
and definitely nauseated.

434
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,280
Well, whoever bought Lux
stood to gain

435
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,990
from Dean Cooper's death.

436
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,742
Yes. This man,

437
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,785
the person who owns Lux now.
What's his name?

438
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,413
Her. It's Eleanor Bloom.

439
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,790
Detective, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

440
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,292
I doubt it.

441
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,586
But let's go talk
to Eleanor Bloom.

442
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:01,921
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

443
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,255
Thank you.

- I am.

452
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,945
Why? You come to take
a peek at the legend?

453
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,155
According to the docket,
one of your clients

454
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:29,949
is a known explosives expert

455
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,992
named Patrick O'Neil.

456
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,494
I need his help

457
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,621
to get my son
to come back home with me.

458
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:38,540
You look hot and sound crazy,

459
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,584
which is totally my type.

460
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:43,629
But I don't talk about
my clients out of court.

461
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,214
It's a lawyer thing.

462
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,174
Oh, you misunderstand me.

463
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,093
I'm his lawyer now.

464
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,053
- You can go home.
- (laughs)

465
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,304

Look, lady.

466
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,139
I don't know what
you've heard about me,

So, you think I had something
to do with Dean Cooper's death?

478
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:19,331
CHLOE:
Well, barely an hour

479
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,166
after he was killed,
you closed on a deal

480
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:22,751
he'd been
obstructing for years.

481
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:23,794
Sounds convenient.

482
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:26,547
- Sounds like good business to me.
- Cooper intentionally

483
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,382
gave you
businesswoman blue balls

484
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,341
just to torture you.

485
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,010
- It's rather cruel.
- And I bought

486
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,845
his favorite golf course
last year and turned it

487
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,680
into a landfill
for medical waste.

488
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,348
Oh, I see. Well played.

489
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:37,349
So, you're saying
this was all

490
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,143
a multi-million
dollar prank war?

491
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,520
I'm saying I didn't kill him
over a deal.

492
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,106
Besides, I just flew in
from Macau this afternoon.

493
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,400
Check with the airstrip.
You have any other questions,

494
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,359
you can ask my lawyer.

495
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,153
Not so fast,
Mommy Warbucks.

496
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,696
I have some questions
for you myself.

497
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,281
- Lucifer, you promised
that you wouldn't...
- Detective,

498
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,699
this woman has my home.

499
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,492
If you're gonna give me
some sob story...

500
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:56,910
Oh, far from it.

501
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,954
I know your type.
You don't respond to emotion,

502
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,497
or intimidation.

503
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:03,000
The only thing that gets
you going is a deal.

504
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,835
So, let's make
a deal, shall we?

505
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:07,755
What do you desire?

506
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,506
Tell me and it's yours.

507
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,802
I want everything
Dean Cooper has.

508
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:15,763
Well, Cooper owned Lux.

509
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,097
So, how about everything
apart from that?

510
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,057
Everything.

511
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:19,516
All I want

512
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:20,642
is what was his.

513
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:22,644
And then to destroy it.

514
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:25,147
So, you're gonna tear down
all of his properties?

515
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,191
I'm a developer.
I'm gonna knock everything down

516
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,317
and then rebuild.

517
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,443
Even Lux?

518
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:30,569
Especially that place.

519
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:32,029
That's prime real estate.

520
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,280
I'm gonna build a mega-mall.

521
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:34,615
A "mega-mall"?

522
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,617
Yeah, you know, Gymboree,
Sunglass Hut...

523
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,702
Bulldozers get rolling as soon
as my people finish

524
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:39,953
emptying the buildings.

525
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,705
You know,

526
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:45,375
a murder investigation can
tie up a development for years.

527
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,128
I know you know more
than you're telling us.

528
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,297
So, if there
is any way,

529
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,383
at all, that you can help
this investigation,

530
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,261
- that would be wonderful.
- (chuckles softly)

531
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:57,387
She's good.

532
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,348
I could use a few of her
on my team.

533
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,769
The accountants
I had looking over the deal

534
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,979
did find several
unreported payments.

535
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,023
Hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

536
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:09,817
You don't hide money like that

537
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,568
unless you don't want
anyone to find it.

538
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,492
Bloom was right.

539
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,537
Dean Cooper was making large
off-the-books payments

540
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,247
and hiding them
from his company.

541
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:24,998
Well, could be anything.

542
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,208
Drugs, blackmail.

543
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,128
There's no shortage of bad deeds
in Dean Cooper's life.

544
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,380
I'm gonna try and trace
where these payments went.

545
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:32,840
Maybe our killer's
on the other end.

546
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,007
Oh, delightful.

547
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,384
Whilst you do that,
I'm gonna return

548
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,719
to Eleanor Bloom's office
and get my home back.

549
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,429
Not sure she's
interested in selling.

550
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,056
Well, maybe
she'll change her mind

551
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:44,017
after I turn her world into a
sphincter-loosening nightmare.

552
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,561
Ew. Lucifer.

553
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,729
I'm sorry about
your home. I am.

554
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:48,814
But you have
to promise me you're not

555
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:49,898
really gonna hurt this woman.

556
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,234
Well, then, help me, Detective.
Arrest her!

557
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,027
I mean, isn't contributing
to homelessness

558
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,445
in Los Angeles a crime?

559
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,406
Lucifer, the law is on
Bloom's side here.

560
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,867
I want to help you, but we have
to find a legal solution.

561
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,077
Okay. So I'm on my own, am I?

562
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:03,036
That's not what I--

563
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,969
We know you build bombs
for the mob, Patrick.

564
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,470
That's ridiculous.

565
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,472
I... I deliver pizzas.

566
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:24,683
Yeah.

567
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:26,602
We cracked your code.

568
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:28,562
"Hoping to get
a delivery

569
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,606
"at Slauson and La Brea
tomorrow night.

570
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,358
Enough pepperoni
to feed a family of four."

571
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,736
The mafia, the cartels,

572
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,280
when they hear that
we have you in custody,

573
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,616
and they think
for a second about your...

574
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,285
ingenious pizza code,

575
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,621
they're gonna want
to keep you quiet.

576
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:46,788
So, uh...

577
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,749
you can help me out, right?

578
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,751
- Depends.
- (door opens)

579
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,837
Hmm! Hands off my
client, Officer.

580
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,047
(door closes)

581
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,383
You're not his lawyer.

582
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,928
The accused has
a constitutional right

583
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,472
to be counseled
by whomever they choose.

584
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:05,349
She can be my lawyer.

585
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,186
I understand your confusion.

586
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:10,938
You're very attractive.

587
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:12,773
I've found that
can also mean

588
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,316
you're not very intelligent.

589
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:25,702
(chuckles)

590
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,622
I've already posted your bail.

591
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,041
No. Wait, wait, wait.
I-I can't afford that.

592
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,460
Oh, don't worry,
I take payment in trade.

593
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,046
Is it true that you know
how to make bombs?

594
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:39,633
That's what I'm accused of.

595
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:40,592
Yeah?

596
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,428
Have you ever brought down
a building before?

597
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:45,722
I know how it's done.

598
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:47,683
(laughs)

599
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,727

Hey, man,

we're just doing a job.
We don't want any trouble.

604
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,325
You think you can come in here
and take apart my life

605
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:06,451
without any trouble?

dealing with, do you?

And how do you do that?

711
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,895
Think of me as
a professional tempter.

712
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:03,855
People hire me to find out

713
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:06,149
if their R&D guy
would sell secrets.

714
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,901
Or if a famous couple's nanny

715
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,695
could be bribed for
pictures of their kids.

716
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,156
So whose loyalty were you
testing at Cooper's company?

717
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:14,866
That's privileged information.

718
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,121

to know, we got calls

00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,338
Well, then, we need to look
harder, Detective.

794
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,424
This is about more than me.

795
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,843
I mean, do you know the
history of sin in this place?

796
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,136
It was a, an institution

797
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,263
decades before I ran it.

798
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:24,639

That crack is still there

801
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,478
from when Ava Gardner threw a
scotch glass at Sinatra's head.

802
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:31,813
- (chuckles)
- Hmm.

803
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:34,649
Underneath here there's
prohibition tunnels everywhere.

804
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,735
Howard Hughes used to use them
to sneak his mistresses

805

away from his other mistresses.

861
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,778
You don't just tempt potential
employees, Simon.

862
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:46,155
You also go after
potential spouses.

863
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:47,782
Dean Cooper's payments started

864
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:50,285
to you just after his son
got engaged to Christi.

865
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,870
Care to explain?

866
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:56,040
It's true.

867
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:58,167
Old Man Cooper
didn't trust Christi.

868
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:59,669
She came from
Nowheresville, Michigan,

869
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,713
where they put cars
on blocks in yards.

870
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,590
So Dean Cooper thought she was
after his son's money,

871
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,134
and hired you to prove that
she was just a gold digger?

872
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:07,427
And I approached her.

873
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:10,638
Rented Bentley, fake
Rolex, the whole nine yards.

874
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:11,890
I laid it on thick.

875
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,182
And? Did she sleep with you?

876
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:14,851
She passed.

877
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,311
She stayed faithful.

878
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,229
What, you couldn't seduce
her with your fake Rolex?

879
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,023
- Well, color me shocked.
- (chuckles)

880
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:22,358
Hey, man, my success rate
is pretty high.

881
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:24,485
She was really in love
with her fiancé.

882
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:25,778
It happens sometimes.

883
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,031
So if she didn't cheat, then
what happened with Dean Cooper?

884
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,407
I told the old man the truth.

885
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,451
But it didn't matter,
he didn't like her.

886
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,828
Even if there was no
evidence of her cheating,

887
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,915
he wanted me to... make some.

888
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:38,082
"Make some?"

889
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:39,626
I photoshopped pictures of her

890
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:42,003
in some compromising positions.

891
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,088
What?

892
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:45,632
It was a lot of money.

893
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,634
So Dean Cooper tried
to blackmail Christi

894
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:48,843
into breaking off
her engagement

895
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,803
with fake proof of her cheating?

896
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,972
That's some serious
motive for murder.

897
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:54,474
LUCIFER:
The poor girl was
just trying to find

898
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:55,767
a place to belong.

899
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,186
And you, you vile insect,

900
00:32:58,394 --> 00:32:59,604
took that away from her.

901
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,064
If you ask me,
she killed the wrong man.

902
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:02,190
Lucifer, come on.

903
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:03,274
All right.
Detective,

904
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,693
this man is a
professional homewrecker!

905
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,028
And when it gets out,
what he's done,

906
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:08,237
he will be out of business.

907
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,448
That will have to be
punishment enough.

908
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:11,407
Please.

909
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,826
Very well, Detective.

910
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:22,418
DAN:
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

911
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:23,795
I was, um--

912
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,214
I was pretty surprised
when you called me.

913
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:27,674
Even more surprised

914
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:29,550
you actually invited
me out. (chuckles)

915
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,595
You know, as soon as I walked
into that interrogation room,

916
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,764
I felt a spark between us.

917
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:38,559
Yeah?

918
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,019
Me, too.

919
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,771
I'm surprised
you're still single.

920
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,023
- (chuckling)
- Lucky me.

921
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:47,652
Look, I'm gonna be
honest with you,

922
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,862
I've been a little
bit gun-shy

923
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:51,364
about the whole dating thing.

924
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,157
You know, since my split.

925
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,617
No, I understand.

926
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,829
I went through
a bad breakup, myself.

927
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,707
Honestly, I was in Hell

928
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:02,041
for what felt like forever.

929
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,710
(chuckles)

930
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,753
I've only recently come back.

931
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:10,383
What happened with you two?

932
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,385
Was there someone else?

933
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:13,720
No, no.

934
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,346
No, nothing like that.

935
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:17,056
But...

936
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:18,349
But?

937
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,061
(sighs)

938
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:23,980
(smacks lips) Well,
there's this-this guy

939
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,898
that she spends
a lot of time with.

940
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:28,693
And he definitely has a
thing for her, but I--

941
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:31,654
I mean, I don't know if
it's reciprocated, but...

942
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,699
- you know, I...
- Go on.

943
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:39,120
I think you were right, Maze.

944
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:41,914
They must be discussing
some evil, terrible plans.

945
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:42,999
And we must stop them.

946
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:46,210
No, let's let it play out.

947
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:47,670
Just to be safe.

948
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:48,713
(sighs)

949
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,176
Wow. You know,

950
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,011
I haven't really
had anyone to...

951
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,930
talk about my ex with.

952
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,183
And it feels really
good to get it out.

953
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,894
Yes, it certainly does
clarify things.

954
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,021
Whoa, whoa, uh, wait,

955
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,064
I'm so sorry.

956
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:07,940
I, um,

957
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:10,026
I totally over-shared,
didn't I?

958
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:11,736
- (chuckles softly)
- I--

959
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,112
I haven't done
this in a while.

960
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:14,781
And... (chuckles)

961
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:15,990
I screwed it up.

962
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,953
Well, I suppose I do
have some time and...

963
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:23,790
...you are fairly attractive.

964
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:25,833
(chuckling):
What?

965
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:32,256
Oh...
(chuckles)

966
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,053
(camera snaps)

967
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:40,473
(chuckling):
Oh, that's a keeper.

968
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:42,934
Come on, let's go.

969
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:44,143
I know where he lives.

970
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:46,145
I'm not gonna go watch
my mother make out with Dan!

971
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:47,730
They're not gonna make out.

972
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,941
They're gonna...
(moans)

973
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,318
I know what they're
gonna go do, Maze!

974
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:53,945
Fine. I'll report back.

975
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,154
Maze, stop.

976
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,156
This is just a...

977
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,866
an innocent date.

978
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:00,493
An innocent date?

979
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:03,121
- With Chloe's ex?
- Yeah, they're colleagues.

980
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,497
She was in Hell
for thousands of years,

981
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,749
and he's a good enough
looking... guy.

982
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:08,376
Please don't make me
explain this any more.

983
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:11,921
(giggles) But it is
so much fun to torture you.

984
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:14,090
Look,

985
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:16,551
I'm not gonna interfere
with my mother

986
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,178
enjoying a little bit
of happiness.

987
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:20,930
Please.

988
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,143
Fine.

989
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:27,854
It's not like
I wanted to watch, anyway.

990
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,313
Even I have my limits.

991
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:30,690
(chuckles)

992
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:48,875
(phone dialing)

993
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:51,460
It's me.

994
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:54,172
Forget the building,
I need a smaller charge.

995
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,632
For say, one person.

996
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,093
Don't worry about that.

997
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,137
I'm going to do this one myself.

998
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:15,443
(doorbell rings)

999
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:18,988
Mr. Cooper,
sorry to bother you.

1000
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:20,615
We just have a
few more questions.

1001
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,491
Can your fiancée
vouch for your whereabouts

1002
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,951
the morning
your father was killed?

1003
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:27,872
No, she was out looking
for a venue for the wedding.

1004
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:29,332
Why?

1005
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,458
- Well...
- CHRISTI:
What is this?

1006
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,585
I thought Eric had been
cleared of the charges.

1007
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,003
Oh, he has.

1008
00:37:34,212 --> 00:37:35,213
Because we now know
that you're the one

1009
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,964
who killed your
father-in-law, Christi.

1010
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:37,840
What?

1011
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:39,634
CHLOE: Eric's father
created fake evidence

1012
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:41,427
that you were cheating
and tried to blackmail you

1013
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:42,261
into leaving.

1014
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,095
And then he had

1015
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:45,640
a little champagne toast to evil
while he did it.

1016
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:47,892
No wonder you wanted to jam it
down his throat.

1017
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,726
I...

1018
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:49,685
No.

1019
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,270
No, I did it.

1020
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,065
My father, he-he
showed me the evidence

1021
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,816
and I knew it was fake.

1022
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:58,110
Christi would never...

1023
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:00,279
And-and the fact that
he would...

1024
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,366
stoop so low,
I couldn't help myself.

1025
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:05,493
I flew into a rage.

1026
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:07,036
Well, if that's the case,

1027
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:08,454
Eric Cooper, you're
under arrest...

1028
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:09,538
No!

1029
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:12,917
It was me.
It happened

1030
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,210
all like you said.

1031
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:15,419
Christi...

1032
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:17,588
I'm-I'm the one
who did it, not Eric.

1033
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:18,714
I think he did it.

1034
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:20,675
You two realize that if
you confess to this crime,

1035
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,468
there's a good chance you
both will go to jail?

1036
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,680
Whatever we face,

1037
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,932
we face together.

1038
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:30,601
LUCIFER:
I don't understand.

1039
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,437
The one of you who didn't do it,
you'll lose everything.

1040
00:38:36,274 --> 00:38:37,358
No, we won't.

1041
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:46,534
No one was willing
to stand next to you

1042
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:47,868
in front of the bulldozers?

1043
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,079
(laughs)
No.

1044
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:52,290
No, I sent everybody home.

1045
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:53,416
(inhales deeply)

1046
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:55,751
Thought I'd say
my good-byes on my own.

1047
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:58,170
Good-byes?

1048
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,798
I thought you were gonna
fight for this place.

1049
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,009
Well, it occurred to me that

1050
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:05,303
much as I love this place, uh,

1051
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,430
I can always build a new one.

1052
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:10,516
I mean, it wasn't the walls
that made it my home.

1053
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,226
The people.

1054
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:13,394
Yes.

1055
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,854
Well, the women.

1056
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:18,399
But they'll flock to any
new place I go to, so...

1057
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:19,233
Hmm.

1058
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:23,612
Well, that makes this
sort of anticlimactic.

1059
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:26,657
- But Lux has been named
- Mm.

1060
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:29,410
a Heritage Site
by Los Angeles County.

1061
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,536
Detective, is this...

1062
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:32,246
I had a friend
in the city council

1063
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:33,205
push it through.

1064
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:34,540
And I used your, uh,

1065
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,542
little history lesson
as inspiration.

1066
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:38,294
Lux is protected now.

1067
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:41,047
It can't be demolished
for development.

1068
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,466
Detective, you...

1069
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,051
(chuckles)

1070
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:47,803
you saved my home.

1071
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:50,514
Well, you'd still
have to buy it back

1072
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:53,184
from Eleanor Bloom, I'm sure
well above market price.

1073
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:55,353
But...
(sighs)

1074
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:56,604
you can afford it.

1075
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:57,480
(chuckles)

1076
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:00,524
I...

1077
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:03,027
I-I mean, I simply don't know
what to say.

1078
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,737
I'm-I'm normally the one
doing the favors.

1079
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,364
And for a price.

1080
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:08,574
Friends help
each other out.

1081
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:12,620
Yeah, well,

1082
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:15,206
let me at least
buy you dinner tonight.

1083
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:16,082
To celebrate.

1084
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:18,084
I know this
amazing steakhouse

1085
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:20,252
and-and the chef's an absolute
artist in the kitchen.

1086
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:21,629
I mean, he's also
a degenerate gambler

1087
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:22,713
and owes me a favor.

1088
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,257
Otherwise, you'll just go home

1089
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,842
and eat one of those
poisonous sandwiches

1090
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:28,552
you get from the vending machine
at work.

1091
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,638
Come on, Detective.

1092
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,015
Friends help each other out.

1093
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:35,810
<i>She saved Lux.</i>

1094
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:37,812
No strings attached.

1095
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,563
I-I didn't even ask.

1096
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:41,023
LINDA: Well, Chloe
saw that your home

1097
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:43,234
is a very important
place to you.

1098
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,736
Does it really surprise you

1099
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:47,488
that she'd want to
help you protect it?

1100
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:48,697
(scoffs)
Well, I...

1101
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,741
People make
gestures like that

1102
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,784
all the time.

1103
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:54,495
You just saw two people
go to jail for each other.

1104
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:56,664
But those people
were clearly insane.

1105
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:57,957
Now their home is a jail cell.

1106
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:01,377
You realized earlier that "home"
meant more to you than Lux.

1107
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:02,920
That you could lose Lux

1108
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:04,255
and still have
a place here.

1109
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:05,923
Because Los Angeles is my home.

1110
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:07,258
Lux or no.

1111
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:10,010
Are you sure that's what
you were really looking for?

1112
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,096
Well, what else would it be?

1113
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,514
Something occurred to me

1114
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:14,890
when you introduced me
to your mother.

1115
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,475
Why is it that

1116
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:18,227
I'm the only human in your life

1117
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,187
who knows who you really are?

1118
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:22,064
Because you asked me, remember?

1119
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:23,858
You insisted that I show you.

1120
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:26,652
Detective Decker has asked you
many times.

1121
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,237
And I always tell her the truth.

1122
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:29,989
But you know
she doesn't believe you.

1123
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:31,699
You could show her

1124
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:33,033
your true face,

1125
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:35,578
but you don't.

1126
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:38,914
Why is that?

1127
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:42,376
Do you think
it's because

1128
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:43,961
you might be afraid

1129
00:41:44,837 --> 00:41:46,088
of how she might react?

1130
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:48,048
Because you care

1131
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:50,426
that much about
what she thinks of you?

1132
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,094
No, I-I-I'm sorry.

1133
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:53,387
Doctor,
I don't really understand

1134
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:54,763
where you're going with this.

1135
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,224
I think you did come
to Los Angeles

1136
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:58,767
looking for something.

1137
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:01,812
But I also think
you've stopped.

1138
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:04,607
