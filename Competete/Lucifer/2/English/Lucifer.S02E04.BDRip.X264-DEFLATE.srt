Sometimes, when we're in crisis,

Oh, sorry... right.

to stay on Earth.

Piece of cake, actually.

92
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:12,652
Mum's all sorted; not a problem.

93
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:13,820
Really?

94
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,196
Because the last time
you were here,

95
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,739
you used the word "frightened."

96
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:17,574

Hmm. And the "deal"
with your dad?

100
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:24,998
To send Mum home?

101
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,833
What, you think I'm scared
of Him or something?

that distraction is a way
to avert your problems.

107
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,429
- No.
- Ergo, the more I distract,

108
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:40,430
the less I worry.

109
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:41,890
No, I did not say that.

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,659
By the time I pulled over and
found her, she was already...

182
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,956
I'm on new meds.
I wasn't thinking straight.

183
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,292
I just got this job.
I panicked.

184
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,336
Killer cliché: "I panicked,"
closely followed by...

185
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,712
T-Talk to the other guy!

186
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,214
- What other guy?
- She used

187
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,758
my phone to call somebody.

188
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,343
Her boyfriend, I don't know.

189
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:25,053
She wanted to go
over to his place,

190
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:26,846
- he threatened to kill her.
- (phone rings)

191
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:28,306
Oh! Excuse me.

192
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:30,975
Oh, it's you.

Did you come here to gloat?

201
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,248
I just came to see how the

202
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,959
supreme goddess was acclimating.

203

Nothing I can't handle.

00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:16,813
I'm still on
a sabbatical from work,

212
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,439
so I spend the bulk of my day

213
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:21,484
at home with the... children.

214
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,277
Factories of filth.

215
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:24,904
Of mire.

218
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,621
I discovered a trick with him.

219
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,332
Whenever he asks a question,
I just have sex with him.

220
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,126
Seems to render him mute.

221
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,337
Hmm. Took me a while
to figure that one out.

222
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:43,089
As for the rest of it,

223
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:46,217
for lack of a better word,
it is absolute...

224
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:47,927

Well, if it's so bad,
why don't you just go back?

226

Why?

227
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,434

to torturing me

I found a poison
in Daria's stomach contents.

256
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,411
It's called mandrake,

257
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,872
it's like this
crazy organic hallucinogen,

258

262
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,339
had back-to-back
rides all night,

263
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,341
and he didn't pick up Daria
until 30 minutes

264
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,300
before she died.

265
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:10,885
Exactly.
He would've barely had time

00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,012

00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,827
that clearly won't lead
anywhere, so I need a favor.

357
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,203
Favors are your thing, not mine.

358
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:25,037
All right, then.

359
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:26,038
What about a wager?

360
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,331
What's in it for me?

361
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,457
Whatever you want.

362
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,500
Your convertible.

363
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:30,710
Fine. But you need to take

364
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,545
the detective out and have fun.

365
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,754
Three drinks
should do the trick.

366
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,674
(chuckles) Sucker's bet. Easy.

367
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:37,967
Yes, but you're not allowed
to tie her up

368
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,343
and pour booze down her throat.

369
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,469
Less easy.

370
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:41,929
Fine.

371
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,223
- All right. Deal.
- (shouts): I said get naked!

372
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:45,266
Oh, hello.

373
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:47,768
Want to watch?

374
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:49,061
(phone beeps)

375
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,813
Okay, you were the last one
to talk to Daria;

376
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,440
you're telling me
you have no idea

377
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:53,774
who she was with
last night?

378
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,819
No. She was having
a girls' night.

379
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,531
She was roomies with
another waitress, uh, Naomi.

380
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,283
Maybe she was with her.

381
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,160
Do not leave town.

382
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,247
So did Casanova's
alibi check out?

383
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:09,915
Working on it,
but in the meantime,

384
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:12,543
Daria's roommate, Naomi, might
have an idea of her timeline.

385
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,045
Oh, lovely. Then can we go
for grilled polenta?

386
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,798
Well, I can't focus
on an empty stomach, Detective.

387
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,175
(sighs)

388
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:21,177
Hey...

389
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,062
Oh. Hi.

390
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,355
Hey, uh...

391
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,399
I just wanted
to return this.

392
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,276
Oh. Uh...

393
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:38,694
<i>Therapeutic Truth.</i>

394
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,155
So much for that, right?

395
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,865
(chuckles)

396
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,159
Are you okay?

397
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,578
(exhales)

398
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,332
One exhalation yes, two...

399
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,167
- none of my business?
- Yeah, listen.

400
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,419
Thanks for your concern,
but, um, I'm fine.

401
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,713
No more false pretenses,
remember?

402
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,591
Friendship
means honesty.

403
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,384
You can talk to
me, Amenadiel.

404
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,845
Apparently, that <i>is</i>
your real name.

405
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:07,348
(laughs) It is.

406
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,771
This is hard to explain.

407
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,856
Uh, it's kind of a, uh...

408
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,316
physical problem.

409
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:18,526
Oh?

410
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,861
And things aren't working
the way they used to.

411
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,114
Oh.

412
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:26,200
And I-I don't, I don't know
what to do about that.

413
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,411
I see. Well, you know,
it's very common.

414
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:30,663
I doubt that.

415
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:31,872
Generally stress related.

416
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,207
It <i>is</i> very stressful.

417
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,333
My advice?

418
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,210
Don't overthink it.

419
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,421
You need to relax.
Try to put it out of your mind.

420
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,257
Maybe have a bit of fun.

421
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,466
- Fun?
- Yes.

422
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,802
Maybe a cocktail.

423
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:47,221
And before you know it...

424
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,645
It doesn't make you any
less of a man, Amenadiel.

425
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,355
Not even a bit.

426
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,069
(seagulls squawking)

427
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,614
Was everything okay?

428
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:08,242
I haven't seen Daria
or Naomi all week.

429
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:09,869
We feed each other's cats.

430
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,538
Oh, gosh, I detest cats.

431
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,582
Want an animal to stare at you
with contempt?

432
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,876
Get a cat. Open box
of excrement

433
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,252
- in your house? Cat.
- (sniffs)

434
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,587
Oh, gosh.
Can you smell that?

435
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,797
Foul, incontinent creatures.

436
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,383
That's not a cat smell.
That's a dead smell.

437
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,681
Oh, my God! Naomi!

438
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,565
She's got the same
triangular stamp as Daria.

439
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,775
Same signs of poison.

440
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,778
Well, well. Talk about
a girls' night gone wrong.

441
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:53,037
♪♪

442
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,959
Lovely. Why don't we go
up to the penthouse,

443
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,128
and I can show you the original
Stairway to Heaven.

444
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:02,129
(chuckles)

445
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,547
Ah, Detective.

446
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,466
After 6:00 on a school night?

447
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,092
Ella's final
forensic report came in.

448
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,135
Right.

449
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:08,969
Um...

450
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,013
Sorry. Can this wait?

451
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:11,972
(chuckles):
I mean,

452
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,766
those deaths were
fiendishly tragic,

453
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,185
but I'm pretty certain that
tomorrow, during office hours,

454
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:17,895
our dead girls
will still be dead.

455
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:18,938
I just wanted to run a couple...

456
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,314
MAZE:
Good. Saved me a trip.

457
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,899
You, me, drinking. Now.

458
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,692
- ELLA: I'm in!
- CHLOE: What are you doing here?

459
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,986
- Lucifer said I should drop by.
- But we're working.

460
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,029
No, <i>you're</i> working.

461
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:27,988
Who the hell is she?

462
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,949
Oh, sorry. Hi, I'm Ella!

463
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,618
- (chuckles)
- CHLOE: I was about
to give him the rundown

464
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,869
on your report.
Do you want to...

465
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:35,663
No, go for it.
I got to dehydrate. Whew!

466
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:39,249
Okay. Anyhow, first off,
there was tissue damage

467
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,334
to Daria's stomach lining,

468
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,794
caused by liquid nitrogen,

469
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,837
the stuff that makes
fancy cocktails smoke.

470
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,506
It's probably how
she ingested the poison.

471
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:46,715
Well, excellent lead, Detective,

472
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,217
but you just ruined
my ménage à trois.

473
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,762
Second, I assumed that Daria
was at a club on Gower,

474
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:53,514
and we found an abandoned
building on the corner.

475
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,349
It looked like they had
recently had a party there.

476
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,266
Fascinating.

477
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,810
I'm thinking
it was a rave, so...

478
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,520
Any way you could make
some phone calls to help me out?

479
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,355
You know, you seem to have
your finger on the pulse.

480
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,357
Not the appendage
I'd hoped to be pulsing by now.

481
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:04,817
I know that hood.

482
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,276
There's a great tiki bar

483
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:07,861
across the street
from that building.

484
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,029
I know the bartender.

485
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:10,280
Course you do.

486
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,907
We could go and
have a drink,

487
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:13,450
ask about the
dead girls.

488
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,869
Yes. That sounds like
a very good lead, Detective.

489
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,371
If you want to
retrace the steps

490
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,289
of two hot girls
on a girls' night,

491
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,418
you need to think like two
hot girls on a girls' night.

492
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:23,585
With your lady parts.

493
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,005
And piña coladas
in hand.

494
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:27,881
Oh, my God, I <i>love</i> piña coladas!

495
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:29,550
Lovely!

496
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,932
(slurping)

497
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,188
So, I was watching
<i>Chinatown,</i> right?

498
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:44,982
And all of a sudden,
it hits me.

499
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,568
I need to go to L.A.
I mean, do you ever feel like

500
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,278
God is telling you
to do something?

501
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,112
No.

502
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:52,698
Oh. You think Chloe's
gonna drink that?

503
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:53,532
No.

504
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,161
Hey, guys. Do you
recognize this hand stamp?

505
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,247
What about these women?

506
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,124
No.

507
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,751
Okay, look. I'm LAPD,

508
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,085
and if there's any info
that you can give me

509
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,087
- on any...
- (snorts, laughs)

510
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,715
How <i>not</i> to get laid.

511
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,176
I'm not trying
to get laid, Maze.

512
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:13,844
I don't get it.

513
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:15,554
Well, did you talk
to the bartender?

514
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,015
Yeah. He said
something was going on

515
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,433
across the street in
the abandoned building.

516
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,226
I put a call in for
a warrant to the judge,

517
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,519
and I'm waiting
to hear back.

518
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,480
Great. Looks like you have
some time to kill.

519
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:25,481
Have a drink.

520
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,107
No. I'm gonna
call it a night.

521
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,442
Hello, ladies.

522
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,569
Hi. What are
you doing here?

523
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,071
Maze invited me.

524
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,031
- She said it's girls' night.
- MAZE: Yeah.

525
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,909
No. I'm working
a double homicide.

526
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,661
Would it kill you
to just relax for once?

527
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,038
- (sighs)
- All you do is

528
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,539
work, work, work.

529
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:43,791
Wow. Like you're one to talk.

530
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,001
You're at Lucifer's
beck and call 24/7.

531
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,669
It's like you're
his personal concierge.

532
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:50,631
I'm not his personal
anything, anymore.

533
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,634
Hmm. Well, you basically still
live there, and it's not like

534
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,135
he's pouring <i>you</i> any drinks.

535
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,138
Least I know how to have fun.

536
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,390
What about pleasure?

537
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,267
Men?

538
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,145
When's the last time
you had sex?

539
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,563
ELLA: Hey, why does everything
always have to be

540
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,398
- about work or sex?
- LINDA: Yeah, I agree.

541
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:12,111
Girls' night, done right,
is about female bonding.

542
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,404
- Exactly.
- Really getting
to know each other.

543
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:18,117
Sharing problems,
origin stories, secrets.

544
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,785
- MAZE: Can't we just drink?
- LINDA: Fine.

545
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,787
I'll start. Um...

546
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,914
I worked my way
through med school as

547
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:25,791
a phone sex operator.

548
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,794
1-800-ProfessorFeelGood.

549
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,046
I would totally
call that.

550
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,047
Nice.

551
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,423
I'm Ella, by the way.

552
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,801
- I love that we just
skipped the small talk.
- Yes.

553
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,178
Um, okay. I'll go next,
I guess. Um...

554
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,513
I used to steal cars.

555
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:41,974
Who's next?

556
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,976
I was forged in
the bowels of Hell

557
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,478
to torture the guilty
for all of eternity.

558
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,189
Interesting share.

559
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:51,191
Okay, so...

560
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:52,526
Now, you go, Chloe.

561
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,278
Female trust.

562
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,696
Come on.

563
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:56,738
What's on your mind?

564
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,740
What's on my mind...

565
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,701
like, other than the case?

566
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:02,119
Yeah.

567
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:06,540
Um...

568
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,668
A little divorce.

569
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,003
- Uh...
- MAZE: Mm-hmm.

570
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,297
Single parenthood...

571
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,926
uh, possible homelessness and...

572
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,889
most likely many, many cats
in my future.

573
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,724
Or things
that require batteries.

574
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,058
Okay, you know,
that's-that's...

575
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,393
that's what I'm talking about.

576
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:29,062
You guys,
this is so fun!

577
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,189
- MAZE: Is it?
- ELLA: Yes!

578
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,566
Yeah, uh, tequila, stat.

579
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,234
- ELLA: Yes.
- MAZE: Keep 'em coming!

580
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:35,652
LINDA: This is really
gonna help you feel,

581
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,237
you know, anything.

582
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:41,783
LUCIFER:
Ugh!

583
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,160
Cosmopolitan?

584
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,078
Perhaps this really
<i>is</i> girls' night.

585
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,915
There are only two reasons
to drink alone, brother.

586
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,708
Either you're a chronic dullard,

587
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,460
or you're trying
to avoid your problems.

588
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,878
If it's the
latter, I approve.

589
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,713
My problems
<i>are</i> your problems.

590
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:57,382
Ooh! Aren't we
the little empath?

591
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,677
You think letting Mom stay here
on earth doesn't affect us all?

592
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:01,511
(scoffs)

593
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,804
Why? Because you think Dad is gonna

594
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,890
forgive and forget about
the fact that you broke a deal?

595
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,350
Haven't broken anything.

596
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:07,476
I found a loophole.

597
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,353
As such, I'm not thinking
about it at all.

598
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:10,354
You should try it.

599
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,231
There will be consequences!

600
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,776
I don't get it.

601
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,778
If you're so concerned,
why don't you just

602
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,154
fly Mum back to Hell?

603
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,657
Because I can't!

604
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,077
That was a tad dramatic.

605
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:25,911
Why not?

606
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,287
It's complicated.

607
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:30,666
Never fear,
fun brother's here.

608
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,918
I'm gonna show you the magic
of distraction.

609
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,045
But no more girly drinks.
All right?

610
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,005
Cosmos are yummy.

611
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,259
Oh... Bourbon. Stat.
Keep 'em coming.

621
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:57,109
Thank you, Los Angeles!

622
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,612
(laughing)

623
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,698
And then Lucifer's
all like...

624
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,826
(imitating Lucifer):
"Hey Chloe,
name three friends

625
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,954
that you could go call
and have a drink with."

626
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,455
- CHLOE: So smug, you know?
- LINDA: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

627
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,791
Well, one...two...three!

628
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,667
CHLOE:
So, you're saying,

629
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,002
if I called you guys,

630
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:16,586
you would drop everything

631
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,088
and come and have
a drink with me?

632
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:20,465
Mm-hmm. 'Cause that is what
girlfriends do for each other.

633
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,676
Yes, especially during
tough times.

634
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:23,677
Exactly.

635
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,096
I've never had friends
like that.

636
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,514
Like, ever.

637
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:29,057
Well, you're a lot
more tolerable

638
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:30,183
when you're drunk,
Decker.

639
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,435
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

640
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:32,811
And then Lucifer's like,

641
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,981
"You use work to avoid
having fun."

642
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,566
Oh, yeah.
Well, not anymore, lady.

643
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,067
'Cause we're your tribe, now.

644
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,403
And we like to party!

645
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:42,696
(howling)

646
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,115
I wish I had my knives.
We could have made a blood pact.

647
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:46,366
- Ooh, next time.
- Aww...
- Yeah, yeah.

648
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:48,201
Next time?
This is progress.

649
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,411
To tribes!

650
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,204
To tribes!

651
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:52,998
Sip it.

652
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:53,832
(camera clicks)

653
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,209
I think we should go back
up there.

654
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,378
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

655
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:00,339
Mm.

656
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:02,174
(whooping)

657
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,176
LINDA: Oh, it looks like
someone's made a fourth friend.

658
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,553
Oh, you get it, girl!
(whooping)

659
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,055
Oh, no!

660
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,307
- MAZE: Abort! Chloe!
- LINDA: Oh... don't do that.

661
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,892
I don't
think she...

662
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,477
Does she wear contacts?

663
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:15,062
- LINDA: She's really into him.
- ELLA: And she's bringing
him over.

664
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,313
- LINDA: Is she?
- CHLOE: Look!

665
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,231
Same hand stamp

666
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,316
as Daria
and Naomi!

667
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:20,484
Where did you get this?

668
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,444
I saw some
hot women, uh,

669
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,613
g-going into a party
across the street last night.

670
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:25,781
- Okay.
- It was just...

671
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:26,907
Do you recognize these women?

672
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:27,824
Did you see
these girls there?

673
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:28,825
(grunts)

674
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:29,910
What's your deal?

675
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,828
Hey, she's just asking
a few questions.

676
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,122
Well, he's taken.
So back off, skank!

677
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,374
- CHLOE: I...
- MAZE: Hey!

678
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,959
No one calls my skank a skank.

679
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,503
- MAZE: I'm hurting her.
- CHLOE: No!
- LINDA: Oh, no, no...

680
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:41,213
- No.
- Okay, no. No, no, Maze.

681
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,506
Maze...

682
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:44,299
Wipe that smile
off her face.

683
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,760
Maze, remember...
aggression

684
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,261
is not the answer, okay.

685
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,930
Clearly, this woman is having

686
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:51,264
some serious
trust issues.

687
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,224
Clearly.

688
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,101
Or maybe she's just
a raging bitch.

689
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,185
(laughing):
Oh!

690
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:56,812

Hey.

711
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,356
Did you see these girls?

712
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:42,691
Yeah, maybe.

713
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,151
- Where?
- It was-- it was--

714
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,735
- Where?!
- It was a crowded
sex club,

715
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,279
and there was so many
hot girls...

716
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,405
A sex club?

717
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,781
Yeah, just...

718
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,993
Don't tell my girlfriend.
Just...

719
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,580
♪ And the boys and the girls
they stare... ♪

720
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,665
(scoffs)
Girls' night out.

721
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,177
Oh...

722
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,054
Oof. Happy hour
over already?

723
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,514
Must have been
some party.

724
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:15,849
Yeah...

725
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,851
other than the half hour-ish

726
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,187
from 8:47 to 9:17

727
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,022
that I can't quite remember
anything.

728
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:24,274
(chuckling):
Classic Chloe.

729
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:25,817
Only you would make a point
of remembering

730
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,944
the exact amount of time
you can't remember.

731
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:29,613
Mm. Well,

732
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:32,240
I was lucid enough to
destroy a tiki bar

733
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,701
and get a lead
on our two dead blondes.

734
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,870
I found a guy with a hand stamp.

735
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,788
The same club that
Daria and Naomi went to?

736
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,166
Not a club.

737
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:45,295
More like a roving,
pop-up sex party.

738
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:46,963
Secretive,
invite-only,

739
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,216
caters to rich jerks
who like to pay for it.

740
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,050
So gross.

741
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:51,760
So those two girls
were sex workers?

742
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:53,803
Looks like it.

743
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:55,430
But the only way
to know for sure

744
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,224
is to get you
into the next shindig.

745
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,100
Which hand stamp guy told me--

746
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:00,560
right before he passed out--

747
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:02,521
is happening as we speak.

748
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:04,147
Me?

749
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,983
Uh-huh. Men only.
And I got you a date.

750
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:09,277
- Nope.
- Yes.

751
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,862
- Mm-mm. No way.
- Yes.

752
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:12,489
It's good to have Lucifer
there with you as back up.

753
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,157
So they don't think
you're a cop.

754
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:17,827
I don't look like a cop.

755
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:20,956
Uh-huh.

756
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,251
Hey.

757
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,418
Do I look like a cop?

758
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:30,131
(kitten mewing on video)

759
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,591
(laughing)

760
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,843
Ah. Finally, you're here. Right.

761
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,262
I promise this will be more fun

762
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,972
than light beers
and <i>Bachelor</i> reruns.

763
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,557
Your jokes
never get old.

764
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,850
Oh, come on, who doesn't
love a sex party?

765
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:41,685
Then again, if you're me,

766
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:43,520
every party's a sex party
of sorts.

767
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:44,646
DAN:
It's illegal, for starters.

768
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,273
Why do you think they
change the location every night?

769
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,233
No liquor license,
underage girls...

770
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,734
Well, the world's
oldest profession

771
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,611
seems to be surviving
quite nicely.

772
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,946
Hello, chaps.

773
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,782
Yes, my first startup
was a sex club, actually.

774
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:57,617
Little place called "Eden".
Perhaps you've heard of it?

775
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,619
I'm... good.
Thank you.

776
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,039
Best case scenario,
this club exploits women.

777
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,958
Worst case? It got those girls
a belly full of poison.

778
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:05,959
Mm.

779
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,003
- One other thing.
- Hm?

780
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,046
I'm not sure
why he's here.

781
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,258
Only dullards drink alone.

782
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,968
Yes, he's a tad anxious
these days.

783
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,469
I thought a night out
would do him good.

784
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,221
Right. Well,
we have one mission:

785
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,473
to find out who
knew the dead girls.

786
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,726
And remember--
we're undercover, okay?

787
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,186
(chuckling):
As if you could look like
anything other than a cop.

788
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:26,521
I do not look like a cop!

789
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:27,689
Cop.

790
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,899
(sighs with frustration)

791
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:31,818
All right, will you guys
just please,

792
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,361
for God's sake, be chill?

793
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:36,239
And three rules:
no drinking, no touching...

794
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,491
...and just keep everything
low-key.

795
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,952
Yes!
(laughing)

796
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,538
- (woman laughing)
- DAN: Oh, my God.

797
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:46,166
This is not helping us find out
who knew the dead girls.

798
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:48,501
Agreed. His shimmy is
a tad off-putting.

799
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,836
AMENADIEL:
Come on, Luci!

800
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,838
Come cut a rug
with your big bro!

801
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,006
LUCIFER:
Uh. No, no,
no, no, no.

802
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:54,341
White man's overbite,

803
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,925
that is definitely
where I draw the line.

804
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,218
Hold on a second.

805
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:58,511
Look at the bar.

806
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:01,765
It's liquid nitrogen.

807
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:03,141
It's the same thing
that caused damage

808
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,684
to Daria Mitchell's
stomach lining.

809
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:05,852
Yes.

810
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,064
Hey, buddy.

811
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:09,939
Hey.

812
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,650
What do you know
about these two girls?

813
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,572
Not so fast,
buddy boy.

814
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,367
Seems my martini isn't the
only thing here that's dirty.

815
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:21,993
- (straining)
- Mmm.

816
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,495
A drink to savor,
don't you think?

817
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,121
Ah...
(inhales)

818
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,706
Want to explain
why you ran?

819
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,250
Come on.
You're obviously a cop.

820
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,919
- (chuckles)
- Shut it.

821
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,504
I figured you were
here to bust me.

822
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,381
Yes, we are
here to bust you.

823
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:36,966
For the untimely fate of
two innocent Nebraskan girls.

824
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,010
Wait... what?

825
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,178
LUCIFER: It's funny
how killers go deaf

826
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,638
at the moment of reckoning,
isn't it?

827
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:42,639
No, no. I...

828
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,099
I'm no killer.

829
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:46,559
I-I-I keep an eye on
the girls that work here

830
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:48,436
and serve the pervs drinks.

831
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:49,646
And pot...

832
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:51,439
Maybe a bit of "E."

833
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,650
- What about mandrake?
- Who's Mandrake?

834
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:56,027
Did you put poison in these
two girls' drinks?

835
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,697
No-no. What? No.
I-I remember these girls.

836
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,740
Their drinks were clean
when I made 'em.

837
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:02,242
Who was paying for 'em?

838
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,328
I don't know, it was some
Hollywood dirtbag with a gold card.

839
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,706
You'll need to be
a little more specific.

840
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,417
It's... Yuri something.

841
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:11,668
He's not here
tonight though.

842
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:13,670
I guess your two dead girls

843
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,004
and the other blonde must have
really worn him out.

844
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:15,839
DAN:
Wait a minute.

845
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,048
- There were <i>three</i> blondes?
- Yeah.

846
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:18,550
Your two newbies

847
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:19,592
and their hot friend.

848
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:20,468
Right. First name:

849
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:21,928
"Hot", last name "Friend"?

850
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,013
They don't use
their real names.

851
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:25,765
She's one of our
regulars though.

852
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,684
You know, life of the party.

853
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,102
Oh, she won't be
the life of anything,

854
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,229
if we don't get to her before
lady killer Yuri has his way.

855
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,439
If he hasn't already.

856
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:33,523
(sighing):
Thank you.

857
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:34,524
(clears throat)

858
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,446
Oh, silly me.

859
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:41,781
(sighs)

860
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,783
Come on. Rise and shine,
Crantini.

861
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:44,868
- Time to go.
- (groaning)

862
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:46,161
Yeah.
Let's do this.

863
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:46,953
(grunting)

864
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:50,957
(Lucifer laughing)

865
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,292
Gosh, I wish I got that
on video.

866
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,501
Oh, I can get that
on video!

867
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,128
Hold on.
Douche-cam.

868
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,272
Must have been some party.

869
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,107
Ah, that's funny.

870
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:18,443
And I'll laugh after we find
this Yuri scumbag.

871
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:20,278
You have anything
on the third girl?

872
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,322
Bartender said she was,
"Blonde, hot,

873
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,448
and had an exposed midriff".

874
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,950
Which describes half
the population of L.A.

875
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:26,868
Well, the chef's wife,

876
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,077
Gisele, fits
that description.

877
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,455
Yeah, but when you saw her,
she was healthy.

878
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:31,831
You think she could have
worked with Naomi

879
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,166
and Daria
at the sex club?

880
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:34,793
She knew them

881
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,211
through her husband's
restaurant.

882
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,171
I mean, but part-time
sex worker?

883
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,340
Would that be the first thing
you put on your résumé?

884
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,342
No. But if she was there,

885
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,385
she was witness to everything
that went down that night.

886
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:46,679
So, maybe Yuri's after her.

887
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:47,972
Yeah, well, the tech
got Yuri's info

888
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:49,724
from the credit card
he used at the sex party.

889
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:50,975
Only has a P.O. box.

890
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:53,269
No home address, but I did get
a cell and a plate number.

891
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:54,103
Okay, good.

892
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:55,480
Lucifer and I
will go find Yuri,

893
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:56,648
and, uh,

894
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,233
and, um...

895
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,026
- (Lucifer laughing)
- ...you track down Gisele.

896
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,070
(laughing continues)

897
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:03,404
Oh...

898
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:04,364
DAN:
Copy that.

899
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,574
That is...

900
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,036
What did Maze win

901
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,372
and why does it involve
my tragic drunk face?

902
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,665
Just a little wager.

903
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:15,458
Well, you had a lot
on your mind,

904
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,960
so I decided
to distract you,

905
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:18,545
with "girls' night."

906
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,173
Last night was a setup?

907
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,092
Yes. Well, you had fun,
didn't you?

908
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,260
You should be
thanking me.

909
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:29,430
What are you doing?

910
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:31,850
- Detective...
- (snaps picture)

911
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,565
(grunts)

912
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,316
Uh, hey, Davis
hasn't seen Gisele,

913
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,151
and she's, uh,
not answering her cell,

914
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,112
so if Yuri has her,
we've got to get there fast.

915
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:45,154
CHLOE:
I'm on my way.

916
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,447
Detective...

917
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,200
What did you say to her?

918
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,461
LAPD. Get out
of the car, Yuri.

919
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,547
LUCIFER:
Good Lord, you could at least

920
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,424
fork out for a room, Yuri.

921
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,259
- (Yuri retching)
- LUCIFER: No, no, no, no!

922
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:07,468
Not the Italian leather!

923
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:09,178
Bloody hell!

924
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,055
Yeah, more like karma.

925
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,267
We know you were
at the sex club last night,

926
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:16,352
and you're responsible
for the death of two girls.

927
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,104
What do you know
about Gisele?

928
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,565
I don't know anyone
named Gisele.

929
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,025
You have it all wrong.

930
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,319
I only went to that club

931
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:27,447
because Crystal
promised me newbies.

932
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:29,866
I paid five grand apiece

933
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:31,367
for those two
sweethearts.

934
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:32,452
Who's Crystal?

935
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,454
She was with Daria
and Naomi.

936
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,748
Then you should most
definitely ask for a refund.

937
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:40,168
I know. Those girls had no
idea that I was their date.

938
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:41,544
You're telling me
Daria and Naomi

939
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:43,129
had no idea
it was a sex club?

940
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:44,422
No.

941
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,050
When they found out,
they wanted to leave.

942
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:49,218
Crystal bought them drinks,

943
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,846
but they drank them
and bailed anyway.

944
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,766
I was so upset that
I took the last sip and--

945
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,392
You drank the rest
of the poison.

946
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:00,897
I have been sick
ever since.

947
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,106
Oh, God.

948
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,025
Oh, no, no, no.
Not again.

949
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,111
Is Gisele Crystal?

950
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,529
LUCIFER:
Oh, you mean the chef's wife?

951
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:10,156
Could she be the one
who killed Daria and Naomi?

952
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:11,741
Well, Daria was sleeping
with her husband,

953
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,701
so if anyone had a bone to pick,
it would be her.

954
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,204
(panting)

955
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,122
Yuri, do you know
Crystal's real name?

956
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:20,875
No. But I have a picture.

957
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,794
Oh, lovely.
I'll take that.

958
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,630
Right. Ooh, pecker pic.

959
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:27,924
- Pecker pic.
- Eww!

960
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:29,592
Oh, hold on.

961
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,345
CHLOE:
That's not Gisele.

962
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,639
No, and that blonde hair
doesn't look real either.

963
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:36,641
CHLOE:
You're right, it's a wig.

964
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,185
And the girl wearing it
looks real familiar.

965
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,694
Oh, it's just rush, rush, rush
in this town, isn't it?

966
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,529
Oh, hi, detectives.

967
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:52,115
I'm just putting
a few things in storage.

968
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:53,533
I'm going back home.

969
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:55,284
Right, you can take the girl
out of Nebraska,

970
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:57,370
but you can't take Nebraska
out of the girl.

971
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,746
Or can you?

972
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:01,290
I don't feel safe
in L.A. anymore.

973
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,376
You wouldn't either
if two of your neighbors

974
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:04,460
wound up dead.

975
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,004
Don't you just hate that?

976
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,339
I'm sorry, I have
a flight at 3:00.

977
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:09,257
LUCIFER:
Yes, and I've
just discovered

978
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:10,925
this wonderful thing
called Facebook.

979
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,844
- Have you heard of it?
- I have to go, please.

980
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,637
'Cause Facebook's
heard of you.

981
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:17,306
It knows that you're a big
deal in your small town.

982
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:21,561
A ten back home,
but in L.A., just a five.

983
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,938
Things haven't worked out
for you here, have they, Lily?

984
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,817
So much heartache,
struggle, compromise.

985
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:29,610
It made you
desperate enough

986
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,279
to turn against your own
sorority sisters,

987
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:32,613
Daria and Naomi.

988
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,949
No. Daria and Naomi
were my friends.

989
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,367
- (chuckles)
- CHLOE: Were they?

990
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,870
Because we know you were
with them the night they died.

991
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,872
You said you hadn't
seen 'em for a week.

992
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,040
You have no proof of that.

993
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:45,543
Except for a photo taken
by your charming buddy Yuri.

994
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:47,253
Nice wig, by the way.

995
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:49,714
Really brings out
the murder in your eyes.

996
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,387
Seems kitties do have claws.

997
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:03,061
Please, just let me go.

998
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:04,937
Is this the part where you wish
I had a gun, Detective?

999
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,731
Shut up, Lucifer,
I got this.

1000
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,816
You pretended to be
a friend to those girls.

1001
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:10,276
Shame on you.
(coughs)

1002
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,070
They called <i>me!</i>

1003
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:13,946
They were desperate
for my help.

1004
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,991
The best workout class,
where to hike...

1005
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,117
this apartment!

1006
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:20,411
They asked you for help
and you preyed on them?

1007
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,996
I was doing them
a favor.

1008
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:23,956
What, by putting mandrake
in their drinks?

1009
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,334
I thought it was
an organic kind of roofie.

1010
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,086
I didn't know that
it would kill them.

1011
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,171
I was just trying
to loosen them up.

1012
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,631
You were trying to make
an extra buck

1013
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,132
by bringing in
a couple newbies.

1014
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:36,677
I won the Dame Judith
acting award in college.

1015
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,472
I was the <i>president</i> of our sorority.

1016
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,724
I should have
made it by now!

1017
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,227
L.A. was supposed
to be easy!

1018
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,813
- (cell phone chiming)
- Oh, phones...

1019
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:48,773
They can be
so distracting.

1020
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:57,365
There's a special place in Hell
for women who fake friendships

1021
00:35:57,573 --> 00:36:01,119
as a way of manipulating
other women!

1022
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,663
She's right, you know.

1023
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,000
And I think we have
a silver lining, Detective.

1024
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,837
What with Lily going away,
and Daria and Naomi dead,

1025
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:12,839
I believe that there's
an apartment vacancy.

1026
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:15,466
Are you seriously suggesting
that I should move

1027
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:16,801
into a dead girl's apartment?

1028
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,303
No, no, no, the killer's place
is much nicer.

1029
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:22,140
I mean, just look
at this view!

1030
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:48,958
How'd you get
in here?

1031
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:53,462
Let's just say Samantha at the front
desk is no longer into men.

1032
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:57,133
What, you still mad?

1033
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:00,219
What was all that stuff
about being my tribe?

1034
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:01,888
You had fun,
didn't you?

1035
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,016
I don't have time for this.

1036
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,976
I have work to do.
You can go.

1037
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,025
I wasn't totally
faking it.

1038
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:19,488
Like when I strangled
psycho chick for the win.

1039
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:20,990
<i>That</i> was genuine.

1040
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,408
Gee, thanks.

1041
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:25,870
You know, I wouldn't just
kick ass for anyone.

1042
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,331
Okay, fine, I would.

1043
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:31,834
But this time
it was... sweeter.

1044
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:34,879
This is some twisted
version of an apology?

1045
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:36,589
I don't do apologies.

1046
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,633
But I don't want
to kill you anymore.

1047
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:42,595
You're a very,
very deranged person.

1048
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:44,055
Thanks.

1049
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,475
So, we're still good
to be roomies, right?

1050
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:48,643
What are you
talking about, <i>roomies?</i>

1051
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:49,810
We shook on it.

1052
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,687
Post-karaoke,
pre-potbelly dude.

1053
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:53,272
What?

1054
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,024
I told you I was
in between places.

1055
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:56,484
You said that you were
looking for someone

1056
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:57,818
to share expenses.

1057
00:37:58,027 --> 00:37:58,945
Don't you remember?

1058
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:03,532
The missing half hour.

1059
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:06,410
Look... I've got money.

1060
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:09,163
I like your kid,
and you dress like crap,

1061
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,374
so I won't be stealing
any of your clothes.

1062
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,459
What, you got
a better plan?

1063
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:18,589
You said you wanted
fun, Decker.

1064
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,300
Fun.

1065
00:38:22,677 --> 00:38:23,678
Oh, my...

1066
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:28,391
Roommates?

1067
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,684
You and Detective Decker?

1068
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:32,228
(laughs)
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1069
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:34,647
And have I mentioned "no,"
and also, "no"?

1070
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:37,024
- You're not my boss anymore.
- Well, that may be.

1071
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,985
But I can't have the women
in my life teaming up.

1072
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:40,361
I'll be outnumbered.

1073
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:43,531
Dad forbid you manage to
have sex with her before I do.

1074
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,908
Oh, actually, can I interest you
in another wager?

1075
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:48,119
No. Done deal.
Pay up.

1076
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,913
(sighs) Fine,
the convertible's yours.

1077
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,164
I'm over that.

1078
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:53,833
Well, the hot,
new bartender.

1079
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,126
Been there, done that.

1080
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:56,544
Well, spit it out
then, Maze.

1081
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:57,712
What is it you want?

1082
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:03,884
I want a drink.

1083
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:06,595
What, that's it?

1084
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,431
Fine. Pick any bottle,
pull two glasses.

1085
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,226
No, I want you
to pour <i>me</i> a drink.

1086
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,104
All right.

1087
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,492
To newly defined
relationships.

1088
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:30,244
Cheers.

1089
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:31,787
(elevator bell dings)

1090
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:36,667
Oh... please...

1091
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,461
don't drink
in front of me.

1092
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,796
Bad case of the
distractions, brother?

1093
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:43,466
- (chuckles)
- Well, I better go.

1094
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:45,343
MAZE: I'll let you deal
with the lightweight.

1095
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:46,635
(Amenadiel groans)

1096
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:48,679
Judging from your
behavior last night,

1097
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:51,015
that lunatic dancing,
I fear that my advice

1098
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,059
may have created a whole
new set of problems.

1099
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:55,853
No more turning
a "blind eye," Lucifer.

1100
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:57,646
(groans)
Listen...

1101
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:02,735
We both know that Dad
is not the kind

1102
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:03,694
to forgive and forget.

1103
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:06,614
No distraction on earth
is gonna change that.

1104
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,407
I said that I would
punish Mom,

1105
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:10,534
and I'm doing so
here on earth.

1106
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:12,536
Deal maintained,
loophole achieved.

1107
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:13,871
What if He doesn't
feel that way?

1108
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,083
There will be real
consequences, Luci,

1109
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,376
for all of us.

1110
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:19,794
Especially me.

1111
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,129
You know, I liked
you better drunk.

1112
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:24,799
Tell me something, brother,
what deal <i>did</i> you make?

1113
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:27,468
What was worth writing
Father, of all people,

1114
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:28,552
a blank check?

1115
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:30,971
Not a what.
A who.

1116
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:41,607
You made a deal
for Chloe's <i>life?</i>

1117
00:40:41,816 --> 00:40:43,150
Don't look at me like that!

1118
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,985
At the time, it made
a certain amount of sense.

1119
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,320
Don't you understand?

1120
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:49,448
You made a deal
to return Mom to Hell.

1121
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:52,284
In exchange,
Chloe's life was spared.

1122
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:53,994
Well, that's one
interpretation.

1123
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,288
Despite whatever loopholes
you think you found,

1124
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:58,749
and the lies that
you have told yourself,

1125
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:01,419
you still haven't delivered
on your end of the bargain.

1126
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:04,672
Luci, what if Dad
decides to

1127
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:06,882
take back His side
of the deal?

1128
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:09,427
(laughs)

1129
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:12,596
One silly human soul?

1130
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:16,475
I can't imagine Dad would
take much interest in that.

1131
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:19,645
CHLOE:
<i>Yes, two adult women and a child.</i>

1132
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:20,980
MAN (over phone):
Just bring over a deposit,

1133
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,022
and the apartment's yours.

1134
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:25,317
Really? Oh, yeah,
I will, uh...

1135
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:27,319
Great, I'll drop off
a check right away.

1136
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:29,238
- Okay, thank you.
- MAN: Of course.
