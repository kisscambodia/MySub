00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:09,260
Well, where else would I go?

00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:10,553
Your return to the Underworld

6
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:12,305
has been requested.

7
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:14,933
Remind Dad that I quit Hell
because I was sick and tired

8
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,351
of playing a part in his play.

and desire's

12
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:21,731
More like a gift from God,
really.

13
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,149
Why don't I affect you,
Detective?

14
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:24,859
I guess we both have

26
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,089
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

What does Father want?

28
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:48,717

those are all

Terrible karma,

00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:32,761
but more importantly,

45
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,221
is this really how you want
to spend your time on Earth?

46
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,806
I don't know who you are,

47
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:39,225
but if you don't step back,
I will kill you.

48
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:40,351
(chuckles)

49
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,227
But that's not what

50
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:42,479
you really desire, is it?

51
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:46,608
No, it isn't.

52
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,735
So, what do you want?

53
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,237
Freedom.

54
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:52,530
LUCIFER:
Oh...

55
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,365
just as I suspected.

56
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:56,076
You were tired of being
a prisoner, weren't you?

57
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:57,744
Yeah, that's right.

58
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,329
I-I-I couldn't take it anymore.

59
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,748
So you wanted to break
your shackles, be reborn.

60
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:02,749
I did.

61
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:03,750
So you escaped Hell,

62
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:04,751
looking for an empty body,

63
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,044
and found
this poor sod,

64
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,504
who'd just died
of a heart attack,

65
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,256
and now here you are,
wreaking havoc on Earth.

66
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:12,092
The jig is up.

67
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,511
We found you, Mum.

68
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,596
Wait, what?

69
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:18,932
You just said you wanted
to escape your shackles.

70
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,016
Yeah.

71
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,935
When the paramedics
brought me back,

72
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,645
I realized I needed to be free.

73
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,271
Yes, from Hell.

74
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,773
No, man, from debt.

75
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,525
I owe a ton of money.

76
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,485
And this was gonna get me
out from underneath it.

77
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:31,945
You know what, I'm sick of this.

78
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,655
The two of you are...

79
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:34,781
(sighs)

80
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:35,782
It's not Mom.

81
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,158
Oh, you think?

82
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,284
AMENADIEL:
Well, we had to check.

83
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:39,702
She doesn't have a body.

84
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:41,454
She must have entered
a human form

85
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:42,956
of someone who's recently died.

86
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,290
Which means anyone
who kicked the bucket

87
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:46,042
whilst you were sleeping
on the job.

88
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,211
Luci, do you realize
he's the last one on our list?

89
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:51,297
Well, you must have missed one.

90
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:53,091
Or maybe she's not
in Los Angeles.

91
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,301
(laughing):
No, she's here.

92
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,387
I kept her prisoner
for thousands of years.

93
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,304
She's coming for me.

94
00:02:58,513 --> 00:02:59,305
I know it.

95
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:01,057
We just need to get
to her first.

00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,642
(sighs)

97
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:04,144
Are you coming?!

98
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:05,937
In a moment.

99
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,940
There's so much punishment,
so little time.

In human terms,

119
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:50,064
once upon a time,
a boy met a girl,

120
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,066
and they fell in love.

121
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,484
They had sex.

122
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:54,986
The only trouble was,

123
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,321
they were celestial beings,

124
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:58,448
so that moment created
the universe.

125
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,949
Mm, the Big Bang?

126
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,368
Never knew how appropriate
the name was until now, did you?

127
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,287
Anyway, they became
Mum and Dad.

128
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:07,874
They had a whole litter of kids,
including yours truly.

129
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,375
And they built a house.

130
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:10,501
They called it Heaven.

131
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,544
They were happy.

132
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:12,837
Dad was...

133
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,924
well, Dad, and Mum...

134
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:20,345
Well, Mum was rather lovely
in the beginning.

135
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:23,765
(sighs)

136
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,058
But things change, don't they?

137
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,269
Dad started going
into the garage

138
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,064
and tinkering with a little
project he called humanity.

139
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:36,236
Mum grew cold... distant.

140
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:37,820
(inhales deeply)

141
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:40,114
And pretty soon, they were both
neglecting their family.

142
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,784
And then one of his children
started to act out?

143
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,077
Indeed.

144
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,745
Yeah... so Dad got pissed off

145
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:47,330
and tossed me out of the house.

146
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:49,666
And what did your mother do?

147
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,417
Nothing.

148
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,796
She just stood there
and let it happen.

149
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,716
Anyway, a couple
of thousand years later,

150
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,468
Dad kicked her out, too.

151
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:03,554
Cast her into Hell
and put her in a cell.

152
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,474
So, I did the same for her
as she did for me.

153
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:08,893
Zilch.

154
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:12,230

00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:14,607
CHLOE:

158
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,778
It's bringing back memories
of your acting days?

159
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:20,029
If you're feeling nostalgic,

160
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:22,824
sure I can find some horny
teenagers and a hot tub.

161
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:24,993
'Cause the movie
you were in was...

162
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:25,952
Yeah, I got it.

163
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,161
Is everything all right,
Detective?

164
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,788
You seem distracted.

165
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:30,290
Usually I get at least
a glimmer of a smile

166
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:31,291

167
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,583
the occasional eye roll.

168
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,585
I think I got
a snort once.

169
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,671
Two days ago, you were
shot point-blank.

170
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,506
Ah, well, no need to
thank me for my heroism.

171
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:39,507
Well, maybe just a little.

172
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:40,425
No one's stopping you.

173
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,634
(chuckles)

174
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:43,052
There was blood
all over you.

175
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,429
You should be dead.

176
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:45,888
Well, par for the course
for our adventures,

177
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:46,931
Detective.
What's new?

178
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,391
I have a sample of your blood

179
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,851
and I'm gonna take it
and test it.

180
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,352
- Oh.
- And I'm gonna find out

181
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:52,895
exactly what you are
once and for all.

182
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:53,896
- Yeah.
- Oh.

183
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:55,189
The Devil himself?

184
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:56,441
No, I'm guessing
Larry Morningstar,

185
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,817
the son of a plumber
in Connecticut.

186
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:59,819
Right, well, wrap
that up, would you?

187
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:01,154
'Cause I could use
your help on my end.

188
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,447
I'm on a bit of a manhunt.

189
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:05,575
Well, womanhunt, and I need
to find her before...

190
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,039
I'm too late.

191
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:13,082
♪♪

192
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,968
(sighs)

193
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,928
So, our victim's name
is Gillian Taylor.

194
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,890
She was a stand-in for the lead
actress on <i>Leave It to Leslie.</i>

195
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,350
Stand-in?

196
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,101
Yeah, stand-ins are
used to light a scene

197
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,436
as the actors prep.

198
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,771
Usually want to be
actors themselves.

199
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,482
And now she's dead
because of me.

200
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,649
What do you mean,
because of you?

201
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:39,984
Well, remind you
of anyone?

202
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,028
That's weird.

203
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,196
CHLOE:
What's weird, Ella?

204
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:44,697
Well...

205
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,116
you'd think
cause of death would be

206
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:48,409
the giant
chunks of metal

207
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,161
sticking out of her head,
but no,

208
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,621
she was strangled.
Look.

209
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,955
You can see the contusions
on her neck.

210
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:54,749
So, the horns were added
postmortem?

211
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:58,044
Yeah, soft tissue at the point
of impact is yellow-pink.

212
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,837
That means that there
was no blood pressure

213
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,714
when our killer
went all stabby-stab.

214
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:02,757
And...

215
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,717
she was killed somewhere else.

216
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,677
This body
was moved here.

217
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,137
So, the killer is sending
a message.

218
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,098
Ah, good, so you agree with me.

219
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:12,016
I didn't say the
message was to you.

220
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:13,476
Well, who else
would it be for?

221
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,103
(sighs)

222
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,187
What the hell?

223
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:20,525
Oh, joy of joys,
I thought Detective Douche

224
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:21,567
was in jail.

225
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:22,819
He's suspended.

226
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:24,195
Or at least he was.

227
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:25,780
Give us a minute.

228
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:26,823
Hi.

229
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:27,907
Hey.

230
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:29,409
What are you doing here?

231
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,285
I've been reinstated.

232
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:32,161
What?

233
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:33,746
After Malcolm and everything

234
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:34,580
that happened at Palmetto,

235
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:35,873
they wanted to sweep everything
under the rug.

236
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:37,375
And the only thing
I confessed to was

237
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,835
improperly checking out
evidence.

238
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,169
A gun that killed someone.

239
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:41,546
I didn't ask for this.

240
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:43,131
You didn't turn it down, either.

241
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,340
Would you rather I go to jail?

242
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:45,883
You think Trixie
would prefer that?

243
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:49,929
No, it's just...
it's a lot to take in.

244
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:52,598
(scoffs)

245
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:55,268
I've been demoted.

246
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:56,561
I've been reassigned

247
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,938
to assist on cases, so...

248
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,274
for now, how can I help?

249
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,235
Uh, interview crew members.

250
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:06,446
See if they know anything,
any enemies she had.

251
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:07,738
I mean, you know.

252
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,240
Thanks, Chloe.

253
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,283
Yeah.

254
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:16,664
You're a newbie,
aren't you?

255
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:18,416
Oh, hey, yeah.

256
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,042
Ella Lopez.

257
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,794
I just transferred
in a couple days ago.

258
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:24,297
You must be Detective Decker's
civilian consultant.

259
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,090
Lucifer Morningstar.

260
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:26,966
Cool.

261
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:29,010
I was expecting

262
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,595
a different reaction considering

263
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:31,596
your choice of bling.

264
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:32,847
Oh.

265
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,098
Dude, I had a friend
named Adolf.

266
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:35,224
Okay, Adolf.

267
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:36,642
I didn't hold it against him.

268
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,060
- (chuckles)
- And besides, I think the Devil

269
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,770
- gets a bad rap.
- Oh.

270
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,272
- You do, do you?
- Sure.

271
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,900
I mean, what did he really
do that was so bad?

272
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,610
What, rebel against his dad?

273
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:47,904
Ask some naked lady
if she wanted an apple?

274
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,614
Be still my heart.
Do go on.

275
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,491
I suppose he does run Hell.

276
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,784
That's not so great,
you know, with the torture

277
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:54,744
and eternal damnation.

278
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,037
I'm retired.

279
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,538
And besides,
I didn't create Hell.

280
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:58,539
I just worked there.

281
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:00,541
And now you're talking

282
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,709
in the first person.

283
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:03,586
Wait.

284
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:04,670
- Are you...
- The Devil?

285
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,422
- ...a method actor?
- What?

286
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,548
(groans)

287
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,301
(clamoring)

288
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,387
Not exactly an
Emmy-worthy performance

289
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:14,680
from our child actor.

290
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,307
LUCIFER:
And her dick nozzle boyfriend.

291
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:17,183
CHLOE:
Weird, for a girl

292
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,476
who normally doesn't
wear mascara,

293
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:19,727
she's certainly
wearing a lot.

294
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:20,811
I wonder why.

295
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:22,396
Trixie loves her show.

296
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:23,898
Oh, my God, me, too.

297
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:29,695
LUCIFER: Sweet candy
coating on the outside,

298
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,531
delicious evil
on the inside?

299
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,199
Or she just likes
the attention.

300
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,451
Either way, she's got a wall
of reps surrounding her.

301
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,869
I've got a call in
to interview her.

302
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,913
But for now let's
focus on Gillian.

303
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:39,997
Yeah.

304
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,796
Gillian rented from me
for four years.

305
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,257
Such a sweet, strong girl.

306
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:52,218
You know, I... I don't have
a daughter, but, uh...

307
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,889
You know, she got so close
on so many auditions.

308
00:09:57,098 --> 00:10:01,060
I... I really thought that
she was gonna break in.

309
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,148
This is my fault.

310
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,109
Why do you say that?

311
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,236
WOMAN:
Well, I work as a set nurse.

312
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,487
I pull a few strings.

313
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,322
I got her that job.

314
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,324
If she hadn't met Amy...

315
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:16,784
Do you think
Amy did this?

316
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:19,829
No, sweet, darling,
innocent Amy?

317
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,540
Oh, I'm sensing sarcasm
and general loathing.

318
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,792
Oh, that girl's
a bad influence.

319
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,253
She has so much cocaine
up her nose, it would snow

320
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,046
- if you shook her.
- (chuckles)
Yes, I've tried that.

321
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,631
WOMAN:
The show kept it
out of the news.

322
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,924
They even hid her O.D.

323
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,467
a couple of days ago.

324
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,720
Hospital was barely able
to start her heart again.

325
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:36,762
Well, hold on.

326
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,764
You're saying Amy died,
then came back to life,

327
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,224
and then an innocent
girl was found dead

328
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,226
with devil horns
shoved into her skull?

329
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:44,979
I... guess that's
one way to put it.

330
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:46,397
Yes.

331
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,236
Maybe Gillian wasn't
as innocent as she seemed.

332
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,575
Well, maybe she needed the cash
to fund her flamingo army.

333
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,827
We need to check
on Gillian's financials.

334
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:02,788
See if she made any large
cash deposits and, if so, when.

335
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,999
I don't know.
Maybe we can find a pattern.

336
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,418
Well, it doesn't matter, because
I know who the killer is.

337
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:09,086
Really? Who?

338
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,007
My mum.

339
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:14,300
Your mom?

340
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,426
It's a long story, but I think

341
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:18,054
my mum's soul is
currently inside Amy.

342
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:20,514
She's the perfect choice
of host body, really.

343
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,767
Young, beautiful, worshipped
and adored by millions.

344
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,393
You're making less sense
than you normally do.

345
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,520
That's because you
still don't believe me!

346
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,981
Just test my
blood, Detective.

347
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,483
Then we can have
a real conversation.

348
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:37,657
♪ We wear red

349
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,909

352
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,331
LUCIFER:
Oh.

353
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:47,458
Look at you, all broody.

354
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,127
Suits you.

355
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,007
Well, don't worry.

356
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:56,884
Maze always turns
up eventually.

357
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:59,470
She's like a bad penny...
in tight leather pants.

358
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,846
(chuckles)

359
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,431
(sighs)

360
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,059
Unless, of course, you
scared her away for good.

Well, everything was fine until
you went all lovey-dovey on her.

363
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:11,857

- On a case.

She's going to test my blood.

Sure, I mean, what could
possibly go wrong

383
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,904
if angel blood enters the police

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,098
Yeah, they got
into a big fight

395
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,267
a couple days ago as they
were setting up a shot.

396

they weren't rolling audio.

Well, I get the gist of it.

398
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,733
Gillian had a bunch of money
hidden away at her place.

399
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,485
And then this blowup.

400

What do you think?

401
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:40,946
Amy had a secret drug problem?

402
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,449
Then Gillian found out about it
and was blackmailing her?

403
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,784

You don't?

440
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,661
What we care about is
that you and Gillian

441
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,746

right before she died. Why?

442

Does it matter?

443
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,041
We found a lot of cash
at Gillian's house,

444
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,251
so if she was
blackmailing you...

445
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,711
She wasn't
blackmailing me.

446
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,130
She was my sober
companion.

447
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,132
Well, clearly not very
good at it. (chuckles)

448
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:25,759
The production company thought
it was a good idea

449
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:29,054
to hire my stand-in to
<i>also</i> keep an eye on me.

450
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,931
They thought
it would help keep it a secret.

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,933
- What was the fight about?
- I was getting

452

me like a child.

453
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,103
I'm an adult!

454
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:37,730
I can make my own decisions.

455
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,231
Clearly.

456
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,905
I'd gotten a
new supply in.

457
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,490
She was trying
to take it away from me.

458
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,326
Oh.

459
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,001

So Gillian cut off
your supply.

463
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,801
That must have pissed off
your dealer. Who is he?

464
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,094
I-I never met him.

465
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,763
All I have
is a number.

466
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,681
I'd text him,
he'd messenger me the drugs.

467
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,476
Okay, good.
I'm gonna need that number.

468
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,478
Okay. Thank you.

469
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,564
Okay, so the production company

470
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:23,108
confirms that they paid Gillian
under the table

471
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,693
to be Amy's sober companion.

472
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,070
That explains the cash.

473
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,488
I mean, I'm not saying
Amy's innocent,

474
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:28,989
but I don't see
a motive anymore.

475
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,451
Well, what about our
emoji-loving drug dealer?

476
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:33,911
Could be a show of strength.

477
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,829
Making sure no one screws
with him in the future.

478
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:39,041
I put a warrant in to locate
his cell phone, and, uh...

479
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,167
What?

480
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,336
Do you still think
this is about you?

481
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,338
Of course I do, but it's
worse than I thought.

482
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,507
My mum is clearly
playing the long game.

483
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,426
Taunting me with my own
distorted image again and again.

484
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:52,972
No, really. Do you really think
the drug dealer is your mother?

485
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,015
Well, she's clever enough
to pull it all off.

486
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,476
What? You thought I
took after my dad?

487
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,813
Oh. You don't have to believe
anything I say, Detective.

488
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,314
Test my blood.

489
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,026
Oh, dearie me, why
are you hesitating?

490
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:07,695
Scared to find out the truth?

491
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,113
I'm not scared about anything

492
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,532
other than finding out
what STDs you have.

493
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,866

I'm sorry. I, uh...

501
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:54,950
I must have gotten lost.

502
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,957
(keys jingling)

503
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,584
Good night.

504
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,297
LINDA:
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>you deserve any of the blame</i>

505
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,590
<i>for what happened
with your mother?</i>

506
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,301
No. That's between her and Dad.

507
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,635
Then whose fault is it?

508
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,138
Well, I suppose
none of this would have happened

509
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,890
if Amenadiel had been
watching over Hell

510
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:18,891
like he was supposed to.

511
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,517
I thought that was your job.

512
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,437
Well, it was, but when
I abdicated, it became his.

513
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,606
Sort of like a game
of hot potato.

514
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,150
And then there's Maze.

515
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,401
And what about her?

516
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,611

517
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,071

518

be involved in all this.

519
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,240
Might explain why Mum was able

520
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,076
to hit the ground running
with my torment.

521
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:38,243
And

522
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:39,661

523
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,954
if it wasn't for the detective,

524
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,206
and she doesn't even know it!

525
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,540
And why is that?

526
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,751
Well, when I asked Father
for the favor, I...

527
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:48,253
(chuckles softly)

528
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:49,630
Look, it doesn't matter.

529
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,423
Even if I told her,
she wouldn't believe me anyway.

530
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,510
Sounds like there's a lot
of blame to go around.

531
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:55,886
Yes.

532
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:58,305
Is there anyone

533
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,265
(sighs)
Anyone I'm leaving out.

534
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:01,391
Um...

535
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,311
(clock ticking)

536
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,230
Oh, you're right.

537
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,525
Yes. If you'd fixed
my existential problem earlier,

538
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,026
none of this
would have happened.

539
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,946
Well, good on you for taking
responsibility, Doctor.

540
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,280
It's very noble.

541
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,283
Ah.

542
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,327
(laughs)

543
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:26,333
I worry you're not gaining
<i>anything</i> from our sessions.

544
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,835
- What do you mean?
- Lately,

545
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,170
you're using our sessions
as an excuse

546
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,006
to misinterpret
what I say for your own gain.

547
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,842
(laughs)
What?

548
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,010
I don't think
I'm actually helping you.

549
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:38,720
Are you breaking up with me?

550
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,305
I'm asking
the question.

551
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,641
Are our sessions
actually helping,

552
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,185
or just making things worse?

553
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,068
Lucifer?

554
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,488
You said you wanted to talk.

555
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,867
Hello, Chloe.

556
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:03,912
What's going on?

557
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,207
I was really hoping I wouldn't
have to do this, but...

558
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,127
recent developments have
left me with no other choice.

559
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,712
No other choice than to what?

560
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,755
You need to know
the truth, Chloe.

561
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,924
About Lucifer.

562
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:17,885
All right.

563
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:19,636
I'm listening.

564
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,931
Oh, I'm not gonna tell you.
I'm gonna show you.

565
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,310
What are you doing?

566
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:30,647
Amenadiel.
Amenadiel, no!

567
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,780
(gasping)

568
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:41,116
Okay, you're gonna be fine.

569
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,118
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
You're gon...

570
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,828
(sighs)

571
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,166
You c...

572
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,834
(panting)

573
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,922
You're... you're okay.

574
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,465
(panting)

575
00:20:58,634 --> 00:20:59,676
How?

576
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,596
Okay, this is going
to be hard for you to hear,

577
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,849
which is why I needed you
to see what Lucifer is.

578
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,477
No.

579
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:10,646
I don't believe it.

580
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:12,648
Good.

581
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,524
Because it's all a lie.

582
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,361
Bulletproof vest
and blood packs.

583
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,279
Are you insane?

584
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,156
You could have
killed yourself!

585
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:22,574
I was perfectly safe, Chloe.

586
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,117
This, by the way,
is what Lucifer wore

587
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,535
when you guys
confronted Malcolm.

588
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,537
- How would you know that?
- Because I put it on him.

589
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,164
He knew what
he was walking into.

590
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:33,293
Listen, everything that he does
is part of a performance.

591
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:36,630
All right.

592
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,674
Then what about the weird
mojo thing he does?

593
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,133
Neural linguistic programming?

594
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,594
The power of suggestion?

595
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,013
Look, he studied it
at a very young age.

596
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,516
And I hate to admit this, but
he's actually really good at it.

597
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,184
What about the fact
that you two are brothers?

598
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,020
Come on.
You've never heard of adoption?

599
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,774
Why? Why would he do all this?

600
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:57,693
Listen, what you
have to understand

601
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,987
is that my brother and I had
a very difficult childhood.

602
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:01,947
And to deal with
it, he created

603
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:06,076
this persona for himself--
Lucifer Morningstar, the Devil,

604
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:07,828
incorrigible and invincible.

605
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,162
So he's a liar?

606
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,747
Chloe, he means well,

607
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:12,207
but in the end, the only person

608
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,251
he ever truly lies to
is himself.

609
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,712
(phone ringing)

610
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:19,923
Decker.

611
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,842
You tracked our
dealer's phone? Great.

612
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,093
I'm on my way.

613
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,262
Any other questions?

614
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:26,847
Yeah.

615
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,307
Why tell me all this now?

616
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,434
Because you needed to know.

617
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,064
MAN:
<i>When I woke up a week later,</i>

618
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:39,067
they'd written in a...
a wisecracking neighbor.

619
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,903
You know, he-he got
all the best lines.

620
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,448
Your heart goes out to him,
doesn't it?

621
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:47,326
(sighs) A dealer
trying to find a buyer
at an AA meeting,

622
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:49,578
people at their
most vulnerable--
that's really low.

623
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,789
Yeah. It's also not something
my mum would even care about.

624
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,709
Because-- and I can't believe
I'm saying this--

625
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,252
the killer isn't your mother.

626
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,379
(sighs): Unfortunately,
I think you're right.

627
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:02,132
Dear me, this has all been
a wild goose chase.

628
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:03,216
Hey.

629
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,136
There's still a killer
out there, Lucifer.

630
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:07,929
And we tracked his
phone to this room.

631
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,639
We've got to figure out
who the dealer is.

632
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,600
MAN:
It was the lowest
point in my life.

633
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:12,976
Thanks, David.

634
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:14,603
OTHERS:
Thanks, David.

635
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,439
- All right, does anybody else
want to speak?

636
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:19,358
Yes, I'd like to say
something.

637
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,069
Thank you.

638
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:26,865
Hello.

639
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,035
My name is Lucifer Morningstar

640
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,371
and I...

641
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,791
<i>love</i> drugs.

642
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,959
- (people gasping)
- Love them! Mmm!

643
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,961
Yummy, yummy, yummy.
Can't get enough.

644
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,547
And... I've got lots of money...

645
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:45,801
(sniffs) mmm,
that I love spending on drugs.

646
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,636
Not even picky.
I'll do any of them.

647
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,846
Mix them together sometimes.
(chuckles)

648
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,848
You ever done a he-she?

649
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,309
No? A neon nod? A donk?

650
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,686
Ah. Yeah, he knows
what I'm talking about.

651
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,688
That man has definitely donked.
Haven't you?

652
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,858
Uh, the theme of the day
is your lowest point.

653
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,403
Right, my lowest point.
Well, geographically,

654
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,570
that would be Hell, of course.

655
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,865
Hard to get much lower
than that. (chuckles)

656
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,369
And...

657
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,628
Well, then I suppose it was
when my mother abandoned me.

658
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,217
Turnabout was fair play, so I...

659
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,302
abandoned her in turn.

660
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,681
Didn't even give her a chance
to defend herself.

661
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,392
I mean, what
could she possibly say

662
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,644
that would justify what she did?

663
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,568
What <i>would</i> she say?

664
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,034
Well, that was a disaster.

665
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,078
Actually, I thought
that was really impressive.

666
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,873
- You did? It didn't
draw anyone out.
- Yep.

667
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,374
That's not what
I was impressed with.

668
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,043
Hey, guys.
Looking to score?

669
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,546
Because I've got some
really good stuff,

670
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:05,839
if you've got cash.

671
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,215
Are we playing show and tell?

672
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,842
I got something to show you.

673
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:12,012
I actually found this on
the ground-- this isn't
even mine. I just...

674
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,555
(grunts)

675
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,682
No, it-it really
isn't. I...

676
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,560
Oh, okay. Where-where
did those come from?

677
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,021
Right. Now I've flushed out
your dealer,

678
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,063
do you mind if I...?

679
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:23,440
Knock yourself out.

680
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:25,775
Those really
are not mine.

681
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,319
CHLOE:
Oh, of course they aren't.

682
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,362
You don't really think
I could do that to someone?

683
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,698
I think you were
pissed off that someone
blocked your meal ticket,

684
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:33,283
and I think you were trying
to send a message, yeah.

685
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,535
Yeah, but I couldn't
do <i>that</i>. That...

686
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,913
Oh, God.
Is that her skull?

687
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,916
(retches)
Can you take that away, please?

688
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:42,501
Not until you tell me
what you know about...

689
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,544
(retches, coughs)

690
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:46,546
Oh, God.

691
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:47,756
(exhales)

692
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,883
That poor girl.

693
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:53,678
All right, if
it wasn't you,

694
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,639
then who would want to
make it look like it was?

695
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,186
If she had a dealer
before me, you know, I...

696
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,731
I doubt... I doubt he was happy
I stole his best buyer.

697
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:07,984

00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:53,989
Oh, there you are, Maze.

711
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,491
I've missed you.

712
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,505
So, where the hell
have you been, Maze?

713
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:12,757
Away.

714
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:14,593
Wonderfully vague,

715
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,053
but you'll have to be a tad
more specific, I'm afraid.

716
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:18,305
I needed you.

717
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:20,056
Oh.

718
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,310
So I'm supposed to just come
running whenever you need me?

719
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:25,895
Yes. That's exactly what
you're supposed to do.

720
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:29,190
- And why is that?
- Because since fire
and brimstone,

721
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,734
that's just how
it is between us.

722
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,277
Through thick and thin.

723
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,655
So, come on. Where were you?

724
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:36,990
Shouldn't you be
more concerned

725
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,034
with the guy
I just saved you from?

726
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:42,245
Oh, please. I'm only vulnerable
when the detective is around.

727
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,081
(low, muffled grunting nearby)

728
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,042
So, who is he?

729
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:50,211
LUCIFER: Amy Dodd's
dick nozzle boyfriend.

730
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:55,050
- She's the actress
from <i>Leave It...</i>
- ♪ Leave it to Leslie. ♪

731
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,594
What? It makes me laugh.

732
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:00,722
Well, he must have seen me
going into Amy's trailer
when I thought she was Mum.

733
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:02,432
Jealous, were you?

734
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:04,434
Wanted to prove yourself
to be a big boy

735
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:05,935
by waving a knife in my face?

736
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,312
Wait, your mom escaped Hell?

737
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,480
Yes.

738
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:10,065
Funny timing,
isn't it?

739
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:11,900
She slipped out whilst
Amenadiel was injured.

740
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,026
And you, uh...

741
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,403
Well, where were you, Maze?

742
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:17,614
Wait, you think I'm helping her?

743
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,199
Have you forgotten

744
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,950
who actually
tortured her in Hell?

745
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:24,204
Well, desperation makes
for strange bedfellows.

746
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,999
I've just pictured you in bed
with my mom.

747
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,335
Oh, I can't un-see that now.

748
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,588
So, Mama Morningstar's
on the loose.

749
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:35,715
I never could
break that woman.

750
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,467
She wouldn't submit.

751
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,595
Seems like I have
another chance.

752
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:41,971
(low grunting)

753
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:44,307
You sure
he doesn't know anything?

754
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,018
(grunts)
What is wrong with you people?!

755
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,270
Yes, I'm sure.
Give me that.

756
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:52,816
(muffled talking)

757
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:54,984
I think he would disagree.

758
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:56,152
(muffled talking)

759
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:57,028
Fine.

760
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:02,075
I know things...
about the murder.

761
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,911
We found the drug dealer with
the adorable devil drawings.

762
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:07,163
- Case closed.
- You think Irwin killed her?

763
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,083
- No, he'd never do that.
- Maybe, maybe not. Don't care.

764
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,835
You guys are with the cops,
though, right?

765
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,421
More of a day job thingy--
got much more pressing issues

766
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:15,338
at the moment.

767
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,756
Right, seriously...

768
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,968
if you weren't helping my mom,
then where were you?

769
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:23,388
(groans):
Ah...

770
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:27,851
I was with a friend.

771
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:29,144
Friend?

772
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,645
Demons don't
have friends.

773
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:33,773
Someone who's been helping me
do some...

774
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,068
...soul-searching.

775
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:38,737
What, like hunting them
down and killing them?

776
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,613
(scoffs)
I wish.

777
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:42,532
That would be a lot easier.

778
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:44,117
No.

779
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,870
Now that we are stuck here,
I need to figure out...

780
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:49,581
where I fit in.

781
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,374
And she's been
helping me do that.

782
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,376
(chuckling)

783
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,837
Thanks. I knew
you wouldn't understand.

784
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:58,047
- I barely do.
- (muffled talking)

785
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,924
(continues
muffled talking)

786
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:02,343
What?

787
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,012
Amy had another drug dealer.

788
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:05,555
Go on.

789
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,682
She used to score big from some
other guy before she got clean.

790
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,684
But then Gillian
cut him off completely,

791
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,394
and the guy,
he was super pissed.

792
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,396
Right, and where can I
find this <i>other</i> dealer?

793
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:14,564
I don't know.

794
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:15,690
- Oh...
- No, I-I-I swear

795
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,025
I've never met him.

796
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,860
Look, he goes by the name of...

797
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,403
of Bobby B.

798
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:22,572
Lovely.

799
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:25,909
I thought you said

800
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,244
this case doesn't have anything
to do with your mom anymore.

801
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:29,412
It doesn't.

802
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,415
Then why are you running off
to tell Chloe?

803
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:35,502
Well, maybe there are things
you wouldn't understand
about me, either.

804
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,961
(scoffs)

805
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,051
So you guys are gonna
let me go now, right?

806
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,639
Of course.

807
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:48,723
(chuckles)

808
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,768
After I've had my fun.

809
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:54,062
(indistinct radio transmission)

810
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,439
- Ah, there you are!
- Oh, hey.

811
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:58,399
- I've got some news
on the case.
- Oh, me, too.

812
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:00,026
But go on.
Ladies first.

813
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,445
Well, our drug dealer's
alibi is still shaky.

814
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,948
Uh, but he did mention
there's another dealer.

815
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:07,909
- Oh. That's what <i>I</i> had.
- And Amy's lawyered up,

816
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,744
so we can't get
anything out of her.

817
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,287
And all we have on
this "other dealer"

818
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:12,956
is that he's selling
prescription pills.

819
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:14,415
Oxys. Percocet.

820
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,459
Oh, not my faves, but
they'll do in a pinch.

821
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:19,754
So if the story stands,
we're looking for someone
in health care: doctor,

822
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:22,006
pharmacist.
I'm gonna go through
these booking sheets

823
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:25,093
for anyone in the medical
industry that's been charged
in the last couple years.

824
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:27,011
Right.

825
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:28,972
Feel free
to jump in and help me.

826
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,848
(groans)

827
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:31,808
Joy of joys.

828
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,311
Oh, there is one thing
that might help.

829
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:36,813
Yeah, what's that?

830
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,693
Bobby B.

831
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:43,820
What's that?

832
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,738
She was like a mother to her.

833
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:50,827
I have some issues
that I need to work out,

834
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,662
and I think
I know just how to do it.

835
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:55,498
What?

836
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,710
(Maze laughing)

837
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,214
- Oh...
- What is wrong
with you people!

838
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:09,804
(exhales)

839
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:12,390
(chuckles)

840
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:14,517
So you're back.

841
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:20,690
I'm here.

842
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,358
I wouldn't say I'm back.

843
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,193
You know I was looking
for you, right?

844
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:25,904
After what happened?

845
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,947
Maze, what you did
for me was...

846
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:29,782
(laughs softly)

847
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:32,785
But you were gone.

848
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,622
I needed to get away
from Lucifer.

849
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:37,874
And you.

850
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:40,168
I need to
figure out

851
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,503
where I fit in in this world.
And to do that,

852
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,339
I need some space.

853
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:45,882
From the both of you.

854
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:47,884
Yeah.

855
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:49,886
No, I mean, I was...

856
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,721
feeling the same thing,
you know?

857
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,389
I think some distance
between us

858
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:55,266
might be a good thing.

859
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:20,583
Hey, can I ask you a question?

860
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:21,584
Shoot.

861
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:23,711
Do you really believe in God?

862
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,299
Whoa. I was expecting
more like,

863
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,635
"Hey, Ella, what's it like
moving from Detroit to L.A.?"

864
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,262
"Hey, Ella, how'd you survive
growing up with four brothers?"

865
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:36,182
But the big "G" question
right off the top--

866
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:37,517
did not see that coming.

867
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,687
- Okay, sorry, it's inappropriate.
- Oh, no, no, no.
I actually

868
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,981
really like talking about it.
It's my faith.

869
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:45,066
It's kind of a big part
of my life.

870
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:48,444
So, uh, yeah, sure. Uh, hit me.

871
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:49,278
Okay.

872
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,949
Do you believe
that it all really exists?

873
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:53,908
What do you mean?

874
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,076
Say, angels.

875
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,661
Or the Devil.

876
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,580
That sort of thing.
That's all a metaphor, right?

877
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:00,707
Maybe.

878
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:02,959
Maybe not.

879
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,919
Oh, okay. That's pretty...

880
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:06,713
I just thought
there would be more faith

881
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,131
in your faith, I guess.

882
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,717
Oh. No, see, my aunt
was a nun, okay?

883
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:12,802
And she always taught me that
doubt was really important.

884
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,971
Right? I mean,
if you don't question something,

885
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,098
then what's the point
of believing it?

886
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:17,932
Mm-hmm.

887
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,267
I doubt

888
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,310
so that I can believe.

889
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,645
So, then, if you had the chance

890
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:24,689
to prove
it was all real or fake,

891
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:25,940
would you do it?

892
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:27,984
I mean,
that kind of defeats the point,

893
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:30,778
don't you think? It's faith...

894
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:32,613
Roses.

895
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,866
What? What do roses have
to do with faith?

896
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,035
No, nothing to do with faith.

897
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,203
And everything to do
with the case.

898
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:42,373
Um, okay, so I-I found
nitrogen, right, on the rods

899
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,375
in the victim's head,
and-and it got me thinking.

900
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:47,336
It could be almost
anything. And then I found

901
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:48,671
the capital "K."

902
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,673
- Capital "K"?
- Potassium? Periodic table?

903
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:51,966
Why don't you just skip
to the end?

904
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:54,302
And... rose fertilizer.

905
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,388
Which also has nitrogen.

906
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,141
So the rods were taken
from a garden.

907
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:01,184
Exactly.

908
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:02,685
Garden tools,

909
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:04,854
lawn accessories...
- Like flamingos.

910
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,356
Well, yeah, I mean,
that's oddly specific,

911
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:09,400
- but, yeah, flamingos...
- Thank you. Thank you.

912
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:21,454
Mr. Morningstar.

913
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,122
Hello, murderer.

914
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:24,415
Murderer?

915
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,501
(door shuts)

916
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:28,211
I don't...
I don't understand.

917
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:31,255
Oh, Roberta, can we skip the
boring part where you deny it

918
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:34,133
and just, uh... Let's get
to the good stuff, shall we?

919
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:37,887
Does it help
if I call you Bobby B.?

920
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:39,555
What are you talking about?

921
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,849
Oh. Oh, it's very simple.

922
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:43,518
You stole drugs
from the hospital

923
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:44,852
and sold them to Amy Dodd,

924
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,729
your biggest client,
who you met on set.

925
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:49,649
You introduced Gillian
to Amy, got her the job.

926
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:52,360
But then she helped Amy
get sober.

927
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,529
You felt betrayed,
yadda yadda yadda,

928
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:56,739
you killed her. Then you tried
to frame her new dealer.

929
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:57,907
Am I getting close?

930
00:35:58,116 --> 00:35:59,075
That's ludicrous.

931
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,661
No. No, what's ludicrous

932
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:03,412
is that you were like a mother
to her,

933
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:05,998
and you sacrificed her
like she was nothing.

934
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,793
Did she mean so little
to you in the end?

935
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,212
Really? Tell me,

936
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,548
why would you do that? Why?

937
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:14,799
You need to go now.

938
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:15,800
Tell me why.

939
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:17,218
Stay back.

940
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,761
You plunged two rods
into her skull

941
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,263
to make her look like the
Devil. But, you know what,

942
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:22,056
she's not the Devil-- I am.

943
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,975
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
There we go!

944
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:26,727
I love a game of poker. Go on,
I'll give you a freebie,
just to make it interesting.

945
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:28,146
(grunts)

946
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,606
(panting)

947
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:32,608
How is this possi...?
(grunts)

948
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:33,860
(shouting)

949
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:40,449
(shouting)
(panting)

950
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:42,785
All right. Okay. Can we just...

951
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,955
(grunts)
have a-a time-out, please?

952
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,127
(grunting)

953
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,628
(choking)

954
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:55,381
Is this a supernatural
fire poker?

955
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:58,718
How is this possible?
(knocking)

956
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:01,971
Mrs. Beliard,
it's Detective Decker.

957
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,973
Bloody hell.
Of course she's here.

958
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,934
- Detective!
Detective, you need to leave.
- (doorbell ringing)

959
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:11,314
- (shushing) It's gonna
be over real soon.
- (choking)

960
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:20,615
I know someone's in there.
I can wait out here all day.

961
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:23,284
I took in that girl
and I gave her a job

962
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:26,329
and then she cut me off
from my best customer.

963
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:30,041
So, yeah, I put three inches
of steel into her brain.

964
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:31,375
And I actually liked her.

965
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,711
LUCIFER (groans):
Please.

966
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,671
Please don't...
(grunts)

967
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,215
- Please...
- What?

968
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,008
What, you're gonna beg
for your life, huh?

969
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:41,677
...don't tell anyone...
(grunts)

970
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,013
that I died like this.

971
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:46,057
(choking)

972
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,683
(panting)

973
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:48,976
Just...
(coughs)

974
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,896
(Taser clicking)
(shouts)

975
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:56,484
(panting)

976
00:37:59,028 --> 00:37:59,820
Nearly had her.

977
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:01,572
(grunts)

978
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:03,366
Yeah.

979
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,413
(Taser clicking)

980
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:15,127
(siren wailing in distance)

981
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,716
I'm never living
this down, am I?

982
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:23,636
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

983
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,722
You know, you weren't there
when Ella's forensic report

984
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,099
pointed us at Roberta.

985
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:29,475
So how'd you put this together?

986
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:31,519
Well, I was on the
Devil's business, Detective.

987
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:34,730
(chuckles)
Look, even if I told you,

988
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:36,357
you'd just say
I was being crazy.

989
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,567
Hmm. That's funny.

990
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,695
That's what your brother
was just saying about you.

991
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:43,114
Oh. Amenadiel talked
to you, did he?

992
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,283
He did.
He explained everything.

993
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:48,119
Was very impressive.
Filled in all the gaps.

994
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:49,787
But?

995
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:51,664
(sighs)
But I don't buy it.

996
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:54,417
I don't accept
that you're crazy,

997
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,377
and I don't accept
this "Devil's business" either.

998
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:57,628
All right,
so what do you believe?

999
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,213
That I need the eggs.

1000
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,048
Excuse me?

1001
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,759
It's an old joke. Guy walks
into a psychiatrist's office,

1002
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,594
he goes,
"Doc, you got to help me.

1003
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:07,430
My brother's crazy.
He thinks he's a chicken."

1004
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:09,432
- (chuckles)
- And the doc goes,
"Well, why don't

1005
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,975
you turn him in?" The guy goes,

1006
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,770
"You know, I would,
but I need the eggs."

1007
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:16,564
That's not very funny.

1008
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:17,440
Yeah.

1009
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:18,899
(sighs)

1010
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,067
Look,

1011
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,988
I don't know what your deal is,

1012
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,282
but you make me
a better detective.

1013
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:28,951
And you've
always got my back.

1014
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,079
What more could I ask for?

1015
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,251
And you need the eggs.

1016
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:38,961
Damn right I do.

1017
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:41,213
(knocking)

1018
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:44,508
Lucifer.

1019
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:45,968
We don't have an appointment.

1020
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:47,511
No.

1021
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:50,514
No, we don't. I, uh...

1022
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:53,225
I just wanted
to drop by and say...

1023
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:55,978
thank you.

1024
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,439
And why's that?

1025
00:39:58,814 --> 00:39:59,940
Because you were right.

1026
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:01,650
I've been blaming everybody else

1027
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,611
for the situation I'm in.
And the fact of the matter

1028
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,863
is that...

1029
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:08,491
(sighs)
I chose to do nothing

1030
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:10,326
when my mother was cast out.

1031
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:13,162
To never ask her
why she did what she did.

1032
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:14,455
So that's on me.

1033
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:17,166
That's good, Lucifer.

1034
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:20,211
No.

1035
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:22,380
No, it's not.

1036
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:24,256
Why do you
say that?

1037
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,342
Well, I've assumed
a lot about my mother,

1038
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,468
including the fact
that she wants revenge

1039
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,303
for what I did
to her.

1040
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:32,348
- And now she doesn't?
- Well, it doesn't
appear so, no.

1041
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,016
And why is that
a bad thing?

1042
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:36,727
Well, because, Doctor,
if she's not coming to kill me,

1043
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:38,354
then I don't know
what she's doing.

1044
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:41,148
And...

1045
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:42,942
(sighs)

1046
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:45,403
...that's truly terrifying.
