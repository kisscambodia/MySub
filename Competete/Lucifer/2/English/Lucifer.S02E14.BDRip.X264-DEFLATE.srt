00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,596
That you disappeared
after I almost died,

184
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,765
and then waltzed back in
married to a stripper?

185
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,934
Exotic dancer, but,
yes, I can explain.

186
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:13,810
No.

187
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:14,769
No need.

188
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:15,770
I'm happy for you.

189
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:16,771
Really.

190
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:17,939
Do you mind?

191
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,607
Sorry.

192
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:20,608
Am I bugging you?

193
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:21,609
I'm totally bugging you.

194
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,277
No, I love
that sound.

195
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,779
- Oh.
- LUCIFER:
Look, Detective,

196
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,406
I had some
family issues.

197
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,449
And I-I went to Vegas
to blow off some steam.

198
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:30,284
One thing led
to another, and...

199
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,703
Look, I am sorry, I should've
told you that I needed...

200
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:33,830
time off.

201
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,707
This isn't about vacation hours,

202
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,043
this isn't about time cards,
Lucifer, this...

203
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,463
How could you just...?

204
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,298
I thought
we were...

205
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,136
(voice breaking):
I thought we were friends.

206
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,055
Friends? Yes.

207
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,682
Friends, that's exactly
what we are.

208
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,724
Just friends.

209
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,270
- Right.
- Right.

210
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:58,187
So it's all
sorted then,

211
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,522
- we'll go back to the way it was.
- Great.

212
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,398
You know, before...

213
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:01,399
Yes, I get it!

214
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:02,942
- DAN:
Hey.
- What?

215
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,987
I have Ash's ex-wife
in interrogation.

216
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,197
Great.

217
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:11,367
I...

218
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:12,743
That's classy,
dude.

219
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,996
Real classy.

220
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:16,664
Thank you?

221
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,501
You think they
like me?

222
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,712
Oh, what's not to like?

223
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,088
(Candy chuckling)

224
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,176
"Violent psycho bitch."

225
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:31,262
"Sid and Nancy,
except she's Sid."

226
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:34,390
"All she wanted was
to crush Ash's soul."

227
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:36,976
So, Courtney,

228
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,562
care to explain why all of
your ex-husband's bandmates

229
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,230
think you're capable of murder?

230
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,441
I had nothing to do with this.

231
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:44,984
Where were you the
night of Ash's death?

232
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:47,695
The same place I am
every night: work.

233
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,614
I have employees who
can vouch for it.

234
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:50,490
What do you do?

235
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,074
Run an online clothing company.

236
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,285
Built it from scratch.
Worked my ass off.

237
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,079
You want to know what Ash
would say about work?

238
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:58,873
"The world will provide."

239
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,166
But you know who did?

240
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,209
Me.

241
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,669
Someone had to
be responsible.

242
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,963
The band, they thought
I was uncool,

243
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:10,718
but it was Ash, he was
the selfish, childish one.

244
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:12,720
I completely understand.

245
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:14,889
I was with an
immature partner,

246
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,098
and it was maddening.

247
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:17,225
It's crazy-making.

248
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:18,434
Yeah, wanted to kill him.

249
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,020
I didn't say that.

250
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,940
LUCIFER:
Ouch. Shade.

251
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,192
I wouldn't take
it too personally.

252
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,070
Yeah, right.

253
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,113
I'm sure it's not me
she's talking about.

254
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,200
Well, who else would
she be talking about?

255
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,493
CHLOE:
So, you want to explain

256
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,411
the domestic
abuse charge?

257
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,579
Look, we fought.

258
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:40,998
I'm not proud of that.

259
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,668
But I've paid for
my mistakes, literally.

260
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,044
What do you mean?

261
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:47,255
Ash took everything
when we divorced.

262
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,757
I agreed to sit down
with a divorce mediator,

263
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:52,093
and the guy was completely
biased against me.

264
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:53,803
I think him and Ash

265
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,888
set up some sort of
shady side deal.

266
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:57,807
He's the real criminal.

267
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,393
But if Ash got this
hefty divorce settlement,

268
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,436
then why was he couch-surfing?

269
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:03,437
Where'd the money go?

270
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,440
Maybe the mediator took it?

271
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,442
Like I said, the guy's a crook.

272
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,701
I got him.

273
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,828
Someone tagged Lucifer
at The Grove.

274
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:19,996
You're kidding.

275
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,623
Someone named "Cottoncandy86"?

276
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,125
That's an
unfortunate name.

277
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,711
No, Mom, it's an
Internet-- never mind.

278
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:30,172
It looks like they were getting
frozen yogurt to celebrate...

279
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,091
newlywed life?

280
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,927
#mrslucifer, #hottiehubby?

281
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,804
Are you speaking in tongues?

282
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:37,638
Mom!

283
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:38,764
Look.

284
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,684
He and cottoncandy86
are married.

285
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,437
- What?!
- He specifically told me
to watch over Chloe.

286
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,938
After everything that
we did to save her,

287
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:48,065
I don't... I don't understand.

288
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:50,318
Betrothing himself to that?

289
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:52,486
He wouldn't.

290
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,905
Perhaps Mazikeen was right.

291
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:56,991
Lucifer's concocting a plan.

292
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,953
♪♪

293
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:05,791
Well, Courtney's story
checked out.

294
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,627
She was working late
with two employees

295
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:08,919
at the time Ash was killed.

296
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:10,212
Courtney's been pointing
pretty hard

297
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:12,548
at their divorce mediator,
but I don't know.

298
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:13,799
Seems like a stretch.

299
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,218
Yeah, agreed, but I did
check it out anyways.

300
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:17,261
This guy named
Anthony Annan.

301
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,471
He's got a clean
record, and nothing

302
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,056
but Courtney's word
points to him.

303
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,141
Uh, Detective, a word?

304
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,392
You're still here?
Shouldn't you be

305
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,186
on some honeymoon
far, far away?

306
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,771
Oh, look, it's Mannequin Hair.

307
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,649
- Who?
- I don't know his name,

308
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,359
but he's in
the other photo, too.

309
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,653
- Is that weird?
- What other photo?

310
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:34,737
The one of the dead dude.

311
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,822
See? Right there.

312
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,240
Mannequin Hair is
in the crowd

313
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:39,325
behind the yellow tape.

314
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,285
She's right, it's him.

315
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:42,828
Unbelievable.

316
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,955
It's highly unlikely
for Ash's divorce mediator

317
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:46,957
to be lurking at the scene
of his murder, yes?

318
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:47,792
Yeah, very.

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,085
I'll track him down.
Nice.

320
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,087
Well done, Candy.

321
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,672
Well, I don't get a lot
of names at my job,

322
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,548
so I'm super good
with faces.

323
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:57,218
- And other things.
- Ah.

324
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:58,928
LUCIFER: This is fun, isn't it?
Isn't this fun?

325
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,764
Hmm? Murder, suspects, clues.

326
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,557
Gosh, it feels good
to be back.

327
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,226
Right, I'm going to
call Candy a cab,

328
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,186
and then you and I can
get down to brass tacks, yes?

329
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:08,145
(pouty groan)

330
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:09,480
Actually,
come to think of it,

331
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:10,898
who watches over Trixie?

332
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,191
Do you want to go splitsies
on a nanny?

333
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,984
Besides, I hear this case
involves a band,

334
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:14,819
so, lucky for you

335
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,530
I bring my much-needed
musical expertise.

336
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,156
Did you know
he plays piano?

337
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,158
Like, better than
Elton Tom.

338
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,743
I know plenty about
music, thank you.

339
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:24,578
- (laughs)
Do you, now, Detective?
- Mm-hmm.

340
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,122
Right, what's your
favorite band, then?

341
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,373
- Hmm?
- Hey...

342
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:30,584
(laughs):
Oh, full of '90s jams, I see.

343
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,962
The Bangles, N'Sync,

344
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:34,630
Right Said Fred?

345
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,632
- Give me the phone back.
- I mean, seriously,
Detective,

346
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:37,758
your music queue
alone is enough

347
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,510
to disqualify you
from this case.

348
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,804
You're not the one who's
<i>on</i> this case, Lucifer.

349
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,974
What? But what about
our partnership?

350
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,893
Our partnership ended
when you ghosted me

351
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,395
and the entire department.

352
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,939
You can't just march back
in here like nothing's wrong.

353
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:54,316
You can't just grab
what you want when you want.

354
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,530
I'll just put that
down there, then.

355
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:06,912
You let me down, Lucifer.

356
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,750
I mean, what good
is a partner

357
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,251
if I can't depend on you?

358
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,130
I don't need you anymore.

359
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,924
- Well, surely
you don't mean that.
- I do.

360
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,468
You can go.

361
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,094
Both of you.

362
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,891
Right.

363
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,814
I haven't seen you
in a while, Lucifer.

364
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,776
Uh, I know you've
been through Hell.

365
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,654
I suppose we can
discuss that another time.

366
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,449
Oh, no, no, there's no need
for censoring, Doctor.

367
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,951
Candy and I have no secrets.

368
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,204
Isn't that the key
to a successful marriage?

369
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,792
And how are you coping
since your... travels?

370
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,378
Any warning signs
of lasting trauma?

371
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:57,671
Denial?

372
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,673
Rash decisions?

373
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,551
Um... no, no.

374
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,845
I think I've thought through
everything quite carefully.

375
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,722
He's a thinker, this one!

376
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,351
And, uh... and what
about Detective Decker?

377
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,812
I thought you two
had become...

378
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:14,855
close.

379
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:17,107
Well, everything
I felt for her

380
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:20,361
was smoke and mirrors,
courtesy of dear old Dad.

381
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,696
I mean, He clearly
expected me to zig,

382
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:23,989
and so I zagged.

383
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,077
And does Chloe know
that you've <i>zagged</i> Candy?

384
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,286
- (giggles)
- Yes.

385
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:30,412
She just fired me.

386
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:31,789
- Shocking.
- I know.

387
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,208
But if you felt
so manipulated...

388
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,753
why return to Chloe at all?

389
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:39,922
Well, I mean,
I tried to leave,

390
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,675
but I just felt
that I missed...

391
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:45,886
my work.

392
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,514
Look, anyway,
baby, bathwater,

393
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,558
the detective and I are
quite the crime-fighting duo.

394
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:51,851
I mean, you wouldn't
break up

395
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,644
- Batman and Robin,
now, would you?
- No.

396
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:55,229
We have a job to do.

397
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,648
So if she could
just see sense...

398
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,316
I was fired once.

399
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,776
But you know what I did?

400
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,070
I just kept showing up and
made myself expandable.

401
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,489
Oh, uh, do you mean
indispensable?

402
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:08,200
No. Expandable.
I got a boob job,

403
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:10,452
and it totally
expanded my horizons.

404
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,121
Because then, I
could do something

405
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,706
none of the other
girls could do.

406
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:14,707
You wanna see?

407
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,125
- Ooh, yes.
- No.

408
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,127
No?

409
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,129
But you know, the part
about showing up...

410
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,090
that's not, actually,
bad advice.

411
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:24,967
It's called "acting as if."

412
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:28,804
Yes. Yes,
well done, Candy.

413
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:31,640
I think I know exactly
how to get back on the case.

414
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,142
Oh, gosh, I wish I'd
talked to you earlier.

415
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,268
Saved myself a trip.

416
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,895
(both chuckling)

417
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:36,937
LUCIFER:
Have a candy, Candy.

418
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,398
(squeals, chuckles)

419
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:42,651
DAN:
<i>Bad news, Chloe.</i>

420
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,820
Ash's mediator won't talk.

421
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,031
Well, because he's a lawyer.

422
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,284
Yep, not without a warrant.

423
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,620
Okay, will do.

424
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:54,705
I know you're there.

425
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:56,415
I'm a cop, Lucifer.

426
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,167
You think I don't know
when I'm being followed?

427
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,503
(sighs) All right,
fair enough.

428
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,048
Look, I'm simply here
to help with the case.

429
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,675
What, you mean the case
that Chloe kicked you off of?

430
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,178
I'm just... I'm trying
to put things back

431
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,679
the way they were, Dan.

432
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,851
Yeah, I've been there.

433
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,147
Right. And I have
a brilliant idea.

434
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,524
You expect me to let you
go undercover

435
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:23,734
with your stripper wife?

436
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:25,361
Right. First of all,
she's an exotic dancer.

437
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:26,445
"Stripper" is pejorative.

438
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,697
Well, far be it from me
to disrespect your bride.

439
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,157
Thank you.
And secondly,

440
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:32,326
Candy is a natural
at getting men to talk.

441
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,994
CHLOE:
Oh, I bet she is.

442
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,497
Awesome.

443
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,707
Lucifer has outdone himself.

444
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,293
Thanks.

445
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,379
Mm-hmm.

446
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,839
LUCIFER:
But, Detective,
the mediator

447
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,424
won't talk to you
without a warrant.

448
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,885
Which is why I so wisely made
an appointment for Candy and I

449
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:51,804
this afternoon, see?

450
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:52,888
You need me.

451
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:54,848
Let me think about that.
No.

452
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,684
Uh, Detective, if I
didn't know better,

453
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,269
I'd say you were prejudiced
against exotic dancers.

454
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:00,896
Okay, we're done here.

455
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,189
- Good-bye.
- But...

456
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:03,482
Come on, Candy.

457
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:05,234
Well, look,
if you change your mind

458
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,236
and wish to take me up
on this splendid lead,

459
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,904
then, you know,
you can always text me,

460
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:10,698
or I'm on Wobble now as well.

461
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,033
You can get Candy
on Cottoncandy86.

462
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,750
♪ Take a good look
at the world around you ♪

463
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,755
♪ All the filth and hate
does it astound you? ♪

464
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,800
It was a marvelous idea.
I'm sure she'll come around.

465
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:31,051
MOM:
So it's true.

466
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,636
You're back.

467
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:36,390
Oh, invading my privacy,
as usual, I see.

468
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,809
Your brother and I
were worried sick.

469
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,937
You could have at least called.

470
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:44,773
Oh, my gosh, are you
Lucifer's sister?

471
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:45,816
Oh!

472
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,693
Oh, Lucifer,
don't be rude.

473
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,070
Who is your
top-heavy friend?

474
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,116
Candy, darling,
this is my mother.

475
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,453
Mum, this is Candy,
my wife.

476
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,455
I'm sorry that we didn't
invite you to the wedding.

477
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:00,497
We just decided

478
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,374
no enemies.

479
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,463
Well, lovely to meet you.

480
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,174
You're Lucifer's <i>mom?</i>

481
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,344
Oh, my gosh,
you look amazing!

482
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,096
I should start
using sunscreen.

483
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,473
A shame he kept you hidden.

484
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,683
I hate secrets.

485
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,229
Do you like shopping?

486
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:25,647
<i>Do</i> I?

487
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:30,194
I want to hear all
about you and Lucifer.

488
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,155
You two must have
so many plans.

489
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,991
So...

490
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,661
what do we
think of Candy?

491
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,417
Well, I think she's
perfect for Lucifer.

492
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,671
Her bra size equals
her IQ, huh?

493
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,798
That's generous.

494
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,014
See that vein popping
out the side of your neck?

495
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,518
Same thing happens when I
throw the dishes in the trash

496
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,478
instead of washing them.

497
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:06,688
You're mad.

498
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,316
I'm an idiot.

499
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,279
Look, I know Lucifer
better than anyone, okay,

500
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,864
and he does this sometimes.

501
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:19,326
Disappears, does stupid,
impulsive things.

502
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,454
But he always comes
back around, Chloe.

503
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,749
Yeah, but this time
I don't want him to.

504
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,919
I'm serious, I am done.
I'm done.

505
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:31,880
But he did get you an
in with that mediator.

506
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,258
That's a good thing, right?

507
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,551
Yeah, well, I don't care.

508
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,094
There's no way
I'm letting him

509
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,930
and his exotic-dancer wife
on my case, or any case.

510
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,434
Maybe you and Lucifer
need a mediator.

511
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,270
(sighs)

512
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,398
Just saying.

513
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,161
ANTHONY:
So, Mrs. Morningstar...

514
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,914
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you can call me Candy.

515
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,257
Candy, why do you want
to divorce Lucifer?

516
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,633
Um...

517
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:20,804
Well, I just feel like we're
supposed to have a partnership,

518
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:24,474
and it just totally feels
like it's not working anymore.

519
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,935
Mm-hmm. And you two have
been married for...

520
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,312
- Five days.
- Ever!

521
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,772
- Forever.
- Five days.

522
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,399
- LUCIFER: Five days.
- It feels like it.

523
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:33,734
But we've been through
a lot in that time,

524
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,110
and I say that we
work brilliantly together,

525
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,153
don't we, sweetie?

526
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,905
(laughs)
Well...

527
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,365
if you're talking
about the bedroom, yeah.

528
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:41,700
I mean, thank God

529
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,619
this bod is made
for pure sex,

530
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:44,995
because, clearly,

531
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,455
(whispering):
it's all he cares about.

532
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,081
I'm tired.

533
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:49,958
Eh...

534
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,212
Would you say that's the, uh,
the crux of your issue?

535
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,588
Oh, the crux
of the issue?

536
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,131
Oh, no, no, no,
that would be Lucifer

537
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,300
disappearing, and
then popping back up

538
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:01,303
with zero explanation and
a ditzy bimbo on his arm.

539
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:05,098
He's cheated on you
in five days of marriage?

540
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,184
No, of course I didn't.
I've been completely faithful.

541
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,478
I take the vows of marriage
very seriously.

542
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,731
And that's why you chose
an idiotic, bedazzled <i>tweener</i>

543
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,649
as your partner.

544
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:14,524
ANTHONY:
I'm sorry, Candy,

545
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:15,817
there's no name calling in here.

546
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,570
Even if it's to yourself.

547
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,739
Lucifer,

548
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,157
would you like to respond?

549
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,200
(scoffs)

550
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:26,078
This is gonna be hard for you
to understand, but...

551
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,414
I've been through Hell recently.

552
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,750
Both figuratively and literally.

553
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,835
True torment,
my greatest fears realized.

554
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,630
Lucifer,
I am the one who almost died.

555
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,800
Yes, I know.
That is what I'm talking about.

556
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,719
(sighs)
Wow.

557
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,807
I almost believe you care.

558
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,059
Have you ever known me to lie?

559
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,231
I don't know.

560
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:58,360
I don't know.

561
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,154
Why don't we take five?

562
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,580
(Anthony clears throat)

563
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,541
Are you okay, Mrs. Morningstar?

564
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:16,545
(sighs)

565
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:20,382
Yeah, I'm...
yeah, thank you. I am.

566
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,842
- (chuckles)
- Um...

567
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:27,723
I, uh, I had heard
through a friend that...

568
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:33,103
you were open to
a little extra negotiation.

569
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:37,399
Um, I'm not sure
what you mean by that.

570
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,861
Um, well, my husband, you see,

571
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,696
has a lot of money.

572
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,906
And so, if you were to...

573
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,701
swing things my way,

574
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,912
then I'd make it
worth your while.

575
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:53,040
Wow...

576
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,709
(chuckles)

577
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,377
You're really
something.

578
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,422
But that would be
crossing a line.

579
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,132
And I can't do things like that.

580
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:03,383
LUCIFER:
Why not?

581
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,302
You did with
Ash Corrigan.

582
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,928
You two are in on this together?

583
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,764
- No, we're...
- Oh, yes.

584
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,433
(Chloe sighs)

585
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:12,726
LAPD.

586
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,189
We know about your side deal
with Ash Corrigan.

587
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,858
Didn't pilfer enough money
from Ash's ex?

588
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,152
Had to go and kill Ash
to get the rest of the spoils?

589
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:25,447
Whoa.
I would never, ever hurt Ash.

590
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,616
Then what did you want
to accomplish, Anthony?

591
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,534
Hmm? Come on.

592
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,078
Tell me.

593
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,330
What did you desire?

594
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,124
I wanted...

595
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:37,793
Yes?

596
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:42,756
I wanted the Heavy Woolies
to be the hugest band ever.

597
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,467
But... oh.
(chuckles)

598
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:46,885
ANTHONY:
Um...

599
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,846
Okay, yeah, yes,
I helped Ash in the divorce

600
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,056
and I got him all
of Courtney's money.

601
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,016
But there was no side deal,
'cause I did it for free.

602
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,561
I did it for the band.

603
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,021
I did it for the music.

604
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,855
- (chuckles)
- So,

605
00:23:59,064 --> 00:23:59,731
you're a fan?

606
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,109
No, no, no. I was the manager.

607
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,611
At least, Ash promised me...

608
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:07,364
maybe I could be the manager
someday.

609
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:09,491
The point is,
I helped them a lot.

610
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,035
Ash and I
came up with a plan.

611
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,622
(Lucifer laughs)
Buy all the albums himself

612
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:18,333
using his ex-wife's money
to inflate sales.

613
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,043
Talk about self-promotion.

614
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:21,670
All they needed
was a little nudge.

615
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,380
And it worked.

616
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:24,881
I mean, we got on the charts

617
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,050
and we started
getting radio play,

618
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,677
we were gonna be booked
for this big tour.

619
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,179
I mean, we were gonna
make it so big.

620
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:34,266
We have a photo
linking you to the crime scene.

621
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,225
Why were you there?

622
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:36,768
I was looking for them
after the gig,

623
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:38,728
'cause Ash and Marla,
they were fighting.

624
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,647
The bassist?
Why were they fighting?

625
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:41,857
When weren't they
fighting?

626
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,151
I thought that Ash was gonna
kick Marla out of the band

627
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,194
that night after the gig,
so I went down there

628
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:47,571
to see how it went down.

629
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,450
That's when I saw the police
standing there,

630
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,576
across the street.

631
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:55,495
Over his dead body.

632
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,416
It was the night the music died.

633
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,586
(Lucifer scoffs)

634
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,090
Perhaps Marla didn't want to be
the fifth Beatle.

635
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,343
Looks like we have
a new suspect.

636
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,846
Oh, well,if that's the case,
then you're welcome, Detective.

637
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,222
It's nice to be needed.

638
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,599
Look, go home.

639
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,350
Trust me.

640
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,060
Candy needs you more than I do.

641
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,316
(sighs)

642
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:25,692
(chuckles awkwardly)

643
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,404
Mine's bigger, right?

644
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,574
Yes. Does that mean anything?

645
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,910
Just how much
Lucifer loves me.

646
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,746
Ah, so these small ones are for
couples who don't really care.

647
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:38,914
Exactly.

648
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:40,207
Tell me more

649
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,708
about you and Lucifer.

650
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,377
What comes next for
you two lovebirds?

651
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:46,630
Did he say anything

652
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:49,716
about-- oh, I don't
know... matricide?

653
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:52,636
No, I think the mattress
in the penthouse is pretty new.

654
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,596
Oh, come on, Candy.

655
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,599
I know you two have
some kind of plan.

656
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,478
Well, you're right about that.

657
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,063
So many plans.

658
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,690
Tell me everything.

659
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,487
Someday...

660
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,073
...I want to open
my own juice bar.

661
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,115
Or a tanning salon.

662
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,659
Or a combo juice bar

663
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,619
and tanning salon.
(gasps)

664
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:18,453
You're speaking

665
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:21,122
and yet I don't
understand a single word.

666
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,416
I get that a lot.

667
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,085
Why don't you talk
and I'll listen?

668
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,253
I'm a good listener.

669
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:27,337
Like right now? I know exactly

670
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:28,755
what you're trying to say.

671
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:30,173
- But I didn't...
- You want what's best

672
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:31,591
for your son
and you'll do anything

673
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,968
to make sure he's happy.

674
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:36,304
I want you to know,
I got Lucifer's back.

675
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:37,764
And yours.

676
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,015
Because...

677
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,184
you're <i>my</i> mom now, too.

678
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,730
We're family.
(laughs)

679
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,107
(giggles)

680
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:48,608
MOM:
<i>She's a sinister</i>

681
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:49,651
genius.

682
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,611
Mother, come on now.

683
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,698
Here I thought this "Candy"
was an insipid dullard.

684
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,450
But she may be
the most formidable opponent

685
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,202
I've ever faced.

686
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:01,913
I came away
with nothing!

687
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,832
Not a single crumb
of information

688
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,500
about Lucifer's real agenda.

689
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,502
- What if there is no
hidden agenda, Mom?
- Oh...

690
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,296
What if this Candy's

691
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:10,839
exactly who she seems?

692
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,841
Then...
(scoffs)

693
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,176
...I don't understand
what Lucifer's doing.

694
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,762
- Whatever he wants, as usual.
- So he really just married

695
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,931
this preening mouth breather
because he likes her?

696
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:21,683
Please.

697
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:24,853
Only a deeply damaged soul
would make such a poor choice.

698
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:27,731
(sighs)

699
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:30,525
Unless...

700
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,486
he really is that far gone.

701
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:36,865
Then that would mean
that my son

702
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,366
is really, truly broken.

703
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:41,661
And I'm the one that broke him.

704
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,537
Mom...

705
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:43,705
don't.

706
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,206
I manipulated him.

707
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,001
I pushed him too hard.

708
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:51,588
I did this.

709
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,885
I'm a terrible mother.

710
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,017
DAN: Public intoxication,
vandalism.

711
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,894
Okay, Marla does have
a few priors.

712
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,063
But all par for the course
for a wannabe rock star.

713
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,024
How'd you get the lead?

714
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,568
I got in to see the mediator.

715
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:15,904
Lucifer did a thing.

716
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,657
Yes, I knew you guys
would patch things up.

717
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:19,574
Nope.

718
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:20,533
Not even close.

719
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:21,951
(whispering):
Not even close.

720
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,745
Well, it sounds like
he's trying to help.

721
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,080
Why are you rooting for him?

722
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:26,247
I'm not rooting for him.

723
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:27,499
Okay, anyhow,

724
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,918
to me, Marla reads like
a troublemaker, not a killer.

725
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:33,463
Oh, unless you count crimes
against fashion.

726
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:34,756
Yikes.

727
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:35,632
(chuckles)

728
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,841
Hey, guys.

729
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,719
Remember those marks
on Ash's head?

730
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,516
You think they came from
the knobs on Marla's bass?

731
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,393
I mean, I still have to do
further tests,

732
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,395
but it sure looks like <i>Tetris</i>
to me.

733
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:49,896
Okay, maybe Marla's our girl.

734
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,273
We got to find her
and find that instrument.

735
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:56,486
(electric guitar riff playing)

736
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:00,949
Yeah, I spoke to her roommate.

737
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,909
She said Marla's here somewhere.

738
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:04,536
Yeah.

739
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:05,954

00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,914
This next song is for a,
uh, a special someone.

00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,501

she doesn't need me anymore.

Yeah.

Well, I say she's wrong.

763
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,759
And I'm gonna prove
just what I'm willing to do

764
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:02,302
for our partnership.

765
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,805

is Marla. Has
anyone seen Marla?

785
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:12,455
We're looking for
someone called Marla.

786
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:14,415
I know she's here tonight.

787
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,000
She's the bass player.

788
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:17,377
Ah, there she is!

789
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:19,254
Marla! Will you bring
her up to the front?

790
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:24,717
Come on. Marla, everybody.

791
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,344
(laughs)

792
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,512
(song concludes)

793
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,431
See? You need me.

794
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,398
That better not be
Marla's bass.

795
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:39,816
It's already been processed.

796
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,651

801
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:51,077
it was wiped down pretty good,
but...

802
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,872
I found traces of Ash's blood
on the tuning knobs.

803
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,248
LUCIFER: What, so
Marla's the killer?

804
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,125
Murder solved!
(laughs)

805
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,043
And I believe that proves

806
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:00,712
just how much
the department needs me.

807
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:02,964
Including you.

808
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:09,345
Uh, we got a stalker,
which is normally bad,

809
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,097
but makes me
very happy right now

810
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,599
'cause I was getting
very uncomfortable.

811
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,729
What on Earth does he want?

812
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:21,900
You know I watched
over Chloe for weeks

813
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:23,192
after you disappeared, right?

814
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:24,819
Angel or creeper, brother?

815
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:25,778
It's a fine line.

816
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,406
You asked me to guard her,
so I did. Like an idiot!

817
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:30,867
You see, because I thought
that she meant something to you.

818
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:31,701
(scoffs)

819
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,952
We both know she's special.

820
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,914
Oh. That she is.

821
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,916
A whoopee cushion sent from Dad.

822
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,335
I'm sure he's having
a right old laugh at the moment.

823
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:43,963
Right. So that means it's okay
to turn your back on Chloe?

824
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,215
Just ignore her feelings?

825
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:47,926
Feelings she had
no control over.

826
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:49,344
Feelings that aren't real.

827
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:50,428
But she doesn't know that.

828
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:53,264
Which is why I had
to save her from...

829
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,768
From you.

830
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,982
You're not ignoring Chloe,
you're protecting her

831
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:04,567
because she had no choice.

832
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,819
So I gave it back to her.

833
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:09,405
By holding up a shield
made of Candy.

834
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:13,826
I'm sorry, Lucifer.

835
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,119
(sighs)

836
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,167
You should at least explain
some of this to Mom.

837
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:22,460
She's upset.

838
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:23,711
Good.

839
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:29,092
She died and went to Hell
for you, Luci.

840
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,968
For you.

841
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,511
She faced her greatest fears

842
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,512
all because she loves you.

843
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,346
Oh, come on.

844
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,223
Yes, she hurt you.

845
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,685
But she was just doing what
she thought was best for you.

846
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:40,269
And from what you just told me,

847
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:42,188
I'm quite sure
you can relate to that.

848
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:44,565
Come on.

849
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,403
What more does it take?

850
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:57,787
(sighs)

851
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,708
You really told Lucifer
where I was?

852
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,418
Since when do you guys talk?

853
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,753
Since he helped me
save your life.

854
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,214
I didn't kill Ash.

855
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:09,716
Innocent people don't run.

856
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:12,218
Or get a dead guy's blood
on their guitars.

857
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:13,511
Whoa, what?

858
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,430
Ash's blood
was all over your bass.

859
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:16,848
I don't know anything
about that.

860
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:18,516
I-I ran because of these.

861
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,063
What, you're making fake IDs?

862
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:26,399
That's how I make rent, okay?

863
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:27,608
How come you didn't tell us
Ash wanted

864
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:28,943
to kick you out of the band?

865
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,278
(chuckles softly)

866
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,362
You didn't know that?

867
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:34,991
S-Sure, we... bumped heads.

868
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,952
He... he was gonna kick me out?

869
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:41,748
Look, even if I'd known,
I wouldn't have hurt him.

870
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:42,915
You have proof?

871
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,250
Um... yeah, yeah.

872
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:45,918
This kid, Hunter,
from Silver Lake.

873
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,004
He's like 16, maybe less?

874
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,090
I, uh, made him an ID
that said he's 27.

875
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:53,009
Anyway, he hung
around me all night.

876
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:54,469
Actually, check Wobble.

877
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:56,220
He was live posting stuff
of us all night.

878
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,265
His ID is
HunterSTomstoned.

879
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:02,477
I'm legal!

880
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,103
(whoops)

881
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,230
There's a bunch more.

882
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,066
Looks like they cover
the time of death.

883
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:09,567
Like I said, I didn't do it.

884
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,986
Then how did Ash's blood
get all over your bass?

885
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,072
CHLOE:
Hold on, look at this.

886
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,700
That's Doug,
our drummer.

887
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:19,494
He loaded our gear.

888
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,037
Doug had the bass last.

889
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:24,499
(clears throat)

890
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:30,296
You know what?
I should just stay here.

891
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:32,924
Finish up Marla's arrest
report, but, um...

892
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,219
maybe your consultant is free.

893
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:39,222
(sighs)

894
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,890
(knocking on door)

895
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,601
Doug Kennedy, LAPD.

896
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:47,021
Ugh. Typical youth of today,
leaving the door unlocked.

897
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:47,855
Shh!

898
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,649
(phone ringing)

899
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,984
Uh, sorry, I...

900
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:54,654
It's Candy.
(sighs)

901
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:55,863
Just...

902
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:00,201
(whispering): Candy, darling,
I can't talk now.

903
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,036
About to catch a killer.

904
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,871
(grunts)

905
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,498
(choking)

906
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,125
Gonna have to call you back!

907
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:14,006
(choking)

908
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,007
Let him go, Doug.

909
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:16,092
DOUG:
You stay back!

910
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,718
J-Just stay back!

911
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:19,804
This is all Ash's fault!

912
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,180
We were gonna make it big,

913
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:23,641
and then Ash said
he was gonna go solo.

914
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,393
He was gonna bail on all of us.

915
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,812
I went to smack him
and I freaking lost it!

916
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:29,438
You're making
this worse, Doug.

917
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:30,898
Let him go.

918
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:33,109
No. If you care about your
partner, you drop your gun, now!

919
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:35,903
Oh, Go... You may as well just
yank the sucker, then, Dougie,

920
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:38,406
'cause I'm useless
to her, you see?

921
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:41,117
What? That's not true, Lucifer.

922
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:43,536
Isn't it? I mean,
you said as much yourself.

923
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:46,080
W-Wait, what the
hell's going on?

924
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,374
LUCIFER: The detective
doesn't need me anymore.

925
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,084
So come on.

926
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,586
Do your worst.

927
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:52,962
Don't listen to him, Doug.

928
00:36:53,171 --> 00:36:55,631
No, go on! Go on, go on.
Yank like it's your last wank.

929
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:58,801
Or better still, you shoot,
Detective. Come on.

930
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,929
Two birds, one bullet,
what do you say? Huh?

931
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,306
(Lucifer grunts)

932
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:08,561
(coughing)

933
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:09,770
You okay?

934
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:10,813
I think so.

935
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,607
DOUG: Yeah, that's
because you shot me!

936
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:15,860
Doug Kennedy,
you're under arrest.

937
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,279
There's not a
scratch, Detective.

938
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:20,114
Impressive marksmanship.

939
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,742
Actually, I was aiming for you.

940
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,119
(chuckles)

941
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:26,913
(siren wailing)

942
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,293
(gasps)

943
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,337
Oh, my God! Is Lucifer okay?

944
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:36,589
- We were on the phone
when he got cut off, and...
- Candy.

945
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:38,674
He's in the other room,
giving a statement.

946
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:39,967
Don't worry.
He's fine.

947
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,093
Did you save him?

948
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:42,929
Thank you! Oh!

949
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,016
Oh. All... All righty. That's...

950
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:49,435
His job is way too dangerous.

951
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:51,312
I begged him to quit, but no.

952
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,980
My hubby's all about his work.

953
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:54,523
He is?

954
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:57,485
Oh, my God, it's "Detective
this," and "Detective that."

955
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,320
Working with you
means so much to him.

956
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:01,489
Well, he's got a strange
way of showing it.

957
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:02,657
Well, duh.

958
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,492
Dude's totally messed up.

959
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,827
But then, you probably
already know that, huh?

960
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,163
'Cause you're kind of
the reason why?

961
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:10,164
What? Uh...

962
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:11,374
Didn't you two
just go

963
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:13,376
through a super bananas
situation?

964
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:15,294
With like, poison?

965
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:17,046
He kept saying
how he almost lost you,

966
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:19,048
and it was hell and stuff.

967
00:38:19,257 --> 00:38:21,133
Yeah, i-it was bananas.

968
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:24,679
It, it, I... went
through a lot, and, um...

969
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:27,181
And I... I guess he did, too.

970
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,849
LUCIFER:
Great. Statement given...

971
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:30,935
Candy. Oh!
(grunts)

972
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:32,812
Ow.

973
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:35,064
Uh, Candy darling,

974
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:37,024
the detective's not
a big fan of PDA.

975
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,359
It's fine.

976
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:40,736
I'm just glad
she's here for you.

977
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:44,031
See you tomorrow
at the precinct.

978
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:46,701
Detective.

979
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:50,413
Don't be late.

980
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:52,999
(Lucifer chuckles)

981
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,217
(footsteps approaching)

982
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:05,261
Amenadiel seems to think
I owe you a chat.

983
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:09,223
So I'll start by saying
I do not forgive you.

984
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:11,892
I deserve that.

985
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:12,977
Hmm.

986
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:17,356
However, you did make
quite a sacrifice for me.

987
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,693
Despite your callous
manipulations,

988
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,696
maybe you were well-intentioned
somewhere,

989
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,407
deep, deep down.

990
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:28,409
Perhaps that counts
for something.

991
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,579
I'm glad you think so, son.

992
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:32,913
Besides,

993
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:35,166
I'm far more pissed off at Dad.

994
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,085
I mean, you just tried to speed
up feelings I already had,

995
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:39,670
whereas he...

996
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:41,672
Well.

997
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:44,717
He made all those feelings
a lie.

998
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:47,511
Anyway.

999
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:50,765
Nice catching up.
I'll see you in a few millennia.

1000
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,059
Lucifer, wait.

1001
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,480
I appreciate your honesty.

1002
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:03,152
And now, I'd like
to be honest with you.

1003
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:05,237
Oh. This'll be a hoot.

1004
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:07,782
Since I escaped Hell,
all I've wanted is to get back

1005
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,284
to the Silver City,
to reunite our family.

1006
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:13,329
You're still fantasizing
about heavenly rebellion?

1007
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,206
Just let it go, Mum.

1008
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:17,625
Been there, done that, big fall.

1009
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,210
But that's just it.

1010
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:21,587
Why do you think
you lost that fight?

1011
00:40:21,796 --> 00:40:23,381
Oh, I don't know,
let's have a think, shall we?

1012
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:24,924
Not enough cardio?

1013
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,426
The fact that dear old
Dad's slightly almighty?

1014
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,845
Because I was young,
woefully foolish and...

1015
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:31,013
Unarmed?

1016
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:33,891
You know that if you had
possessed the Flaming Sword,

1017
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,310
the weapon that guarded Eden,

1018
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:38,104
the weapon
that can cut through anything,

1019
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:39,980
even the Gates of Heaven itself,

1020
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:42,483
well, you would've won
that rebellion.

1021
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:44,068
Why are you dwelling
in the past?

1022
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,861
The fact is,
I didn't have the sword,

1023
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:48,614
and Dad destroyed it
soon after, so...

1024
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:51,033
What if I told you that
the sword was right here,

1025
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:52,284
on Earth?

1026
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:54,829
And it's already
in your possession.

1027
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:55,996
What?

1028
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:59,083
The Flaming Sword
is Azrael's blade.

1029
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,378
We have everything we need
to go home.

1030
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:17,643
Well, the Oscar
goes to Candy Morningstar.

1031
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:19,186
You think they bought it?

1032
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,855
Yes, my mother doesn't know
what hit her.

1033
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:22,565
So, thank you.

1034
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:25,359
For helping me peek inside
that scheming head of hers.

1035
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:27,987
Well, it's the least I could do.

1036
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:29,989
After what you did
for me in Vegas?

1037
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:32,032
You saved my life.

1038
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:34,368
Pretty sure I'm gonna owe you
for the rest of it.

1039
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:35,870
Let's call it even, shall we?

1040
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:37,204
Yeah.

1041
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:38,706
Oh, that reminds me

1042
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,124
Oh, no, no, no.

1043
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:41,125
You keep that.

1044
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:42,293
I hear divorce

1045
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:43,794
is quite expensive
these days.

1046
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,212
In fact,

1047
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:47,715
why don't you add
this one to the, uh, pot?

1048
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:49,675
Thank you.

1049
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:51,802
I'll put them both to good use.

1050
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:55,055
(ditzy voice): 'Cause, you know,
I totally have so many plans.

1051
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:56,265
(both laugh)
Oh, God.

1052
00:41:58,767 --> 00:41:59,768
Well, to making plans.

1053
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:00,811
Yeah.

1054
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:04,565
All right.

1055
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:12,406
Lucifer.

1056
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:15,618
I get why you had me
con your family.

1057
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:19,121
But what is going on
with you and Detective Decker?

1058
