00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,642
A lot can happen
in five minutes.

182
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:56,185
You can't be suggesting...

183
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:57,520
That you slept
with her? I'm not.

184
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,272
No. That I'm a two-pump chump.

185
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,481
If we'd slept together,
she wouldn't have left

186
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,024
until the morning.
Believe me.

187
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,070
Maybe she'd still be alive.

188
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,072
Okay, what else
can you tell me about Jana?

189
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:10,199
I need to put together
a victim profile.

190
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,285
Well, I mean,
she gave incredible...

191
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,745
And I'm not talking
about her sexual skills.

192
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,539
- Right.
- Maybe her last name,

193
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,875
friends, family, where she was
staying when she was in L.A.?

194
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,376
I'm a lover, not a Rolodex.

195
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:21,461
OFFICER:
Detective.

196
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,045
Found it in the tunnel.

197
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:24,088
Thank you.

198
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:28,634
All threatening texts.

199
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,303
All sent from the same number.

200
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,763
This last one, just before
she got to your place.

201
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:35,057
"Ditch the loser from Lux"?

202
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,102
Oh, this is terrible. She
was seeing someone else at Lux?

203
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,272
I think it means you.

204
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:45,943
(laughs)

205
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:47,695
DAN:
<i>The number on Jana's cell</i>

206
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:50,823
belongs to a wealthy Silicon
Valley guy, Andy Kleinberg.

207
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,325
We tracked his phone's GPS

208
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,827
to some swanky
Malibu beach house.

209
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:58,498
I'll send you
the address, Chloe.

210
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,876
What the hell
are you doing here?

211
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:05,129
You see this?

212
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:07,298
We're basically famous.

213
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,051
Are you nuts?

214
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,720
You brag about what we did
in a police precinct?

215
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,722
Dude. Chill.

216
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,641
- I was coming to get my check.
- Yeah.

217
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:17,808
(laughs)

218
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:19,227
And I thought

219
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:21,604
that we could, uh,
celebrate our righteous kill.

220
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:23,564
(giggles)

221
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,983
We didn't kill anyone, okay?

222
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,068
We just...

223
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:30,071
We gave karmic justice
a little nudge.

224
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:33,157
Oh. Is that what we're calling
the Russian mob now?

225
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,201
- Shh!
- (chuckles)

226
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:36,536
Come on!

227
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,829
Let's grab some vodka,
we'll make it a theme.

228
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:41,624
Maze, we're not having a drink.

229
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:42,792
We shouldn't even
be seen together

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,127
until all this blows over.
Do you get it?

231
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,300
♪♪

232
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,689
Trying to blend in?

233
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,817
Well, it's not often I get
to break out the linen.

234
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,236
Speaking of style, I've got
to get one of these for Lux.

235
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,114
Yeah, that would really
tie the place together.

236
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,574
- Look, for the last time...
- WOMAN: Hey, Lucifer.

237
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,534
Yes. Hello. For the
last time, Detective,

238
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,786
nothing happened
with Jana after you left.

239
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:19,870
I believe you.

240
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,247
- It just doesn't...
- Hey, Lucifer.

241
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,290
...change anything.

242
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:23,499
Well, why not?

243
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,627
Well, look at this party.

244
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:28,838
I bet this is your
definition of fun, isn't it?

245
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:31,591
Well, I mean, I prefer scotch in
a lowball to sex on the beach...

246
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,635
and the drink, I mean.
But dealer's choice.

247
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,512
Okay, well, fun for me

248
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,639
is being home with Trixie,
reading her a book.

249
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:39,599
Really?

250
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:41,559
Yeah.

251
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,020
And that's okay,
but we're different.

252
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,187
Like, too different.

253
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:47,273
Well, as a wise man
once said,

254
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,983
"opposites attract."

255
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,359
I believe that was
an animated cat

256
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,652
in a music video.

257
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,030
- LUCIFER: A <i>wise</i> animated cat.
- CHLOE: Excuse me.

258
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,741
Hi. I am looking
for Andy Kleinberg.

259
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:57,908
Do you know where he is?

260
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,202
Don't waste your time
with him.

261
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,495
Let me get you a drink.

262
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,331
LUCIFER:
Keep it in your pants,
Tommy Bahama.

263
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,540
She's spoken for,
thank you.

264
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:05,750
(chuckles)
No, I'm not.

265
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,376
So do you know
where Andy is?

266
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:09,837
Your loss.

267
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,382
Oh. Thank you.

268
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:14,967
CHLOE:
Andy Kleinberg?

269
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:16,260
You're blocking
my view.

270
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:18,346
The view from a jail
cell sucks, too.

271
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:20,222
What, is this a joke?

272
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,849
Wait, is this one
of George's pranks

273
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,601
to get me back
for that stripper?

274
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:25,519
Hey, are you a stripper?

275
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,396
I'd recommend
you stop talking now.

276
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,940
Jana Lawrence was found
murdered this morning.

277
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,526
She was my stewardess
on my flight yesterday. So?

278
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,320
So you sent her
a threatening text.

279
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,738
"Ditch the loser
from Lux."

280
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:36,572
KLEINEBERG:
Yeah.

281
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:39,241
She said she was hooking up
with some DJ named Lucifer.

282
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,827
DJ? How dare you!

283
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,245
"Meet me now, or else"?

284
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:47,458
Yeah, or else this is shut off. <i>No mas.</i>

285
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,378
Look, I sent that text
to, like, 25 girls last night.

286
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,004
It's called a "booty call."
You ever have one?

287
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,090
Of course not.
Booties call me.

288
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,633
Sometimes.

289
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:56,926
Look, is there anyone
who can prove

290
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,552
you <i>not</i> having sex?

291
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,805
Oh, I had sex.
Meet Sharon.

292
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:03,265
Hey, Lucifer.

293
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:04,600
KLEINBERG:
Oh, yeah.

294
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,102
She can attest to
my whereabouts

295
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,103
all night long.

296
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,521
And she can, too.

297
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:11,691
Now... (sighs)
if you'll excuse me,

298
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,569
I'd like to go somewhere
where you two are not.

299
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:21,325
- LUCIFER: Charming.
- CHLOE: You know...

300
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:22,993
you and him have
a lot in common.

301
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,704
We are nothing alike.

302
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,455
Really? Right.

303
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,916
LUCIFER: Well, that is
clearly off the rack.

304
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:29,917
Inferior linen.

305
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:31,210
Not remotely the same.

306
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:32,920
Regardless, I don't think
he's our killer.

307
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,297
Let's go talk
to your friend Sharon.

308
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:36,882
See if his alibi
checks out.

309
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,968
She's not my friend.
She's just a woman that I...

310
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,761
No, actually, that's worse.

311
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,096
Right, where to, then?

312
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,764
There's been
another murder.

313
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,725
Ballistics match
our flight attendant.

314
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,774
DAN: The victim was in the
shower when he was killed.

315
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:54,734
Signs of a struggle.

316
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,193
Looks like he was
tortured, too.

317
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:57,737
So Jana's killer
had it in

318
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,280
for this poor chap
as well, did they?

319
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,032
On the upside,
looks like he didn't have

320
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,076
anything to do
with this case after all.

321
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,413
Pretty sure you didn't
sleep with this guy.

322
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,584
Uh, actually, you're
wrong about that, Detective.

323
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:16,422
Raj. So fit.

324
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,216
CHLOE:
This isn't good.

325
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:20,968
What, that a man was
one of my lovers?

326
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,970
Come now, Detective,
it's the 21st century.

327
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:24,430
It's not that,

328
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,307
it's that you slept
with both victims.

329
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,767
We've been trying
to find a connection

330
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,351
between the two,
and so far

331
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,436
all we have is you.

332
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,188
Well, I wish
I could help you.

333
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,315
What, you didn't get details
between the sweet nothings?

334
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,191
Quite a few, actually.

335
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,817
But they were mostly
about what he desired,

336
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:38,319
which I doubt
you want to hear.

337
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,406
What if this whole thing
is about desire?

338
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:43,657
You've been with
a lot of people.

339
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,075
What if one of them
got jealous

340
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,744
and wanted you
all to themselves?

341
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:48,245
What, you think
one of my exes is

342
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:49,288
killing off the others?

343
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,916
Look, I've seen what
your exes are capable of.

344
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,459
Charlotte Richards,
to name one.

345
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,877
Bloody hell,
for the last time,

346
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,504
she is not an ex.

347
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:58,881
Either way,
we should warn them

348
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,007
that they could be
in trouble.

349
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,092
While Dan's looking
into other connections

350
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,469
between our victims,
we should talk to

351
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,720
anyone you've slept with.

352
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,347
Oh, that's
a brilliant plan.

353
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,556
It is?

354
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,225
Well, what better way
to prove my word to you

355
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,060
than a bevy of exes
singing my praises?

356
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,561
(chuckles)
Sure.

357
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,813
That's definitely what's
gonna happen.

358
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,189
- Yeah.
- Okay,

359
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,816
a list of everyone
you've slept with

360
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,359
in the last eight weeks.

361
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,362
Right, you'll need
a much bigger notepad.

362
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,906

You slept with all of them?

381
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,235
Yes. Bit of a dry spell
the last couple of months.

382
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,903
- (scoffs)
- This is a waste of time.

383
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:04,905
I refuse to believe that
one of my former lovers

384
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:06,073
would kill another.

385
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:08,534
Yeah, well, so far we don't have
any other connections.

386
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,286
And people will go
to crazy lengths

387
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:13,080
for the ones they love,
even if they're the ones

388
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:14,623
who suggested
the split...

389
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,835
and still have feelings,
even though they shouldn't.

390
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,088
What on earth are
you talking about?

391
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:23,674
Did I just say that
out loud?

392
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:27,094
- LUCIFER: Yes.
- DAN: Oh. Never mind.

393
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:28,929
Right.

394
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:30,890
(over speaker):
It was an amazing,

395
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,725
<i>amazing</i> night.

396
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,643
But the next day,
Lucifer was with

397
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,605
another woman, so did
that make you jealous?

398
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,773
Jealous? Why?

399
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,609
Well, because
he basically

400
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,611
used you for sex
and moved on.

401
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,654
- Did that bother you?
- I knew what I was in for.

402
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:46,864
And what were you in for?

403
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,241
The best night
of my life.

404
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,576
The best night of my life.

405
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,202
The best night
of my life.

406
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,454
The best night of my life.

407
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,915
The best night
of my life.

408
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,041
You know, this is
actually feeling

409
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,543
a bit masturbatory,
even for me.

410
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:01,795
Though clearly not
the words of a killer.

411
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,756
He knew exactly
what I wanted.

412
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,466
- And he did this thing...
- (grunts)

413
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,092
- He did this thing...
- (clears throat)

414
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,595
He even did this thing
with a Pan flute

415
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,138
and a butternut squash...

416
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:12,765
I was improvising.

417
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:13,933
I didn't have
any zucchinis.

418
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:18,103
He did this thing
with my Tibetan singing pot

419
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,855
and artisan honey.

420
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:21,106
It's a game
I play called,

421
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,608
"Do I make you
horny, honey?"

422
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,443
...with some Vaseline
and a car battery.

423
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:26,236
- DAN: What?
- LUCIFER: That was a move I call,

424
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,613
"Gentlemen,
start your engines."

425
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,698
It's bloody brilliant.
(chuckles)

426
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,535
Did you and Lucifer have
any intimate moments?

427
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,412
Obviously, we were intimate.

428
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,206
We were <i>hella</i> intimate.
Mm!

429
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,874
Did you not hear about
the honey? I mean...

430
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,459
(clears throat,
voice cracks)

431
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:44,838
We're talking about, um,
emotional intimacy.

432
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:46,507
Like, um...

433
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,219
did Lucifer, uh,
bring you dinner?

434
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,972
Or did he

435
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,474
do anything special
for you?

436
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:57,601
Get you a burger,
fries?

437
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,019
(laughs)
What? No.

438
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,313
Look, it was a rad night.

439
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:02,356
...and morning...

440
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:03,440
...and afternoon...

441
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,735
But...
that's all.

442
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:07,569
Mm.

443
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,489
I mean, I certainly wouldn't
hurt anyone over him.

444
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,366
What? No.

445
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,243
There was no reason
to hurt anyone.

446
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,453
I mean, he was just
a meaningless

447
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,080
- one-night-stand.
- CHLOE: Mm.

448
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,290
- It was just about sex.
- It's just sex.

449
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,583
It's just sex.

450
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,003
There was no emotional
connection.

451
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:25,462
WOMAN: That was it,
it was fun,

452
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,006
but completely meaningless.

453
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,549
- Just fun...
- ...but meaningless.

454
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,592
- Meaningless.
- It meant nothing. Nada.

455
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,052
I never saw him again.

456
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,721
See where I'm going
with this?

457
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,685
Well, look, man,
the good news is...

458
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,688
none of them has motive
to be the killer.

459
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:46,108
Yes. Because none of them
cared enough about me

460
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,317
to murder.

461
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,403
WOMAN:
Thanks for calling me in.

462
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,114
I actually wanted
to speak with you.

463
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,409
Wait a minute,
why is she here?

464
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,579
I don't know. I keep telling
the detective she's not my ex.

465
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,748
MOM:
I wanted to tell you that

466
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,041
you impressed me.

467
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:03,125
Really?

468
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,793
- Yeah.
- Mm.

469
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,962
I underestimated you.

470
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,298
I gave you all
the reason in the world

471
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:10,591
to betray Lucifer.

472
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,342
You did.
During that case

473
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,553
you went to incredible
lengths to hurt Lucifer.

474
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:15,971
I did nothing
of the sort.

475
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,390
You took that case
just to try and get me

476
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,100
to call Lucifer
a liar in court.

477
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,728
True, but I would never
hurt Lucifer.

478
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:24,980
I was trying to prove

479
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,940
that you weren't
worthy of him.

480
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,152
I see. What about
the other women

481
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,403
that you don't think
are worthy of him?

482
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,321
What'd you do to them?

483
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,573
(chuckles) Nothing.

484
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,825
They are inconsequential.

485
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:39,078
You're different.

486
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,330
He's different
when he's with you.

487
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,001
Does that threaten you?

488
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,754
Perhaps at first.

489
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,422
Not anymore.

490
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,216
It makes me happy.

491
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,676
I'm glad he found someone.

492
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,930
He deserves a woman
like you in his life.

493
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:05,145
Have you slept
with him yet?

494
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:06,313
What?

495
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:07,689
See?

496
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:09,608
You're different.

497
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,027
Where were you the night
of the 27th?

498
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,403
(exhales)

499
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,405
Hey, listen, man,
you're not gonna, uh...

500
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,074
You're not gonna
tell Chloe about

501
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,283
me and Charlotte,
right?

502
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,868
Well, as long as
you promise to never

503
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:20,911
touch Charlotte again.

504
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,871
No, it's not a problem.

505
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,333
Good. 'Cause the last thing
I need is a step-Dan.

506
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,796
You say some really
weird things, man.

507
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,597
You ever do something
awesome for somebody,

508
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,683
and they just don't care?

509
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,226
I'm a therapist.

510
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,479
Being taken for granted
is in the job description.

511
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,149
- MAZE: Hmm.
- LINDA: Like, for example,
when a friend

512
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,025
uses your lunch break
for free therapy,

513
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,027
and doesn't say
thank you.

514
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,864
You want me to take care
of this friend of yours?

515
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,908
Yea... It's fine.

516
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,493
So how do you deal with it?

517
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:04,663
I just realize that
self-worth comes from within.

518
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,290
You can't rely
on others

519
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,332
to validate you.

520
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,084
I don't care what
anyone thinks of me.

521
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,711
Of course you do,
we all do.

522
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,421
You know, and that's okay.

523
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,006
That's human.

524
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,091
I'm a demon.

525
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:17,968
I actually think
you're more human

526
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,678
than a lot of people I know.

527
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:21,555
Take that back.

528
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,057
Okay, okay,
you're a good friend

529
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,851
and a great pers...

530
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,519
Demon.

531
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,606
You just need to
realize it for yourself.

532
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,025
Not because I said it.

533
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:34,693
(minor gasp)

534
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,237
You're saying I'm awesome.

535
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,782
I'm saying that <i>you</i> need
to say that you're awesome.

536
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,660
Believe that
you're awesome.

537
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,500
Yes, you're awesome.

538
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,211
Hell yeah I am.

539
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:54,796
Thanks, Doc.

540
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:56,757
(door opens)

541
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,217
CHLOE:
<i>Did you notice anything</i>

542
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,593
out of the ordinary?

543
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,886
Did anyone threaten you?

544
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:02,554
I mean, there was
that one girl.

545
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:03,639
What girl?

546
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,098
The creepy weirdo.

547
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,100
She was always in a
corner of the club.

548
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,936
She just gave
this death stare.

549
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,270
Daggers.

550
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,189
Okay, can you
give me a description?

551
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:14,274
Well, I can describe
her aura.

552
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,069
That's okay.

553
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,321
Her name is Suki Price.

554
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,282
A number of your exes confirmed
seeing her lurking around Lux,

555
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:24,743
so we ran her description
through the DMV.

556
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,411
Are you sure you
don't recognize her?

557
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,163
No, which is strange,
'cause I remember

558
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,957
the face of everyone
I've been with.

559
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,417
- Hmm.
- Oh, maybe
she's mask girl.

560
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:33,877
Let me guess:
Halloween?

561
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,629
What? No.
President's Day.

562
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,214
(chuckles) Or maybe,
I don't remember

563
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,132
'cause it was just another
meaningless encounter.

564
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,886
This case not the trip down
memory lane you were hoping for?

565
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:44,096
Oh, it's almost enough
to make a man

566
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,681
question the way
he's lived his life.

567
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:46,932
Almost.

568
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:48,725
Well, luckily this girl
gives me hope.

569
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:51,436
At least one of my former lovers
might be willing to kill for me.

570
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,480
Oh. It's open.

571
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,567
LAPD. Anyone home?

572
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,947
Well, this isn't creepy at all.

573
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,454
See? I told you someone cared.

574
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,421
Look at this.

575
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:20,799
Multiple chest hair options.
Amazing.

576
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,426
I can make a lasting impression.

577
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,637
Yeah, on someone
with serious issues.

578
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,140
This woman is clearly deranged,

579
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:29,975
dangerous, and...

580
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,353
Why am I on this wall?

581
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,731
Well, maybe she can just
sense the inevitable.

582
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,607
(toilet flushes)

583
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,609
Suki Price? LAPD.

584
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,155
What're you doing in my--

585
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,406
(screams)
Lucifer!

586
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:45,907
- CHLOE: Okay, hey, hey.
- LUCIFER: What--

587
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,244
- (toilet flushes)
- Hey, come out
with your hands up.

588
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,252
This is one of
your exes?

589
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,588
Do you know,
I'm really not sure...

590
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,673
I-- darling, could you do this?

591
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,010
And say, "I am
not a crook."

592
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,513
No, it's definitely not
Sexy Richard Nixon.

593
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:10,599
I'm quite certain
we've not slept together.

594
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,309
Well, I could have
told you that.

595
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:13,852
Care to explain
the wall?

596
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:16,813
Oh... I'm just...

597
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,398
really into Lucifer.

598
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,317
(chuckles)
And who could blame you.

599
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,069
You're my perfect man.

600
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:25,030
Like porn
and stuffed crust pizza

601
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:28,075
and my Hello Kitty blankie
all rolled into one.

602
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,703
I've loved you from afar.

603
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:32,537
LUCIFER:
Right.

604
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:33,747
I see what's
happened here.

605
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,333
Not having sex with me
drove her into a murderous,

606
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,501
psychotic rage.

607
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,378
Murder?

608
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:40,670
What are you talking about?

609
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,547
We're investigating the
deaths of Jana Lawrence

610
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:45,133
and Raj Daniere.
Have you heard of 'em?

611
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,511
I have all of Lucifer's lovers
categorized.

612
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,055
Uh, uh...

613
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,182
here is the flight
attendant section.

614
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,976
Here's Jana with Raj.

615
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:56,895
CHLOE: So the two of them
knew each other?

616
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,855
Raj is Jana's GBFFN.

617
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,109
<i>Was</i> her GBFFN.

618
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:04,945
A gay best friend for now.

619
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:06,238
Oh.

620
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,032
She sometimes crashed on his
couch whenever she was in L.A.

621
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,743
Hmm. And w-what are
these numbers about here?

622
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,079
Date from two days ago.

623
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,207
The last time
Lucifer and Jana

624
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:18,417
hooked up.

625
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:19,793
LUCIFER: Right.
Much as I admire

626
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,753
your dedication to this
creepy stalker business,

627
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,714
- LUCIFER: I have to correct you,
there was no hookup.
- CHLOE: Mm.

628
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,426
But I made
a commemorative doll.

629
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,514
You're wearing your new suit.

630
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,934
Yes, what excellent detail
on the French cuffs.

631
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,644
That's what I was
doing last night.

632
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,813
Oh, you can ask the
pizza delivery man.

633
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,022
He helped me
with these

634
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,482
teeny tiny buttons.

635
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,735
Ask him.
(sniffs)

636
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,321
Who's the third person
in this photo?

637
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:54,744
SUKI: Uh, that's
a pilot Jana works with.

638
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,455
Those three hang out together
all the time.

639
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,457
Maybe he knows
what happened.

640
00:24:58,665 --> 00:24:59,666
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

641
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,293
Look, I'm gonna
send an officer by

642
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:02,502
to get a full statement
from you.

643
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:03,837
Do not leave town.

644
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,883
And abandon Lucifer?

645
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,343
(Suki chuckles)

646
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:12,637
Never.

647
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,142
Right, good-bye.

648
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:20,604

Mm-hmm.
Oh...

654
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:47,422
And you want me
to try this because...?

655
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,133
This "espresso" concoction
is my favorite thing

656
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,468
about humanity so far.

657
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,053
Well, besides sex, but...

658
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:54,221
(groans)

659
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,597
You're looking well
these days.

660
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:57,724
So confident, so cheery.

661
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,809
(chuckles)
I almost didn't recognize you.

662
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,812
Thanks to you, Mom.
You found a way to get us home.

663
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:05,190
But...

664
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,275
manipulating Lucifer
and Chloe toward each other

665
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:08,693
for our own gain...

666
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,529
Your Father is the one
that started all of this.

667
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:13,240
We are simply bringing it
to an end.

668
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,449
On our terms.

669
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,535
I've tried to manipulate
Lucifer before.

670
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:18,370
It didn't end well.

671
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,580
That's because you lied to him.

672
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,707
Lucifer respects the truth.

673
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:24,376
So use that to get us all home.

674
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:27,254
And then, we can
put all of this behind us.

675
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,218
This is delicious.

676
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,345
Mm-hmm.
Still not as good as sex.

677
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,555
Mom!

678
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,098
Please.

679
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:41,434
DAN: Our pilot's name
is Tim Pickman.

680
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,353
He's got a record:
drugs and assault.

681
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:44,813
Used to work for a big airline,

682
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:47,107
now he flies rich
dudes on small jets.

683
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,651
His recent routes are...

684
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:52,404
The Caribbean, Mexico
City, Ahmedabad.

685
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,573
Yes, all hotspots
for drug smugglers.

686
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:56,324
O-Or so I'm told.

687
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,910
Working for a private airline
would be the perfect cover.

688
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,871
You have quick travel,
lax customs agents...

689
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,582
And if Pickman was
smuggling drugs,

690
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,417
maybe Jana and Raj
found out about it,

691
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,627
threatened to squeal, so he
shut 'em up permanently.

692
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,212
Yes, murder's
handy that way.

693
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,880
Okay, where do we find him?

694
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,591
Let's see.

696
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,262
FAA reports he filed a
last-minute flight plan.

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,806
Flying Van Nuys to Caracas,
takes off in less than an hour.

698
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:22,058
Okay, we got to get

699
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:23,893

Well, I'm pondering

Guy smuggles a lot of drugs

He recruits 'em on the

On Jana's last flight,
a package went missing.

A package?

751
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,439
So, what,
Burt thought Jana stole it?

752
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:35,233
And when she didn't have it,
he went after Raj.

753

for someone to pretend

762

to have this
mysterious package.

763
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:54,586
Yes, and it would
need to be someone

764
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:55,962
who might have
worked with Jana.

765
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,213

Uh, Tim, who
else was on the flight?

Just me,

768
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,886
Andy Kleinberg, my copilot,

769
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:04,053
and a new flight attendant.

770
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:05,430
A new flight
attendant?

771
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,265
So Burt may not have known
what she looked like?

772
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,103
I'm in.

773
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,272
Okay, but you understand
what you're agreeing to, right?

774
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:15,774
Sure.

775
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:17,692
You want me to bounty hunt
this Burt scumbag

776
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,527
and pretend to
deliver his package.

777
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,321
But we'll need you to
work with us on this one.

778
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:22,822
We'll set up the meet
and everything.

779
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,158
Do I still get to rough him up
before the cops do?

780
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,496
We'll be close by,
but technically, yeah.

781
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,539
More in. You want
to know why?

782
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:32,999
Because we're
running out of time

783
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,250
and you're
our only option?

784
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:35,376
No.

785
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,754
Because I'm awesome.

786
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,839
Because I take risks
for my friends

787
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,549
and I don't need
your thanks.

788
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:44,677
Am I supposed to be
thanking you for something?

789
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:46,012
No.

790
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,516
Because self-worth comes
from within, bitches.

791
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,559
Now,

792
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,270
if you'll excuse me,

793
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,189

Right.

797
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:15,458
I should've assumed
you'd be busy.

798
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,085
I can come back.

799
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,920
Well, no, no, that's
not a euphemism.

800
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:22,048
I mean an actual police
sting operation.

you're here...

boyfriend material?

804

To anyone.

807
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,358
So I've come to
realize, but...

808
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,318
what does that say
about me, brother?

809
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:45,864
Is this about Chloe?

810
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,618
And why would
you think that?

811
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,706
Mom, she...
told me what happened

812
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,624
or what almost happened,
apparently.

813
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,042
Did she now?

814
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,919
So, I suppose
you're gonna tell me

815
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:01,880
humans and the divine don't mix.

816
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,798
Luci, listen, I
have underestimated you

817
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:04,966

818

to frustrate me

never admit it, but...
- (Lucifer scoffs)

821

when it comes to Chloe...

822
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,021
perhaps you've been
underestimating yourself.

823
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,649
Careful, brother. That sounds
dangerously like a compliment.

824
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,026
Ah, take it how you like.

825
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:25,361
You never listen
to my advice, anyway.

00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,013
Okay? So, just...

889
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:59,348
step outside and get some air.

890
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,017
I don't need air.

891
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:02,351
Well, I do.

892
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:06,230
Right.

893
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,191
Understood.

894
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,276
♪♪

895
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,955
(sighs)

896
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:29,837
A man just entered the bar.

897
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:31,589
Got you.

898
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,135
You are one of the
prettiest flight attendants

899
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:37,303
I've ever seen.

900
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,888
- Oh.
- I'm Burt.

901
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:40,264
Hi, Burt.

902
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:42,892
You ready for takeoff?

903
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,895
(chuckles)

904
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,314
They're on their way
to the hotel room.

905
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,618
Are you ready for the package?

906
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:03,704
Mm-hmm. I think that's
supposed to be my line.

907
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,502
I know you killed
that flight attendant

908
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,254
and her friend, dirtbag.

909
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:13,297
(grunts)

910
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:16,342
No, no, no! My name's Jim!

911
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:17,885
Some guy gave me a C-note,

912
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:19,637
told me to sit next to you
and say I was Burt.

913
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,097
(screams)

914
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:22,807
If that's not our killer
then where is he?

915
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,691
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

916
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,942
(chuckles)

917
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,445
Burt, I presume.

918
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,453
(Jim groaning)

919
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,080
Can I keep him?

920
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:46,914
JIM:
Get her off me!

921
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:48,040
She's insane!

922
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:49,375
Well, you better start talking.

923
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,294
Where's the man
that paid you?

924
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:54,005
I don't know. He saw some tall
guy with dark hair in a suit.

925
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:55,089
He took off.

926
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:56,465
That's Lucifer.

927
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:57,633
Yeah.

928
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:00,428
Recognized you
from the beach party.

929
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,180
Of course.
Tommy Bahama.

930
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:03,514
It's good that you found me,

931
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,766
'cause I've been meaning
to ask you something since then.

932
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:07,685
Where'd you get the water slide?

933
00:37:07,894 --> 00:37:08,895
I'd love one for Lux.

934
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:10,104
I'm not sure where I'd put it...

935
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:11,147
I want my package.

936
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:12,815
Now.

937
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:17,111
I should've known Jana left it
with you after I saw her at Lux.

938
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,114
That's why she was only there
a few minutes-- to stash it.

939
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:23,075
No, the reason that she left
so quickly was because

940
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,661
she was unhappy
that I didn't have sex with her.

941
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,663
Yeah, I don't believe you.

942
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,624
No one says no
to a girl like that.

943
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:32,543
I'm finding it hard to believe
myself, trust me, but, uh,

944
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,962
as for your package, Burt...

945
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:37,340
I don't have it.

946
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:38,841
Liar.

947
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,468
Oh, come now.

948
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:41,928
Surely a little bit of cocaine

949
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:43,846
isn't worth all
the senseless killing.

950
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:44,931
Cocaine?

951
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,643
What's in that package
is far more valuable than drugs.

952
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,478
- Oh.
- It's my ass on the line,

953
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:51,938
and that stupid bitch Jana...

954
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:00,238
You don't speak of her that way.

955
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:02,865
You promised Jana the world

956
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:05,243
and everything
she could ever desire.

957
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:09,121
Money, drugs,
a life of pleasure,

958
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:11,874
but she deserved
better than that...

959
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,793
better than you...

960
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:16,587
or me.

961
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:21,634
I mean, what did either of us
really give her?

962
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:23,636
Empty pleasure?

963
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:25,846
Hey, man...

964
00:38:27,265 --> 00:38:28,307
we can work something out.

965
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:29,350
(chuckles)

966
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,769
I'll find the package.
I'll get paid. We'll...

967
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:34,021
We're similar in a lot of ways,
aren't we, Burt?

968
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:36,732
Except for one.

969
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:41,445
You're a bad man and I'm not.

970
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:45,700
I'm much...

971
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:47,910
much worse than that.

972
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,666
(shouting)

973
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,877
- (shouts)
- Lucifer!

974
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:01,507
There's your killer,
detectives.

975
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:03,509
Think you'll find he feels
quite remorseful

976
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:04,760
about the life he's led.

977
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,804
Please... okay, p-please,
just-just arrest me, okay?

978
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:07,763
DAN: Okay, get up.
BURT: I'm sorry.

979
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:09,307
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Stand up.

980
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:10,349
I'm sorry.

981
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,564
Hey.

982
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:18,733
About what you heard
in the van...

983
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:20,234
Hey, it doesn't matter...

984
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:22,445
except something
still bothers me.

985
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,823
Burt went to a lot of trouble
for a single drug deal.

986
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:30,786
Yeah, well... the guy had
a reputation to protect.

987
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,706
You know? One person
steals from him,

988
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:35,958
everyone else thinks
they can, too.

989
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,919
CHLOE: <i>All right.
But then who has the package?</i>

990
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:47,136
How... how did you find me?

991
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,805
I'm sorry I took it.
I was desperate.

992
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:51,015
I'm broke.

993
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:52,933
When the stewardess let it slip

994
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:55,186
how much cash she was gonna make
from this delivery, I...

995
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:57,521
I thought it was drugs.

996
00:39:58,272 --> 00:39:59,482
I was gonna sell them.

997
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,775
Then I opened it.

998
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:02,943
One of them broke.

999
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,988
I spilled a little on myself.
Now...

1000
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,327
What the hell
is happening to me?

1001
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,579
(grunts)

1002
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:15,206
(choking)

1003
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:37,269
Hey, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1004
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:39,980
I tracked your phone's GPS.

1005
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:43,109
Well... here I am.

1006
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,113
Well, we should wrap up
the arrest report,

1007
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:50,324
and by that I mean paperwork,
not some celebratory drink

1008
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,743
that you'll then
turn into a moment.

1009
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,870
(chuckles)
Yes, well...

1010
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:57,373
I've changed my mind
about that, actually.

1011
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:00,042
I realized it would never
work out between us.

1012
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,544
- Really?
- Yes.

1013
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:06,882
So, from now on, no
more attempts at moments.

1014
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:10,761
I'd be honored to, uh, simply
continue working by your side...

1015
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:13,097
...if you'll have me.

1016
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,266
Of course.

1017
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:16,684
- Good.
- Yeah.

1018
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:18,394
It's not like you
to give up, but...

1019
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:19,937
Oh, no, I haven't given up.

1020
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:22,731
I had a...
an epiphany, of sorts.

1021
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:26,444
You deserve someone worthy
of you and that isn't me.

1022
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:28,487
That's not what
I've been saying, Lucifer.

1023
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,781
I know.
It's what I'm saying.

1024
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:34,869
You... deserve someone better

1025
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:36,996
because you, Detective,

1026
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,957
are selfless to
a nauseating degree.

1027
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:44,211
You always put
your daughter first,

1028
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,963
even though the ungrateful
urchin does nothing

1029
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:47,173
to contribute to the rent.

1030
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:49,091
- (laughs)
- So...

1031
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,635
you deserve someone
worthy of that grace.

1032
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:54,805
Someone who knows that every
crime scene breaks your heart,

1033
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:56,599
even though
you'd never admit it.

1034
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:58,809
Someone who
actually appreciates

1035
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:01,312
your impossibly boring
middle name.

1036
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:02,730
Jane.

1037
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:05,774
More importantly, Detective,
you deserve someone

1038
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:07,151
as good as you...

1039
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:09,570
because...

1040
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:13,991
well, you're special and I'm...

1041
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:17,995
...I'm not worth it.

1042
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:27,004
Yeah, you're probably right.

1043
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:37,097
Detective...
