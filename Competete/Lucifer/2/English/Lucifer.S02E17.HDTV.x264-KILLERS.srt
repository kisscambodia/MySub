1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:02,418
Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:04,725
Operation "Help Lucifer
Escape From the Hospital."

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,273
And you, my dear doctor,

4
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:07,920
are going to help me. Let's go.

5
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:09,420
The three of you plan to use...

6
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:11,500
this Flaming Sword

7
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:14,015
to cut through the gates
of Heaven and go home.

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,171
- What does Maze think of your plan?
- Well, I don't know; I haven't told her.

9
00:00:16,196 --> 00:00:18,257
So what, are you going on a vacation?

10
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:19,797
Lucifer didn't tell you.

11
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:21,757
We're all going back to Heaven.

12
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:25,476
She's been acting very
odd recently, on edge.

13
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,938
This obsession with getting home

14
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,720
is a bit much, don't you think?

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,166
That's because only you,

16
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:33,993
my Lightbringer, can ignite it.

17
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:35,798
- That's it?
- It's all I've got!

18
00:00:35,823 --> 00:00:37,079
You have to try harder.

19
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,759
I'm not broken; the sword must be.

20
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:41,665
This is what Uriel
was trying to tell me.

21
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,548
There's another piece missing.

22
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:07,255
Lucifer, we need to
talk about something.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,931
What... Can it wait?

24
00:01:08,956 --> 00:01:11,859
I'm busy keeping an eye
on our mercurial mother.

25
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:15,196
No, it's important. I think
you might be in danger.

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,977
Is it the Yakuza?

27
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,311
The Nephilim?

28
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,846
One Million Mums?

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,393
It's Maze.

30
00:01:22,418 --> 00:01:23,938
She's angry with you, brother.

31
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,001
Well, is it Tuesday already?

32
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:28,756
Anger is Maze's default setting,

33
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,949
sort of baked into her demon DNA.

34
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,361
No, this is different, Luci.

35
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,094
I think you really need to talk to her.

36
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,827
She'll get over it; she always does.

37
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:39,485
Right now, we have bigger
issues to deal with,

38
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,352
like whether or not
Mum is wasting our time.

39
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:45,030
If she believes her client

40
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:48,100
has found another piece of
the Flaming Sword, so do I.

41
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:51,303
Oh, such a loyal son.

42
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:54,386
But Mum hasn't adapted to this
world as well as you might think.

43
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:57,417
This chap could be conning her.

44
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:02,323
- I think I'm gonna go make sure...
- She seems to be doing just fine.

45
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,317
That's not the money, is it?

46
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,784
Of course not. She wouldn't
bring it to the meeting.

47
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,613
Oh, no. Of course not.

48
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:13,034
I mean, that would be
absurd, wouldn't it?

49
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:14,425
She's just showing it to him.

50
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,409
I mean, it's not like
she's gonna hand it to him

51
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:18,493
before she... gets the piece.

52
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:19,831
That's great.

53
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,854
And now she's letting
him leave. Marvelous.

54
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:29,207
Well, that went well.

55
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,751
- Oh, you think so, do you?
- I do.

56
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,880
He has what we need in
his safe in the back room.

57
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,115
- Oh.
- He's going to get it right now.

58
00:02:37,183 --> 00:02:40,171
Mum, you just handed him
a briefcase full of cash

59
00:02:40,196 --> 00:02:42,097
with no proof whatsoever
he has what we need.

60
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:44,861
- And?
- You've been conned.

61
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:46,702
He's a client of mine, darling.

62
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:48,784
I don't think he'd be that foolhardy.

63
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:50,213
Oh.

64
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:55,057
Well, I'm sure he'll be right back.

65
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:58,908
Maybe we should go
check just to be sure.

66
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:00,768
I think that's a good idea, don't you?

67
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:03,154
Oh.

68
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:10,459
Huh. See? He didn't con me.

69
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:13,128
Look, instead he's dead,
and someone robbed him

70
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:15,089
of what's ours... much better.

71
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:19,034
Well, the good news is, after
this spectacular bungling,

72
00:03:19,102 --> 00:03:21,703
I happen to work with
a homicide detective.

73
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:23,071
If you find the killer,

74
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:24,847
then you'll find our
piece of the Flaming Sword.

75
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:26,310
- Hey, but, Mom...
- The challenge is...

76
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:28,744
making sure we catch the case
before some other detective.

77
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:30,645
- But what about...
- I may be able to help.

78
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:33,315
Really? I'm all ears.

79
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:46,294
- Is everything all right here?
- Yeah, everything's fine, Maze.

80
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:49,387
You can, uh, you-you
can put away the knives.

81
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:54,005
We'll be in touch, Dr. Martin.

82
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:59,478
Excuse me.

83
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:03,072
Uh, Maze.

84
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,664
Maze.

85
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:06,808
Oh, my Lord.

86
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:10,033
Who the hell was that?

87
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:14,494
That was the chairman of
the ethics review board.

88
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,986
- Are you okay?
- No.

89
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:19,556
No, I am not.

90
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,751
No, Maze. No, no, no, don't, don't.

91
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,210
That won't do any good.

92
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:25,172
What happened?

93
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:28,136
A couple of weeks ago,
I maybe, sort of...

94
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:31,680
helped Lucifer break out
of a mental institution.

95
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,742
Using my own name.

96
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:36,869
- It's my fault, really.
- No, it is not your fault.

97
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:39,986
It is Lucifer's fault.
It's always Lucifer's fault.

98
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:42,736
First, I find out he's
ditching me to go to Heaven,

99
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,886
and now he's hurting you.

100
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:48,078
Look, I'm gonna fix this, Linda.

101
00:04:48,103 --> 00:04:50,939
And then him and I are
gonna have a little talk.

102
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:12,344
- Hey, I should get my own desk.
- Not happening.

103
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:13,830
Right next to yours
would probably be best.

104
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,048
Definitely not happening.

105
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:17,166
Why are you hovering over me?

106
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,522
I'm not hovering. I'm just
spending time with my partner.

107
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,548
Oh, well, since you're here,

108
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,111
why don't you help me
with this paperwork.

109
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,736
I could really get
used to this, partner.

110
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,476
Right. Yes, on second thought,

111
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:31,148
maybe a desk in the far corner might...

112
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,968
- Mm-mm.
- Oh! Ms. Richards.

113
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:36,251
Detective Decker. Just the
woman I was hoping to see.

114
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:39,258
Well, I feel the opposite.
If you'll excuse me.

115
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:40,581
Hear me out.

116
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,158
A client of mine called.
He sounded very worried.

117
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:45,681
I think he might be in terrible danger.

118
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:46,906
Oh, that's awful.

119
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:49,509
- Detective, we should do something.
- He's at a bar downtown.

120
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:52,906
Would you come with me and
make sure that he's okay?

121
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:54,285
Nope.

122
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,541
- Nope?
- I'm a homicide cop.

123
00:05:56,566 --> 00:06:00,001
I do not go around checking
on worried criminals

124
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,619
like a nanny, Charlotte.

125
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:05,228
- So if we're done here.
- I heard... things.

126
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:10,329
On a... on-on the phone call.

127
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:12,313
Like?

128
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:16,774
Fingers... pointing.

129
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,173
You heard... fingers pointing?

130
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:23,283
Very angrily.

131
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:25,110
Yes.

132
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,748
Also, a gunshot.

133
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:30,607
Sounded like he was...

134
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:33,263
dying, or, um...

135
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,174
melting?

136
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:37,978
It's hard to tell.

137
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:40,999
- Charlotte...
- It sounds worth our time, actually.

138
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,367
Agreed.

139
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,636
Why didn't you just lead with that?

140
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:52,424
The lock's damaged.

141
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:53,760
Is it?

142
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:58,592
Looks like you're right.

143
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:01,082
He's been dead about an hour.

144
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:02,858
Oh? Impressive guess, Detective.

145
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,061
Uh, I'm assuming from the...

146
00:07:05,702 --> 00:07:07,522
discoloration.

147
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:11,247
Well, that wasn't a
complete Dumpster fire,

148
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:13,272
but now that we're finished,
you can see yourself out.

149
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,298
I'll do nothing of the sort.

150
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:17,256
Fine. I'll show you out, if you insist.

151
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:19,600
I'm not going anywhere.

152
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,662
But the detective and I have
got everything handled now.

153
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:25,489
This is far too important to
leave to just the two of you.

154
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:28,179
- I will stick around.
- Mum.

155
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,522
Besides, we'll get to work together.

156
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:32,522
Won't that be fun?

157
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:41,358
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

158
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:44,829
We're running tests for
gunshot residue and cocaine.

159
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:46,188
Should have those in,
like, five minutes.

160
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:47,722
Okay. Good.

161
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,393
Oh, Charlotte.

162
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:52,811
You're still here, huh?

163
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:54,311
Well, he was my client.

164
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:56,428
I thought I might be
of help to the case.

165
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:58,671
But if not, we could
always get her to shoo along

166
00:07:58,696 --> 00:07:59,881
and we can carry on with our business.

167
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:01,803
No. I'm sure she could be very helpful.

168
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:03,069
So tell me, why does Zeke Moore,

169
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:05,131
a manager at an import/export company,

170
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:06,678
have you representing him?

171
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:08,826
- Because I'm the best.
- At getting criminals off.

172
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:10,194
Well, that's not true.

173
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:12,196
I haven't slept with any of my clients.

174
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:13,618
What?

175
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:15,303
You represent the worst of the worst.

176
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,978
So why was Zeke a client?

177
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:18,670
Because he works for Bianca Ruiz.

178
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:20,194
What? The tequila magnate?

179
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:22,300
Bianca's tequila empire is a front.

180
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:25,311
She uses the distribution
routes to sell guns, drugs,

181
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,823
and, oh, yeah, people.

182
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,147
So we've been after her for a long time.

183
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:31,709
Who do you think did this?

184
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:33,735
A rival of some sort?

185
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,494
Well, that's actually a good question.

186
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,834
Ella, what do we have?

187
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:38,874
Well, no smoking gun,

188
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,501
but poor Zeke here got shot twice.

189
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:42,866
First in the thigh...

190
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,428
bullet winged him... and then another

191
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:49,322
went through his hand
hitting him in the chest.

192
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:51,491
Probably trying to defend himself.

193
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:53,363
Too bad you can't catch bullets.

194
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:54,730
Well, he can't maybe.

195
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:56,501
I don't think this
was a professional hit.

196
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:58,353
Maybe a robbery gone wrong.

197
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:00,275
And idea of what was taken?

198
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,884
Well, trace elements point to cash,

199
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,211
cocaine, gunpowder residue,
indicating weapons...

200
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:08,587
all your basic bad guy stuff.

201
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:10,465
No sign of forced entry, though.

202
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,109
Which means the killer
either knew the combination,

203
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:15,237
or he just waited for the
vic to open it to strike.

204
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:16,466
Mm-hmm.

205
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:19,728
Hey, I got something here.

206
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:23,337
Cell phone.

207
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,251
No dust on it, so it
hasn't been there long.

208
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,183
Well, Zeke had his phone on him,

209
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:29,918
so this one could be the killer's.

210
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,501
Maybe he dropped it during the fight

211
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:34,565
or just didn't have time to retrieve it.

212
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,267
Passcode protected, of course.

213
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,571
But the home screen is... two eyes?

214
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:41,774
Human female breasts.

215
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:44,290
No. That is a woman's
perfectly freckled rump.

216
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:46,807
So our lead on the killer

217
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:50,696
is a pair of butt-boob-eyes.

218
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,595
It's a great start.

219
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,208
Hello, Daniel.

220
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,161
What are you doing here?

221
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:14,044
Ms. Ruiz there...

222
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:15,731
is my client.

223
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:18,784
Well, she's a real piece of work.

224
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:23,382
Trying to make me jealous?

225
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:25,402
What do you want from me?

226
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:27,495
You seduce me, you betray
me, now you're back.

227
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,661
You have to want something,
I just can't figure out what.

228
00:10:29,686 --> 00:10:31,520
I do want something, you're right.

229
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:32,879
And I'll tell you.

230
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:36,036
Just somewhere private.

231
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:39,789
I'm not having sex with you here.

232
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:43,011
But I need something to pass
the time until we get a lead.

233
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:44,905
I don't understand you.

234
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,306
All right, whatever this is between us.

235
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:50,867
Well, it's simple, Daniel Espinoza.

236
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:53,430
I like you.

237
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,240
♪ I get that money ♪

238
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,109
♪ That money don't get me ♪

239
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:03,446
♪ Oh, ain't it funny how
they all want to be a G ♪

240
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:04,780
♪ I make it happen... ♪

241
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:06,148
You guys, it's a record label.

242
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:09,031
The symbol on the phone we
found is the label's logo.

243
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:11,244
And they choose to publish this music

244
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:12,574
of their own free will?

245
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,878
It's a vanity label.
It exists only to make

246
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:16,605
this one guy's music.

247
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,910
Okay, well, who owns it?

248
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:20,417
And can you please turn it off?

249
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:22,109
Chet Ruiz.

250
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,620
Bianca's youngest son.

251
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:26,042
Half our billing goes to
keeping him out of jail.

252
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,800
So Bianca's own son

253
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:31,363
robbed and killed one of
her most loyal soldiers?

254
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:34,050
The files barely mention Chet.
I didn't know he was actually

255
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:35,976
- part of the family business.
- He's not.

256
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:38,566
Bianca tries to keep him as far
away from it all as possible.

257
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:41,175
Maybe he started to resent
that, decided to make a play?

258
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,533
And then dropped his phone,
proving just how right

259
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:44,894
his mother was about him.

260
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,761
Well, if Chet is the killer,
this could be our chance

261
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,949
to take down Bianca, as well.

262
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,972
Cut off the head of
her entire operation.

263
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:52,278
This could be huge.

264
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:55,368
Yeah. Bummer is the phone
proves that Chet was in the room

265
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:58,153
but doesn't definitively
tie him to the murder.

266
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:00,412
Dan, why don't you work
on hacking the passcode.

267
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:01,974
I'll have a chat with Chet.

268
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,277
And, Charlotte, thank
you so much for your help.

269
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:06,362
But now that one of your
clients is our main suspect,

270
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:07,684
it's best you go.

271
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,410
I don't think I have to go quite yet.

272
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:11,145
Maybe not, but I think you should.

273
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,356
Bianca's having a party today.

274
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:15,746
It's the launch of her new tequila.

275
00:12:15,771 --> 00:12:18,206
I'm sure Chet will be there, and...

276
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:19,528
I'm invited.

277
00:12:19,553 --> 00:12:20,895
Why do you want to help us now?

278
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,320
Because we all want the same thing:

279
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:24,907
to find out who robbed and killed Zeke.

280
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:26,638
You know, Chloe, it
would be a good chance

281
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,052
for us to go undercover.

282
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:30,067
Gather some intel before they
even know we're onto them.

283
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:32,550
- All right.
- Fine.

284
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:33,673
Good. It's settled.

285
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,840
The detective and I will go, so
thank you so much for your help.

286
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:37,677
I don't think so.

287
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:39,590
The invitation is under my name.

288
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:41,323
I will go.

289
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:44,652
Perhaps Detective
Espinoza should join me.

290
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:46,887
No. Yes, that's not happening.

291
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:49,200
- Uh, very well. I'll go with you...
- No, I'll go with Charlotte.

292
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:51,215
- But, Detective...
- No more argument.

293
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,928
Very well. But I
suggest you go shopping.

294
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:57,004
This isn't the kind of place
you can attend in pajamas.

295
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:00,907
This is ridiculous.

296
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,918
Pajamas?

297
00:13:02,943 --> 00:13:04,347
What if Ella goes to the party?

298
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:06,074
That sounds like a great idea.

299
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,601
Oh, my God. Thank you so
much for thinking of me.

300
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:10,776
But you know what? I'm so busy.

301
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,304
I have been sidelined

302
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,504
by my own mother and the detective.

303
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,058
It's absurd.

304
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,174
I won't stand for it.

305
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,500
I am gonna find a way into that party.

306
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,455
Do you always whine like this?

307
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,024
I don't know how she puts up with it.

308
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:26,762
Where's Dr. Linda?

309
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:28,301
Suspended.

310
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:29,972
Because of you.

311
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:31,605
Because you have been a terrible,

312
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,457
selfish friend.

313
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:35,972
To her.

314
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:38,338
Now you're gonna fix it.

315
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:41,365
Well, gladly, once I figure
a way back onto the case.

316
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,303
No, Lucifer.

317
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:45,929
Now!

318
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,015
But I suppose they can
handle things without me

319
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:50,614
for the time being.

320
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,518
What's the plan?

321
00:13:56,414 --> 00:13:59,019
It'll take two hours to scan the phone.

322
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:02,061
I'll come to you.

323
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:04,534
I'll kill some time till it's done.

324
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,019
See you soon.

325
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:10,970
Hey, man.

326
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:12,445
You looking for your brother?

327
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:13,873
Or my m... um...

328
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,241
Charlotte?

329
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:16,502
Listen, um...

330
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:18,377
are they here? Because I
haven't been able to reach them.

331
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:19,735
No, they took off.

332
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,142
Couple hours ago.

333
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,201
Of course they did.

334
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:24,294
And why would they
bother to let me know?

335
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:26,080
I could try to call them for you.

336
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:27,893
Don't worry about it, Dan.

337
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:29,549
I mean, with a brother like Lucifer,

338
00:14:29,574 --> 00:14:31,441
I really should be used to this, right?

339
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,137
Hey.

340
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,347
What are you doing right now?

341
00:14:57,816 --> 00:14:59,151
Charlotte Richards.

342
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:02,149
Have you seen my plus one?

343
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:03,823
She's a tired-looking blonde.

344
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,593
Probably dressed in something
freshly-plucked from the floor.

345
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:08,794
- Mm-mm.
- Hmm?

346
00:15:25,764 --> 00:15:27,878
Let's get this pajama party started.

347
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:44,865
I still don't understand
why you're helping us.

348
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,315
Bianca's your client.

349
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,873
I'm not the same woman
I was when she hired me.

350
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,631
Hmm. Did you have a change of heart?

351
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,154
No, the same heart.

352
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:53,880
Completely different soul, though.

353
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:54,975
Hmm.

354
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,818
There's Chet. I'll go talk to him.

355
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:00,303
You know, that's wise.

356
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:01,684
You seem more his type than me,

357
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,419
and you're not
particularly intimidating,

358
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:05,382
- so that should help.
- Help what?

359
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:08,006
Well, in seducing him, of course.

360
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:10,397
I'm not gonna seduce him, Charlotte.

361
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:12,532
Not with that posture you're not.

362
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,795
- Fine. I'll do it.
- No. No.

363
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,403
There's gonna be no seducing.

364
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,138
We just need to get Chet to talk,

365
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:19,673
have him incriminate himself,

366
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,008
then we can arrest him
and flip him on Bianca.

367
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:24,477
You expect him to betray his own mother?

368
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:27,714
One that's given him
everything he's ever wanted?

369
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:30,073
Not all kids appreciate what
their parents have given them.

370
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:31,518
Well, that I agree with.

371
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:34,680
I just think with a little
pressure, he'll crack.

372
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:36,323
Oh, bodyguard.

373
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,666
Maybe he's not as easy
to get to as I thought.

374
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:40,760
Why would an overprotective mother

375
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:43,274
bring her murderous son
to a tequila-fueled party?

376
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:46,455
Well, if her son killed
Zeke, she has no idea.

377
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,627
Okay. I've got an idea.

378
00:16:56,828 --> 00:16:59,469
Dr. Linda Martin is an amazing therapist

379
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:01,090
and an incredible woman.

380
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:02,596
You can't do this to her.

381
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,418
Well, I'm afraid that she
brought this on herself.

382
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:07,455
So, unless there's something...

383
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,579
specific that you can tell me,

384
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:11,690
there's very little that I can do.

385
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:12,869
Hmm.

386
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:17,464
Well, how about proof of
all the good she's done?

387
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:20,233
Like this guy. Lucifer Morningstar.

388
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,635
Oh, that's quite flattering.

389
00:17:21,702 --> 00:17:23,619
The worst patient anyone could ask for.

390
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:26,815
He is a back-stabbing, selfish,

391
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,699
narcissistic little devil.

392
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,869
- He's greedy...
- Is there a-a point to this?

393
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:33,354
Yes, I'm wondering the same thing.

394
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:36,044
The point is, despite all of that,

395
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,537
she went out of her way to help him.

396
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:40,020
Yeah, she's right.

397
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:43,223
The doctor has seen a
side to me that I hide

398
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,704
because it's, well, terrifying.

399
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,284
But she accepted me nonetheless,

400
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:50,612
and she's helped me through issues
that I thought insurmountable.

401
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,910
I appreciate the testimonial,

402
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,936
and I will include it into the notes.

403
00:17:57,318 --> 00:17:58,685
That's it?

404
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,678
Unless you have more evidence to submit.

405
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,549
Well, she's generous.

406
00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:06,850
As a, as a therapist, as a lover,

407
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,323
- a friend...
- Wait.

408
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:12,377
- You slept with your therapist.
- What?

409
00:18:12,402 --> 00:18:13,784
O-only in the beginning.

410
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:16,143
Then she decided that I shouldn't
pay for therapy with sex.

411
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:18,135
So, such strong morals, don't you think?

412
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,268
Let's go!

413
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:20,326
What the...?

414
00:18:20,351 --> 00:18:22,299
Oh, no, no, she saved my life.

415
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:24,097
I mean, granted, she killed me first,

416
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,732
- but I did ask her.
- Oh, my God.

417
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:27,122
Lucifer.

418
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:33,533
We actually have been trying
to get the formula for...

419
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:34,940
Charlotte.

420
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:36,854
Excuse me. Oh.

421
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:37,979
Mmm.

422
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:40,704
So glad you can make
it. How are the children?

423
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:42,682
They're angels.

424
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:45,417
But speaking of children...

425
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:47,620
What did Chet do now?

426
00:18:47,688 --> 00:18:49,729
Run out on another tab?

427
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:54,955
The police suspect him
of killing Zeke Moore.

428
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,276
That's impossible.

429
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,651
I have it from a very good source.

430
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:01,159
I'll get to the bottom of it.

431
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,418
Thank you, Charlotte.

432
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:03,752
- As always.
- Of course.

433
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:04,940
Enjoy.

434
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:11,682
What did you do?

435
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,346
What could I do?

436
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,401
You won't let me drink, my bank
account's pretty low lately...

437
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:18,674
Zeke Moore. What did you do?

438
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,135
I took care of a problem.

439
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,393
You're welcome.

440
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:23,798
You don't work for me.

441
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:25,862
But I should. Look what I can do.

442
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:27,916
Yeah, remove one of my best earners?

443
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,935
You see, this is why you need me, Ma.

444
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,742
I found out that Zeke was
building up his own business.

445
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:36,838
Smuggling up rare artifacts on the side.

446
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:38,729
And I was making 30%.

447
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:40,548
Oh.

448
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:42,369
Well, I would have known that
if you had just given me...

449
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:43,955
How do the police know it was you?

450
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,362
I may have...

451
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,056
dropped my phone.

452
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:51,205
Chet, what was on your phone?

453
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:54,815
Let's go somewhere quieter.

454
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,108
No, Mom. Mom, Mom.

455
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:02,516
The whole business?

456
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,705
I was just trying to learn how
the financial part worked, Ma.

457
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,151
You know, prove to you I
could be a part of this.

458
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:08,890
So you saved it on your phone,
which the police now have.

459
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:09,949
Don't worry.

460
00:20:09,972 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm already taking care of it.

461
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:13,119
Won't be a problem.

462
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:19,362
What?

463
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:22,452
Hello.

464
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,166
Improv?

465
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,073
Really?

466
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:47,323
Come on, man, you promised
me you wouldn't laugh.

467
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:51,913
I went through a lot this last year.

468
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:55,283
And improv sort of
helped me reorient myself.

469
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:57,291
How?

470
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,922
Well, it took stepping outside of myself

471
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,425
to figure out who I really was.

472
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:06,595
You know, stop defining
myself by other people.

473
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,864
Chloe. Lucifer.

474
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:10,232
I see.

475
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,834
So you think I'm defining
myself by my brother, yeah?

476
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:14,102
Well, I know from experience,

477
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,182
the dude casts a pretty big-ass shadow.

478
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,991
Well, if there is one
constant in the universe,

479
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:21,799
it's that Lucifer's the favorite.

480
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:23,940
No matter what I do.

481
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:27,244
No matter how hard I work
or how much he screws up.

482
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:30,252
It's never gonna change.

483
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:37,099
You guys must have competed
over everything, huh?

484
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:39,716
I mean, he would never admit it, right?

485
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:42,525
But yeah. Yeah, everything.

486
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,236
Even women?

487
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,620
Eh, I just noticed that you and Lucifer

488
00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:49,678
have a weird relationship
with Charlotte Richards.

489
00:21:49,703 --> 00:21:50,775
I just thought maybe you guys...

490
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,035
No, Dan, we are not
competing over Charlotte.

491
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:54,963
Trust me.

492
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:58,320
At least, not in the way you think.

493
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:01,580
And if we are, well, obviously I lost.

494
00:22:02,225 --> 00:22:04,126
Because I'm here, with you.

495
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:06,885
No offense.

496
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,322
Yeah, none taken.

497
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,102
Oh, man.

498
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:13,049
They couldn't crack the passcode.

499
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:16,008
But, uh, for what it's worth,

500
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:18,830
I like you a hell of a lot
more than I like your brother.

501
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:32,680
I know everyone here except you.

502
00:22:32,705 --> 00:22:34,723
What are you doing here?

503
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:37,361
I, uh...

504
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:39,220
I'm... uh, was...

505
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:41,635
I came because, well...

506
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:44,666
I love your son's music.

507
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:45,830
Hi, Chet.

508
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:47,908
Chet, you're so good. You're amazing.

509
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,588
Oh, please. I've seen the sales.

510
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:53,916
Nobody actually listens
to that... stuff.

511
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:56,814
Oh, I listen to it, big-time.

512
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,158
♪ I-I... get that money ♪

513
00:22:59,183 --> 00:23:01,814
- ♪ That money don't get me ♪
- ♪ Me! ♪

517
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:09,257
- Yeah.
- That's enough, ma'am.

518
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:10,459
Chet, you're so good.

519
00:23:10,484 --> 00:23:11,502
- You're dope!
- Let's go.

520
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:14,029
- I love you. I...
- I love you more.

521
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,025
Dan. Hey. Look, that phone...

522
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,627
I think it is way more
important than we thought.

523
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:27,682
It might be the key
to taking down Bianca.

524
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,513
Great. Now that we've solved that,

525
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,248
I can get back to the case and...

526
00:23:33,316 --> 00:23:35,846
Ooh! God! What?!

527
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:38,120
What? You just made everything worse.

528
00:23:38,187 --> 00:23:40,656
Why am I surprised? Just leave.

529
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:43,158
Since that's been your
plan all along anyway.

530
00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:45,360
Is that what all this has been about?

531
00:23:46,996 --> 00:23:49,783
Amenadiel told you about our
trip back to Heaven, didn't he?

532
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:51,369
Don't you blame him.

533
00:23:51,394 --> 00:23:52,528
- You...
- Aah!

534
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:53,752
... should have told me.

535
00:23:53,777 --> 00:23:55,837
Well, if you understood
the full picture...

536
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:56,963
Oh!

537
00:23:56,988 --> 00:23:58,840
Stop hitting me.

538
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:00,056
Then explain.

539
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:01,982
Well, I'd like to,
but you have a tendency

540
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,439
- to get emotional about things.
- Aah!

541
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:05,898
Case in point.

542
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:08,314
So I needed to be
controlled, is that it?

543
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:09,908
What the hell am I, Lucifer...

544
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:11,696
a pawn in some plan of yours?

545
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:13,322
No, I wouldn't put it like that.

546
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:15,533
Of course you wouldn't,
because that would actually

547
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:18,694
require you understanding
how you affect people.

548
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:21,530
- How you hurt them.
- Oh! Aah!

549
00:24:21,597 --> 00:24:23,899
You seem to be the one doing
the hurting at the moment.

550
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:26,501
You don't care about
anyone other than yourself.

551
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:29,328
Unless they can be of use to you.

552
00:24:30,506 --> 00:24:32,174
Sound familiar?

553
00:24:32,564 --> 00:24:35,486
Tread very carefully, Maze.

554
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,837
You're just like your parents.

555
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,506
Aah!

556
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:58,423
- Aah!
- Oh!

557
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,414
Maybe... maybe we should

558
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,899
just take a time-out so that...

559
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:11,611
you can catch your breath.

560
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:14,055
Yeah, so you can catch your breath.

561
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,111
And then, I'll get back
to kicking your ass.

562
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:23,003
See, now...

563
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,361
I had no idea that you
were this mad at me.

564
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:31,943
You were gonna leave me.

565
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:36,703
I would never do that.

566
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:40,078
But you told Amenadiel and your mom

567
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:43,039
that y... you were going
with them to Heaven.

568
00:25:43,064 --> 00:25:46,172
Well, I didn't say how long for.

569
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:47,594
Huh?

570
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:50,408
Or what I was gonna do when I got there.

571
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:55,869
You're playing your own angle.

572
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:04,172
And you didn't tell me...

573
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:08,552
because you needed me
to be angry with you

574
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:10,949
so you could sell your story.

575
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:12,576
Exactly!

576
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:16,098
So, all this...

577
00:26:16,123 --> 00:26:17,390
was for nothing.

578
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:24,206
Lucifer, that's even worse.

579
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:35,202
This phone could be the key

580
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,083
to taking down the entire Ruiz empire.

581
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:39,342
Yeah, but how do we crack it
if cyber couldn't even do it?

582
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,888
Time. That idiot
didn't install a program

583
00:26:41,913 --> 00:26:43,213
that can remotely wipe the phone.

584
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:46,264
And it's an older phone
with just a four-digit code.

585
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:47,819
So, what, we just keep
trying till we get in?

586
00:26:47,844 --> 00:26:50,387
- How long will that take?
- There are only 10,000 options.

587
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:52,780
Well, actually, 9,996 now...

588
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:55,490
I took a couple stabs.
So, hey, making progress.

589
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:57,280
I would say maybe a month.

590
00:26:57,305 --> 00:26:59,567
Well, we can't arrest 'em till
we know what's on that phone.

591
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:00,795
And if they decide to
make a run for it...

592
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,280
All right. Let's just
try to speed it up.

593
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:03,546
Let's look into Chet's background,

594
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:05,100
let's try and come up
with number combinations

595
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,851
that might be meaningful
to him, all right?

596
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,061
Let's go.

597
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:13,010
Did you guys...

598
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:15,413
kill the chairman of the review board?

599
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:17,397
Please tell me you didn't kill him.

600
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:18,882
Not that he didn't deserve it,

601
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,087
the smug, insufferable...

602
00:27:21,112 --> 00:27:24,040
No, no. No one's dead.
We did this to each other.

603
00:27:24,065 --> 00:27:25,656
Though...

604
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:28,525
when it comes to your case,
I fear I may have, um...

605
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,312
complicated things.

606
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:32,963
Lucifer told him you used to screw.

607
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:35,332
- Among other things.
- Oh?

608
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,118
Oh.

609
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,305
Well, I guess that's that.

610
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:42,618
No, that isn't that.

611
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:44,575
I want to know why she's
still upset with me.

612
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:47,392
Since I'm not currently a
practicing doctor of psychiatry,

613
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,632
I don't have to lead you
on this path of realization;

614
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:50,972
I can just tell you.

615
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:54,954
Maze is pissed at you
because you used her.

616
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:56,429
Sure.

617
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:59,154
But for the greater good of
our debauchery here in L.A.

618
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,013
Did you even once think
of how this affected her?

619
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:03,069
Of course I did.

620
00:28:03,094 --> 00:28:05,095
Thought about how she
might ruin everything

621
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:08,251
by disemboweling my mum
or castrating my brother.

622
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:10,367
I meant her feelings.

623
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:12,736
- What?
- She thought...

624
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:15,048
you abandoned her.

625
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:19,009
That you didn't care
how that affected her.

626
00:28:19,034 --> 00:28:22,566
But those sort of things
never bothered her be...

627
00:28:25,794 --> 00:28:27,928
before.

628
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:31,353
Oh.

629
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:36,160
Mazikeen.

630
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,761
I didn't realize...

631
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:45,335
I should have realized.

632
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,506
Well, my work here is done.

633
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:57,091
Literally.

634
00:28:57,982 --> 00:28:59,216
So, if you'll excuse me,

635
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:03,957
I'm going to find a very stiff martini.

636
00:29:11,777 --> 00:29:13,178
Linda.

637
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:15,983
I'll take care of this.

638
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:17,707
I promise.

639
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:32,049
Bianca.

640
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,005
Has something happened?

641
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:36,093
Yes.

642
00:29:37,138 --> 00:29:39,870
My son robbed and
killed Zeke, as you know.

643
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:42,759
But then he showed me
what Zeke was smuggling.

644
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:44,821
And for whom.

645
00:29:45,442 --> 00:29:47,004
Now I have it.

646
00:29:47,612 --> 00:29:50,267
And I think it's very
important to you, isn't it?

647
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:53,151
- It is.
- Then let's make a deal.

648
00:29:53,176 --> 00:29:55,155
I'll give it to you

649
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,195
if you get my son's
phone from the police.

650
00:29:58,401 --> 00:29:59,768
That's not possible.

651
00:29:59,793 --> 00:30:01,180
You'll find a way.

652
00:30:02,187 --> 00:30:05,086
Otherwise, I'll make
sure that what you want...

653
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:07,221
disappears forever.

654
00:30:19,195 --> 00:30:22,963
Birthday reverse. Nope.

655
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:25,311
Double 69.

656
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:27,933
Oddly relieved that's not it.

657
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:31,133
Ms. Lopez.

658
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,835
We haven't really had
the chance to meet.

659
00:30:33,903 --> 00:30:37,500
I know. I've been looking
forward to a formal "hey-ya."

660
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:39,733
- S... uh...
- Uh, no, I see you're still

661
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:41,859
working on the phone.

662
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:43,801
I knew Chet well.

663
00:30:43,826 --> 00:30:47,028
Perhaps I could borrow it,
maybe try some combinations?

664
00:30:47,964 --> 00:30:50,106
I see through you.

665
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,856
I know you are waiting around

666
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:55,642
for my boy Dan.

667
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:57,210
Oh.

668
00:30:57,278 --> 00:30:58,831
Caught me red-handed.

669
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:02,276
And even though most
everybody is all like,

670
00:31:02,301 --> 00:31:03,783
"She a shark,

671
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:06,419
"those dead eyes, don't trust her,"

672
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:08,421
when I look at you...

673
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:10,590
I see a light.

674
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:12,181
Did my bandage come undone?

675
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,716
So, for now,

676
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:16,894
benefit of the doubt.

677
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:19,442
But if you ever hurt Dan again,

678
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:22,155
I'll have someone break your legs.

679
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:29,394
Oh, that's my brother.

680
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:31,988
I've been trying to get
ahold of him forever.

681
00:31:32,746 --> 00:31:34,283
Can you watch the phone?

682
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:35,757
Sure.

683
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:37,329
Thanks.

684
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:41,075
See? Light.

685
00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:49,862
Start talking.

686
00:32:07,082 --> 00:32:08,348
Ah!

687
00:32:11,373 --> 00:32:13,028
What happened to you?

688
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:16,652
Oh, this. It's just a little
fisticuffs between friends.

689
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:20,026
I just had a very enlightening
conversation with Charlotte Richards.

690
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:21,527
Ah. Well, I've had my fill

691
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:24,421
of enlightening conversations
for today, thank you.

692
00:32:25,202 --> 00:32:27,300
Lucifer, she told me who she really is,

693
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:29,248
and how you two are related.

694
00:32:29,273 --> 00:32:31,738
I somehow doubt that.

695
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:33,573
No, it all makes sense.

696
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:35,008
Why you were so disgusted

697
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:37,276
when I suggested you
two had slept together.

698
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:39,202
Why you act so weird
around her in general.

699
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:41,643
She... really told you.

700
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,467
What did she tell you?

701
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:45,809
That she's your father's ex.

702
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:49,881
Right, yes, no. That's-that's true.

703
00:32:49,906 --> 00:32:51,257
Right, yeah.

704
00:32:51,282 --> 00:32:52,971
I mean, the way she
talked about your dad

705
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:55,264
and-and what he put her through.

706
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:58,084
Mm-hmm. Betrayal,
torture, Hell, et cetera.

707
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,599
- All true.
- Mm-hmm.

708
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:03,136
I just cannot imagine raising
kids with someone like that.

709
00:33:03,161 --> 00:33:06,426
Sympathy for the goddess, Detective?

710
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,917
Why didn't you just tell
me she was your step-mom?

711
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:12,703
Well, it didn't seem
that simple to explain.

712
00:33:12,728 --> 00:33:15,281
I mean, how did this
all come about, anyway?

713
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:17,316
Well...

714
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:20,211
I... I caught Charlotte
trying to steal evidence

715
00:33:20,236 --> 00:33:22,021
for Bianca Ruiz.

716
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:23,256
What?

717
00:33:23,323 --> 00:33:24,557
Why would she do that?

718
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:25,992
Well, apparently Bianca figured out

719
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,994
that Charlotte and I were
working together at the sting.

720
00:33:28,062 --> 00:33:29,604
Bianca threatened Charlotte's family.

721
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:32,250
I mean, she threatened
you if she didn't help.

722
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:34,794
Well, that sounds plausible, yes.

723
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:36,586
I don't know.

724
00:33:37,004 --> 00:33:38,604
Something about it doesn't feel right.

725
00:33:38,672 --> 00:33:40,888
I don't know if I can trust her.

726
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:42,775
Well, I mean, I know I'm biased,

727
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:45,090
but one thing's for certain, Detective:

728
00:33:45,115 --> 00:33:46,846
Charlotte Richards will stop at nothing

729
00:33:46,914 --> 00:33:48,865
to protect her children.

730
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:53,386
- You can trust that.
- Hmm.

731
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:57,623
- Did you bring me what I asked for?
- Mm.

732
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:00,783
As promised.

733
00:34:03,913 --> 00:34:05,883
Make sure it's real.

734
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,047
That it wasn't cloned.

735
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,883
_

736
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:25,017
To the things a mother
will do for her children.

737
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:27,020
I'll drink to that.

738
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:30,262
I can't even count the times

739
00:34:30,287 --> 00:34:32,636
that Chet has come close to
destroying everything I've built.

740
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:35,613
Children always find
new ways to test us.

741
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:37,167
She's talking about Amenadiel.

742
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:39,381
Put us through... hell.

743
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:40,963
That one's me.

744
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:43,263
And yet we still protect them.

745
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:44,902
Always.

746
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,888
_

747
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:56,450
Now for your side of the bargain.

748
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:05,265
We lost the feed.

749
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,741
- She's up to something.
- Well, no, no, no.

750
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:07,930
She may have just shorted the bug.

751
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:10,032
No. Charlotte Richards
is either screwing us over

752
00:35:10,057 --> 00:35:11,168
or she's in trouble.

753
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,489
Guys, get ready to go in.

754
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:14,345
And she better be in trouble.

755
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:20,489
This opens a safety deposit box.

756
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:22,703
Inside you'll find what
Zeke was smuggling for you.

757
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:24,744
This isn't what we agreed to.

758
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:27,599
How do I know you'll hold
up your end of the deal?

759
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:29,592
Because I always do.

760
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:31,398
And quite honestly, I don't see why

761
00:35:31,424 --> 00:35:33,425
you put so much value in...

762
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,238
Freeze! See your hands!

763
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,231
LAPD. Bianca Ruiz, you're under arrest.

764
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:40,957
This is absurd.

765
00:35:40,982 --> 00:35:43,735
Charlotte. Charlotte.

766
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,295
Will no longer be representing you.

767
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:50,168
You're making a terrible mistake.

768
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:52,768
Don't touch me.

769
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:55,411
Charlotte, are you okay?

770
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:56,805
- Yes.
- Lucifer, don't.

771
00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:58,207
Step away. I need to search her.

772
00:35:58,275 --> 00:36:00,099
Well, I don't think that's
necessary, Detective.

773
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:03,159
- Well, I do.
- It's okay, son.

774
00:36:03,184 --> 00:36:04,451
Fine.

775
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:05,810
Arms out.

776
00:36:09,152 --> 00:36:10,653
Hmm.

777
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:13,536
Oh, you're being incredibly thorough.

778
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:16,548
I like it.

779
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:21,385
- She's clean.
- Well, I told you, Detective,

780
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,998
she's got nothing to hide.

781
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:24,800
The phone was still unlocked.

782
00:36:24,868 --> 00:36:26,536
We have everything.

783
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,623
Seems like we do.

784
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,078
Let's, uh...

785
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,606
A book?

786
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:49,037
That's what Zeke smuggled for me?

787
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:52,569
Is this a joke?

788
00:36:52,594 --> 00:36:54,323
Well, if it were, I would
have chosen something funnier,

789
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:56,302
like Douglas Adams or Freud.

790
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:57,995
Are you certain...

791
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,191
that this is all that was
in the safety deposit box?

792
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,659
Well, how is a book

793
00:37:01,684 --> 00:37:03,151
supposed to ignite the sword?

794
00:37:03,176 --> 00:37:05,540
Maybe it's an instruction manual.

795
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:10,208
In an ancient language I can't read.

796
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:11,833
Wonderful.

797
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:12,899
Here.

798
00:37:12,924 --> 00:37:15,049
Wh... I can't read it.

799
00:37:15,117 --> 00:37:16,988
But you speak every language.

800
00:37:17,013 --> 00:37:18,314
Speak, not read.

801
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:20,287
I've always found tongues
much more useful than books.

802
00:37:20,312 --> 00:37:21,866
So whatever language this is...

803
00:37:21,891 --> 00:37:23,659
It's Sumerian.

804
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:26,746
Unlike some of us who had
everything handed to him,

805
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:28,967
I actually spent my youth studying.

806
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:31,615
Excellent.

807
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,229
My smart boy.

808
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,448
How-how quickly can you translate it?

809
00:37:37,473 --> 00:37:40,026
Um, should only take me a few days.

810
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,652
Days?

811
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,611
I don't have that kind of time.

812
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,481
Mum, why have you got your
knickers in such a twist?

813
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:48,883
Is there a reason why
you're in such a rush lately?

814
00:37:48,951 --> 00:37:52,648
I-I'm just anxious to see
the rest of the family.

815
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:55,955
Please start translating.

816
00:38:00,095 --> 00:38:02,296
There's something going on with her.

817
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,724
Yeah. Or it's just that
time of the millennium.

818
00:38:08,604 --> 00:38:10,489
What?

819
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,848
Excuse me.

820
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:23,030
Not this time.

821
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,974
- Hey.
- Hey.

822
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:32,804
Congrats on nabbing Queen Tequila.

823
00:38:33,117 --> 00:38:34,827
Well, Chet's still out there,

824
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:37,487
so this isn't over until I find him.

825
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:39,200
You and Charlotte Richards...

826
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:41,736
that is the most awkward
team-up of the century.

827
00:38:43,116 --> 00:38:45,261
Actually, it wasn't
as bad as I expected.

828
00:38:45,286 --> 00:38:47,620
I learned a lot of
eye-opening things about her.

829
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:50,554
That's for sure. Like her
being Lucifer's step-mom.

830
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,075
- Had no idea...
- Wait a minute.

831
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,679
She... step-mom?

832
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,075
Yeah. Yes.

833
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,018
That makes a weird
amount of sense, actually.

834
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,624
Dan, I want you to be careful with her.

835
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:05,622
There's something
about her I don't trust.

836
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:07,691
I'm gonna be fine, Chloe.

837
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:11,059
- Wait. One more thing.
- Yeah.

838
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:13,759
If you married her,

839
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:16,624
you'd kind of be like Lucifer's dad.

840
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,905
- Oh, my God.
- Right?

841
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,531
It's so, so messed up.

842
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:41,195
I'm glad you agreed to meet me.

843
00:39:41,263 --> 00:39:43,130
Well, of course I did.

844
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:46,742
I knew that book couldn't be it.

845
00:39:48,337 --> 00:39:49,503
Well, come on.

846
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:53,320
Hand it over. I need
what Zeke really smuggled.

847
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,647
Now.

848
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:02,513
Mm. A knife.

849
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:05,490
We already have...

850
00:40:07,723 --> 00:40:10,424
My life is ruined!

851
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,326
I don't want to go to prison.

852
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:13,794
This is all your fault!

853
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:55,733
Who knew translating
could be so exhausting.

854
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,282
Listen, I think I found something.

855
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:01,506
Huh?

856
00:41:01,531 --> 00:41:05,094
God shattered the Flaming Sword
into three distinct pieces.

857
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,701
"The Blade of Death."

858
00:41:06,726 --> 00:41:08,026
Azrael's.

859
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:09,699
"The Medallion of Life."

860
00:41:09,724 --> 00:41:12,086
Johnson's belt buckle.

861
00:41:12,402 --> 00:41:15,322
And the key that binds
them all together.

862
00:41:17,426 --> 00:41:20,490
Well, keys don't bind, they unlock.

863
00:41:20,515 --> 00:41:23,336
I think someone needs to go
back to translation school.

864
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:28,926
And guess who has the key.

865
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,749
Well, don't leave me in suspense.

866
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:34,942
Who is it, brother?

867
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,677
It says that God entrusted the key

868
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,943
to his favorite son.

869
00:41:42,971 --> 00:41:45,471
Of course he gave it to you.

870
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:48,609
It's always you, isn't it?

871
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:49,834
Well, what are you talking about?

872
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:51,487
The only keys I've got are these.

873
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:56,128
What else did you bring
with you to Earth, Luci?

874
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:58,891
Your ring.

875
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:01,903
I've never seen you without
it; maybe that's the key.

876
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:04,563
Well, the key to completing
my ensemble maybe.

877
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,193
Here.

878
00:42:06,218 --> 00:42:08,787
Try and attach your ring to this.

879
00:42:08,854 --> 00:42:10,355
- Brother.
- Just do it.

880
00:42:10,423 --> 00:42:11,867
And we'll confirm what we already know.

881
00:42:11,892 --> 00:42:13,785
- Brother...
- That Father's favorite,

882
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,177
despite everything that you have done,

883
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:17,327
is and always has been you.

884
00:42:17,496 --> 00:42:18,811
Look down.

885
00:42:23,336 --> 00:42:25,087
Is that the key around your neck

886
00:42:25,112 --> 00:42:27,313
or are you just happy to see me?

887
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:33,976
He entrusted it...

888
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,839
