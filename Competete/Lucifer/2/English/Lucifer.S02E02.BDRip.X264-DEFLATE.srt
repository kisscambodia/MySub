to me in Hell instead of sending

109

110
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,355

00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,344
I cut them off.

184
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,472
Why would you...?
I mean, come to Earth,

185
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,724
get a haircut or something,
but that's a little extreme.

186
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:36,058
Hey, bud.

187
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,520
Can I tag in next?

188
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:40,688
Excuse me?

189
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:41,856
With the lady.

190
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,483
How much?

191
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,443
This one you <i>could</i> kill. Come on.

192
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:47,987
I'm joking!

193
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:49,572
I'm joking, Mother.

194
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:51,741
Gosh.

195
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,367
You're gonna have to
lose those clothes.

196
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,994
They're a
serious problem.

197
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:56,871
Taking you home,

198
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,499
'cause this being out in public
thing obviously isn't working.

199
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,918
And then I'm gonna
see my colleague...

200
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:03,794
Mum!

201
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:06,047
- Yes?
- You're naked!

202
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:09,175
Well, you said the clothes were
a problem, so problem solved.

203
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,385
Get in the bloody
car, will you?!

204
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,180
God. Traumatized
for eternity now,

205
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,389
so thank you
very much for that.

206
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,391

Maze?

214
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,199
Ah, good, you're still here.

215
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,367
I have a job for you.

216
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,786
On my way out, Lucifer.
No more jobs.

217
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,704
Yes, yes, I know.
You don't work for me anymore.

218
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,415
Very clear. But I have a feeling
you're gonna love this one.

219
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,210
Just think of it
as a parting gift.

220
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,461
Come on.

221
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,004
(clears throat)

222
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,716
Hello, Mazikeen.

223
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:55,304
Is that her?

224
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:56,389
Mm-hmm.

225
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,765
In a human body?

226
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,267
- (chuckles)
- Well, unfortunately.

227
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,561
For you.

228
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,564
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
Maze, but hands off.

229
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:05,731
What?

230
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,149
You're kidding.

231
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:09,819
Millennia, Lucifer...

232
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:12,822
with no physical form.
(chuckles)

233
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:16,576
But now...

234
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,788
...look at all that flesh.

235
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:22,456
LUCIFER: Yes, but sorry, dear.
No torture.

236
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,250
Just don't let her
out of your sight.

237
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,419
Until I've worked out
whether she's lying or not,

238
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,545
she can't be trusted.

239
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,132
You want me to babysit?

240
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,843
Well, "my mum in the body of
a disturbingly hot woman"-sit,

241
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,636
but yes, for now.

242
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,601
(clicks tongue) Mmm.

243
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,494
I was just trying to give
Tammy Twinkletoes a makeover.

244
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,711
Honey, you...
you popped out her eye.

245
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:10,504
Yeah.

246
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,256
That was an accident.

247
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,217
LUCIFER (over intercom): Well, I
think she looks rather fetching.

248
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:16,636
Lucifer.

249
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:20,097
Hello, Detective.
Sir Douche. Offspring.

250
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:21,349
CHLOE: You know,
I bet you're actually

251
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,309
behind this, aren't you?
Sadly, no.

252
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,102
Can't take the credit,
but I do approve.

253
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,271
Can we get to work now, please?

254
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,565
I'm just wondering if there's
any fresh homicides popped up.

255
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:30,816
(sighs)

256
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,276
Ooh, you know,
when you make that face,

257
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,694
you look a bit like the doll.

258
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:34,862
(scoffs)

259
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:38,741
(Lucifer humming dance beat)

260
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,368
- Hey.
- Ah, look.

261
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,828
You can disco a bad guy
into confessing.

262
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,330
This isn't a game;
this is parenting.

263
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,790
And it's important.

264
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,125
She mutilated
Tammy Twinkletoes.

265
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:50,044
And I'm sure
there's a real mutilation

266
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,796
out there to solve as we speak.

267
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:53,214
Something that screams

268
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,841
"crazed witchy woman
on a rampage" perhaps?

269
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,219
What? Not that I know of.

270
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,471
Okay, I'm gonna go
back in there.

271
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,555
Detective!

272
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:02,890
Just a doll.

273
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:04,392
I don't know what all
the fuss is about.

274
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,062
It's not just a doll;
it's manipulation.

275
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,606
- What?
- Trixie's best friend
Landa got a new

276
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,441
All-American doll,
and now Trixie wants one.

277
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,485
So what does she do?
She destroys her old doll,

278
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:16,987
- expecting me to replace it.
- Mm, impressive.

279
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,197
But, then, I'd
expect nothing less

280
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:19,407
from the shrewd
little minx.

281
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,992
- Why don't you comply,
then we can get on, yes?
- No.

282
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,328
And I'd appreciate it if you
don't undermine my authority.

283
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,579
But you're being
a bad mother.

284
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,165
Abandon the child
in its time of need,

285
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:29,333
- and it won't trust
you in the future.
- (phone ringing)

286
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,043
- Is that what you
want, Detective?
- Decker.

287
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,670
- (sighs)
- Yeah.

288
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:34,755
Got it.

289
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,716
New case. Hotel Gleam.

290
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,093
Ah, finally!
Fantastic news.

291
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,057
He's practically a kid.

292
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,934
Yeah, 19 or so.

293
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:48,394
CHLOE:
How long has he been here?

294
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,104
ELLA: I don't know,
maybe a few days.

295
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,605
Guess the maid
really took

296
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,441
the "do not disturb"
sign seriously.

297
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:57,945
Cause of death: single
puncture wound to the neck.

298
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,739
I'm thinking ice pick.

299
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,449
Or a screwdriver, perhaps.

300
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:02,867
Five-inch, Phillips head?

301
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:04,243
Huh.

302
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:06,203
Yeah. Maybe.

303
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:07,413
You're good.

304
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,706
I know. Detective,

305
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,583
interesting pool of
blood through here.

306
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,339
I'm assuming it belongs
to Cinderella here.

307
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,925
Cinderella? Sure we don't mean
evil stepmother?

308
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,094
Really?

309
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,139
Are we really still on the whole
"my mother did it" thing?

310
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,974
I thought she was responsible
for our last murder.

311
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:28,476
What, you're just throwing
homicides at her

312
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,478
- until one sticks?
- No, I'm simply saying

313
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,646
that the missing woman
may well be our killer.

314
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,274
A murderous psycho
whose rampage started

315
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:36,776
by impaling that poor lad.

316
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,903
Okay, my guess is that this
is an affair gone wrong.

317
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,156
Jealous husband follows
his cheating wife here.

318
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,700
He kills the young lover,
he wounds her,

319
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,744
and then he drags her home
or she escapes.

320
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,287
Definitely the latter.

321
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:49,455
(sighs) Well, we would know more

322
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:50,956
if she had left
more than a shoe.

323
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,292
We don't have a purse.

324
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:55,753
No wallet, no keys.

325
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,129
Would the woman's phone help?

326
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:59,089
Well, yes, of course,
but we don't have...

327
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,966
A phone! (gasps)

328
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,012
Wow!

329
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,181
Good eye, Luce!

330
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,266
...ifer.

331
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:11,352
I'll get this
back to the lab.

332
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,020
See if I can
restore it.

333
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:14,855
Yeah, fast as you can, Ella;
we have to proceed

334
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:17,441
- as if this missing woman
is still alive, okay?
- Yeah.

335
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,984
I don't want to find
another body.

336
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,570
Trust me, you will not find
another body.

337
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:23,989
I found a body.

338
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:33,916
She's a maid at the hotel.

339
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,544
Explains why she didn't find
our dead guy.

340
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,796
'Cause, you know, she was dead.

341
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,589
Anyway, okay.

342
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:43,133
No open wounds, so she's
definitely not our Cinderella

343
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:44,218
who bled all over the place.

344
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,261
You see the bruising

345
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,804
and the semi-circular
marks on her neck?

346
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:47,805
Strangled.

347
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,683
Aha. Long fingernails,
which means the killer's female.

348
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,601
Not necessarily.
I mean, the marks aren't deep.

349
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,144
It could just be a dude

350
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,729
- who's not serious man-groomer.
- Come on.

351
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,439
It's so obvious;
your Cinder-hellion

352
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,984
had just plunged a screwdriver
into the poor lad,

353
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,777
when she was interrupted
by the chambermaid,

354
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:03,445
who she then snuffed out
with her bare hands.

355
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:04,280
CHLOE:
Chambermaid?

356
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,531
Who's the killer, Mrs. Peacock

357
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,740
in the library
with the candlestick?

358
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:07,908
I love that game.

359
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:10,077
DAN: I really don't think
it's the missing woman, Lucifer.

360
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,079
It's a little unusual
for a woman to strangle someone.

361
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,707
But look at the size of the
bruising; clearly not man hands.

362
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,668
I've seen some guys with
some pretty tiny lady hands.

363
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:18,586
Dan doesn't count.

364
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,254
- Come on.
CHLOE:
- Okay, regardless,

365
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,089
the maid's death
wasn't planned.

366
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:23,924
I still think we're looking
at a third party--

367
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,468
someone attacking the couple
when the maid entered.

368
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,429
The killer then dragged the maid
into the bedroom,

369
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,431
where they struggled until <i>he</i>

370
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,266
finally managed
to strangle her.

371
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,435
Which gave our Cinderella time
to get the hell out of there.

372
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,561
I couldn't agree less.

373
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,062
And she needs to go
straight <i>to</i> Hell

374
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,647
as soon as possible.

375
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,649
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to make a call.

376
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,277
Oh, did we get anything
on that cell phone?

377
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,613
Oh, right! Uh, totally forgot.

378
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,865
No, no.

379
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,742
Could not recover anything
from the SIM card.

380
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,493
Water and phones, bad news.

381
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,621
I dropped mine in the toilet
once-- that sucked.

382
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,247
- Damn. So much for that.
- Had to reach in,
I didn't have my gloves.

383
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:56,916
Uh, no.

384
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,710
No, 'cause I did get
a serial number off of it,

385
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,962
so I know who bought it,
at least.

386
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:03,881
Richards and Wheeler.

387
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,424
High-end law firm
in Beverly Hills.

388
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:06,634
Cool.

389
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,093
Next time, if you want,
you know,

390
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:11,013
you can just lead
with that information.

391
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,723
If you want.

392
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:14,183
Okay, boss,
where do you want me?

393
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,810
I'm not your boss,
I'm just, you know, kind of...

394
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,062
My boss.

395
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:19,897
It's okay, Chloe.

396
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,857
I've accepted my demotion
like a big boy.

397
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,651
And besides, it's kind of hot
when you give me orders.

398
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:27,029
Sorry.

399
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,280
Old habits.

400
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,449
CHLOE: Why don't you start
with missing persons,

401
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,368
see if there are any new leads
on our Cinderella.

402
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:34,954
Lucifer and I will go
to the law firm.

403
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,664
- Okay.
- Okay.

404
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:38,165
Lucifer.

405
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,042
- Lucifer.
- Hmm?

406
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,878
Oh. Uh, are you praying or...?

407
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,672
Yes. Usually works.

408
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,340
He must've gone for
a wank or something.

409
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,177
(sighs) Come on,
Amenadiel, where are you?

410
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:54,098
Hello?

411
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:56,600
Is this thing on?

412
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,269
I keep waiting for God
to talk back to me, too.

413
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,981
But you know what, don't
get discouraged, okay?

414
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,440
He is listening,
it's just

415
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,943
a one-way intercom kind of deal.

416
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,069
(slaps back)

417
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:14,201
LUCIFER: <i>Come on, brother,</i>
<i>where are you?</i>

418
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,212
Linda.

419
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,925
Surprised to see
you're still coming in.

420
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:32,845
I mean, after all,
this is a...

421
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,890
a real facility for real
therapists with real patients.

422
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,559
Unfortunately, I can't
talk right now, Linda.

423
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,810
I've got some
research to do.

424
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:40,894
Oh, sure, I bet.

425
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,563
Learning more
about psychiatry?

426
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,066
Or is it time to switch it up?
Be a lawyer maybe.

427
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:47,609
Astronaut.

428
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:48,652
I understand.

429
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,946
You're upset that I told you
I was a therapist.

430
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:54,616
Maybe you are one,
'cause your intuition's uncanny.

431
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:58,579
Linda, listen. I did
what I had to do, all right?

432
00:17:58,787 --> 00:17:59,705
Now, you wouldn't
understand this,

433
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,582
but I was dealing with matters
of great importance.

434
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,833
I didn't have a choice.

435
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:04,501
Yes, you did.

436
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,379
You used me.

437
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,424
You didn't have to do that.

438
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,720
I'm used to my patients
lying to me, not my colleagues.

439
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,805
Not my friends.

440
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:21,143
I confided in you, trusted you.

441
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,771
And you betrayed that trust.

442
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,107
It is difficult
to explain,

443
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:30,444
but things have been
very trying for me.

444
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:32,488
Mm-hmm.

445
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,865
Maybe if you didn't think
so much about yourself

446
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:37,576
and more about
how you treat others,

447
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:39,578
things wouldn't be so trying.

448
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,123
It's called karma.

449
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,169
Might want to research <i>that.</i>

450
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,523
All right, the most
effective way to do this

451
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,942
is with a discreet and
systematic approach.

452
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,776
Understood.

453
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,569
We can start with the
partners and then...

454
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,738
LUCIFER:
Attention, lawyers! Hello!

455
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,324
Hello. Attention, please.

456
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:21,078
Uh, now, does anyone recognize
this critical piece of evidence

457
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,497
found at
a gruesome crime scene?

458
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,082
Yeah. See?

459
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,750
That's our
corporate-issue phone.

460
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:27,960
We all have one.

461
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,253
That could be anybody's.

462
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:30,796
Right.

463
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,005
What about this

464
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,340
Louboutin power pump

465
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,301
with the ombré finish
in a size, uh... seven?

466
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,886
- Six, U.K.
- Lucifer...

467
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,263
MAN:
Oh, my God.

468
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,056
Th-That's
Charlotte's shoe.

469
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,808
Is she okay?

470
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,852
Prince Charming, I presume.

471
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,480
Richards.
Charlotte Richards.

472
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,023
She's the owner
of this firm.

473
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,192
When she didn't come
into the office, I just...

474
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,945
assumed she was out of town
on a case.

475
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:58,282
Was this man involved in
any of those cases, by chance?

476
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,203
- Oh, my God, is he...?
- Dead as a doornail.

477
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,038
Yes. Or in this
case, a door screw,

478
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,790
'cause the hole in his
neck's from a screwdriver.

479
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,542
And I happen to think that
Charlotte may well have done...

480
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,003
Could provide us
with more...

481
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,380
information on his death.

482
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,257
Well, I-I don't recognize him.

483
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,135
Wait, does that mean
you think Charlotte is alive?

484
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,469
Define "alive."

485
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,304
CHLOE:
When was the last time

486
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:21,513
you saw her?

487
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,397
(crying)

488
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,275
I did this!

489
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,194
Oh, Charlotte, I'm so sorry!

490
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,987
All right, Bradley,
listen up,

491
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:39,072
'cause I've got personal
trust issues at stake here.

492
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,824
Brad, look at me.

493
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,038
Did you want Charlotte gone?

494
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,833
No. No.

495
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,501
That's the last thing I wanted.

496
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,921
Right. Then what do you desire?

497
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,548
T-To be with Charlotte.

498
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,050
We were in love.

499
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:00,093
CHLOE:
Mr. Wheeler,

500
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:04,556
um, would Charlotte
maybe have, um...

501
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:08,143
also... slept with the guy
in the photo?

502
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:09,019
No.

503
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:11,146
We were completely monogamous.

504
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,857
She wouldn't even sleep
with her own husband.

505
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,319
She was married already?

506
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,821
Yeah, but she hated that guy.

507
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,199

Sorry about the mess.

513
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,253
LUCIFER: I'm sorry
about those shoes.

514
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,295
Excuse me?

515
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,256
Mr. Richards,
when was the last time

516
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,465
your wife was home?

517
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,092
Oh, God, uh...

518
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,302
Three days ago, maybe.

519
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,054
You didn't file
a missing person's report?

520
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:46,723
She's always traveling.
Doesn't always tell me when.

521
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,268
Did she tell you she was
bonking her associate Bradley?

522
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:51,436
(whispers):
Lucifer.

523
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:53,021
Did she?

524
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,189
I knew.

525
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:55,524
What could I do?

526
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:56,650
Well, one option
would be

527
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,443
to stab her in the neck
with a screwdriver.

528
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,321
Do you recognize
this man?

529
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,656
Oh, God.

530
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,574
Uh... h-he came by

531
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,619
the house with a package
for Charlotte, uh, last week.

532
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:09,162
Pretty sure it was,
like, a work thing.

533
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,164
Well, it depends what kind
of package, doesn't it?

534
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,792
- Uh, i-is Charlotte all right?
- Can you account

535
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,502
- for the last three days?
- Yeah.

536
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,504
I've been up to my ears
in puke.

537
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:18,797
My kids are home sick.

538
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:22,175
Uh, I haven't left the house
since Monday.

539
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:23,844
And not showered
since, I see.

540
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,387
Are your children home?

541
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:26,596
I'd like to confirm with them.

542
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,849
Yeah, sure.
Uh, just down the hall,

543
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,475
and, uh, uh...

544
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,687
When exactly did you
surrender your manhood?

545
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:34,938
Excuse me?

546
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,274
I mean, I'm all for
stay-at-home dads,

547
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,900
and believe me,
I personally commend you

548
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,485
for not abandoning
your children,

549
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,487
but that's still no reason
to give up.

550
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,157
Oh, I-I... I haven't
given up. I'm...

551
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,035
Mr. Richards, you have
an entire slice of salami

552
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,536
stuck to your shirt.

553
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,288
Oh, God.

554
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,706
(sighs) Come on.

555
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,124
Where's your closet?
Up here?

556
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,459
Mm.

557
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,377
Oh, goody.
They come in more colors.

558
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,087
There's only
one body part

559
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:00,505
- rubber should be worn on.
- Oh!

560
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:01,882
Not that you'd know.

561
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,467
You've clearly
castrated yourself.

562
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,469
But don't worry.
I'm here to help.

563
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,179
Hawaiian print?

564
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,556
The eighth deadly sin. Out.

565
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,850
Dave Matthews
tribute tank.

566
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,685
Now I'm doubting
your sanity.

567
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:15,687
What have we got?
Ah! Here we go.

568
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,147
This is more promising.

569
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,524
Not worn since the...?

570
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,193
- Wedding.
- That's what I thought, right.

571
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,652
Let's have a look.

572
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:24,863
Come on.

573
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,531
Come on!

574
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,702
Is that, uh...

575
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,246
Cocaine!

576
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,499
(laughs):
Oh, and the good stuff, as well.

577
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,251
Ah, Detective,
welcome to the party.

578
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,050
BOY (over TV): Hey, Mom,
the gang's here for lunch!

579
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,343
WOMAN:
Ready in a minute.

580
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:49,554
You know, feeding a whole
ball team isn't too big a job

581
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,932
when you have macaroni
and cheese dinner handy.

582
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,767
Okay, boys, come and get it!

583
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:57,813
Mazikeen, what is this
strange gooey substance

584
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,981
that this boy is cooing about?

585
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,275
MAZE (in distance):
You watching porn?

586
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:03,527
(groans)

587
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:11,410
What is this?

588
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:12,702
It's like money.

589
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,664
Humans use it to buy
things they can't afford.

590
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,749
(sighs) Wish I'd found this

591
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,876
before I ate
out of those street bins.

592
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:20,836
(shudders)

593
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,629
Humans are silly animals,
aren't they?

594
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,799
Weak. Fragile.

595
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,467
That's what I'm counting on.

596
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:32,097
Now... where were we?

597
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:33,640
(sighs)

598
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:36,017
(computer trilling)

599
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:43,608
(whistles)

600
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,193
That's a lot of coke.

601
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,071
Think the attorney's
husband was dealing?

602
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,574
I don't think he's the
entrepreneurial type.

603
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:52,409
Thinking maybe
the lawyer was.

604
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,619
Doesn't make a whole lot of
sense, but it would explain

605
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,038
why she ended up bleeding
in that hotel room.

606
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,709
Well, maybe the kid was
her street dealer or something.

607
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,879
Yeah, maybe. Anyhow, Ella got
a big fat print off the plastic.

608
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,130
I'm running it
through AFIS now.

609
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,132
What's with the box?

610
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,508
Delivery for you.

611
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,843
- What?
- Yeah.

612
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,350
Dan, I thought we
talked about this.

613
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,768
A united front,
especially now.

614
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:21,021
Hey, don't look at me.

615
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,731
Oh, she's here!
Lovely.

616
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,274
Did the mini kitchen
come, too?

617
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,526
Lucifer, you shouldn't
have gotten her the doll.

618
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,111
It's fine.
You can say it's from you.

619
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,446
(computer beeping)

620
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:31,281
LUCIFER:
Oh. Hello.

621
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,616
DAN:
Luis Mendoza.

622
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,118
He's a known associate of
drug kingpin Victor Perez.

623
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:36,912
He's a scary dude.

624
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,954
CHLOE:
Smart though,

625
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,915
to partner up with a
high-powered defense attorney.

626
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:42,459
Which would explain why
he's eluded the FBI for years.

627
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,377
I have a friend
in the Bureau.

628
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,629
I'll call him, I'll see
what I can find out.

629
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:46,922
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

630
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,883
Oh, look, she comes with an
adorable little chocolate cake.

631
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,218
Your child's favorite.

632
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,011
I will deal with you later.

633
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:55,722
You're welcome.

634
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,350
(sighs)

635
00:25:58,558 --> 00:25:59,726
(clears throat)

636
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,980
Eeny meeny miney...

637
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,611
(knives scraping)

638
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,531
You are wasting
your time, Mazikeen.

639
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:14,282
You couldn't break me in Hell.

640
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,825
What makes you think
you could do it here?

641
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,662
Maybe I couldn't hurt you
because you weren't human.

642
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:20,664
Well, now you are.

643
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,999
No, it's because I wasn't
guilty of anything.

644
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,585
Hell gives the damned
what they deserve.

645
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,921
I didn't deserve to be punished.

646
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,506
And you know it.

647
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,465
No.

648
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:34,094
I think it's because I just
didn't find your weak spot.

649
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,512
Everyone has one.

650
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,932
Human bodies
have several.

651
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:40,392
Careful.

652
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,102
This body only heals once,

653
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,187
and Lucifer told you
not to harm me.

654
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,566
You may have him confused
right now, but he's smart.

655
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,486
He'll come around, see you
for who you really are.

656
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:53,738
A mother who loves her son.

657
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:57,033
Loving mothers
don't abandon their sons.

658
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:00,453
I threaten your relationship
with him, don't I?

659
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:01,871
(scoffs)

660
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:03,373
Nice try.

661
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:05,166
(laughs)

662
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,627
Even though you say
you're on your way out,

663
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:10,005
you're still here
doing his bidding.

664
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:11,339
You need him.

665
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,842
And if I stay,
then he won't need you.

666
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,136
Trust me,
you won't stay.

667
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:19,306
Lucifer made a deal with your
ex to take you back to Hell,

668
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,350
and he doesn't
break deals.

669
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,061
Don't think he'd start with God.

670
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,106
He made a deal?

671
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:30,483
Wait.

672
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,532
Is that a weak spot?

673
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:45,332
Are those... tears?

674
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,376
(grunts)

675
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:51,296
Oh!

676
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,051
You're a bad mother.

677
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,095
Really? I think you might
be projecting a little bit.

678
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:00,764
(chuckles):
Oh, really? How's that?

679
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:03,975
Well, you keep trying to pin
murders on your own mother.

680
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,519
I'm guessing you and her don't
have the best relationship.

681
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:08,271
There.

682
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,232
At least I get to keep
the cute little chocolate cake.

683
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:12,400
Oh, come on.

684
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:13,735
Talked to Agent Colburn.

685
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,612
Charlotte wasn't working
<i>for</i> the cartel.

686
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,946
She was working
to bring it down.

687
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:18,406
So was that poor kid.

688
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,576
His name's Marco Sanchez.
Got in over his head

689
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,244
with the cartel,
was trying to make it right.

690
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,872
So he was working with Charlotte
and the FBI as an informant?

691
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,957
Trying to build a case
against Perez, yeah.

692
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,877
That's why he and Charlotte were
meeting at the hotel in secret.

693
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,128
But look at this.

694
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,507
Perez's hit man is
Jimmy the Carpenter.

695
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,175
Want to take a guess
at his M.O.?

696
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:40,095
- Screwdriver?
- Boom.

697
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,015
So the woman <i>isn't</i> a
ball of homicidal fury.

698
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:45,850
CHLOE:
No. Perez is.

699
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,519
Or his hit man anyway.
LUCIFER: Right.

700
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,270
Well, shall we arrest
the Perez chap, then?

701
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,772
The FBI has been trying
to do that for years.

702
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,148
He's Teflon. He launders

703
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:53,858
everything through
his tanning salon franchise.

704
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,027
Yeah, we can't risk
derailing the FBI's case.

705
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,738
We have to go through the court,
and we have to get a warrant.

706
00:28:58,988 --> 00:28:59,906
I'll see if
I can rush one.

707
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,241
Perez could have
Charlotte now.

708
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:02,701
Ah, I doubt it.

709
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,994
Well, if not,
he's after her.

710
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:06,830
I don't doubt that.

711
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,915
Yeah, why don't you stay here
and get the warrant.

712
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,208
I think I've left
the cooker on.

713
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:11,501
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

714
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,422
Ah, lovely. You
got one on the go.

715
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,882
Right. New
information, Maze.

716
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,969
Seems Mum might not be a lying
sack of savagery after all,

717
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,470
but it also seems
that she's the target

718
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,556
of a vicious
cartel hit man.

719
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,599
So you mustn't let her
leave the penthouse

720
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,643
until this whole mess
is resolved. Right-o?

721
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:31,688
Your mom's gone.

722
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:33,565
What?

723
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,734
Well, how did that happen, Maze?

724
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,152
She tricked me,

725
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,446
then head-butted me, then left.

726
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,656
(sighs)

727
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,116
Sorry.

728
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:45,368
Oh, well.

729
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:47,328
Suppose the worst
that could happen

730
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,581
is that she's brutally murdered.

731
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,875
If so, she'll just find
a new body

732
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,419
and run right back
like a good mum, yeah?

733
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:55,628
Or not.

734
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:57,380
I may have let

735
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:00,049
the whole deal
with God thing slip.

736
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,343
So I think she
might be running away.

737
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:05,138
So if she goes into a new
body, we'll never find her.

738
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:10,685
Okay. Then we'll just have
to find her before that happens.

739
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,104
I mean, how far can
a celestial being

740
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,648
trapped in a feeble human body
for the first time get?

741
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,066
Well, let's see.

742
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,569
She's stupid hot,
wearing my clothes,

743
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:21,613
and she's got
a corporate credit card.

744
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:25,784
Bollocks.

745
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:33,583
Hello, chaps. Just looking for
the head of a big drug cartel.

746
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,627
Is he home? Vicky?

747
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,504
Victor?

748
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,340
- Oh!
- Oh. Sorry, love. Vicky!

749
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:41,716
- (man shouts)
- Ah.

750
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,343
(laughs)

751
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,386
Ah. Hello.

752
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:47,847
Mr. Perez,
I need you to know

753
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,057
that I'm not here
to talk to you

754
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:50,475
about your criminal
drug enterprise.

755
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,101
I'm here about
Charlotte Richards.

756
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,314
Are you, by chance,
holding Charlotte prisoner?

757
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:59,484
- Who?
- Right. I'll take that as a no.

758
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:01,152
Here's my point.
(groaning)

759
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:02,570
You may think that she's dead,
but she's not,

760
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:04,030
which is fine,
because you also think

761
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,782
that she's still Charlotte,
which she's also not.

762
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,534
- Is that clear?
- Ow!

763
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,118
I simply need you
to promise

764
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,538
to stay away from
Charlotte Richards. Deal?

765
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:20,213
Oh. Oh, look at that.

766
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,633
Snowstorm in a tanning salon.
How ironic.

767
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:27,971
Oh. Detective.

768
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:30,723
I think Vicky here is ready for
a little bit of show-and-tell.

769
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:31,808
Emphasis on the show.

770
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,434
(shouts)

771
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,436
♪♪

772
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:37,647
VICTOR (chuckles):
<i>Wait a second.</i>

773
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:39,858
You think I had him killed
'cause he's a narc?

774
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,359
Why would I do that?

775
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,735
I was using him.

776
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,446
Fed him bogus information
on purpose.

777
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,241
Had the FBI chasing
after their own knobs.

778
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:49,784
Kid was an asset.

779
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:51,828
Be stupid to hurt him.

780
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,455
Well, you forgot to tell
your buddy Jimmy the plan.

781
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,499
Screwdriver
to the neck.

782
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:59,419
The Carpenter? He's dead.

783
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:03,673
Oh. Did I throw a wrench
in your works?

784
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:06,467
Get it? Screwdriver? Wrench?

785
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,886
It's a whole theme.

786
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:09,679
(laughing)

787
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,142
Ah. How's my little
drug kingpin panini?

788
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:15,810
Not our guy.

789
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,104
We have to find someone
connected to Marco and Charlotte

790
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:19,898
that didn't know
Jimmy the Carpenter's dead.

791
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:22,191
Well, Jimmy's dead?
Tragic.

792
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,820
So assuming the whole cartel
knows that, it rules them out

793
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,364
and points us
to the only way

794
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:30,408
that Charlotte and Marco
are connected:

795
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,368
the law firm.

796
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,621
Two shakedowns in one day.
I'm in.

797
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:38,166
No more shakedowns, no more
tanning booth shenanigans.

798
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,876
You and I have been working
together long enough

799
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:41,711
for you to know
how to follow protocol.

800
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,713
I'm sorry, Detective,
but Charlotte's in danger.

801
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:44,964
We need to find her.

802
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,343
How did she go from big bad
wolf to little lost lamb?

803
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:49,928
Well, maybe she's a wolf
in sheep's clothing,

804
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:52,096
but right now she needs
to return to the flock.

805
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,395
Yeah, I worked
on that case.

806
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,356
I work on every case
that comes through here.

807
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:03,775
Okay, but the Perez case
was sensitive.

808
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:04,943
You were the only one here

809
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,444
besides Charlotte
who knew about it.

810
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:08,279
Which means you're also

811
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,822
the only one here who was aware

812
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,574
of Jimmy the Carpenter's
methodology.

813
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:14,494
Wait. You don't think that I...

814
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:15,954
Got handy with
a screwdriver

815
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:17,997
and tried to pin it
on the Perez cartel?

816
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:21,209
- Yes.
- (chuckles) That's insane.

817
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,043
CHLOE:
What's insane is

818
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,670
a guy with
a Harvard law degree

819
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:25,129
still working as an associate.

820
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:28,424
LUCIFER:
Yes. Passed up for partner
by old Tom Cruise out there.

821
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,219
Guess you should've been
slipping the boss your top gun.

822
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,554
If you're suggesting
that I killed

823
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:38,017
an innocent kid and my boss--
my mentor of 12 years--

824
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:42,021
all out of professional
jealousy, you're crazy.

825
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:43,606
Hold on.

826
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,858
I don't believe that
we mentioned two murders.

827
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,986
I mean, we showed you the
crime scene photo of Marco,

828
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,779
but not Charlotte.
- Lucifer...

829
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:53,533
Well, given the information
that you presented--

830
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:57,078
the phone, the shoe--
I just assumed that she was...

831
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,871
Dead? No.

832
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:01,791
Just missing. And if we find
her alive, it's gonna be

833
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,293
very interesting to hear
what she has to say about you,

834
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:06,045
her loyal protégé.

835
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,132
This line of questioning
is now over.

836
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,633
Why don't you go
speak to my attorney.

837
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:12,719
He's two doors down.

838
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,973
Why would you divulge
privileged information to a guy

839
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,017
who's now clearly
our lead suspect?

840
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,728
Sorry. I'll get that
protocol thing down one day.

the credit card we opened

859
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,198
Oh, I know who you are now.
You're the one who killed me.

860
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:17,158
Well, apparently not.
But I am now.

861
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:18,910
Sorry.

864
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:23,706
Detective.

865
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:25,500
If you're gonna
follow me following him,

866
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,293
we should have just
drove together.

867

00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:34,801
I'll stay here

869
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,636
Protect <i>me?</i> From what?

870
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,013
Ow!

871
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,515
What'd you do that for?

872
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,433
Well, the detective
knows you're alive now,

873
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:44,268
so you're gonna have to sell
the whole Charlotte charade.

874
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:46,229
Need to explain
that blood pool somehow.

875
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,314
- Oh, you little...
- Devil?

876
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,608
Yes. But about that--

877
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,860
we've never met until now,
don't know each other.

878
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,905
I fear it's too much for
the detective to handle.

879
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,243
Well, it looks like she can
handle quite a bit.

880
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:02,954
Yeah.

00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:06,958
(handcuffs clicking)

883
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,001
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

884
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,673
(sighs)

885
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:16,634
Well, it seems that wound was
re-aggravated in all the hubbub.

886
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:18,094
Poor woman.

887
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,346
You want to tell me
what the hell you were doing?

888
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,974
Well, leading the mouse
to the cheese, of course.

889
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:24,267
I mean, I was
gonna be the cat,

890
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:27,854
but then you showed up, so I
suppose that makes you the dog.

891
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,730
What am I gonna do with you?

892
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:31,232
Well, I can
think of a few things.

893
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,733
Might need
a stretch first though.

894
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,402
You need to follow the rules.

895
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,946
You tell me not to ravage
suspects in front of you.

896
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,531
Now I can't do it
behind your back either?

897
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,116
I mean, make your mind up,
Detective.

898
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:43,327
No more buying
my daughter $200 dolls.

899
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:44,912
Well, why not?
You weren't going to.

900
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:47,415
I was teaching her a lesson.

901
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,834
Neglect 101.
You're abandoning her

902
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,711
in her time of
need, Detective.

903
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:00,595
I don't know what happened
between you and your mother.

904
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,389
And if you ever want to talk
about it, I'm here for you.

905
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:04,724
But listen to me.

906
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:06,517
Doing what's best
for your child--

907
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:09,103
it doesn't always
make 'em happy.

908
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:20,489
(door opens)

909
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:24,493
I hate to interrupt
so late, but, uh...

910
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:26,746
I just wanted to apologize.

911
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:27,997
Oh?

912
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:29,999
Yeah, you were
right, Linda.

913
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,502
You see, I really do
have a lot to atone for.

914
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:36,756
I've... made so many
mistakes lately.

915
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:39,842
But a big one was hurting you.

916
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,844
I may have forged
a friendship with you

917
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:44,263
under false pretenses, yes.

918
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,141
But I did consider you a friend.

919
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,811
And I'm deeply sorry
that I ruined that.

920
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:57,485
If anyone understands mistakes,
it's a therapist.

921
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,570
Not that you'd know.

922
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:02,531
(chuckles)

923
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:03,783
(sighs)

924
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,451
Apology accepted.

925
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:08,371
Thank you.

926
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:09,956
Night.

927
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:11,374
Good night.

(clears throat)

943
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:29,118
What on earth is that?

944
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:30,870
Cheesy noodles.

945
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:34,165
It's what mothers make
to bring their children joy.

946
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,210
I saw it on the flat-screen.

947
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:39,754
(chuckles softly)

948
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:42,548
That explains all the cheese.

949
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,888
Lucifer...

950
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:52,600
I wish, with all my being,

951
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:55,269
that things could go back
to the way things were.

952
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:57,938
With you...

953
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:01,734
and all my children
again in Heaven.

954
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:08,032
I want what your father
took from me.

955
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:11,369
I want my home back.

956
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,167
But I know that's not possible.

957
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:22,254
So I want to do what I can

958
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:27,426
to be a good mother
to you here, on Earth.

959
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:38,187
It's too late.

960
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,316
You abandoned me, Mum.

961
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:46,987
You just stood by and watched
as I was cast out.

962
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:50,950
Thrown into Hell
and vilified for all eternity.

963
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,830
There aren't enough
cheesy noodles in the universe

964
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,623
to fix all that, I'm afraid.

965
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,879
Okay.

966
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,340
(thunder rumbling softly)

967
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:18,727
Your father never
sent you to Hell.

968
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:22,648
I did.

969
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:25,985
Oh, great. Much better.

970
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:30,239
I did it to save your life.

971
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:34,785
After the rebellion,
your father was angry.

972
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,204
Deeply angry.

973
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:43,127
He wanted to
destroy you.

974
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,880
I begged him not to.

975
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:51,051
<i>I</i> asked him to send
you to Hell instead.

976
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,055
I did it because
I love you, son.

977
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:59,059
And I always will.

978
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,229
However...

979
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,691
if you still need me

980
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:08,444
to return to Hell,
I understand.

981
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:12,364
You do what is
right for you.

982
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:13,782
(chuckles)

983
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:16,702
That's very gracious
of you, Mother.

984
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:18,078
(chuckles)

985
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:20,080
Okay, but please don't
send me back to Hell.

986
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:22,124
(both chuckle)

987
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,046
But I meant the rest.

988
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:30,674
I know you did.

989
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:34,637
All right.

990
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:36,222
All right,
you can stay.

991
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:38,307
For now.

992
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:39,892
Just until I...

993
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:42,353
figure out what I need to do.

994
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:44,522
Thank you, son.

995
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:46,899
Yeah.

996
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:57,660
