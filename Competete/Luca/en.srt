Well, let's go fix up our Vespa.

1929
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:32,726
Yeah, about that. Uh...

1930
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:35,312
It's a crazy thing. I might have sold it.

1931

DANIELA: Luca?

1932
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:42,653
Mom? What are you all doing here?

1933
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:48,200
If you promise to write to us
every single day

1934
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:51,495
and be as safe as possible,
and I mean safer than safe,

1935
01:21:52,246 --> 01:21:55,123
(SIGHS) you can go to school.

1936
01:21:55,582 --> 01:21:56,834
(GASPS) I can?

1937
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:58,502
It's all arranged, actually.

1938
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:00,587
You'd stay with Giulia and her mom.

1939
01:22:00,671 --> 01:22:02,548
Your friend talked them into it.

1940
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:03,924
It wasn't easy.

1941
01:22:06,218 --> 01:22:07,761
Luca, do you promise?

1942
01:22:07,845 --> 01:22:09,555
Yes! Yes, I promise!

1943
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:11,515
Thank you.

1944
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:16,687
Oh. Just remember,
we are always here for you.

1945

Okay?

1946
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:20,732
Hey. Look me in the eye.

1947

1950

Come on, Alberto. The train's gonna leave.

1951
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:36,832
Where's your stuff?

1952
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:39,710
Yeah, well, you see...

1953
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:41,295
You are coming, right?

1954
01:22:41,712 --> 01:22:46,008
Um, I would, but Massimo asked
if I wanted to stick around.

1955
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:48,927
Move in maybe. And I just thought, uh...

1956
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:52,806
I think he needs me.
(CHUCKLES) You know?

1957
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:56,852
I can't do it without you.

1958
01:22:56,935 --> 01:22:58,437
ALBERTO: But you're never without me.

1959
01:23:01,064 --> 01:23:02,983
The next time that you jump off a cliff

1960
01:23:03,066 --> 01:23:05,736
or tell Bruno to quit bothering you,

1961
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:07,362
that's me.

1962
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:11,366
But how am I gonna know you're okay?

1963
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:21,126
You got me off the island, Luca.

1969
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:39,520
No idea. Go find out for me, will ya?

Some people think
I'm mad to live in the deep.

1979
01:33:50,714 --> 01:33:53,425
I think that they are the ones
who are mad,

1980
01:33:53,509 --> 01:33:56,136
not me the one who is mad, it's them.

1981

It's a nice life, simple life.
