neither shall any plague

[people] Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.

12
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:27,242
[Ed] For he shall give
his angels charge over thee,

[people] Be with me Lord,

15
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:35,908
Let's take a little break,
shall we?

16
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:42,950
Hon, are you feeling
all right?

17
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:45,033
Yeah, I'm fine.

18
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,325
[sighs]

19
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,783
I just can't remember
one quite like this.

20
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:03,200
He should try and get
some sleep.

21
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:04,658
Yeah. Here you go.

22
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:06,242
- Oh, I'll take him, Mr. Glatzel.
- Huh?

23
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,700
Yeah.

24
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:09,033
Thank you.

25
00:02:09,117 --> 00:02:12,158
- Thank you, Arne.
- No problem. Come on, buddy.

26
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:17,825
He can't take much more
of this.

27
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:19,575
He won't have to.

28
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:22,492
Things will move quickly now that
the exorcism's been approved.

29
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,533
Father Gordon's already
on his way.

30
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:36,367
You're one brave kid,
you know?

31
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,700
I was a little runt growing up,

32
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,992
so I know what it's like
to be picked on.

33
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:42,617
But...

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,700
But that was nothing compared
to what you're going through.

35
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:48,408
I don't feel very brave.

36
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:54,283
Being brave doesn't mean
you're not scared.

37
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:57,117
It means you are scared
but you hang in there.

38
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:01,117
It's gonna be all right.

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,492
I won't let anything
happen to you.

40
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:07,242
I promise.

41
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:11,242
Arne. When are you gonna
ask my sister to marry you?

42
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,367
[chuckles]

43
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:15,117
I don't know what
you're talking about.

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,992
- Come on.
- No, I don't, I...

00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:58,325

[tap knobs squeaking]

53
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:08,450
No! Help me!

54
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,700
No, no, no! No, no, no!

[screaming]

56
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:17,450
- David!
- [Judy] David! Where is he?

[glass breaking]

58
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:19,575
David!

00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,742
[Carl] What's happening, buddy?
Are you okay?

62
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,575
David, what's going on?

63
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,950
David?

66
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,492
[Carl] No!

67
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:49,658
Father, we need to do this,
right now!

68
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:52,700
Okay, let's get him down to the car
and we'll drive him to the church.

69
00:05:52,783 --> 00:05:54,950
No, Father. Right now.

70
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,742
[David screaming]

71
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:05,408
[grunts] No! No! No!

[yells]

73
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,658
Grab his arms, don't let go.

74
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:23,992
[screaming]

75
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:29,283
Save your servant
who trusts in you, my God.

76
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,658
Let him find in you, Lord,

77
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:35,158
a fortified tower in the face
of the enemy.

78
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:36,908
Put on the full armor of God,

79
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:39,408
that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil.

80
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:41,742
Against the powers
of the darkness of this world.

81
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:43,700
Against wickedness.
[gasps]

- [groans]
- Lorraine, what's wrong?

83
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm fine.

84
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:54,950
Lorraine.

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,325
Lord! Send him aid
from your Holy place

86
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:01,742
and watch over him from Sion.

87
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,367
- [sizzling]

88
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,408

[Lorraine] Father!

97
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:38,408
- Where's your first aid kit?
- It's in the kitchen!

98
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,408
I'm on it!

99
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,825
Ed, hurry up!

100
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,492
Hurry, Ed!

101
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:50,950
Ed. Ed, Hurry!

What? David, wait!

108
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:12,825
Stop it! What? What?

00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:20,200
David! David! Help me, please!

111
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,825
What are you doing? David!

112
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:24,242
Help him, please!

113
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:27,450

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,325
- Leave him alone!
- Arne, don't talk to it.

116
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:35,950
I said, leave him alone.
He's just a little boy, you coward!

117
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,700
No, Arne, don't talk to it!

[Debbie screams]

119
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,575

[groans]

123
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,742
Hey!

124
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,200
Listen to me. Look at me.

125
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:09,617
[screams]

126
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,950
Look at me. I know
you're still in there, David.

127
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:14,242
Just leave him alone, okay?

128
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:16,408
Leave him alone and take me.

129
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,117
Take me.

130
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,700
- [gasping]
- Hey, take me. Take me!

131
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:22,617
David!

132
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,033
Leave him alone and take me!

135
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,575
No.

136
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:41,283
No, no.

137
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:48,408
David. David, David!

138
00:09:48,492 --> 00:09:51,492
David, are you okay? Hey, hey.

139
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:53,825
David, go with Mom.

140
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:55,033
Oh, oh!

141
00:09:58,408 --> 00:09:59,492
Yes, David.

Ed? Ed! Hon!

144
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:06,325
What?

145
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:07,742
[groaning]

146
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:17,867
- Somebody call 911!
- Okay.

147
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,117
Mrs. Warren.

148
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:20,242
He's stabilized.

149
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:21,867
We're gonna transfer him
to the coronary unit.

150
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,950
- So, it was a heart attack?
- Yes.

151
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,908
And not a minor one,
I'm afraid.

152
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:30,075
- Can we see him now?
- Not yet.

153
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:32,075
We're gonna to put a stent
into his artery,

154
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,742
try to get blood flowing
back to his heart.

155
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,742
[exhales]

156
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,075
So, is he gonna be all right?

157
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,825
We're gonna need to run a few more tests
before I'm comfortable answering that.

158
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,408
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:03,158
- [Arne] <i>Leave him alone!</i>
- [Ed] <i>Arne, don't talk to it.</i>

00:12:03,242 --> 00:12:05,408
<i>Leave him alone and take me.</i>

161
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,033

165
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:16,367
Hey, the mummy lives.

166
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,908
Hey, why did you let me
sleep so late?

167
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:20,117
I didn't let you,
I couldn't wake you.

168
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,700
- You couldn't wake me?
- No, I couldn't.

169
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,867
Oh, that's strange.

170
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,783
You mustn't have been
trying very hard.

171
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,033
[Debbie] No.

172
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,367
[dogs barking]

173
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,492
- [man] Buddy! Easy, easy, easy!
- Okay, Bruno is right outside.

174
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:36,992
Oh, come on. Bruno's a worldly
man, he doesn't care.

175
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:38,575
[laughs] No.

176
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,867
No, no, wait. Actually,
I do want to ask you something.

177
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,242
Okay. What do you want
to ask me?

178
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:44,325
Um...

179
00:12:45,492 --> 00:12:48,033
- It's no big deal.
- Mmm-hmm.

180
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:50,492
- I've... I've been thinking...
- Mmm-hmm.

181
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:53,325
And now David's
out of the woods,

182
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:57,075
maybe we should
put all this behind us

183
00:12:57,158 --> 00:13:00,325
and get out of this place.

184
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:03,242
- You know?
- You mean, leave Brookfield?

185
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,617
Sure, why not? We've got nothing
keeping us here now. Do we?

186
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,367
Oh, yeah.
Nothing but my family

187
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,700
and all the money
we don't have. Arne...

188
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:11,325
Okay, well,
money's no big deal, right?

189
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:12,617
We're both working,

190
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,575
and this place doesn't
cost us anything.

191
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:17,492
Arne, I just started this job.
I can't just up and walk out now.

192
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:19,533
- [Bruno] Jesus Christ!
- And besides,

193
00:13:19,617 --> 00:13:21,825
Bruno doesn't know the first thing
about taking care of these dogs.

194
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,200
Hey...

195
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:30,283
Let me think about it. Okay?

196
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:33,117
- You'll think about it?
- Yeah, I'll think about it.

197
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:37,283
Okay. There we go.

198
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:40,283
Okay, get dressed.

199
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:41,908
I love you.

200
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,950
- [rock music playing]
- I think David will love that.

201
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,700
- Did you call my mom?
- [Arne] Yeah, I did.

202
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,700
- I told her we were going to be very late.
- Okay, thank you.

203
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:54,742
No, Arne. Please stop eating,
please stop.

204
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:57,492
Mrs. Haskett, so good to see
you, thanks for coming by.

205
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,367
- Hey, we're headed out now.
- Bye, Pookie.

206
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,617
I wrote down a list of stuff
for you to do while we're gone.

207
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,200
Oh, keeping track of this stuff is
what I'm supposed to be paying you for.

208
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:06,450
Not on weekends, you're not.

209
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:08,158
I'm letting you live here
rent free.

210
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:11,033
That should buy me the weekends
maybe the holidays, too.

211
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,283
Okay, Andy gets one cup,
everyone else gets two.

212
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:15,908
Magic and Sparky are getting picked up,
so you don't need to worry about them.

213
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:18,742
But, you'll have to take everyone else
outside at some point this afternoon.

214
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:22,325
Oh, Ruby's allergic to bees, if she gets
stung you've got to call the emergency vet.

215
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,158
I wrote the number down
and stuck it on the fridge.

216
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:25,450
[song faltering]

217
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:28,158
Yo, Arne, you wanna make
a quick five bucks, man?

218
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,908
My stereo's busted.

219
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:34,492
Yeah, sure. I'll take a look at it later.
But, make it 15.

220
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:35,658
Ten.

221
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:39,617
- ...what happened this morning.
- I know.

222
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,658
Ma, okay.
Please don't say anything.

223
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:43,408
I won't say anything,
I promise.

224
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:44,658
Okay, just...

225
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:47,325
He asked if we could
leave Brookfield.

226
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:50,158
- [gasps] You know what that means, don't you?
- No.

227
00:14:50,242 --> 00:14:53,283
- Actually, you mean he proposed?
- Not exactly.

228
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:55,075
- Did you say, yes?
- Not exactly.

229
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:57,783
Arne! Can you bring out
the tray with the meat on it?

230
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,117
Oh, yes. I'm starving!
Are you starving, bud?

231
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,075
Yeah.

232
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:02,700
Okay, I'll go get the meat.

233
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:04,075
- Ow!
- [chuckles]

234
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:21,533

<i>Doctor Merrick, to OR-6.</i>

241
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,825
<i>Doctor Merrick, to OR-6.</i>

242

[knocks on wood]

243
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:27,283
It was nice seeing Judy again.

244
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:31,742
Will she be staying long?

245
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:35,658
I don't know, um,
it depends if...

246
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:42,867
The nurse says that you have
been sleeping in that chair.

247
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,867
Ed would understand if you went
home for a little while.

248
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,950
Did I ever tell you the story
of how we met?

249
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,700
No, I don't think so.

250
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,783
Just that you were young.
In high school, wasn't it?

251
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:00,575
Yeah. We were 17.

252
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:06,283
<i>I went out with
my girlfriends and...</i>

253
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:09,408
<i>And he was an usher at the
movie theater that we went to.</i>

254
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,283
Afterwards...

255
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:17,450
<i>we went out for ice cream.</i>

256
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:21,367
<i>He took me out to the park,
but then it started to rain.</i>

257
00:18:22,992 --> 00:18:28,200
<i>And we stood under the gazebo
until it stopped.</i>

258
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,992
That was 30 years ago.

259
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:38,742
I could go back
to the house, Father,

260
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:43,450
but my home is here
with him.

261
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:08,075

264
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:57,450
Jesus Christ, Arne!
What the hell?

265
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:58,575
[breathing heavily]

266
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:08,242
Can we please do something
about this racket?

267
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:09,950
These dogs are driving
me crazy!

268
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,992
[Debbie] They probably just
smell a rabbit or something.

269
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:15,158
- How come you're not at work?
- I wasn't feeling so hot.

270
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:18,408
[laughs] Arne!
Perfect timing, man.

271
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:19,950
[dogs barking]

272
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,117
Hey, why don't you come inside
with me, have a beer.

273
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,950
If we get that stereo fixed we
can put up a sign, close up shop.

274
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:27,450
- You know what, I don't think so, Bruno.
- Come on.

275
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,783
- Why, you quit drinking?
- No, I just don't...

276
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:33,117
Tell you what, we can
both quit next Saturday.

277
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,450
How about that? [laughs]

278
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:54,450
[weakly] Lorraine. Lorraine.

279
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:56,617
- Lorraine.
- Daddy!

280
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,533
Oh, Ed, thank God.

281
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:01,200
Lorraine.

282
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:03,742
- You have to call the Glatzels.
- She just called, you're fine...

283
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:06,408
We have to warn them,
it's got the kid.

284
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:07,658
No, it's fine, it's over.

285
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:09,658
David is safe,
the demon is gone.

286
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:12,908
Arne. It's got Arne!

287
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,617
[rock music playing]

288
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:27,325
It's beautiful, man.
Nicely done!

289
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:31,950
Come on, man,
don't make me drink alone.

290
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,492
Your girl's gonna think
I'm a drunk.

291
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:41,158
Do you know...

292
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,700
that I saw these guys
play in Sydney?

293
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:47,450
They nearly blew the roof off
Her Majesty's Theater!

294
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:50,408
Bruno! Can you turn that down?

295
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,492
I'm testing out his work!

Hey.

301
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:27,867
What's the matter?
Are you okay? Bruno...

302
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,700
- Let's dance, brother!
- Bruno! No, stop!

303
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:32,575
Bruno. Bruno! Oh, my Lord...

304
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:34,908
Okay. Bruno, go night-night.

305
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:38,242
- No! Not until we dance.
- Yes! No, we're not dancing.

306
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:41,658
- One dance! One dance!
- I don't want to dance! Bruno!

307
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:44,408
Okay, one dance.

308
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,242

- This is Officer Thomas.
- <i>My name is Lorraine Warren.</i>

I know how this is
going to sound,

312

but there's going to be a tragedy
at the Brookfield Boarding Kennels.

You okay?

339
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:11,117
Now, you just stay right there, okay?
Don't move.

340
00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:14,617

00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:59,908
nor sworn deceitfully.

353
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,367
He shall receive the blessing
from the Lord,

354
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,450
and righteousness from the God
of his salvation.

355
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:07,367
[Ed] Right. That's enough.

356
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,658
Thank you.

357
00:26:13,158 --> 00:26:15,117
Well?

358
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,325
These religious objects
would've been enough

359
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,825
to provoke an inhuman spirit,

360
00:26:19,908 --> 00:26:21,783
if there was one present.

361
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:27,492
Does that mean
he's not possessed?

362
00:26:27,575 --> 00:26:30,450
The fact that he can read
from the Bible just seals it.

363
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:32,617
So, what does this mean,
then...

364
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,200
I'm just crazy?

365
00:26:36,617 --> 00:26:39,492
Well... you're not possessed.

366
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,867
But that doesn't mean
that you weren't.

367
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,658
I... invited this
thing into me,

368
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:50,783
and that's the reason
that he's dead.

369
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:55,533
So, you know,
whatever happens to me,

370
00:26:55,617 --> 00:26:57,158
I've got it coming.

371
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:58,575
No, you don't.

372
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:01,742
Look...

373
00:27:03,617 --> 00:27:05,075
I was there.

374
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:09,408
Whatever is going on...

375
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:12,658
whatever happened that day...

376
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,367
that was not Arne.

377
00:27:21,158 --> 00:27:25,033
We're going to help you
in every way that we can.

378
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:31,825
If the demon's gone,
what can you do now?

379
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,742
Who's your lawyer?

380
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:37,867
He was found covered
in the victim's blood.

381
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,283
The murder weapon belongs to him and
it's got his fingerprints all over it.

382
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:44,533
Nobody's disputing any of that.
Arne knows that he's going to prison.

383
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:47,867
All we're saying is that there
were mitigating circumstances.

384
00:27:48,658 --> 00:27:50,450
Mitigating circumstances?

385
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:53,492
Look, I don't think he should
get the death sentence, either.

386
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:55,658
But I am not going
before a grand jury

387
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:58,200
and saying he was possessed
by demons.

388
00:27:58,283 --> 00:27:59,575
It's never been done.

389
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:01,533
Yes it has! It's been done
twice in England.

390
00:28:01,617 --> 00:28:03,408
The Michael Taylor case
was just a few years ago.

391
00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:07,033
Let me rephrase that.
It's never been done successfully.

392
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:08,950
Then let us help you.

393
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:13,033
Ed and I have proven the existence
of the demonic hundreds of times.

394
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:16,450
You've proven it to the church.
This is a court of law.

395
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:18,242
The standards of evidence
are completely different.

396
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:20,075
The courts accepts
the existence of God

397
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:23,075
every time a witness swears
to tell the truth.

398
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:26,825
I think it's about time they
accept the existence of the devil.

399
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:32,533
How are you going
to convince a jury

400
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:35,242
if you can't even convince me?

401
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:41,117
I'll tell you what.
You come over to our house for dinner.

402
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,617
We'll show you the evidence
we've collected over the years.

403
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,325
Introduce you to Annabelle.

404
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:49,450
If you're not convinced,
we'll butt out.

405
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:51,575
Deal?

406
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:57,450
All right.
Show me what you got.

407
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:59,242
[gavel banging]

408
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:03,908
Mr. Johnson, to count one of
indictment number S-A-J-1-2-1-6,

409
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,033
which charges you with
first-degree murder,

410
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:07,700
a class-A felony,

411
00:29:07,783 --> 00:29:09,408
how do you plead?

412
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:12,075
Your Honor,
my client pleads not guilty

413
00:29:12,158 --> 00:29:14,700
by reason of
demonic possession.

414
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:31,158
[bell tolling]

415
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:38,617
This is ridiculous.
I can walk down a flight of stairs.

416
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,992
Oh, hush. You shouldn't
even be out of bed.

417
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:43,700
Lorraine.

418
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,492
I just talked to a friend of
mine in the prosecutor's office.

419
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:49,950
He's gonna go for
the death penalty.

420
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:53,992
I'll build the case,
but that kid is gonna either live or die

421
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:56,325
depending on what you two find.

422
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,075
Well, we won't let him down.

423
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:00,533
[lawyer] I hope not.

424
00:30:00,617 --> 00:30:01,992
Keep me posted.

425
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:08,617
So, what now?

426
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,867
We've never had to prove
a possession after the fact.

427
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,575
Demons don't just
disappear like this.

428
00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:16,033
There's something else
going on here,

429
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:18,200
something that we missed
the first time.

430
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:21,825
Where do we start?

431
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:25,242
At the beginning.

432
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:31,325
[Ed on tape]
<i>It's July 18th, 1981.</i>

433
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:34,200
<i>This is Ed Warren,
here with Lorraine...</i>

434
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:36,908
<i>and Judy Glatzel,
Deborah Glatzel,</i>

435
00:30:36,992 --> 00:30:40,033
<i>David Glatzel
and Arne Johnson.</i>

436
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:42,158
<i>All right, let's get started.</i>

437
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:45,158
<i>Who was there when David first
started exhibiting this behavior?</i>

438
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:49,867
[Judy] <i>We all were.
It was the day we moved in.</i>

439
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,658
There you go.
Go have fun with them.

440
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,617
- Wanna order some pizza?
- [Debbie] Yeah sure, I'll do that right now.

441
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,367
- Hey.
- [Arne] Put that box down a second.

442
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,908
- [Debbie] Why?
- I just...

443
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:00,075
What are you doing?

444
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,492
- Have a look...
- What is... Arne!

445
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:07,617
You know you're supposed to
do this when you get married?

446
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
Okay, so maybe
we'll do that too.

447
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:10,825
[Debbie] Oh.

448
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:13,283
[Debbie shrieks]

449
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:44,200
[hinges creaking]

450
00:33:21,742 --> 00:33:23,033
[screaming]

451
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:31,867
No!

452
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:33,450
Mom!

453
00:33:39,742 --> 00:33:41,450
[breath trembling]

454
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,700
[David] <i>I didn't know
what happened.</i>

455
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,408
<i>It was like a dream.</i>

456
00:33:57,492 --> 00:34:01,075
<i>And nobody believed me
when I told them.</i>

457
00:34:01,158 --> 00:34:04,033
<i>But that was the first time
I saw it.</i>

458
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:20,325
I don't get it.

459
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:22,867
How could he have invited a demon?
He was only in here for a few minutes.

460
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:25,908
There wasn't even anything
in here.

461
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:29,158
Where was the water bed?

462
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,408
Where that rug is.

463
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:34,950
The wood got damaged
when the mattress ruptured.

464
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,200
- Mind if I have a look?
- Please.

465
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:52,617
[gasps softly]

466
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:57,117
That's not water damage.

467
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:15,575
Hon, will you let me
handle this?

468
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:18,200
You're going to ruin your dress
if you go in there.

469
00:35:20,242 --> 00:35:24,617
So, um, the guest room's about
15 feet in and to the right.

470
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,158
Okay.

471
00:35:26,242 --> 00:35:29,450
- Just be careful.
- Just hold my purse.

472
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:00,617
[rustling]

473
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:11,075
- [rat screeches]
- [screams]

474
00:36:11,158 --> 00:36:13,242
Lorraine! Are you all right?

475
00:36:13,325 --> 00:36:15,950
Yeah, I'm fine, Ed.
It's just a rat.

476
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:17,325
[sighs]

477
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:53,075
[rats squeaking]

478
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,908
[praying in Latin]

479
00:38:12,617 --> 00:38:14,158
[Lorraine]
It's a witch's totem,

480
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:16,825
used by Satanists
in their rituals.

481
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:20,283
Remember how I told you that an
inhuman spirit needs to be invited?

482
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:23,117
And you couldn't imagine
how David could do that?

483
00:38:24,242 --> 00:38:26,867
Well, you were right,
he didn't.

484
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:32,867
We think David was cursed.

485
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:36,242
And on the night
of the exorcism,

486
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:39,700
the curse was passed
from David into Arne.

487
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:41,367
Cursed?

488
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:46,075
Are you saying someone
did this to us... on purpose?

489
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:49,075
We've heard of
satanic rituals like this.

490
00:38:49,158 --> 00:38:50,783
The demon is summoned,

491
00:38:50,867 --> 00:38:53,325
the possessed individual takes
a life and the demon departs.

492
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:56,533
Which is why Arne was able to
read from the Bible afterwards.

493
00:38:56,617 --> 00:39:02,408
Yeah. We think whoever cursed
David, used this to draw the demon.

494
00:39:02,492 --> 00:39:04,200
And we'd like you to start
mailing these out

495
00:39:04,283 --> 00:39:06,367
to every police department
you can find.

496
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,033
Start locally.

497
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:11,742
And, just find out if they've
ever seen anything like this.

498
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:16,117
There might be someone else
we can ask about this.

499
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:18,492
Do you remember the priest

500
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:21,075
who helped expose the
Disciples of the Ram cult?

501
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,242
It would've been about
10 or 12 years ago...

502
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:24,992
- Father Kastner?
- Yeah, you're right.

503
00:39:25,075 --> 00:39:28,575
Only it isn't "Father" anymore,
he's been retired for a while.

504
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,908
He tried to help those people.

505
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:34,283
He tried to understand
why they did what they did.

506
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:40,033
If anyone is going to be able to
tell us what this is, it's him.

507
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,242
[Ed] Father Kastner.

508
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,117
I didn't hear the car drive in.

509
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,117
Would either of you care
for an omelet?

510
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,950
We had breakfast before
we left home.

511
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:25,617
I'm Ed Warren,
this is my wife Lorraine.

512
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:31,992
I have chicken shit
on my hands.

513
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,242
[both chuckle]

514
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
[Lorraine] Thank you.

515
00:40:48,492 --> 00:40:50,450
Forget you ever saw this.

516
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,825
You've seen it before?

517
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:56,158
No. But I've seen ones like it.

518
00:40:56,242 --> 00:41:01,325
This is sophisticated.
It's a very nasty piece of work.

519
00:41:01,408 --> 00:41:04,492
What I don't understand is...
is why?

520
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:08,617
David, the little boy who was
possessed, he didn't do anything wrong.

521
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,908
Why would someone
target this family?

522
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:12,158

696
00:56:12,825 --> 00:56:13,867
[sobbing]

697
00:56:29,075 --> 00:56:30,492
All right, that's enough.

698
00:56:31,867 --> 00:56:35,742
Hon, that's enough.
That's enough! Come on!

699
00:56:39,617 --> 00:56:42,450
[breathing heavily]

700
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:47,033
Katie? Katie? Oh, my God.
What did I do?

701
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:48,117
Hon, no!

702
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:51,783
Lorraine!

703
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,700
[sobbing]

704
00:57:05,742 --> 00:57:07,033
[panting]

705
00:57:24,242 --> 00:57:25,575
[Ed] Lorraine!

706
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:31,658
Lorraine.

707
00:57:35,867 --> 00:57:36,908
Ed.

708
00:57:37,825 --> 00:57:39,450
[screaming]

709
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:40,575
No!

710
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,242
[grunting]

711
00:57:55,117 --> 00:57:56,242
[both sigh]

712
00:57:56,325 --> 00:58:00,367
It's okay. I got you.
I got you.

713
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,367
[Lorraine panting]

714
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:13,658
She's down there.
Ed, she's down there.

715
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:24,742
[siren wailing]

716
00:58:26,242 --> 00:58:28,117
[paramedic] <i>Blood pressure's
a little high.</i>

717
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,825
I'm gonna give you
a vasodilator.

718
00:58:29,908 --> 00:58:32,242
It's a pill, you're gonna
put it under your tongue.

719
00:58:32,325 --> 00:58:34,117
It'll open up
your blood vessels.

720
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,033
Yeah, I have those.

721
00:58:36,992 --> 00:58:38,992
I left them at home.

722
00:58:39,075 --> 00:58:42,075
[paramedic] Yeah, well,
I wouldn't do that anymore if I were you.

723
00:58:43,492 --> 00:58:45,033
Mind giving us a minute?

724
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:53,575
Recovery team found a body.

725
00:58:54,783 --> 00:58:57,408
- Is it...
- We're not sure.

726
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,367
Look, I know what
it looks like.

727
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:01,700
But, I don't want any of this getting
out until we have a positive ID

728
00:59:01,783 --> 00:59:03,408
from the coroner.

729
00:59:03,492 --> 00:59:07,492
You know, we dragged
this basin. Twice.

730
00:59:07,575 --> 00:59:09,658
Had to pull teeth to get
it done a third time.

731
00:59:09,742 --> 00:59:11,700
We never would've done it
if it weren't for you.

732
00:59:12,992 --> 00:59:14,950
I'm just glad we could help.

733
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:16,617
Let me know where
you're staying.

734
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,992
And I'll get that casefile
to you in the morning.

735
00:59:27,283 --> 00:59:28,825
[phone ringing]

736
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:35,617
Hello?

737
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,200
Oh, my God, I've been leaving
messages all day.

738
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:39,992
- What's wrong?
- <i>It's Arne. It followed him!</i>

739
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:41,908
You said this was over,

740
00:59:41,992 --> 00:59:43,658
but now he's trapped in there with
this thing and it's telling him

741
00:59:43,742 --> 00:59:45,742
- <i>to kill himself!</i>
- Debbie.

742
00:59:45,825 --> 00:59:48,700
Just calm down and listen to me. I need
you to call the prison chaplain, um...

743
00:59:48,783 --> 00:59:51,450
- Father Newman.
- Father Newman. Tell him that

744
00:59:51,533 --> 00:59:54,992
<i>Arne needs to be put on a 24-hour
suicide watch! He's got...</i>

745
00:59:55,075 --> 00:59:56,242
[static screech]

746
00:59:57,367 --> 00:59:58,992
What? Hello?

747
01:00:00,783 --> 01:00:02,533
What is this thing?

748
01:00:02,617 --> 01:00:04,325
[thunderclap]

749
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:07,575
[thunder rumbling]

750
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:10,117
[keys jangling]

751
01:00:30,575 --> 01:00:31,867
[lock clicking]

752
01:00:39,783 --> 01:00:41,075
[man] Arne.

753
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:46,450
God gives everyone the right
to defend themselves.

754
01:00:51,367 --> 01:00:52,450
[lock clicks]

755
01:01:06,158 --> 01:01:08,367
[Lorraine] This demon...

756
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:13,075
it's not here of its own
free will. It was summoned.

757
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:14,783
That doesn't make me feel
any better.

758
01:01:14,867 --> 01:01:18,533
That means, we know that this
is a curse,

759
01:01:18,617 --> 01:01:20,492
and curses can be broken.

760
01:01:22,325 --> 01:01:25,575
All right.
Then, how do we do that?

761
01:01:32,658 --> 01:01:34,242
Back at the Glatzel house,

762
01:01:34,325 --> 01:01:38,075
I touched David's hand
and I saw something.

763
01:01:39,367 --> 01:01:41,742
I didn't know what it was then.

764
01:01:41,825 --> 01:01:46,200
But I think that I was connected to
the person who is responsible for this.

765
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:50,033
Ed, that body they found...

766
01:01:50,117 --> 01:01:54,117
if it's Jessica,
if it's really her,

767
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,242
then that connection
could still be open.

768
01:02:01,783 --> 01:02:03,908
There's gotta be another way.

769
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:29,950
[gasping]

770
01:02:35,575 --> 01:02:37,950
Okay... okay.

771
01:02:40,908 --> 01:02:42,325
Okay.

772
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:01,825
<i>The Lord is my shepherd,</i>

773
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:04,825
there is nothing I shall want.

774
01:03:04,908 --> 01:03:09,075
He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures...

775
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:15,408
[knock on door]

776
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:16,867
[rattling]

777
01:03:25,575 --> 01:03:27,242
There's nobody there.

778
01:03:38,742 --> 01:03:40,533
We'll leave a note.

779
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:45,575
[door creaking]

780
01:03:53,992 --> 01:03:55,158
[door closes]

781
01:04:19,492 --> 01:04:21,158
[switch ticking]

782
01:04:21,242 --> 01:04:22,742
Oh, boy.

783
01:05:18,742 --> 01:05:20,075
Please be careful.

784
01:05:33,242 --> 01:05:34,492
[whimpers]

785
01:05:51,242 --> 01:05:52,533
[exhales]

786
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,367
Do you see anything?

787
01:05:59,242 --> 01:06:02,075
No. There's nothing.

788
01:06:04,533 --> 01:06:06,242
There's nothing here.

789
01:06:08,283 --> 01:06:10,283
I'm not sensing it.

790
01:06:21,658 --> 01:06:24,075
- Lorraine, what is it?
- The connection.

791
01:06:27,992 --> 01:06:29,367
It's here.

792
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:19,450
[train horn blowing]

793
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:26,117
[train engine chugging]

794
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:34,117
[Ed] <i>Do you see anything?</i>

795
01:07:35,158 --> 01:07:36,408
Yes.

796
01:07:37,617 --> 01:07:40,992
Yes, there are... some stairs.

797
01:07:42,075 --> 01:07:43,825
I heard a train.

798
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:46,867
<i>But now...</i>

799
01:07:49,325 --> 01:07:50,950
there's an altar.

800
01:07:52,867 --> 01:07:54,492
All those black candles.

801
01:07:56,033 --> 01:07:59,575
<i>There's 12 of them.
In a circle.</i>

802
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:00,700
Oh, Ed.

803
01:08:00,783 --> 01:08:02,200
Okay, that's enough,
come back.

804
01:08:02,283 --> 01:08:03,575
I can't.

805
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:05,617
Lorraine.

806
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,408
[switch ticking]

807
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:11,950
It's a woman.

808
01:08:13,117 --> 01:08:14,367
[Ed] <i>Can you see her?</i>

809
01:08:16,117 --> 01:08:17,450
[Lorraine] <i>I am her.</i>

810
01:08:18,492 --> 01:08:20,450
Can you tell where she is?

811
01:08:21,408 --> 01:08:23,950
I don't know. I...

812
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,242
[exhales]

813
01:08:26,533 --> 01:08:28,033
<i>She's doing it again.</i>

814
01:08:28,117 --> 01:08:30,367
<i>She's reaching out to Arne.</i>

815
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:36,492
<i>She's trying to complete
the curse.</i>

816
01:08:36,575 --> 01:08:37,658
[gasps]

817
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,742
<i>Oh, she has him.
She has Arne.</i>

818
01:08:55,575 --> 01:08:57,700
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

819
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:06,450
No, no. Oh, God.

820
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:08,700
End this black sabbath.

821
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:13,117
By the blood of Calvary
I command it!

822
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:25,200
I got a cutter! C-19!

823
01:09:25,283 --> 01:09:26,575
Come on, kid.

824
01:09:26,658 --> 01:09:28,283
[wind blowing]

825
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,575
How are you doing this?

826
01:09:42,408 --> 01:09:44,450
God has shown you to me.

827
01:09:45,533 --> 01:09:48,492
Then your God has damned you.

828
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,950
Ed. The connection
works both ways.

829
01:10:01,283 --> 01:10:02,367
[ticking stops]

830
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,700
[switch ticking]

831
01:10:40,033 --> 01:10:41,075
Lorraine.

832
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,950
You need to come back.

833
01:10:47,033 --> 01:10:48,075
- Lorr...
- [bones cracking]

834
01:11:03,242 --> 01:11:05,158
Lorraine?

835
01:11:05,242 --> 01:11:07,617
You need to break
the connection.

836
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,950
Drop her hand.

837
01:11:10,908 --> 01:11:13,492
Lorraine, let go of her hand.

838
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:15,325
[gasps]

839
01:11:15,408 --> 01:11:16,492
[growls]

840
01:11:20,617 --> 01:11:21,825
[Lorraine gasps]

841
01:11:24,658 --> 01:11:26,325
[both breathing heavily]

842
01:11:35,075 --> 01:11:36,200
Ed...

843
01:11:38,283 --> 01:11:40,158
She knows who we are.

844
01:11:42,242 --> 01:11:44,033
[thunder rumbling]

845
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:49,867
[sighs in relief]

846
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:51,742
[Lorraine] We are so sorry.

847
01:11:51,825 --> 01:11:53,367
[crying]

848
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,825
Oh, we're so sorry.

849
01:11:55,908 --> 01:11:57,200
How's Arne?

850
01:11:57,283 --> 01:12:00,033
He'll be all right.
They got him sedated.

851
01:12:00,117 --> 01:12:01,992
We got the casefile.

852
01:12:02,075 --> 01:12:04,908
There's got to be something here that
connects these girls back to him.

853
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:06,283
That's great.

854
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,617
I got something
to show you, too.

855
01:12:12,492 --> 01:12:15,575
I found it in the Stregheria.
It's early Renaissance.

856
01:12:15,658 --> 01:12:19,783
The Church used it to identify
and persecute witchcraft.

857
01:12:20,825 --> 01:12:22,742
Now...

858
01:12:22,825 --> 01:12:27,450
my Latin is rusty, but...
I think this...

859
01:12:27,533 --> 01:12:30,158
is talking about
a human sacrifice.

860
01:12:31,825 --> 01:12:34,783
One by murder
and the other by suicide.

861
01:12:34,867 --> 01:12:36,825
Does it say how to stop it?

862
01:12:37,908 --> 01:12:39,700
Yeah, it looks like...

863
01:12:39,783 --> 01:12:42,450
you can break the curse by destroying
the altar it was cast from.

864
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:44,242
But...

865
01:12:44,325 --> 01:12:46,658
this part looks like Aramaic.

866
01:12:48,242 --> 01:12:51,075
This next part,
I can't read it.

867
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:54,242
But you stopped her.
Maybe she'll give up now.

868
01:12:54,325 --> 01:12:55,575
She can't.

869
01:12:55,658 --> 01:12:58,075
Once started, the curse
must be completed.

870
01:12:58,158 --> 01:12:59,825
Her soul depends on it.

871
01:13:01,658 --> 01:13:03,617
We'll find another way.

872
01:13:04,867 --> 01:13:06,242
Was there anything
in your vision

873
01:13:06,325 --> 01:13:08,200
that might help us
find her altar?

874
01:13:11,783 --> 01:13:13,492
It was cold.

875
01:13:17,867 --> 01:13:20,533
There was water dripping
from the ceiling.

876
01:13:22,575 --> 01:13:23,992
I think I heard a train.

877
01:13:26,033 --> 01:13:29,950
But it sounded strange somehow.
Like, um...

878
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:33,492
I don't know, muffled?

879
01:13:34,533 --> 01:13:35,867
Well, maybe it was underground.

880
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,825
Could be. I don't know where.

881
01:13:40,242 --> 01:13:42,533
This woman targeted
David and Jessica.

882
01:13:42,617 --> 01:13:43,783
Maybe there's
a connection there.

883
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:44,783
Let me take a look at the...

884
01:13:44,867 --> 01:13:46,283
<i>Take a look at the...</i>

885
01:13:47,908 --> 01:13:49,117
<i>file.</i>

886
01:13:50,742 --> 01:13:52,283
[thunder rumbling]

887
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,158
[groans softy]

888
01:14:22,742 --> 01:14:23,825
Lorraine?

889
01:14:48,242 --> 01:14:50,992
[leaves rustling]

890
01:15:13,492 --> 01:15:14,617
Lorraine?

891
01:15:23,908 --> 01:15:25,325
Lorraine!

892
01:15:25,408 --> 01:15:27,700
[breathing heavily]

893
01:15:42,992 --> 01:15:44,158
[indistinct clatter]

894
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,033
[breathing heavily]

895
01:15:54,367 --> 01:15:56,658
Where is she?

896
01:15:56,742 --> 01:16:00,700
You know, the two of you have
gathered quite the collection.

897
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,783
If you hurt her...

898
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,742
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Warren.

899
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,367
You're so close.

900
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:17,575
I'd hate for you
to give up now.

901
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,533
[loud thud]

902
01:16:23,575 --> 01:16:24,992
[thudding]

903
01:16:30,783 --> 01:16:32,825
[door creaking]

904
01:16:42,325 --> 01:16:44,075
[growls]

905
01:16:51,783 --> 01:16:56,367
- [roars]
- He who calls forth the water of the sea!

906
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,658
The Lord of Hosts is His name!

907
01:16:58,742 --> 01:16:59,992
Deliver Thy servant

908
01:17:00,075 --> 01:17:03,492
from all the workings
of unclean spirits!

909
01:17:03,575 --> 01:17:06,325
Fear and flee, unclean spirit!

910
01:17:06,408 --> 01:17:09,867
- Ed!
- [breathing heavily]

911
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:14,158
Ed.

912
01:17:14,867 --> 01:17:16,158
I'm sorry.

913
01:17:16,908 --> 01:17:18,825
Ed, it was her!

914
01:17:19,783 --> 01:17:21,117
It was her.

915
01:17:23,492 --> 01:17:26,283
- [Drew] Ed, what the hell is going on?
- Help me find it!

916
01:17:26,367 --> 01:17:27,617
Find what?

917
01:17:32,825 --> 01:17:33,700
[Ed] Where is it?

918
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:34,783
[Drew] Ed.

919
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:37,658
Ed!

920
01:17:37,742 --> 01:17:41,283
She was here!
She was in our house!

921
01:18:05,033 --> 01:18:06,617
When did these get here?

922
01:18:11,325 --> 01:18:12,617
They just arrived yesterday

923
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,325
while you guys
were driving home.

924
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,117
They were fresh
when they got here.

925
01:18:47,492 --> 01:18:48,492
[gasps]

926
01:18:54,283 --> 01:18:55,283
[sighs]

927
01:19:04,867 --> 01:19:06,908
[Lorraine] We have
to find this woman.

928
01:19:08,325 --> 01:19:09,575
We've identified the curse

929
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:11,117
and now we have
Jessica's casefile.

930
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,325
There has to be
something in here.

931
01:19:14,742 --> 01:19:16,992
Okay, I'm gonna take the book
to be translated.

932
01:19:17,075 --> 01:19:19,992
There has to be a clue about
where we can find the altar.

933
01:19:20,075 --> 01:19:21,367
[Debbie] So what do we do?

934
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:23,158
You should go be with Arne.

935
01:19:23,242 --> 01:19:25,867
He's gonna need you tonight
more than ever.

936
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:28,075
Ask Father Newman for help.

937
01:19:29,908 --> 01:19:33,033
Drew, you and me are gonna
tear into those files.

938
01:19:33,117 --> 01:19:35,325
We've got to find a link
between these cases.

939
01:19:35,408 --> 01:19:38,908
And a Satanist's power
is strongest at night. So...

940
01:19:38,992 --> 01:19:41,908
Let's hope she doesn't
try anything before then.

941
01:19:59,117 --> 01:20:01,492
They've stopped his sedation.

942
01:20:03,283 --> 01:20:05,033
He'll be coming around soon.

943
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:23,450
[Drew] There's nothing
in these interviews.

944
01:20:23,533 --> 01:20:27,700
Her friends barely saw her
after she got back from college.

945
01:20:27,783 --> 01:20:29,367
Didn't that
seem strange to you?

946
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,825
I mean, we're here,

947
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:32,783
the Glatzels live here,
just 15 minutes away.

948
01:20:32,867 --> 01:20:35,825
But Jessica lived
180 miles from here.

949
01:20:37,158 --> 01:20:39,867
Why is this one so far away?

950
01:20:42,783 --> 01:20:44,908
Hey, where did Jessica
find her totem?

951
01:20:46,325 --> 01:20:48,825
I just saw something
about that.

952
01:20:48,908 --> 01:20:50,825
It was in an interview
with her parents.

953
01:20:50,908 --> 01:20:52,575
It was in a box.

954
01:20:52,658 --> 01:20:55,200
"She brought it back home
in a box from college."

955
01:20:56,492 --> 01:20:58,200
Where'd she go to college?

956
01:21:01,658 --> 01:21:02,617
Fairfield.

957
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,617
This woman lives in the area.

958
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,783
Still a lot of ground to cover.

959
01:21:23,033 --> 01:21:25,575
Yeah, but not
a lot of train tracks.

960
01:21:25,658 --> 01:21:27,992
Remember Lorraine's vision?
She said she heard a train.

961
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:30,742
What time was it?

962
01:21:30,825 --> 01:21:32,783
Maybe we can start
eliminating some of these.

963
01:21:32,867 --> 01:21:34,408
[Ed] Probably
close to midnight.

964
01:21:34,492 --> 01:21:36,283
[Drew] Then it can't be
either of these two.

965
01:21:36,367 --> 01:21:38,158
The commuter lines
don't run that late.

966
01:21:38,242 --> 01:21:39,783
That just leaves
this freight line

967
01:21:39,867 --> 01:21:41,117
that crosses the river here.

968
01:21:42,867 --> 01:21:44,492
The river.

969
01:21:46,325 --> 01:21:48,033
Oh, dear God.

970
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:57,533
Mrs. Warren.

971
01:21:57,617 --> 01:21:59,117
I'm sorry, Father,
we tried calling,

972
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,033
but we couldn't reach you.

973
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:04,575
We were hoping you'd help us
translate a passage from this book.

974
01:22:07,742 --> 01:22:09,908
Of course. Come in.

975
01:22:10,533 --> 01:22:11,658
Thank you.

976
01:22:20,117 --> 01:22:23,033
Give me your keys.
You stay here, call the police.

977
01:22:23,117 --> 01:22:24,325
[Drew] What do you want me
to tell them?

978
01:22:24,408 --> 01:22:26,158
Anything,
just get 'em out there!

979
01:22:26,242 --> 01:22:27,283
[door shuts]

980
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,742
[Kastner] It's the curse.

981
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:41,075
It says, the curse needs three
victims to be complete.

982
01:22:42,325 --> 01:22:45,283
It refers to them as...

983
01:22:45,367 --> 01:22:49,158
"The child, the lover
and the man of God."

984
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:52,825
The embodiment of God's work.

985
01:22:53,658 --> 01:22:57,992
Purity, love, faith.

986
01:23:00,908 --> 01:23:02,367
Has there been another?

987
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,158
It's Ed. It's my husband.

988
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,117
Last night we found a totem
in his office.

989
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:19,908
That is unfortunate.

990
01:23:24,617 --> 01:23:27,242
Here, come with me.

991
01:23:29,242 --> 01:23:31,408
There's something
I need to show you.

992
01:23:50,367 --> 01:23:51,783
[floorboard creaking]

993
01:23:55,242 --> 01:23:56,408
Father?

994
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:00,117
I've been here many years...

995
01:25:01,908 --> 01:25:04,075
starting when I was a priest.

996
01:25:06,575 --> 01:25:10,492
The church
used this mill for storage.

997
01:25:12,408 --> 01:25:16,200
It's where they put the things
that they were afraid of.

998
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:19,533
Things they didn't understand.

999
01:25:36,117 --> 01:25:37,742
You had a child?

1000
01:25:40,617 --> 01:25:43,033
Her mother died in childbirth.

1001
01:25:44,908 --> 01:25:47,575
The Church couldn't know.

1002
01:25:47,658 --> 01:25:51,367
So I raised her here,
in secret.

1003
01:25:54,575 --> 01:25:55,992
It was just the two of us.

1004
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:01,992
Our happiness
filled this house.

1005
01:26:04,867 --> 01:26:08,450
I continued my studies
into the occult.

1006
01:26:08,533 --> 01:26:10,950
I wanted to protect her
from all this.

1007
01:26:14,742 --> 01:26:18,450
Instead I created
a fascination.

1008
01:26:22,492 --> 01:26:25,408
We must be careful

1009
01:26:25,492 --> 01:26:28,742
how our obsessions are passed
to our children.

1010
01:26:33,325 --> 01:26:36,158
"He who dwells in the shelter
of the most high

1011
01:26:36,242 --> 01:26:38,825
will rest in the shadow
of the Almighty.

1012
01:26:38,908 --> 01:26:40,783
I will say of the Lord,

1013
01:26:40,867 --> 01:26:44,492
'He is my refuge
and my fortress,

1014
01:26:44,575 --> 01:26:47,450
my God, in whom I trust.'"

1015
01:26:54,617 --> 01:26:56,867
It's just the wiring.

1016
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:59,783
You know, state building.

1017
01:27:01,992 --> 01:27:03,325
[Arne] Debbie.

1018
01:27:03,992 --> 01:27:05,033
Arne.

1019
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:11,783
What is it?

1020
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:15,450
She's... she's close.

1021
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:28,992
You knew?

1022
01:27:31,367 --> 01:27:34,950
We came to you for help
and you knew this whole time?

1023
01:27:38,408 --> 01:27:40,325
She's my daughter.

1024
01:27:42,825 --> 01:27:44,367
I couldn't...

1025
01:27:46,408 --> 01:27:48,242
I didn't want to see.

1026
01:27:51,825 --> 01:27:52,992
After all these years,

1027
01:27:53,075 --> 01:27:55,408
I thought she'd come back
to me again.

1028
01:27:57,575 --> 01:28:01,075
And now I know
the real reason she's here.

1029
01:28:03,867 --> 01:28:07,658
There are tunnels
under this land.

1030
01:28:07,742 --> 01:28:11,283
She would explore them
as a child.

1031
01:28:13,742 --> 01:28:16,658
Her altar must be down there.

1032
01:28:16,742 --> 01:28:20,617
It's the only thing
that can break her curse.

1033
01:28:22,658 --> 01:28:25,367
We need to destroy it.

1034
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:27,783
[door creaking]

1035
01:28:31,742 --> 01:28:33,283
She's here.

1036
01:28:45,242 --> 01:28:46,200
[Kastner] Go.

1037
01:29:27,408 --> 01:29:29,617
I failed as a priest.

1038
01:29:31,075 --> 01:29:33,742
And I failed as a father.

1039
01:29:33,825 --> 01:29:36,283
Please, God,
don't let me fail...

1040
01:29:50,242 --> 01:29:52,408
[breathing heavily]

1041
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,325
[grunts]

1042
01:31:14,450 --> 01:31:16,033
[breathing heavily]

1043
01:31:16,117 --> 01:31:17,783
[footsteps approaching]

1044
01:31:50,908 --> 01:31:52,700
[Ed] Lorraine!

1045
01:31:52,783 --> 01:31:53,950
Lorraine!

1046
01:31:54,033 --> 01:31:55,533
[Lorraine in the distance] Ed!

1047
01:31:56,492 --> 01:31:57,658
Lorraine!

1048
01:31:58,617 --> 01:31:59,700
Lorraine!

1049
01:31:59,783 --> 01:32:00,950
Ed?

1050
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:03,450
Ed!

1051
01:32:07,117 --> 01:32:08,367
Lorraine!

1052
01:32:10,075 --> 01:32:11,283
[grunts]

1053
01:32:14,992 --> 01:32:15,992
[grunting]

1054
01:32:20,742 --> 01:32:21,742
[Lorraine] Ed!

1055
01:32:24,325 --> 01:32:25,575
