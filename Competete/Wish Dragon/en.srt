1
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,969
What is this?

2
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,471
Don't you know who I am?

3
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,226
I demand you open this gate!

4
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,245
Now, follow me.

5
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,705
Carefully, just like this.

6
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,959
Okay, raise your paper.

7
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,465
And with scales, some grass, some clouds.

8
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,675
Huh? Oh.

9
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,351
Stupid teacher.

10
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,906
Whoa.

11
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,245
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

12
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,328
Hi, Dad.

13
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,541
There you are. Hungry? You want a snack?

14
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,458
Hey, Dad.

15
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,170
- What'd you learn?
- We learned about dragons.

16
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,551
- Your mom forgot you. She doesn't...
- Jimmy, stop. It's rude.

17
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,013
You know it's only the two of them.
She's trying her best.

18
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,109
I'm Li Na.

19
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,403
I'm Din.

20
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,780
You can walk home with me.

21
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,285
My dad's always late.

31
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,703
I'll call you later.

32
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,082
No, no, you first got to
multiply the top by the bottom.

33
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,461
- Come here, little monkey. Up!

00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,464

All right, scales. Oh! Roller skates!

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,383
Ready, set, awesome dragon kite!

40
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,553
I guess it didn't work.

Friends forever...

...year by year,

49
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:51,017
upon this we will always swear.

50
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,398
- Come on. It's time to go.
- Dad, we said...

51
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,609
Li Na, we've been over this already.

52
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,579
I have to go, Din.

53
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,666
But I fixed our kite.

54
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,337
Come along, Li Na.

55
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,672
Take care, kiddo.

56
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,717
Bye, Din.

57
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,515
Eyes ahead, Na Na.

58
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:35,686
We're off to a... a better life,
and we have to leave this one behind.

59
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:05,716
Okay, uh, next up,
235 Gao Shue Street.

60
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,594
- Delivery!
- Thank you!

61
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,679
You're welcome!

62
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,019
- Delivery! Have a nice day!
- Thank you!

63
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,234
- Delivery! Welcome!
- Thank you.

64
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,570
- Delivery!
- Thank you.

65
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,116
- Delivery!
- Thank you.

66
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,998
Oh, Wei! Wei, Wei, Wei, Wei!

67
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,667
Din? Be careful.

68
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,002
What are you doing?

69
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:45,173
- Wei! Old buddy...
- Dude, you gotta watch where you're going.

70
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:49,760
- Think you could get the assignment?
- You haven't been to class in two weeks.

71
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,014
I gotta earn extra cash
for this thing I'm working on.

72
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,476
Thing? Wait a minute,
does this have to do with that girl?

73
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,186
What? No.

74
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,269
Maybe.

75
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,565
Okay, it's her birthday.
I'm planning something special.

76
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,068
So, can you just get me
the assignment, please?

77
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,324
- I'll do your homework for a week.
- Fine.

78
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,950
Thanks. You're the best.

79
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,914
So smart and yet so stupid.

80
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,167
Last delivery.

81
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,840
Uh, hello?

82
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,138
Uh, hello?

83
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,267
Did somebody order dumpling soup?

84
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,228
Whoa.

85
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,900
- Um, hello?
- Come in.

86
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,069
It's locked.

87
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,529
I know.

88
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,244
Oh. Well, uh, I'll just...
...go around.

89
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,538
Did you order the dumpling soup?

90
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,083
I am a god.

91
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,462
Okay,

92
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,757
but did you order the...

93
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,594
And I have chosen you!
For you are pure of heart.

94
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,055
Oh. Um.

95
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,848
Well, I try to be friendly.

96
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,433
Keep my five-star rating.

97
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,353
Now, will you be paying with cash or...

98
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,356
Take this.

99
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,193
It contains everything you need.

100
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:34,115
Um, actually, I need $7.35...

101
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,034
You dare reject the will of the gods?

102
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,039
Kind of...

103
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,707
yeah?

104
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,629
You know what? This one's on me, okay?
I really gotta run, so...

105
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,882
Thanks for the teapot and have a nice day.

106
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,926
Wait. Hot sauce! Huh?

107
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,597
Whoa.

108
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,349
Thanks.

109
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,852
It's just not the same without hot sauce.

110
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,855
- Don't you have somewhere to be?
- Huh?

111
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,732
Wait, five o'clock?

112
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,484
How have I been here for an hour?
I gotta go!

113
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,237
Don't close. Please, don't close.

114
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,002
Kid, be realistic.

115
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,634
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

116
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,470
Okay, thank you for your help!

117
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,270
- Hey. I know!
- Your mom's looking for you.

118
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,231
Water, water, water.

119
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,109
- D7 to checkmate!
- Ooh!

120
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,036
See you tonight.

121
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,708
I said, "If you don't like garlic,
eat something else!"

122
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,543
"Like a napkin!"

123
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,088
Hey, Mom.
Here's the groceries you wanted.

124
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,964
Look who's here! You're late.

125
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,299
Again.

126
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,969
Oh. I, uh, stayed late
for study group, as usual.

127
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,053
Wait!

128
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,598
Eat. Food for your brain.

129
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:27,478
Thanks. I'll just take this inside
and have it with a side of calculus.

130
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,856
Ah, look at him,
all grown up and working hard.

131
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,026
Little Din with a college degree.
Can you believe it?

132
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,239
- I only wish my son had been so dedicated.
- Such a good boy.

133
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,156
Doing my best.

134
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,574
I'm gonna go get sta...

135
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,494
I'm happy for you, kiddo.
Your future is all set.

136
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,914
- A steady job, a big paycheck!
- A shiny new refrigerator.

137
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,375
- A nice car.
- And a flat screen. Big one!

138
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,460
Now, now, stop distracting him!

139
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,380
- He's got work to do.
- Din! I'll be right over.

140
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,551
Uh, yes, so much work to do.
I better get started on that...

141
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,969
Here's the assignment.

142
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:04,181
The teacher said if you don't come
to at least one class this semester,

143
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,641
he's going to fail you.

144
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,478
Oh, hey, Ms. Din.
Even if you ace the final...

145
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,397
again.

146
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,863
I knew it. You've been skipping school
and lying to your mother.

148
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,241
What have you been doing?
Lounging in some internet cafe?

149
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,452
- Can you believe it?
- Such a bad boy.

150
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,036
You're not helping!

151
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,458
Why do this? You're a good student!
You could ruin your future.

152
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,044
- True. There goes the college degree.
- You're not helping!

153
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,379
- I just...
- Just what?

154
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,715
I was just doing a little side job.

155
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,133
Side job?

156
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,303
You have one job, and one job only.
That is to study.

157
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,096
- I know, but...
- But what?

158
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,683
What could possibly
be more important than studying?

159
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,185
Nothing, Mom.

160
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,312
Nothing.

161
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,525
- This is getting juicy.
- What did he say? I can't hear.

162
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,902
You're not helping!

163
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,865
- I know I'm hard on you, but I'm...
- You're right, Mom.

164
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,824
You're right.

165
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,305
It's there?

166
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,432
This can't be right.

167
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,144
- Uh, what are we looking for again?
- A teapot!

168
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,896
Open the door.

169
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,537
Good evening, gentlemen.

170
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,539
This area's off-limits.

171
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,374
Can I help you?

172
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,043
Yes, I believe you can.

173
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,881
Stop! Stop! Stop right there.

174
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,176
- Put your hands where I can see them.
- Oh...

175
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,180
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.

176
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,891
- Uh... Okay, sir.
- You first, man.

177
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:15,229
- You're under arrest.
- Hold on a minute, there.

178
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,442
Ow.

179
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,526
Huh?

180
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,759
I'll fix that later.

181
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,853
Whoa!

182
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,620
<i>Aiya. </i>She's late again.

183
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,747
Okay.

184
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,169
Oh, uh...

185
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,797
What? Oh, that old thing.

186
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,677
Huh?

187
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,971
Well, well, well.

188
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,807
Look who decided to show up.

189
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,061
Starting to take me for granted, huh?

190
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,230
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

191
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,025
So, what do you think of the suit?

192
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:47,071
Good enough to get into the birthday party
of the famous Li Na Wang?

193
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,364
Good.

194
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,783
I think so too.

195
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,495
Okay, Din, tomorrow's the big day.

196
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,414
How are we gonna do this?
What am I gonna say?

197
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:03,045
Happy birthday, it's your best friend Din!
No, that's too strong.

198
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,799
Good evening, Li Na.

199
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,009
Will you allow me to kiss your hand?

200
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,888
Ugh. Man, quit being a creep, Din.

201
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,100
Huh?

202
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,268
Oh yeah, sure, I'll dance with you.

203
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,355
Say, you look kind of familiar.

204
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,193
I got you a present. You still like kites?

205
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,570
What am I saying?
Of course she still likes kites.

206
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,782
Okay, just... calm down.

207
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,950
Be honest.

208
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,204
Hey, Li Na. Happy birthday.

209
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,039
I just want to say,

210
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,834
it's been a long time and...

211
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,044
...I miss you.

212
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,004
What?

213
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,880
Oh no!

214
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,965
Oh, gosh. Um...

215
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,050
Hold on, I can fix this.

216
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,343
Oh, come on.

217
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:52,845
Wha...

218
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,273
What was I thinking?

219
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,152
No, no, no!

220
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,236
Ah...

221
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,083
I must look totally crazy.

222
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,334
It's just...

223
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,921
I don't know what else to do.

224
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,759
I can see my whole life
laid out ahead of me,

225
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:36,096
and I'm trying my best,
trying to make everyone proud,

226
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,060
but the whole time
it feels like something is missing.

227
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,690
I just wish...

228
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,446
I just wish I could keep our promise.

229
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,825
Tea is ready.

230
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,287
Wait, what? The tea is ready?

231
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,875
Huh?

232
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,670
Well, that was...

233
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,634
Greetings, great master!

234
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:17,638
The heavens have opened,
your wishes will be granted,

235
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:22,643
for I am LongZhu!

236
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,811
Huh?

237
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,901
Oh, a peasant boy.
Well, this'll be easy.

238
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,529
Look, I know what you're thinking.

239
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,197
"Do my eyes deceive me?"

240
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,659
"A super, all-powerful,
magical Wish Dragon!"

241
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,453
"Could this be real? Is magic real?"

242
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,412
Yes.

243
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,831
It's real.

244
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,336
Now that we got that out of the way,
onto the important part.

245
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,298
Am I... am I dead?

246
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,175
Grandma! It's Din!

247
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,345
- I fell off the roof. I'm coming for you!
- No, no.

248
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,055
No, you're very much alive.

249
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,474
I am a magical Wish Dragon,

250
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,853
who will grant three wishes
to the owner of this teapot.

251
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,355
And you, sir, are my master!

252
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,357
So, go ahead, wish away!

253
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:16,071
Okay, you got me.
Where are the hidden cameras?

254
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,990
- Great joke, guys.
- Joke?

255
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,577
- Is this a hologram or something?
- I assure you not.

256
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,829
Ah!

257
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,457
Do you wish for
a suit of armor made of solid gold?

258
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,792
It shall be so.

259
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,879
Do you wish
for the strength of 1,000 men? Boom!

260
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,047
- It shall be so.
- Whoa.

261
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,508
For the finest carriage in all the land?

262
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,926
Pow! It's yours!

263
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,761
The wings of a hawk!

264
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,183
Or the legs of a giraffe.
Feels good up here, right?

265
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,350
Or anything else

266
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,021
that your heart desires.

267
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,109
I'm thinking about starting one of those...

268
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,612
Where they sell animals. Pet-type stores.

269
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,531
You going to sell Chow Chows?
That's a good dog.

270
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,327
No one will be selling anything
if we don't find that teapot.

271
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,622
Every time I try
to make casual conversation,

272
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,415
you guys give me a hard time.

273
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,541
Wha...

274
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,463
So, you're a Wish Dragon?

275
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,546
Yes.

276
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,716
How many wishes do I get?

277
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,301
You get three wishes.

278
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:26,099
- How do you fit in this teapot?
- Uh, it's magic. It's a magic teapot.

279
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,935
So small. How old are you?

280
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,145
- That's not...
- Where'd you come from?

281
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,439
- All you need...
- Look at your arms.

282
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,360
Why are you pink? Shouldn't you be green?
Your face is so soft. I want to touch it.

283
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,737
Oh, can you breathe fire?

284
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,617
Okay. Look, peasant boy.

285
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,663
I don't have time.
I'm not here to be your friend...

286
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,082
Whoa, you have to earn my friendship,

287
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,542
and frankly you're not doing a good job.

288
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,586
Listen carefully.

289
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,005
Every Wish Dragon must serve 10 masters

290
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,050
before they're free
to enter the spirit world.

291
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,511
And you are the last one.

292
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,929
Now, I've been stuck...

293
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,557
...in this teapot for 1,000 years.

294
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,269
The sooner we get this over with,
the better.

295
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,479
Have I made myself clear?

296
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,732
Ha!

297
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,942
Wha...

298
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,782
I'm terribly sorry, young man,
but I need that teapot.

299
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,785
Uh, I... I think it's his.

300
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,329
Only the owner of the teapot can see me.

301
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,875
Well, I'm sure he won't miss it.

302
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,380
No way. I found it. Whoa!

303
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,442
Not good.

304
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,736
I wish I knew how to fight.

305
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,449
Come here.

306
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,369
That's a good teapot.

307
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,792
Huh?

308
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,876
Huh?

309
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,218
Whoa.

310
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,596
What the...

311
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,187
No, no, no, I didn't mean that.

312
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,480
I take it back.

313
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,356
Gimme that.

314
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,609
Teapot.

315
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,489
Give me that teapot right now.

316
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,660
Huh? Oh!

317
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,210
Whoa, I just kicked through a door!

318
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,757
Gimme! Gimme! Mine! Mine!

319
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,308
You little twerp!

320
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,858
Ah!

321
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,406
Uh... nobody's home?

322
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,747
I'm done asking nicely.

323
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,353
Are you telling me a teenage boy
out-fought two full-grown men?

324
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,730
- Well, sir...
- Actually, three men.

325
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,732
- Two-and-a-half.
- You should have seen him.

326
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,735
It was 1,000 punches a minute.
Kicks everywhere.

327
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,613
I've never seen so many arms and legs.

328
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,323
This is not good.

329
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,701
The boy knows what he has.

330
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,162
Sir, if I may ask,

331
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,038
what exactly does he have?

332
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,917
That's none of your business.
I'm paying you to find it.

333
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,670
- That is your only concern.
- You haven't paid.

334
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:27,632
You'll be paid when I have the teapot,
beyond your wildest dreams!

335
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,842
Do you understand?

336
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,553
Forgive our incompetence, sir.

337
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,431
But the boy did leave something behind.

338
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,434
It's only a matter of time
before we find him.

339
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,150
Din, up now!

340
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,778
- How about a kick to the face?
- Huh? I said up!

341
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,743
- Ow.
- Breakfast is on the table.

342
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:56,952
Thanks, Mom.

343
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,789
What a crazy dream.

344
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,595
Din, I'm working late tonight.

345
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,143
So, leftovers for dinner, okay?

346
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,604
Mmm!

347
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,813
Delicious.

348
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,568
So, leftovers for dinner.

349
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,194
Yeah.

350
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,322
Leftovers.

351
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,409
<i>Aiya.</i>

352
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,746
Stupid shoes.

353
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,502
Hey Mom, if you could wish for anything,
what would it be?

354
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,130
Din, why are you
asking silly questions? Eat.

355
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,049
Okay, but seriously, Mom,

356
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,426
if you could wish for anything.

357
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,472
- A big house in the countryside?
- Din, we went over this yesterday.

358
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,267
I want you to focus on your future.

359
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,768
That is what I wish for.

360
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,732
I'm more focused
than I've ever been in my entire life.

361
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,027
Hmm. Good.
Now hurry up. You're gonna be late.

362
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,949
- What's that face? I know that.
- I don't have a face. What?

363
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,577
Go to school. Stop planning things.

364
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,130
Um, hello?

365
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,381
Dragon thingy?

366
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,549
You in there?

367
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,012
Excellent work, peasant boy.

368
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,265
One wish down, two to go.
We could be done by lunch.

369
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,434
What did you do to me?
Why do I know kung fu?

370
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:46,187
You're welcome. You wish you could fight.
I made you a master.

371
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,732
I didn't wish for... Hey, that's not fair.

372
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,941
You said "wish."

373
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:54,654
Oh, so just 'cause I said "wish,"
now I'm stuck with these kung fu powers?

374
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,406
Cool.

375
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,325
Yes, it's all very cool.

376
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,410
So, onto that second wish.

377
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,829
Let me recommend the all-time favorite.

378
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,415
A giant pile of gold!

379
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,835
Now, repeat after me.
"I wish for..." You're not talking.

380
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,630
"A giant pile of..."
You're not saying anything.

381
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,214
Hey, stop rushing me.

382
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,802
Ah, you must be the conquering type.
I see that killer instinct in your eyes.

383
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,306
Easy. Just wish for
your very own personal army!

384
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,892
Why would I need an army?

385
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,353
You're quite a simple fellow.

386
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,189
Not to worry.
Here's one the peasant-folk love.

387
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,109
I can allow you to speak with a loved one

388
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,195
on the other side of China!

389
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:39,074
I'm a loved one.
I can't hear you. You're very far away.

390
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:43,161
- There's a wall here. It's cool, but...
- You mean, like, a cell phone?

391
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,788
Ah!

392
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,956
What dark magic is this?

393
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,792
Where is the tiny orchestra?

394
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,127
How do they fit in this metal box?

395
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,755
Two wishes. Anything I want.

396
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,591
The birthday party.
I know what I want.

397
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,718
Wait, a wish?

398
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,053
Yeah, yeah, a wish.

399
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,888
Excellent.

400
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,224
Ah!

401
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,606
A giant metal bird?

402
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,861
- What are you doing?
- Uh, riding my magical Wish Dragon. Away!

403
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,031
What are you doing?

404
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,951
If you're not gonna let me ride you,
we catch the bus.

405
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,286
The "bus"?
Is that some kind of animal?

406
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,582
- How long have you been in that teapot?
- Is it still the Qing Dynasty?

407
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,167
- Ooh!
- Long!

408
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,461
How did you get in there?

409
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,631
Don't ignore me when I'm talking, peasant.

410
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,050
It's not a little man. It's television.

411
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,051
What's this?

412
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,096
Car.

413
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,724
Ah, the spoils of war on display?

414
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,728
- What is this invisible force...
- Glass!

415
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,896
- What purpose...
- Stop light.

416
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,940
- What in the world?
- Ice cream.

417
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,650
- How is this...
- Electricity.

418
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,027
- I know it's all amazing...
- Amazing?

419
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,530
When you've been around
as long as I have,

420
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,491
there's nothing in this world
that could amaze...

421
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,994
"Shrimp chips."

422
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,454
Peasant food, no doubt.

423
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,460
Magnificent!

424
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,629
Okay, we're here.

425
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,717
- You gonna make a wish now?
- I will. Just wait until we get there.

426
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,218
Get where?

427
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,095
Great Wall of China!

428
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,474
A giant chariot made of steel and glass!

429
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,267
Long, this is bus. Come on.

430
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,935
- Out of the way.
- My word!

431
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:37,066
- And watch your step. Carefully.
- Thank you, kind sir.

432
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,655
- No. There must be a better...
- Long, what are you doing?

433
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:44,949
Ah!

434
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,367
That's more like it.

435
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,995
Long, what are you doing?

436
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,789
Getting a personal carriage.

437
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:55,418
I can't afford a personal carriage,
which is why we were taking the bus.

438
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,170
Did you just steal my money?

439
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,173
- ...we won't make the express.
- Here.

440
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,426
- Hey, where did you get this?
- You know, magic.

441
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,599
I, uh, had a really big lunch.

442
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,315
This is more like it!

443
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,277
Huh?

444
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,155
Uh, what is this?

445
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,448
Traffic.

446
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,532
Traffic.

447
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,327
- That some kind of national holiday?
- Ha!

448
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:35,667
You mean to tell me this happens
every single day?

449
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,383
The sun is moving faster than us.

450
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,345
This is worse than my teapot.

451
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:52,141
Ugh! I'm never going to make it in time.
I wish this traffic would just...

452
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,351
Yes, go ahead.

453
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,979
Long, I'm not gonna
waste a wish on traffic!

454
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,065
Look, Din, you're gonna have to use...

455
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,567
You're gonna have to...

456
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,193
You're going to have to...

457
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,154
You're gonna have to use...

458
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,072
Use a wish!

459
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,617
You son of a cabbage farmer!
There is no place to go!

460
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,913
Blow your trumpet all you want.
It won't make any difference at all!

461
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,749
You know, Long,
we'll get there eventually.

462
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,377
Even if it takes all day.

463
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,962
All day?

464
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,257
I heard one traffic jam
lasted three weeks.

465
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,343
If only I had
a magical dragon that could fly.

466
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,554
I know what you're trying. Not gonna work.

467
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:33,766
I spent 1,000 years in that teapot.
I can spend hours in your traffic.

468
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,271
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't we listen
to the tiny orchestra while we wait?

469
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,065
Not gonna work, Din.

470
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,236
Use your wish, Din.

471
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,756
Fine!

472
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,717
Ah!

473
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,068
Careful what you don't wish for.

474
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,696
- Push me too far, I will not hesitate to...
- Fly everywhere?

475
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,033
You're amazing! Look.
Is there anything you can't do?

476
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,119
Well, that's very... Ah!

477
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,333
Anyways, where are we going?

478
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,085
Ah, there it is! Down there.

479
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,300
We're here.

480
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,135
- Wishing time.
- Ah!

481
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,138
Excellent.
I see where this is going.

482
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,600
Now, when choosing a palace,
it is very important that...

483
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,688
Uh, what are you do...

484
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,607
Quit goofing off. This is serious.

485
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,693
Okay, what's the wish?

486
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,944
Okay, you see her?

487
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,153
Hi, good evening.

488
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,948
- Thank you for coming.
- Li Na, happy birthday.

489
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,031
How are you?

490
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,576
That's my second wish, Long.

491
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,745
- I wish...
- Stop, stop, stop!

492
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,207
- I can't do love.
- What? No, Long, it's not...

493
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,252
Couple of rules.
I can't time travel, I can't kill,

494
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:28,464
and it pains me to inform you, not really,
I can't make people fall in love with you.

495
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,259
No, no, no, it's not like that, Long.

496
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,844
She's my best friend.

497
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,137
That's my wish.

498
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,514
I want my friend back.

499
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,937
Wait, rewind. You can wish
for anything in the whole world,

500
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,731
and you waste it on a friend?

501
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,191
What could be more important?

502
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,195
- Is that a trick question?
- No.

503
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,947
Literally anything else.

504
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,285
Let me think, a golden chamber pot,
a palace made entirely of jade,

505
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,664
an army of terracotta warriors!
Why are you wasting a wish on some girl?

506
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,251
Oh! That's right.

507
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,795
Sorry, I can't expect you to understand.

508
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,715
I haven't explained everything.
Down, please.

509
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,721
Ten years ago, a cool spring day.
A gentle breeze.

510
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,099
A lonely boy waits after school. Me.

511
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:24,645
Enter the girl, Li Na, throwing dumplings
and defending my honor. Then we...

512
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,066
<i>This is really happening.
This should be so easy.</i>

513
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,820
<i>Three wishes and I'm done.
But no, I get stuck with this simpleton.</i>

514
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,406
<i>Just look at him with his mindless grin.</i>

515
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,909
<i>So naive. So ignorant.</i>

516
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,869
<i>So stupid.</i>

517
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,495
<i>Why?</i>

518
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,998
<i>What have I done to deserve this?</i>

519
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:48,086
And then she drove away
and I never saw her again.

520
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:54,050
It's okay, Long. I get emotional too
just talking about it.

521
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:01,015
I can't make people fall in love.
Why would I make someone your friend?

522
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,103
What? No, she's already my friend.
I just need to get into the party.

523
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,355
A wish! Why didn't you just say so?

524
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,398
Yeah, I wish to be a princeling.

525
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,819
All right, here we go.
Stand back and it shall be so!

526
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,740
Done and done. Now, onto that final wish.

527
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,702
What is this?

528
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,206
What? I made you a prince.

529
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,542
No, no, I said princeling.

530
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,336
Like one of those guys
with the fancy suit,

531
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,755
the Rolex watch
and the chauffeured car,

532
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,258
the personal assistant...

533
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,261
That's like ten different wishes.
You have two.

534
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,764
Fine. How about a temporary version,
just for today?

535
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:45,184
You're seriously going to wish
to be rich for 24 hours?

536
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,727
I don't care about that.

537
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,857
I just need to reconnect with Li Na.
She won't care if I'm poor.

538
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,693
I'm sorry I'm laughing,

539
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:58,281
but that is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard. Of course she'll care.

540
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,409
Yeah, well, it's my wish and not yours.

541
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,369
Shoot me with your magic juice.

542
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,831
Fine, 24 hours.

543
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,084
Perfect!

544
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,586
And the car.

545
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,839
Whoa.

546
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:15,756
Perfect.

547
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,511
And the personal assistant who has to do
everything I ask for the next 24 hours.

548
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,604
Long, you look good as a human.
Now, walking can be tricky, but...

549
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,565
Okay, party time.

550
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,283
Oh, uh.

551
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:47,288
Good afternoon.
I'd like to inquire about a customer.

552
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,790
Sorry, I can't give out...

553
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,714
Follow me.

554
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,984
Oh, yeah.
Now, these are my kind of people.

555
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,362
The servants' entrance is around back.

556
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,408
Whoa.

557
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,245
This is amazing.

558
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,372
Oh, you got in.

559
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,875
- I've never been so humiliated in...
- Coat check, thank you.

560
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,127
There she is.

561
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,880
She looks so...

562
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,798
important.

563
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,677
- Li Na.
- It's so good to see you again.

564
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,012
How does it feel to be 19, dear?

565
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,975
Oh, well, I've actually been feeling
really confused lately...

566
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:53,479
Great, dear. What would you say
about being the new face of Shin Makeup?

567
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:57,108
Actually, I no longer rep products
that use animal testing.

568
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,443
- Where's your father?
- Li Na?

569
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,445
I'll have him sign the contract.

570
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,990
- Li Na!
- It's so great to see you again!

571
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,033
I want to talk about your future.

572
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,202
I've been thinking about my future.

573
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,248
Inflatable bras, the future of fashion.
I want you to be a part.

574
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,667
- Yeah, I'm not sure...
- That's great!

575
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,877
I'll have a shoot scheduled ASAP.

576
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,089
- Happy birthday!
- It's so... Oh, it's you, Buckley.

577
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,175
We're halfway through the list.
You're doing great.

578
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,720
Yeah, great. Any word from my dad?

579
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,055
He's working hard, just like we are.

580
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,641
So, how about a little bit less of this,

581
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,059
and more of this!

582
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,395
All right, Din. Here we go.

583
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,605
Got it. Game face.

584
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,941
- Whoo. Here we go!
- Hi, Li Na! Happy...

585
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,360
Hi, it's so great to see you again.

586
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:46,198
- Oh, i feel that same way. So...
- This is just the greatest day of my life.

587
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,950
Uh, wow, you too?

588
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,537
Uh, wait, before I forget,
I brought you a little something.

589
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,291
- Hi, it's so good to see you again.
- Actually, we never met.

590
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,085
- If I may?
- Hi, it's so great to see you again.

591
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,257
So, how's your best friend?

592
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,760
I... I don't know what happened.

593
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,595
She didn't even recognize me.

594
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,473
Great. Dreams crushed.
We're done here, right?

595
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,932
I'll have two to go.

596
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,019
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
time for a treat.</i>

597
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,939
<i>If we could have the birthday girl
and her father come to the dance floor...</i>

598
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,316
<i>There she is.</i>

599
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:24,153
<i>And now her father, Mr. Wang,
come to the stage.</i>

600
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,821
<i>Calling Mr. Wang!</i>

601
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,366
- Come on, Dad. Don't be shy.
<i>- Mr. Wang?</i>

602
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,451
<i>Mr. Wang, come on down!</i>

603
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,037
I'm sure he'll be here any second.

604
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,413
<i>Mr. Wang.</i>

605
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,415
Wang? Do I have the right name?

606
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,252
<i>What kind of father doesn't show up
to his daughter's birthday?</i>

607
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,046
- <i>I know.</i>
- Come on.

608
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,424
- We gotta do something.
<i>- Mic was on. I apologize.</i>

609
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,387
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention here.</i>

610
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,931
<i>It's time for the entertainment portion.</i>

611
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,849
<i>Long, make some smoke. Lights.</i>

612
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,523
From the streets of Shaolin,
kung fu like you've never seen it before.

613
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,943
Introducing the great master!

614
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,989
Trained in the art of Dragon Style.

615
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,408
Ooh!

616
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,253
Now, everyone,
keep your eyes on the stage as I...

617
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,271
Uh, that's it.
Show's over. Thank you, folks. Bye!

618
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,939
Personal assistant.

619
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,816
Never been so insulted.

620
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,401
Lucky number eight!

621
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,488
Sir, caviar crème anglaise amuse-bouche?

622
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,575
You don't have
any, uh, shrimp chips, do you?

623
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,201
Uh, no.

624
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,954
No.

625
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,580
Oh, no.

626
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,333
What's a man like you
doing all by himself?

627
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,255
So true. Who needs wine
when you have good company?

628
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,841
I believe you've misunder...

629
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:12,136
I don't normally
move this fast, but...

630
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,055
Sorry, must run.

631
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,099
Hello...

632
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,018
Li Na?

633
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,314
Oh, handsome?

634
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,567
Playing hard to get, I see.

635
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,530
Water. Water. I just need water.

636
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,415
Refreshing.

637
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,720
Where's that kid?

638
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,276
Hello?

639
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,405
- Li Na, is that you?
- Go away. I'm busy.

640
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,450
Ah, yeah, I can see you're busy.

641
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,159
Yes, very busy.

642
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,079
Okay, I... I just...

643
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,708
I'm the one who did
that whole kung fu thing.

644
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,086
I was just trying to...

645
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,590
I know what you were trying to do.

646
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,509
Thanks.

647
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,518
Are you okay?

648
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,353
Yeah.

649
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,772
I'm fine.

650
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,068
Here, take this.

651
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,528
Thank you.

652
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:02,663
Just... just one night
out of the whole year,

653
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,708
I thought maybe he could make time.

654
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,211
I don't know why I'm letting it get to me.

655
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:10,879
I'm sorry.

656
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,883
This is so embarrassing.
I don't normally cry like this.

657
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,474
Here, you got a little something
on your face.

658
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,564
Yeah, it's not really coming off.

659
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,402
I'm sorry.
I must look totally crazy.

660
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,279
No, no.

661
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,199
I just... don't know what else to do.

662
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:44,288
It's like, I can see my whole life
laid out ahead of me,

663
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,542
and I'm trying my best,
trying to make everyone proud,

664
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:52,421
but... no matter how hard I try,
I just feel like...

665
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,590
Like...

666
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,425
Something is missing.

667
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,802
Exactly.

668
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,852
There you are, snake eyes.

669
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,981
I'm sorry, do I...

670
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,608
Oh! Ah!

671
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,485
Oh, jeez, are you okay?

672
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,111
I'm fine.

673
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,155
Here.

674
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:21,783
Thanks.

675
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:27,790
I'm sorry for being so rude.
I don't think I got your name earlier.

676
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,709
Have we met before?

677
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,171
Um, well, actually...

678
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,382
I'm...

679
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,176
There you are. Miss Wang, thank goodness.

680
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,346
Just in time.
Your father will be here any second.

681
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,556
- He made it?
- Uh, yes.

682
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,145
<i>Li Na! There you are.</i>

683
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:54,274
- Oh. Hi, Dad.
<i>- Buckley informs me the party was perfect.</i>

684
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,985
Oh! Uh, yes, it was.

685
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,279
- Thank you, Dad.
<i>- You had a good time?</i>

686
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,366
Yes, of course.
I spoke to everyone you wanted me to

687
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:07,162
and I think I was able to make
some really important... connections.

688
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,666
<i>Hello? Hello? Ah, there we go.</i>

689
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,210
<i>Here, I brought you something special.</i>

690
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,629
Oh! Uh...

691
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,881
- Here you are.
<i>- Go ahead. Open it!</i>

692
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,552
<i>I had to send my assistant
to half the jewelers in Shanghai.</i>

693
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,635
It's true.

694
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:26,390
<i>- I know you appreciate something special.</i>
- Oh, of course.

695
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,892
Just as much as last year.

696
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,976
Thank you, Dad.

697
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:33,814
<i>Oh, uh, did I?
Na Na, I'm sorry. You know, I...</i>

698
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,526
Well, you can never have too much
of a good thing, right?

699
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,654
<i>Excuse me,
I... I didn't see you there, young man.</i>

700
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,198
Allow me to get you a closer look, sir.

701
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,283
Here you are.

702
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,913
<i>Good quality leather,
excellent suit, Rolex.</i>

703
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,541
<i>And what's the family business?</i>

704
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,668
<i>Uh, dumplings!</i>

705
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:58,422
<i>I mean, Dumpling House.
I mean, restaurants in general.</i>

706
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,339
<i>All of them.</i>

707
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,885
<i>Ah, a young man of means, I see.
Reminds me of myself.</i>

708
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,595
<i>You two should have lunch.</i>

709
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,054
- Dad!
- Uh, yes.

710
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:09,099
- Of course. I'd love that.
<i>- Excellent.</i>

711
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,186
<i>Let's have arrangements made.
Forgive my manners.</i>

712
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,687
<i>I didn't get your name.</i>

713
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,938
Oh, I'm...

714
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,568
- Dan.
<i>- Pleasure to meet you, Dan.</i>

715
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,445
<i>Where would you like to go?</i>

716
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,615
<i>The Pearl Tower's excellent.
I have a reservation...</i>

717
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:29,995
- Excuse me, sir. A very important call.
<i>- Just give me a few minutes.</i>

718
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,956
Sir, they said they need to talk now.

719
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,125
<i>Put them on.</i>

720
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,420
<i>Good evening, sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

721
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,466
So, um, would you really like to...

722
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,760
Yes. Yeah.

723
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,054
See you tomorrow, Dan.

724
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,309
We talked and it was just like old times.

725
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:55,354
We made arrangements
to have lunch. Can you believe it?

726
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,773
I can't believe
you didn't explain what a toilet is.

727
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,358
Everything is going to plan!

728
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,485
Oh, really, <i>Dan.</i>

729
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,863
Uh, I'll come clean when the time's right.

730
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,783
You're not gonna,
because there is no right time.

731
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,494
You're the peasant, she's the princess.

732
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,539
Tale as old as time.
And we all know how that ends.

733
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,501
- Good?
- No, not good. Terribly. Horribly!

734
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:22,047
Long, we have a special bond
that runs deeper than money or status.

735
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,173
Why'd you lie?

736
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,092
Well, I... uh...

737
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,176
I'll tell you.

738
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,681
Because the minute Li Na finds out
who you are, this will all fall apart.

739
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,517
You should learn
to have faith in humanity.

740
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,646
I've been around for 1,000 years.
I know how humans work. Not you.

741
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,899
- Poor Long. I see your problem.
- You're my problem.

742
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,902
I wouldn't expect your tiny,
reptilian brain to understand

743
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,696
the power of human friendship.

744
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:49,283
It's okay. I'll be your first
and only friend. Come here.

745
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,202
I had a million friends
when I was human. Oh, no.

746
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,079
Long,

747
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,708
- were you a...
- Yes, yes, I was human.

748
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,961
For heaven's sake,
have you even looked at the teapot?

749
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,672
And I was the best human ever!

750
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:08,093
One of the most beloved, respected lords
in history! You know why?

751
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,054
- You had a lot of friends?
- No!

752
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:15,267
I had all the wealth and land and power,
and everyone loved me for it.

753
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,979
Wait, if you're so great,
why haven't I heard of you?

754
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:24,026
We... Well, obviously some jealous rival
took credit for everything after I died.

755
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,654
You died.
The heavens made you a Wish Dragon?

756
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,323
Yes, as a reward.

757
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,534
- You don't seem happy.
- I'm very happy.

758
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,037
So, if you would just use your last wish,

759
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,457
and wish for the same thing
as every other master,

760
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,666
then I can be done

761
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,002
and leave this wretched world.

762
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,212
And finally return back to heaven,

763
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:48,634
where everyone is waiting to welcome
the great emperor home with a parade.

764
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,304
They have parades in heaven?

765
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:57,643
My point is there's a simple solution
to every problem in the world.

766
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,436
Including yours. Use it.

767
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:04,900
So, that's what you've learned
after all these years?

768
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,484
Yes.

769
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,786
Crap, ten o'clock?
My mom's getting off work.

770
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,330
Long, we gotta go! Hurry! Let's go!

771
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:23,752
Sir, surely you can
extend the loan one more week.

772
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,088
I promise, I can pay you back, sir.

773
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,174
Foreclosure?
Please, sir. I'm begging you.

774
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,551
This company is my life's work.

775
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,512
I have a family and a respons...

776
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,808
- Is everything all right, sir?
- It's fine.

777
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,350
Just...

778
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:42,229
just don't tell Li Na about any of this.

779
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,672
Well, have you found it?

780
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,091
We've located the boy's apartment, sir.

781
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,092
<i>Yes, and?</i>

782
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,971
There's no way he can come or go
without being caught.

783
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,054
<i>Good.</i>

784
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,979
Okay, in the teapot. Everything's normal.

785
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,857
- Lights on.
- Think you can bring Li Na to this dump?

786
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,442
Quiet, you! Homework out.

787
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,402
Her fridge is bigger than this apartment.

788
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:34,239
If you're not gonna say
something helpful, don't say anything.

789
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,574
She's here!

790
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,869
Uh, your suit.

791
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,495
Huh? Oh, no!

792
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,374
Din, I brought you some...

793
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,378
Hello, Mother.
Sure is hot out tonight, isn't it?

794
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,090
No, it's freezing.
You coming down with something?

795
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,843
Oh, no. Just... studying.

796
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,887
Okay. Here.

797
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,724
- I'll heat you up some leftovers.
- Li Na will love leftovers.

798
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,392
- Hey, stop it!
- Stop what?

799
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:06,313
Uh, stop worrying about me. I'm fine.

800
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,898
You don't seem fine.

801
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,401
- How was school?
- Great. School was great.

802
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,361
You lie to everyone, not just yourself.

803
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,863
- Leave me alone.
- Fine.

804
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,699
No, Mom. I was just...

805
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:22,954
- You know where to find me.
- ...talking to somebody else.

806
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:26,166
Din, I'm going to ask you a question.

807
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,293
Remember, I'm your mother.

808
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,087
You can tell me the truth.

809
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,630
Uh-huh.

810
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,465
Are you...

811
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,926
drinking alcohol?

812
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:39,513
- No. Gimme that! I'm not drinking.
- Where are you hiding it?

813
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:43,100
Don't lie to me!
Staying out late! Skipping school!

814
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,519
- You're acting crazy all the time.
- Mom!

815
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,772
I am your mother!
I know when something is wrong.

816
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,649
- What is it?
- Nothing is wrong!

817
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,860
Just tell me the truth.
Whatever it is, I can help.

818
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,904
Mom, you can't.

819
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,822
Believe me.

820
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,532
You can't.

821
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,493
Go to your room.

822
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,787
Don't come out
if you're going to disrespect me.

823
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,996
- I wasn't...
- Go!

824
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,080
Fine!

825
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,961
I hate this place.

826
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,010
- They're really going at it.
- Bring that chair.

827
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,220
Popcorn, anyone?

828
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,638
I can hear you.

829
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,434
Din.

830
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,562
Here.

831
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,651
You...

832
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,446
you need a real dinner.

833
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,698
Thanks.

834
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,659
Sorry, Mom.

835
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:12,522
Hey, little buddy. You're so cute.
You have family? Are you hungry?

836
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:16,234
You're such a cute, fluffy,
little, hairy-faced...

837
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,154
- It's him! Wake up!
- Huh? Huh?

838
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,364
- Hey, boss! Boss!
- Hey, boss!

839
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,533
- Boss!
- The boy!

840
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,548
Impossible.

841
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,264
Okay, Din. You can do this.

842
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,974
Just tell her the truth.

843
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,185
Good evening, sir.

844
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,106
- Oh, hey, Dan!
- Hey!

845
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:59,236
- Sir, may I take your jacket?
- My jacket? I just got this.

846
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,363
Good one, Dan.

847
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,990
Yeah, good one.

848
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,701
Sure. I have plenty more of these at home.

849
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,913
- Thank you. Here you are.
- Here.

850
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,334
Sorry about all the fuss.

851
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,503
My dad insists on "only the best."

852
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:21,591
Actually, Li Na,
there's something I need to tell you.

853
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,468
I know what you're gonna say.

854
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,636
- You do?
- Yes.

855
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,973
It's so nice to meet someone
from a respectable family

856
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,433
that you enjoy talking to, right?

857
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,978
- Oh.
- Madame, your table is ready.

858
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,522
Right. Respectable.

859
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,234
Long, I'm supposed to be
from a respectable family.

860
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:42,737
No. What? I'm shocked. I'm stunned.

861
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,865
- It's exactly what I predicted.
- I need your help.

862
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,618
You were from royalty. Tell me what to do.

863
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,829
Fine. Do exactly what I say.

864
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,957
- Okay. Deal.
- Sir, could I offer you a hot tow...

865
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,960
You shouldn't let
commoners talk to you.

866
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,503
- Really?
- Sir, I just...

867
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,965
wanted to offer you a hot towel.

868
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,633
Sir, you just...

869
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,220
Madame, your table.

870
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,140
Demand another table,
claiming it's far superior.

871
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:15,770
Li Na, this table simply won't do.
Allow me to show you another one.

872
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,982
This is the table
for the hors d'oeuvres.

873
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,946
Well, you tell Mr. and Mrs. Hors D'oeuvres
that this is our table.

874
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,824
Dan, you're such a funny guy.

875
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,242
Funny?

876
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,955
Uh, are you sure you didn't mean
suave, classy, respectable.

877
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,669
You're too good. I'm gonna cry.

878
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,089
I would have her executed
for mocking royalty.

879
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,468
I appreciate you trying
to make this place interesting,

880
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,345
but how about somewhere else?

881
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,222
Somewhere else? Like more fancy than this?

882
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,474
Not good enough?

883
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:55,810
- Well played, child.
- No, like, a walk or something.

884
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,604
May I take your order?

885
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:01,191
- Spare no expense. Money's no object.
- One of everything.

886
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,402
Sir, there are over 600 items on our menu.

887
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,780
- Better make that three.
- Good!

888
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:07,989
As you wish, sir.

889
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,825
So, listen, Dan, about last night,

890
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,620
sorry for acting so weird.

891
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,998
To be honest, it's nice
to have someone who listened.

892
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,833
Ignore her and she's yours.

893
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,879
Look. Rich people
never pay attention to anyone else.

894
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:26,257
All they talk about is their own business,
how much money they make.

895
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:30,595
- It's almost an art form.
- Are you listening to anything I said?

896
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,348
Not a word.

897
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:38,645
Um, okay, well, I was saying
it was really nice to talk to you...

898
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,898
We're close, Din.
Tell her how many palaces you own.

899
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:45,819
Let me stop you. Did I tell you
just how respectable my family is?

900
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,529
- Your first entree.
- Thanks.

901
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,488
Uh-uh-uh.

902
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,781
For nothing.

903
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,450
Dan! You know what?

904
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:56,162
- You're just not who I thought you were.
- Wait, Li Na.

905
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,998
I don't understand.
That worked on all 17 of my wives.

906
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,917
- I can explain.
- What now?

907
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,168
I, uh...

908
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,252
We should...

909
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,922
We should go for that walk.

910
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,383
Maybe a run!

911
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,970
Bon appetit!

912
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,304
Surprise!

913
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:18,642
Hop on.

914
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,021
Fine.

915
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,984
Who were those men?

916
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,736
Gangsters.
Probably out to kidnap us for a ransom.

917
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,371
Come on. This way.

918
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,123
Oh, no.

919
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,792
You've always wanted
to be in a street fight.

920
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:43,877
- Help.
- No!

921
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,004
- Stay calm.
- Come on, please.

922
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,380
Dan?

923
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,508
Look what I found!

924
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,599
Look at me.
How did I become a piñata?

925
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,476
- I think we lost them.
- Good.

926
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,562
So, when exactly
were you going to apologize, Dan?

927
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,645
I...

928
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,691
Huh?

929
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,112
The other way! Other way!

930
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:19,120
Li Na, I really do want to say I'm sorry.

931
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,622
Sorry for what exactly?

932
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,708
Sorry for acting like such a jerk.

933
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,084
Apology accepted.

934
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,379
Now, get him, Dan.
Kick him right in his stupid face!

935
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,464
Kick him!

936
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,386
Hand over the teapot, kid.

937
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:45,104
I didn't sign up for this.
If you made your last wish, we... Oh, no.

938
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,569
This literally could not get any wo...

939
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,992
- Good one.
- Ah. Thanks.

940
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,536
Eat metal, dirt bag!

941
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,621
How do you like them apples, huh?

942
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:03,956
Crap!

943
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,382
Incoming!

944
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,359
Trust me.

945
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,655
- Li Na, I think we're gonna have to...
- Jump!

946
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,454
Don't worry. We got this.

947
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,427
Oh, no!

948
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,263
Oh, my God!

949
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,107
You know what, Dan?
This is turning into a pretty good date.

950
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,152
Oh, no!

951
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,501
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

952
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,927
I'm fine. Thank you for asking.

953
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,098
Oh, boy.

954
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,059
What happened?

955
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,477
Time's up, Dan.

956
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,563
What happened?
Well, we jumped off a building.

957
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,898
We almost died.

958
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,776
- Your 24 hours are over.
- We beat up some gangsters.

959
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,903
- No.
- Okay, that was mostly you.

960
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,364
You gotta teach me some of that kung fu.

961
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,367
Whoops.

962
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,701
Reflexes.

963
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,830
Wait, what happened to your suit?

964
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,751
Look, Li Na.

965
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:17,215
There's... something I need to tell you.

966
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,550
You have one more wish.
You don't have to do this.

967
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,389
My real name isn't Dan.

968
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,472
It's...

969
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:26,890
Din.

970
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,435
You're Din.

971
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,648
I'm sorry.

972
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,359
But... why did you lie?

973
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,569
I wasn't planning to. I just...

974
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:44,200
I was worried that if you found out
it was, well, just me,

975
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,411
everything would end.

976
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,332
So, you still live around here?

977
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:52,875
Yeah.

978
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,753
In that same old <i>shikumen?</i>

979
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,629
Yeah.

980
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:00,174
I told you this wouldn't end well.

981
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,342
Wait.

982
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,178
I remember this alley.

983
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,975
We used to take a shortcut through here
on the way home from school.

984
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,601
Uh, yeah.

985
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,563
And Mrs. Chu would sell
those roasted yams.

986
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,858
Hey, look at that! It's Mrs. Chu!

987
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:19,152
Hi, Mrs. Chu. It's Li Na Wang.

988
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,654
- Do you remember...
- One buck, two yams. No bargaining!

989
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,323
- Some things never change.
- Here.

990
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,950
Sold! Next.

991
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,618
- Ow, ow.
- Move!

992
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,579
So good!

993
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,415
Hold on, is that...

994
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,667
Huh?

995
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,589
No way!

996
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,341
Yeah, new decade, same sweatpants!

997
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,640
Hey, Din, what do you think
about a little race?

998
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,350
- Three, two, one, go!
- What?

999
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,602
Hey!

1000
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:53,895
Ah!

1001
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,397
Okay.

1002
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:58,816
Not fair.

1003
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:12,121
So, your old apartment
has to be right around the corner.

1004
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:16,250
Oh, I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

1005
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:19,670
- Hey Weijing, you have any green onions?
- Hi, Mrs. Song.

1006
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,089
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

1007
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:25,009
Hey, Mom. So, uh, surprise!

1008
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:28,262
We have an unexpected visitor.

1009
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,477
A girl? That's why you're acting crazy?

1010
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:39,398
All this time worried you were drugged out
in some internet cafe. It was a girl.

1011
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,025
- It's Li Na!
- Just a...

1012
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:44,070
Hi.

1013
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,823
Li Na? What are you doing here?

1014
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,326
Just visiting an old friend.

1015
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,203
Oh.

1016
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:56,082
Well, where are my manners? Come in.

1017
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,042
You and I are not finished.

1018
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,379
- She's so pretty now.
- Like a princess.

1019
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,422
Well, her nose is a little flat.

1020
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,174
Start with this.

1021
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:09,220
- You really shouldn't go to...
- You're skinnier than a broom handle.

1022
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,347
- I wasn't expecting...
- Li Na!

1023
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:15,017
Did you know Din puts flowers
on Clucky's grave every year?

1024
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,727
Mr. Huang, cut it out.

1025
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,271
I did not know that.

1026
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,606
He's so cute. He even cries a little.

1027
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,234
I am not crying. I am mourning.

1028
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,362
- He even brings flowers.
- A tiny bouquet!

1029
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:10,656
Come in.

1030
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,831
<i>What? You're saying that's not my son?</i>

1031
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,750
<i>You knew. Don't lie to me.</i>

1032
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,377
<i>You were lying to me
this whole time.</i>

1033
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,672
<i>You just wanted
to inherit my dad's business.</i>

1034
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,425
- <i>Right. I will.
- I know what you did!</i>

1035
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:32,678
<i>You think you can fool me?
I saw you with that guy.</i>

1036
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,430
<i>You have no idea.</i>

1037
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,557
<i>I should've
listened to my mother.</i>

1038
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,392
<i>- I am your mother.
- No!</i>

1039
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,228
Here.

1040
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:46,442
Oh, wow. Oh!
It's like a time machine up here.

1041
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:50,488
Yeah, sorry. This is the only place
I can get peace and quiet.

1042
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,490
You'll never have peace.

1043
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:55,534
Because the ghost
of Clucky will always haunt you!

1044
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,703
No, Clucky! You're dead.

1045
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,456
Are you gonna cry?
Are we gonna see tears now?

1046
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,249
I regret nothing. You were delicious.

1047
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,127
You're gonna know
what regret tastes like.

1048
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,421
Get away from me, you ghost chicken.

1049
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,633
- Why did you eat me?
- It was Li Na. She made me do it.

1050
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:12,718
Selling me out.

1051
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,971
- That's cold.
- It was your idea.

1052
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:19,266
Yeah. I guess we had
a lot of crazy ideas back then.

1053
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,393
Yeah.

1054
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,188
Huh? Oh!

1055
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,271
Here.

1056
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,198
Hey, do you remember that promise we made?

1057
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:36,200
- The pinky...
- Of course!

1058
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:37,535
How'd it go? Um...

1059
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:40,496
Friends forever, day by...

1060
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,581
Year by year,

1061
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,875
upon this we will always...

1062
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,210
swear.

1063
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,095
- Oh!
- Whoa!

1064
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,555
- God!
- Are you okay?

1065
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,223
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1066
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:03,602
Sorry, I wasn't expecting
my own giant face.

1067
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,812
So embarrassing.

1068
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:09,442
Don't be embarrassed.
When I first saw that, I almost fell over.

1069
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:13,946
But it's been nice.
Kind of like you were back.

1070
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,825
But, you know, giant and glowing,
and super glamorous.

1071
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,537
Doesn't hold a candle
to the real thing, though.

1072
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,752
What do you say we go for a real date?

1073
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:30,421
No Dan or any of that.

1074
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,130
I...

1075
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:36,509
Sorry.

1076
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:41,348
<i>Where have you been?
The shoot starts in an hour!</i>

1077
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:44,185
<i>What happened to your hair?
I'm sending a car!</i>

1078
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,188
Um...

1079
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,107
Din...

1080
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:54,070
I had a really wonderful time tonight,

1081
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,447
but I have to go.

1082
01:07:56,947 --> 01:08:00,951
- Thanks for letting me borrow this.
- Keep it till next time.

1083
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,036
No, really, I...

1084
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,622
Not like I'm not gonna see you
for another...

1085
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:08,291
...ten years.

1086
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:11,128
Din,

1087
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:16,008
the truth is,
I have this whole other life now.

1088
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,344
You know? A career.

1089
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:22,264
A future that my dad
worked really hard for.

1090
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:27,061
Certain expectations I have to meet.

1091
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,145
Let me guess.

1092
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:32,983
I don't meet those expectations.

1093
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:33,943
I...

1094
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:35,528
You don't understand.

1095
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,738
I... I'm just trying to be...

1096
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:40,825
realistic.

1097
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:43,327
I'm sorry.

1098
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,392
Hey, Din.

1099
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,522
Did you know that shrimp chips

1100
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:14,650
don't actually have any shrimp
in the ingredients?

1101
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:16,609
Okay.

1102
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,243
Din...

1103
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:30,708
...things are simpler when you're children.

1104
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:33,419
But you're older now.

1105
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,380
And, well,

1106
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:38,215
you have to be realistic.

1107
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:43,761
Din.

1108
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,393
Good news, Long.

1109
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,854
You can finally be rid of me.

1110
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,481
I'm ready for my third wish.

1111
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:55,565
You are?

1112
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:57,193
Make me rich.

1113
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,402
Piles of gold.

1114
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,820
However you do it.

1115
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,239
- But...
- I thought it wouldn't matter.

1116
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,241
That she wouldn't care.

1117
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,036
That was stupid.

1118
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,624
Give me the gold,
and I can have some of that good life.

1119
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,876
People will treat me with respect.

1120
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:18,005
Heck, I'm sure everyone will want
to be my friend then.

1121
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,632
Din...

1122
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,341
Are you sure?

1123
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:25,721
Am <i>I </i>sure? You've been telling me
to make this wish since we met.

1124
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:28,390
Well, you were right. Okay? I was wrong.

1125
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,226
There you go, that's my wish.

1126
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:33,520
Just grant it, and you can
go back to your spirit world

1127
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:35,606
and your stupid parade in the sky.

1128
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,778
Just grant the wish, Long.

1129
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,581
What?

1130
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,419
Din, I'll grant your wish.

1131
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,341
But first,
there's something I need to show you.

1132
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,307
You found the boy. Where is he?

1133
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,143
<i>- At the Pearl Tower, sir.
- Yeah, with a girl.</i>

1134
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:16,021
<i>- But I'm afraid he escaped again.</i>
- What? How?

1135
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,023
Hey, that doesn't belong to you.

1136
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:24,488
Listen to me. I am out of time. I need...

1137
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:33,205
- Li Na! Aren't you supposed to be at...
- I'm sorry, Dad. We really need to talk.

1138
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,123
Of course.

1139
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:36,792
- I'm just on a very important call.
- Dad.

1140
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:38,669
Please.

1141
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:39,752
<i>Sir.</i>

1142
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:44,842
Do you remember when we lived
in that old <i>shikumen?</i>

1143
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:48,304
- I know we didn't have much but...
- Don't worry, Li Na.

1144
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:50,472
We'll never go back to that life.

1145
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,726
But, Dad, don't you ever miss those days?

1146
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:56,103
Wha... Where is all this coming from?

1147
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,647
That... that young man last night,

1148
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,816
the one you arranged a date with,

1149
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:02,568
that was Din.

1150
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,195
From our old neighborhood?

1151
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:06,780
Yes.

1152
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:10,117
And he's the one who took you
to the Pearl Tower.

1153
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,286
Yes, and I know what you'll say.

1154
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:16,081
You'll tell me to stay away
and to leave that old world behind,

1155
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,918
but the truth is,
I think we might be happier if...

1156
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:24,340
Li Na, everything's going to be all right.
I'm gonna go talk with Din.

1157
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,592
- What?
- Bring the van in two minutes.

1158
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,093
Dad, are you okay?

1159
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,512
- What's going on?
- Don't worry.

1160
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:32,890
I'm going to fix everything.

1161
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,239
Dad.

1162
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,159
Long?

1163
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:54,953
Where are you going?

1164
01:12:58,624 --> 01:12:59,917
What is this place?

1165
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:14,098
- Whoa.
- This was my home.

1166
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,936
I was born into royalty.

1167
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:23,732
I learned from a young age
that gold is power.

1168
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,986
So, I set my sights
on expanding my fortune

1169
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,988
and let nothing stand in my way.

1170
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,866
My subjects were loyal...

1171
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,455
...and worked tirelessly year after year.

1172
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:43,710
My daughters were married
to the finest families,

1173
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,963
to expand the kingdom's glory.

1174
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:52,094
And my son,
I sent off to win treasure.

1175
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:57,474
He came home a hero.

1176
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,062
Soon, I had more gold, more land,

1177
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:05,774
and more monuments
than any lord who had come before me.

1178
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:08,484
And yet,

1179
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,029
as I laid on my deathbed,

1180
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,783
I awaited the parade
of loyal subjects and loving family.

1181
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:17,202
But there was none.

1182
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,498
With my last breath,
I cursed all who had forgotten me.

1183
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,085
I arrived at the gates to the spirit world

1184
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:27,796
and awaited
a great procession to welcome me.

1185
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:32,509
I demand you open this!

1186
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,804
Instead, the gods transformed me
into a Wish Dragon.

1187
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:38,056
Not as a reward,

1188
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,017
but as a punishment.

1189
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,895
I was imprisoned
and sent down to Earth

1190
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:46,732
to serve ten masters
and learn the true meaning of life.

1191
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,155
And to be honest,

1192
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:54,531
all these years,

1193
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,283
all these masters,

1194
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:57,951
I have been failing.

1195
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,330
Until I met you.

1196
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:06,001
I don't know the meaning of life.
But the things you care about,

1197
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,545
your friends, your family,

1198
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,840
are worth more
than anything I ever possessed.

1199
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,885
And no amount of gold can ever buy that.

1200
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,475
It's your wish, Din.

1201
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,561
Make sure it's what you really want.

1202
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,356
I...

1203
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:29,942
Din.

1204
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,444
Mr. Wang? What are you doing here?

1205
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:36,281
Please, give me that.
I don't have time for any more games.

1206
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,367
They work for you?

1207
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:41,119
No one's going to get hurt,
but I need those...

1208
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,168
Long!

1209
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:04,351
Stay away from my friend.

1210
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:19,783
Finally, I'm saved.

1211
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:23,495
Ah!

1212
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:29,251
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to hurt the kid.

1213
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:32,421
I've been bowing to others my entire life.

1214
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:36,091
And now, everyone will bow to me.

1215
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:39,177
No! No! No! No!

1216
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,728
- Mr. Wang.
- Dragon, I summon you.

1217
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,064
Din, Din!

1218
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:53,066
I'm your master now.

1219
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,570
And I know my first wish.

1220
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:20,343
Dad?

1221
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:24,097
No! Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

1222
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:26,683
- Din!
- Get in the teapot.

1223
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,476
Dad!

1224
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:30,771
- Li Na.
- No, no, no.

1225
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,274
Call an ambulance!
You're gonna be okay.

1226
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,401
Li Na, listen to me.

1227
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:38,445
I'm sorry.

1228
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:43,450
I tried to save it,
but the business is bankrupt.

1229
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,080
I wanted you to have everything.

1230
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,501
And now, I've left you with nothing.

1231
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,085
No.

1232
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:56,338
I never needed any of that.

1233
01:17:57,089 --> 01:18:00,133
All I ever wanted was my dad.

1234
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,512
All I wanted was you.

1235
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,541
One touch and you're done, kid.

1236
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,973
Yeah, get him, boss. Touch him.
Touch him good.

1237
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:52,185
Ooh, sparks.

1238
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,318
Long, I summon you.

1239
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,403
Din!

1240
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:05,614
Ooh!

1241
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,951
Ah! Whoa!

1242
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:10,245
Uh, dragon guy? I summon you.

1243
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:12,496
Din! Din?

1244
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:14,207
Din!

1245
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:17,377
I wish for enough puppies
to open a pet store.

1246
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:18,295
Puppies?

1247
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:19,421
Yes, puppies!

1248
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:20,589
It shall be so!

1249
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,679
Hey, little fella! I'll name you Teddy.

1250
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,181
No, bad Teddy! Bad boy!

1251
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,191
Hey, boss! I got the teapot!

1252
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,109
Don't let the boy get it!

1253
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:45,739
- Help us! Summon the dragon!
- Wish for something! A gun, anything!

1254
01:19:45,822 --> 01:19:48,283
Wish? Dragon? Summon?

1255
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:51,453
- Dragon guy.
- Huh?

1256
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:53,079
I wish I had longer legs.

1257
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,665
Um, okay.

1258
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:57,793
Are you joking?

1259
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,350
I summon you!

1260
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,149
I command you
to throw this kid off.

1261
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:25,445
I cannot intervene. You're not my master
until you have sole possession.

1262
01:20:28,281 --> 01:20:29,950
- Let it go.
- No.

1263
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,076
Let it go!

1264
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:38,208
Long, Long, I can't see you!

1265
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:41,878
There's no need to die tonight, kid.
Come work for me.

1266
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:44,214
I'll give you all the gold you want.

1267
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:47,592
- We're both wishing for the same thing.
- No.

1268
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:48,677
No, we're not.

1269
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:50,762
I don't need gold.

1270
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:53,974
I have something
more important to wish for.

1271
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,434
Din.

1272
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:57,936
I need that teapot.

1273
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:11,491
Well, at least you'll make
a good statue in my office.

1274
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,013
No!

1275
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:37,559
Long?

1276
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,105
Long, no!

1277
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:43,188
No!

1278
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:09,632
Long!

1279
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:20,185
Long!

1280
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:02,226
Din!

1281
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:05,062
Din.

1282
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,190
What's happening?

1283
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,237
Welcome, LongZhu.

1284
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,824
- What's going on? Where am I?
- Congratulations.

1285
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,494
Your service as a Wish Dragon is complete.

1286
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:23,498
Complete? I haven't finished.
I haven't finished my tenth master.

1287
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:26,459
You have put the needs of another
before yourself

1288
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:29,963
and shown us that you understand
the meaning of life.

1289
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:33,216
You are now free
to enter the spirit world.

1290
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:43,893
Is that a...

1291
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,186
parade?

1292
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:47,939
In your honor.

1293
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:53,319
No, I can't! I have to go back.

1294
01:23:53,903 --> 01:23:54,738
Back?

1295
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:57,657
Turn me back into a Wish Dragon!
I have one more wish to grant.

1296
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,493
Ridiculous. The laws of heaven forbid it.

1297
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:02,787
You're ridiculous!
Old man in a skirt.

1298
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,414
- This isn't a skirt!
- Send me back!

1299
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:12,130
You dare reject the will of the gods?

1300
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:15,425
Fine. If you're not gonna
send me back, I'll go myself!

1301
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:18,428
- Stop that!
- Stupid clouds.

1302
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:20,305
Stop... stop that this instant!

1303
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:22,015
Ah! My friend needs me.

1304
01:24:22,932 --> 01:24:23,975
Fine!

1305
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:26,436
We will permit you to return.

1306
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,647
But only under one condition.

1307
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:53,962
Long!

1308
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,180
Your final wish,

1309
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:04,474
great master.

1310
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:11,981
I wish...

1311
01:25:36,172 --> 01:25:37,924
Dad? Dad!

1312
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:12,000
There you are, Maurice.
Here we got Pocket and Mr. Pants.

1313
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:14,919
And all 234.

1314
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,880
Wow, nice puppies.

1315
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:20,216
Nice legs.

1316
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,844
- Thanks. Toodles.
- Bye!

1317
01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:41,654
Din, I...

1318
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:46,242
When I said that you needed
to be more realistic, I didn't mean that...

1319
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:49,244
It's okay, Mom.

1320
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:54,374
I...

1321
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:57,503
I'm sorry I can't give you a better life.

1322
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,256
You've given me a lot, Mom.

1323
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,926
Everything that matters.

1324
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:07,596
Well...

1325
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:11,017
it's late and, uh, we should have dinner.

1326
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,644
Here.

1327
01:27:14,854 --> 01:27:15,855
Mr. Wang?

1328
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:18,816
- What are you doing?
- Is Din all right?

1329
01:27:20,318 --> 01:27:22,862
Din, what trouble have you started now?

1330
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:24,614
No, no. No trouble at all.

1331
01:27:24,697 --> 01:27:27,158
I just came to apologize.

1332
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,744
I know what you did.

1333
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:31,328
Thank you.

1334
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:37,710
Ah, well, where are my manners?
Sit, sit, sit!

1335
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:40,129
- We were about to have dinner.
- You don't have to.

1336
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:42,548
Nonsense. Nonsense. It's my pleasure.

1337
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:47,178
And besides, we haven't had guests
in, well, a couple hours!

1338
01:27:49,722 --> 01:27:52,225
They're much too young
to be holding hands.

1339
01:27:52,308 --> 01:27:53,434
Shut up!

1340
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:57,146
Here, you look like you could use
a good, home-cooked meal.

1341
01:27:59,899 --> 01:28:02,986
This is the most delicious soup
I've ever tasted.

1342
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:10,493
Na Na!

1343
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:15,498
Na Na! Well, what do you think?
It's too much, isn't it? I'll get another.

1344
01:28:15,581 --> 01:28:18,376
It's great, Dad.
Put it up in the front window.

1345
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:20,837
- Yes! By tomorrow or no deal.
- Hi.

1346
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,300
Okay, hurry up with those dumplings.
You, step aside.

1347
01:28:27,927 --> 01:28:28,928
Good job.

1348
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:31,014
Din! Hello? Where are the teacups?

1349
01:28:31,097 --> 01:28:33,391
- We open in ten minutes.
- I'm on it.

1350
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:35,267
Teacups.

1351
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,645
Teacups, teacups, teacups.

1352
01:28:52,535 --> 01:28:53,535
Long?

1353
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,289
Greetings, great master.

1354
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:57,832
Oh, a peasant child.

1355
01:28:57,915 --> 01:29:02,003
Long, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be in the spirit world.

1356
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:06,549
Yeah, uh, about that,
uh, things got a little complicated.

1357
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:08,009
So, I'm back!

1358
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:12,430
Back? To serve another ten masters?

1359
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:14,182
You guessed it.

1360
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:18,853
But, you've been waiting 1,000 years
just to get through those gates.

1361
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:23,691
I know, there was a parade and everything,
but... you had one more wish.

1362
01:29:24,567 --> 01:29:25,777
It was the only way.

1363
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:30,156
You gave all that up for me?

1364
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:32,825
This is what I want.

1365
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:37,663
For the first time, it feels like
I have a little wisdom to offer.

1366
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:40,083
Maybe make a difference down here.

1367
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,297
Besides, there are no shrimp chips there,

1368
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:49,634
and I still haven't ridden
in one of those metal birds,

1369
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:53,137
and no air conditioning.
No air conditioning in heaven!

1370
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:54,889
There's actually plenty of...

1371
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:01,729
Thank you, Long.

1372
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,648
Thank you.

1373
01:30:08,694 --> 01:30:11,656
Din, why is there
a pile of broken teacups in the...

1374
01:30:15,868 --> 01:30:17,787
Know what? I don't want to know.

1375
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:24,460
Okay, Din, let go.

1376
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:26,503
Let go, Din.

1377
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:34,971
See you soon, Long.

1378
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:46,441
I am a god.

1379
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,197
What are you looking at?
A god, that's what.
