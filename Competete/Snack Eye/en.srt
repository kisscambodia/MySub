1
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:20,210
I'’m guessing it'’s the relay
or the spark plugs.

2
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,212
I got tools back at the cabin.

3
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:24,301
Shouldn'’t be a big job.

4
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:25,650
Can I help?

5
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:33,093
Dad?

6
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:36,357
Yeah. Yeah, sure you can help.

7
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,970
Is there a safe?
At the cabin.

8
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:42,841
Why?

9
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:46,193
You got valuables you
trying to hide? No.

10
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,369
Worried I'’m gonna steal
your baseball cards?

11
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:49,718
No.

12
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:51,492
I heard you on the phone
the other night.

13
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:53,113
You said you were
at a safe house.

14
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,812
It'’s just another word
for cabin.

15
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:58,292
So there'’s no safe?

16
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,858
There'’s a fireplace, though.

17
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:03,688
Maybe we can roast
some marshmallows.

18
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:16,092
Hey. Hey. Hey.

19
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:18,747
Hey. We need to leave.

20
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,444
Right now. Come on.

21
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:22,098
Dad?

22
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:31,107
Dad, what'’s happening?

23
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:43,815
Do not move,
no matter what happens.

24
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:40,481
You were almost hard to find.

25
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,005
Let'’s have it.

26
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:50,578
All of it.

27
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:10,989
Let'’s go in.

28
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:35,275
Here is how I make decisions.

29
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:40,105
Win, you live.

30
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:41,933
Lose,

31
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:43,848
you die.

32
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,817
Now that'’s too bad.

33
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:58,820
Snake eyes.

34
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:01,562
What can I say?
House always wins.

35
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:03,477
No!

36
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:08,264
Run!

37
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:23,801
Kid'’s gone.

38
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:49,991
Oh!

39
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,882
And the winner...

40
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,015
Snake Eyes!

41
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:23,328
They call you "Snake Eyes"
and yet you always win.

42
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,680
Of course,
your technique
is a bit crude,

43
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:28,725
but that has its advantages.

44
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,512
I'’ve been watching you
for a while now.

45
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,471
That ain'’t creepy at all.

46
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:38,735
When you grow up on the streets,
it'’s them or you, right?

47
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,087
My name is Kenta Takamura,
and I could use a man like you.

48
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:47,396
Ain'’t nothing personal,
but I don'’t work for guys
like you.

49
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,876
Or anyone, for that matter.

50
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,835
I know.
You are a drifter.

51
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,230
You fight until no one
will bet against you anymore
and then move on.

52
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:57,449
Works for me.

53
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:00,540
They said you
watched your old man get killed
when you were just a boy.

54
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,281
True?

55
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:07,372
I like to know who I'’m hiring.

56
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:15,772
I told you,
I ain'’t interested.
You got the wrong guy.

57
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:17,948
You haven'’t heard
my offer yet. I don'’t care.

58
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:23,258
"Homicide victim
recovered from cabin fire
is still unidentified."

59
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,262
My men found it
going through your motel room.

60
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:30,961
Sounds like the police
could never ID the body.

61
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,269
Nor did they
ever find the killer.

62
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:38,708
That, Mr. Snake Eyes,
is my offer.

63
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,846
I'’m pretty good
at finding people.

64
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,283
Especially people
who kill other people.

65
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:52,548
Come work for me,

66
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:56,030
and I promise you,
I'’ll find the man
who did this.

67
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,526
I'’ll find a spot for you
in my crew.

68
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,616
You can start at the docks.

69
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:49,300
Hey.

70
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,875
Uh-oh.

71
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:00,921
Here comes Fish Boy.

72
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,706
Cover up! Cover up! Cover up!

73
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,534
Let me know
when you get a new joke.

74
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,145
Oi!

75
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,670
Hey. Easy, easy.
They'’re just kids.

76
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,325
Throw it over. Yeah.

77
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,982
I'’m guessing
you were always picked last
on the playground, huh?

78
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,810
Hey! No, no, no! Huh?

79
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,290
Take it easy.

80
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:25,293
He meant no disrespect.
Right?

81
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,512
Yeah. Sure.

82
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:33,170
I don'’t know
what your deal is,
but you have guts.

83
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:41,178
Boss.

84
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:08,031
Hey!

85
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:11,121
Fish Boy.

86
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,256
What'’s going on?

87
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,389
Boss wants to talk to you.

88
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:20,696
Am I in trouble?

89
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:23,743
Someone is.

90
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,181
Leave the knife. Mmm?

91
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:35,015
We operate on one currency.

92
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:40,672
Not money. Not fear.
Just one simple thing.

93
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:43,240
Trust.

94
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:47,201
See, '’cause without trust,
there can be no loyalty.

95
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,725
And without loyalty...

96
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,773
there is no yakuza.

97
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:19,799
Tommy-san.

98
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:23,803
You look surprised to see me.

99
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:24,977
Kenta.

100
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,631
I wouldn'’t have pictured you

101
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:31,245
in a place like this
with friends like these.

102
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:35,075
My cousin here is one of
Japan'’s most powerful sons.

103
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,642
And you are one
of its most disgraced.

104
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,646
This man betrayed our trust.

105
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,955
He'’s an undercover spy,
acting out of loyalty
to his precious clan.

106
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:52,135
Let'’s show him what loyalty
really looks like.

107
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,368
This is a mistake.

108
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:19,162
Everything we want in life
comes at a price.

109
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:21,686
Now do it.

110
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:38,747
That'’s disappointing.

111
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,749
Kenta!

112
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:20,136
Hey.

113
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:23,052
Mind?

114
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,105
Come on.
Let'’s get out of here!

115
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:44,073
Let'’s go!

116
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,109
Now can we go?

117
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,389
This way!

118
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,712
No, no, no. Kenta!

119
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,155
Tommy, get in the truck!

120
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,038
Anytime you'’re ready.

121
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:53,610
Come on! All right, I'’m trying!

122
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:24,250
LAPD. Drop your weapons.

123
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:26,426
Don'’t move.

124
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,341
You all right?

125
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:30,386
Yeah.

126
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,606
Just peachy.

127
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,629
Good.

128
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,500
You'’re alive.Tommy.

129
00:19:57,674 --> 00:19:58,675
You'’re safe.

130
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,069
We are going home.

131
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,465
I don'’t have a home.

132
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,380
Not yours.

133
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,164
Mine.

134
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:13,647
I owe you a blood debt.

135
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,346
You saved my life. Why?

136
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:20,958
I'’m not a murderer.

137
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:26,312
I looked into your eyes,
and I saw honor.

138
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:34,798
So why run guns for the yakuza?

139
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:38,802
That was a mistake.

140
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:41,065
Well, you got that right.

141
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:44,982
If Kenta ever sees you again,

142
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,246
you are a dead man.

143
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,080
He called you cousins.

144
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,086
We grew up together.

145
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,699
We were both next in line
to become leader of our clan.

146
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:10,051
But there can only be one.

147
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:13,924
So Kenta tried
to have me killed.

148
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:19,278
When his treachery
was discovered...

149
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:24,283
I was given
the responsibility
to decide his fate.

150
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:29,592
I ordered him banished.

151
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:32,247
And since then,

152
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:36,773
he has been trying
to seize power
the only way he knows how.

153
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:41,822
Through greed and violence.

154
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:46,348
I didn'’t know till today
it was Kenta smuggling
these guns to Japan.

155
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:48,959
I was ambushed.

156
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,832
You'’re his enemy now too.

157
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:56,315
Which means
your "Fish Boy" life in LA...

158
00:21:57,838 --> 00:21:59,143
is over.

159
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:07,021
There'’s no going back.

160
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:12,548
Hey, where are we heading?

161
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:38,618
Really?

162
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:36,240
What is it exactly you do?

163
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,982
A little of this,
little of that.

164
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:44,858
That your wife? No.

165
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:46,425
Your girlfriend.Uh-uh.

166
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,774
Sister?

167
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:51,038
Akiko is our chief of security.

168
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:55,085
We value her advice,
but we don'’t have to
take it.

169
00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:05,531
The leader of our clan
rarely meets outsiders.

170
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:07,968
Don'’t forget to bow.

171
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:24,463
Snake Eyes,

172
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:28,902
I present the leader
of the clan Arashikage, Sen.

173
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:32,558
My grandmother.

174
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:36,562
The man who saved
my grandson'’s life.

175
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:40,000
We Arashikage are in your debt,

176
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:43,264
which means Japan
is in your debt.

177
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:46,049
Don'’t worry about it.

178
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:48,791
I'’ll settle for a hot bath
and a plane ticket out of here.

179
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,186
I have a better idea.

180
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,276
Stay.

181
00:24:57,713 --> 00:24:59,672
I want you to join us.

182
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:01,804
Join the Arashikage.

183
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,808
Sen-sama.
If I may.

184
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:08,637
Even allowing him
this much access is reckless.

185
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:11,422
I vouch for him. With respect,
Tommy-san,

186
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:14,034
you do not lead this clan.

187
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:16,426
Not yet.

188
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,299
Someday I will.

189
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,436
And I will need
a warrior like this
by my side.

190
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,050
Someone I can trust
with my life.

191
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:34,620
For 600 years,

192
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:39,450
our ninja have brought
peace and stability to Japan.

193
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:43,759
The secret blade and iron wall
of every government
since the age of Edo.

194
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,979
But things have changed.

195
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:49,678
New threats
call for new strategies.

196
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:51,985
Even welcoming outsiders...

197
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:56,642
as you, of all of us,
should know, Akiko.

198
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:03,300
Any questions we have about
our new friend,

199
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,828
the Three Challenges
of the Warrior
will answer them.

200
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:11,787
And will he submit
to the challenges?

201
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:17,924
He will.

202
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,026
I'’m sorry,
the Three Challenges
of the what now?

203
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,508
The Three Challenges
are designed to reveal
an applicant'’s character.

204
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:43,123
The first two
will cleanse you
of ego, anger and fear

205
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:45,342
and ready you for the third.

206
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:48,650
That'’s the true test.

207
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:52,175
It will be up to you
whether you wish
to take it.

208
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:54,525
What if I fail?

209
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,138
You die.

210
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,579
You'’re being serious.

211
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:08,888
I wouldn'’t put you
in that position
if I thought it was likely.

212
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:15,329
I can'’t give you
a name or a past...

213
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:19,463
but I can offer you a purpose.

214
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,857
And something more important.

215
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,425
A home.

216
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,300
And why would you do that?

217
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,827
Because I saw honor
in your eyes, too.

218
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:42,095
Come.

219
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:49,885
Get some rest.
You have time to decide.

220
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:11,385
In the meantime,
consider my home your home.

221
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,911
So your toys, my toys, huh?

222
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:20,046
How American.

223
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,781
You'’ll need
to get farther faster.

224
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:01,435
We don'’t have much time.

225
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:04,046
The Arashikage are more
than just brute force.

226
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,702
We are spies, scouts,
guardians, infiltrators.

227
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:12,315
You will be tested,
you will be hurt, you will
suffer, and you will fail.

228
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:15,928
But the hardest part
will be listening
to you complain about it.

229
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,634
I still think this is a mistake.

230
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:32,074
Zero hits on his fingerprints.

231
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:34,947
Nothing on any of our
facial recognition platforms.

232
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:37,210
This stray dog of yours
is a ghost.

233
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,561
I'’m not scared of ghosts.

234
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,215
I'’m serious, Tommy.

235
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:44,217
He was working
for the yakuza,
for God'’s sake.

236
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:46,610
He'’s not one of them. That
doesn'’t make him one of us.

237
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:49,483
"Us"?

238
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:55,097
My name...

239
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:59,928
My name is
Tomisaburo Arashikage.

240
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:04,454
You think
I would endanger this clan?

241
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,371
I am this clan.

242
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:11,810
Tommy-san, I wasn'’t
questioning your loyalty.

243
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:14,551
Just my judgment.

244
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,295
He saved my life, Akiko.

245
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,471
I owe him this chance.

246
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:23,038
I understand it.

247
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:25,475
I'’m just worried
you'’re moving too fast.

248
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,782
"Too quick to anger,
too quick to react."

249
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:30,567
Now you sound like Grandmother.

250
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:35,834
If I'’m wrong about him,
we'’ll find out tomorrow.

251
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:40,099
80% of candidates
fail the first challenge.

252
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:41,622
Just saying.

253
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:45,844
Well, that means
20% pass, Akiko.

254
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,064
Just saying.

255
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:53,199
For 600 years,

256
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:55,810
our fighters have been trained

257
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:58,987
by the greatest warriors
the world has ever known.

258
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,772
Hard Master.

259
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:12,087
And most honorable

260
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:14,916
Blind Master.

261
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:19,573
From them,
you will learn
how to fight,

262
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:22,184
how to kill when necessary,

263
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:24,317
but most importantly,

264
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:28,495
how to live according to
the Arashikage Mindset.

265
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:30,149
Abandon ego.

266
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,413
Strike with honor.

267
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:38,287
Selflessness
and truthfulness
will lead to harmony.

268
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:40,899
Any questions?

269
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:43,814
What happens... Silence!

270
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:46,643
You are nothing.

271
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:48,732
This challenge
is a waste of time.

272
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:51,735
You will fail.

273
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:56,566
Okay, Hard-on Master,
or whatever your name is.

274
00:31:58,394 --> 00:31:59,700
Let'’s go.

275
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,002
Challenge one.

276
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:47,139
Take this bowl from me.
I'’ll take that bowl
from you.

277
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:49,706
Okay, I'’ll bite.

278
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:51,839
What'’s the punch line?

279
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:55,364
You must take my bowl
without spilling any water.

280
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:58,759
Fail four times
and your training is over
before it begins.

281
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:15,689
That'’s one.

282
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:42,237
Two.

283
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:20,145
That'’s three.

284
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:40,121
Abandon ego.

285
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:44,734
Selflessness and truthfulness...

286
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,216
will lead to harmony.

287
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:13,023
Hard Master.

288
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:19,160
I humbly request
that you accept my bowl
in exchange for yours.

289
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,351
No congratulations?

290
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:37,787
One down, two to go.

291
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:39,441
Congratulations.

292
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:42,531
If I ever need a bowl of water,
I know who to ask.

293
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,535
You hide it well,

294
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:49,277
but I can tell you'’re
a little impressed with me.

295
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:52,062
What I think of you
is irrelevant.

296
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:55,022
You'’ll survive
the third test
or you won'’t.

297
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,503
Then it won'’t matter at all.

298
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:03,248
To Tommy, our future toryo.

299
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:06,947
May you be strong,
wise and honorable.

300
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:08,253
To Snake Eyes.

301
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:09,992
May you die well.

302
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:13,171
Kanpai.

303
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:15,347
Kanpai!

304
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:20,047
That word he used,
"toryo."

305
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:24,530
It means
"head of family."

306
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,489
I am the last of
the Arashikage bloodline.

307
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:31,580
Ever since I was a child,
I'’ve been groomed to lead.

308
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:34,583
This is my destiny.

309
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:41,373
But if I'’m to lead the clan
into the next hundred years,

310
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,810
I have to adapt.

311
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,422
We have to adapt.

312
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,079
I need warriors like you,

313
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,517
who have lived in
and know the new world

314
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:57,693
but can master
the Arashikage Mindset,

315
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:01,001
to become the future of the clan

316
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:05,353
and fight side by side
as brothers.

317
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:10,184
Anyway, eat.

318
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:25,678
Why is Hard Master
staring at me like that?

319
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:27,549
He isn'’t.

320
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:29,986
He is very nearsighted.

321
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,686
The Blind Master,
on the other hand...

322
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:36,602
he is watching you.

323
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:48,222
They say he knows a liar
when he hears one.

324
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,319
Tommy said
I could borrow
one of his bikes.

325
00:37:58,493 --> 00:37:59,493
His motorbikes?

326
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:01,017
Bike... Yes.

327
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,108
That one.

328
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:29,002
Keep an eye on the bike.

329
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:06,387
I didn'’t know
if you would show up.

330
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:09,869
Why?

331
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:13,133
Just because you left me to
bleed out on a dock in LA?

332
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:15,701
All you had to do was
get Tommy on that boat.

333
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:18,486
Think you could'’ve mentioned
that he'’d wade through 50 yakuza

334
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,880
just for the chance
to kick your ass?

335
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:23,926
Hey, it worked.

336
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,798
You earned his trust.

337
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:27,539
You got in.

338
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:29,889
By the way, how did he like,

339
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:33,022
"I looked into your eyes
and saw honor"?

340
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:36,852
He ate it up. I knew he would.

341
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,117
He told me about your history.

342
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,816
How you tried to kill him
and he cast you out of the clan.

343
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:47,080
Our family drama
is not your concern.

344
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:49,430
Yeah, you'’re right about that,
'’cause I'’m out.

345
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:52,867
We had an agreement.

346
00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:54,304
And I seem to be the only guy

347
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:56,394
who'’s keeping up his end of it.

348
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:58,613
And here I had a gift for you.

349
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:03,705
You found him.

350
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:20,505
Where? Easy now.

351
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,118
I kept my word.
Now you have to keep yours.

352
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,163
They want me
to take three tests.

353
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:29,644
I fail the third, I die.

354
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:32,430
So whatever
you need me to do,
it better be quick.

355
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:34,257
It'’s up to you.

356
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,740
There is a priceless artifact
hidden in the castle grounds.

357
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:42,309
The Jewel of the Sun.

358
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:45,747
It'’s a symbol
of Arashikage'’s power.

359
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:48,750
Find the jewel
and bring it to me...

360
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:52,493
and I'’ll give you
your father'’s killer.

361
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:46,155
"You'’re welcome."

362
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:49,507
This place
is built like a fortress.
What are you protecting?

363
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,509
When I was young,

364
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:56,601
I was told stories
of the Sun Goddess.

365
00:41:56,775 --> 00:42:00,648
Once, long ago,
she wanted to test
the character of her people,

366
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:05,958
so she sent down a gift
in the form of a jewel.

367
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:12,442
A jewel that contained
the power of the sun.

368
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:15,707
We swore an oath
to protect it,
but more important,

369
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:18,144
to never use it ourselves.

370
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:20,581
As I grew, I realized why.

371
00:42:22,757 --> 00:42:26,152
We have the power
to destroy anyone
who wrongs us,

372
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:29,111
but that is
a dangerous temptation.

373
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:31,940
True power calls for discipline.

374
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:38,120
This is Morning Light.

375
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,212
My gift to you
for passing
the first challenge.

376
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,788
It'’s easy to shoot with a gun,

377
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:57,575
but the sword
is a weapon of honor.

378
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,409
You know what I mean.

379
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:13,634
It suits you.

380
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:18,334
Hey, there was nothing
in that brochure
about a nuclear jewel.

381
00:43:18,508 --> 00:43:19,901
Only a few have access.

382
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:23,601
My grandmother, the masters...

383
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:25,951
and me.

384
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,693
Seems like a lot of protocol
for a fairy tale.

385
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:32,479
Not protocol.
There'’s a DNA lock.

386
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:35,482
Like I said,
blood matters
to my family.

387
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,696
What are you doing here?

388
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,177
You.

389
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:03,657
I was going for a walk.

390
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,573
Mm. With a sword?

391
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,405
I thought it was time to
get serious about my training.

392
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:15,016
That'’s Morning Light,
a weapon of honor.

393
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:18,019
What makes you think
you deserve it?

394
00:45:18,193 --> 00:45:20,021
What makes you think
you can use it?

395
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,284
How hard could it be?

396
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:24,460
Let'’s find out.

397
00:45:30,336 --> 00:45:32,947
How'’d you get that scar?
How did you get your name?

398
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:34,921
I'’ll tell you when
you get to know me better.

399
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,646
If you live that long.

400
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:42,000
How about a wager? I'’m all ears.

401
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,873
Land one blow on me
and I won'’t cut them both off.

402
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,833
And if I lose?

403
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:52,750
You tell me why you'’re here.
I thought I did. We'’re training.

404
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:54,752
Here with the Arashikage.

405
00:45:58,538 --> 00:46:00,235
You'’re on. Hit me.

406
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:07,677
With your sword.

407
00:46:13,945 --> 00:46:15,337
Come at me like you mean it.

408
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:27,523
It'’s not your skill
that'’s lacking,
it'’s your heart.

409
00:46:27,697 --> 00:46:30,744
If your heart is pure,
our secrets will reveal
themselves to you.

410
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:32,398
If not...

411
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:43,539
they'’ll be your end.

412
00:46:45,498 --> 00:46:46,499
You gonna get that?

413
00:46:59,077 --> 00:47:01,383
A win without honor
is no win at all.

414
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:05,910
Are you sure it'’s Kenta?

415
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:08,782
He found a new way
to bring his guns to Japan.

416
00:47:10,175 --> 00:47:12,046
He'’s taking delivery
of a shipment tonight.

417
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,266
If I move fast,
I can get the jump on him.

418
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,485
You have a location? Shinjuku.

419
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:18,400
I'’ll send a team.No.

420
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:21,577
I'’ll handle this myself.

421
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:24,580
You have that look
you get sometimes.

422
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:26,495
The shadow before a storm.

423
00:47:28,454 --> 00:47:30,717
That storm will pass
when I kill Kenta.

424
00:47:34,068 --> 00:47:35,156
Tommy.

425
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:37,114
I'’ll come with you.

426
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:09,166
I'’ll block the alley
from the street.

427
00:48:10,148 --> 00:48:11,845
Tommy,
you handle the rest of them.

428
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:13,455
And you, secure the weapons.

429
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:14,761
What about Kenta?

430
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,241
He'’s mine.

431
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:21,899
They'’re here.

432
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:57,498
Boys.

433
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:21,616
Cobra.

434
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,010
This is a lot of firepower.

435
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,666
What does Kenta want
with it all?

436
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:31,713
To start a war.
With us.

437
00:52:31,887 --> 00:52:35,195
Which means
we'’re gonna need support.
Let'’s call Scarlett.

438
00:52:45,945 --> 00:52:47,903
Major O'’Hara. Give me a second.

439
00:52:49,296 --> 00:52:51,690
I need to take care of
some surprise guests.

440
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,349
Go ahead.

441
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:00,481
Kenta is back in Tokyo

442
00:53:00,655 --> 00:53:02,353
and aligning with Cobra.

443
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:04,703
This is recent?

444
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:06,183
From tonight.

445
00:53:07,575 --> 00:53:08,576
Hang on a sec, okay?

446
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:26,159
Should we be worried?

447
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,465
About Scarlett?

448
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:30,381
No. Major O'’Hara
is with the Joes.

449
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:32,252
The what?

450
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:34,863
An elite global
counterterrorism unit.

451
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:36,735
They'’re the good guys.

452
00:53:48,877 --> 00:53:49,878
Cobra.

453
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:51,315
So what'’s the deal with Cobra?

454
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:53,360
The deal is,

455
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:56,102
they'’re a secret
network of terrorist cells,
crime syndicates,

456
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:58,670
arms manufacturers
and paramilitary groups

457
00:53:58,844 --> 00:54:01,934
linked under
a single centralized command.

458
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:05,851
A shadow organization
devoted to bringing about
global revolution

459
00:54:06,025 --> 00:54:08,984
through violence,
extortion and fear.

460
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:14,207
Major?

461
00:54:14,381 --> 00:54:16,862
Major O'’Hara? Major?

462
00:54:17,036 --> 00:54:19,299
I just sent you
a mission brief.

463
00:54:19,473 --> 00:54:22,694
I'’ve been keeping tabs
on an old friend of mine
who just landed in Japan.

464
00:54:22,868 --> 00:54:24,435
I don'’t think
it'’s a coincidence.

465
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:27,394
Her name'’s Ana DeCobray,
aka "Baroness."

466
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:29,527
Since we lost touch,
she'’s been busy.

467
00:54:31,224 --> 00:54:32,921
She killed a member
of parliament?

468
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:35,881
Along with 200 other passengers
on the same train,

469
00:54:36,055 --> 00:54:37,796
just to influence an election.

470
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:40,253
She'’s been linked to bombings,
assassinations and civil unrest

471
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,017
everywhere from Nanzhao
to Borovia.

472
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:44,324
In short,
she'’s top-echelon Cobra.

473
00:54:44,498 --> 00:54:47,936
If Kenta'’s linked up
with the Baroness, the threat
to you is significant.

474
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,025
I'’ll be in Tokyo
as soon as I can.

475
00:56:59,938 --> 00:57:02,897
I didn'’t sign up
to work for terrorists.

476
00:57:03,071 --> 00:57:06,205
A little late
to grow a conscience,
don'’t you think?

477
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:13,734
We each have our own agenda.

478
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:19,523
There is no reason
this triangle of ours
can'’t be purely transactional.

479
00:57:19,697 --> 00:57:21,829
We all have something
the other wants.

480
00:57:24,658 --> 00:57:25,920
Baroness.

481
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:30,098
I know who you are
and what you'’ve done.

482
00:57:30,272 --> 00:57:32,666
That rock you want me to steal,
it'’s for Cobra, isn'’t it?

483
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:36,322
No.

484
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:38,672
I didn'’t sign up for this.

485
00:57:38,846 --> 00:57:42,589
As I said,
ours is a series
of exchanges.

486
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:44,896
Kenta wants to destroy the clan.

487
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:48,334
The clan has something I want.

488
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:50,118
And we have something you want.

489
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:52,381
Now of course,
if you'’ve had a change of heart,

490
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:54,340
you are free to go.

491
00:57:54,514 --> 00:57:57,604
But then, so is he.

492
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:02,479
He goes by Augustine.

493
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:04,872
The man who
took your father'’s life...

494
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:07,266
and yours.

495
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:17,581
Tell me where he is.

496
00:58:18,277 --> 00:58:20,453
Under lock and key.

497
00:58:20,627 --> 00:58:24,631
But I promise you, back out now

498
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:27,025
and you will never
see him again.

499
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,377
All that rage...

500
00:58:32,726 --> 00:58:35,033
for all these years.

501
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:38,253
Are you sure you'’re ready
to give up the hunt

502
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:40,865
when you'’re so close
to finding peace?

503
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:45,347
Think about it.

504
00:58:47,436 --> 00:58:49,047
You have three days.

505
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:51,832
Then I let him go.

506
00:59:03,322 --> 00:59:05,324
Trust me. He'’ll do it.

507
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:07,673
He'’d better.

508
00:59:08,414 --> 00:59:09,981
Or I kill you both.

509
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:23,342
Every warrior has a weakness
your enemy can exploit.

510
00:59:23,516 --> 00:59:27,128
The second challenge
will expose it.

511
00:59:27,302 --> 00:59:31,742
To avoid harm,
you must first learn
how you harm yourself.

512
00:59:32,699 --> 00:59:34,962
Most can'’t manage and fail.

513
00:59:37,965 --> 00:59:39,793
Where is everybody else?

514
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:42,796
This test is private
and unique to you.

515
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,624
You face it alone.

516
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:50,717
The light will reveal all.

517
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,893
Follow it.

518
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:22,113
I'’m sorry, Dad.

519
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:26,639
I couldn'’t stop him.

520
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:42,176
It'’s not your fault.

521
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:44,265
You were just a kid.

522
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:49,662
I couldn'’t save you.

523
01:01:50,968 --> 01:01:52,665
You saved yourself.

524
01:01:53,927 --> 01:01:56,147
That'’s the only thing
that mattered to me.

525
01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:54,945
Did I pass?

526
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,513
This is more than a test
you pass or fail.

527
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:02,039
It is a mirror
to reveal your weakness.

528
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:08,393
Even if it
causes you more pain,
you must unburden yourself.

529
01:03:08,567 --> 01:03:12,658
It is the only way
to overcome the third challenge.

530
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:14,486
And I assure you,

531
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,619
this is not a challenge
you want to fail.

532
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:20,003
I miss something?

533
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:26,226
I followed you into the city.

534
01:05:27,053 --> 01:05:28,576
But you know that.

535
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,795
Where did you go?

536
01:05:31,797 --> 01:05:34,582
You'’ve been looking for a reason
not to trust me from the start.

537
01:05:34,756 --> 01:05:37,324
You'’re an unknown.
That'’s dangerous.

538
01:05:41,415 --> 01:05:44,375
I think you can handle yourself.
Dangerous to this clan.

539
01:05:45,724 --> 01:05:47,726
You don'’t know
what this place means to me.

540
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,598
I owe the Arashikage everything.

541
01:05:50,772 --> 01:05:52,861
I never knew family
before I arrived here.

542
01:05:53,645 --> 01:05:55,560
Can you understand that?

543
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:12,969
You want to know why
I'’ve been a ghost for so long?

544
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:20,193
My father was murdered
when I was a kid.

545
01:06:21,803 --> 01:06:25,242
When I tried to find out why,
it was as if he didn'’t exist.

546
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:27,766
False identities, false papers.

547
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:30,377
Everything about him was a lie.

548
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:34,773
Even my own name.

549
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:44,043
That'’s why
I couldn'’t find you.

550
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:48,439
If I pass the third challenge...

551
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,964
I'’m Arashikage, right?

552
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,619
If you pass.

553
01:06:55,707 --> 01:06:57,013
I have to pass.

554
01:07:00,146 --> 01:07:03,932
I'’ve done unforgivable things
I wish I could tell you,
but I can'’t.

555
01:07:05,456 --> 01:07:07,501
But if I could become
part of this family,

556
01:07:07,675 --> 01:07:08,894
be its protector...

557
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:12,767
I think
that would make it right.

558
01:07:21,428 --> 01:07:23,430
Then empty your heart.

559
01:07:26,303 --> 01:07:28,174
Whatever you'’re hiding
in there,

560
01:07:28,348 --> 01:07:30,524
the challenge
will see right through it.

561
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,926
I see that you have
a clouded mind.

562
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:44,190
You live on both sides
of the mirror.

563
01:07:44,364 --> 01:07:47,715
Only you know whether
you are ready to take this test.

564
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:50,457
Be certain
that you wish to proceed.

565
01:07:50,631 --> 01:07:52,807
Once the third challenge begins,

566
01:07:52,981 --> 01:07:54,635
there is no turning back.

567
01:07:57,812 --> 01:07:59,075
I'’m sure.

568
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:04,210
Those who pass are
accepted into the Arashikage.

569
01:08:04,384 --> 01:08:06,386
If you survive,
you will gain access

570
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,520
to our knowledge and our power.

571
01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:14,742
But you must swear loyalty
to our clan.

572
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:16,918
Do you accept this condition?

573
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,531
I do.

574
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:30,280
What do I do
when I get down there?

575
01:08:30,454 --> 01:08:32,238
There is a particular tile.

576
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:34,980
Step on it
and wait for judgment.

577
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:38,984
Something funny?

578
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,942
You will see,

579
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,292
Snake.

580
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:04,374
Giant anacondas as old as time.

581
01:10:04,548 --> 01:10:06,985
They never harm
those who are pure of heart.

582
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:08,769
What about everybody else?

583
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:04,738
Empty your heart.

584
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:19,422
Go!

585
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:24,252
Go!

586
01:12:49,713 --> 01:12:52,542
She knows our rules.
She will be punished.

587
01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:55,849
Grandmother... You brought him among us.

588
01:12:56,023 --> 01:12:58,025
The fault is not hers alone.

589
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:00,463
No, Sen-san.

590
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:03,988
The fault is mine.

591
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:06,860
Explain yourself.

592
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:09,907
The penalty of lying is death.

593
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:14,041
We are all listening.

594
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:21,527
My heart is not pure.

595
01:13:22,876 --> 01:13:24,269
I seek vengeance.

596
01:13:25,618 --> 01:13:27,098
My father was murdered.

597
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:30,362
I have dedicated my life

598
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:32,408
to finding the man who did it...

599
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:35,106
and killing him.

600
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:44,855
This is all I'’ve ever wanted.

601
01:13:51,209 --> 01:13:52,602
He speaks the truth.

602
01:13:54,604 --> 01:13:56,867
Your honesty wins you your life,

603
01:13:57,737 --> 01:13:59,739
but not among the Arashikage.

604
01:14:16,495 --> 01:14:17,670
Snake!

605
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:01,018
You should have told me.

606
01:15:01,975 --> 01:15:04,021
We could have been brothers.

607
01:15:05,544 --> 01:15:07,285
I know I failed you.

608
01:15:08,765 --> 01:15:11,942
You are the only brother
I'’ve ever known.

609
01:15:12,116 --> 01:15:14,727
And I would pay you back
with my life if I had to.

610
01:16:08,259 --> 01:16:09,695
Keep it.

611
01:20:14,635 --> 01:20:16,202
I was hoping
you wouldn'’t do that.

612
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:18,944
Akiko.

613
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,905
Still want to know
how I got my scar?

614
01:20:23,079 --> 01:20:24,820
From the last man I trusted.

615
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:28,388
Trust is a hard thing to
come by these days.

616
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:33,437
Time for you to learn a lesson.

617
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:13,869
You have placed
the clan at risk.

618
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:16,393
You must atone.

619
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:19,352
We will return the Jewel...

620
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:24,836
and bring you the head
of Snake Eyes.

621
01:21:48,077 --> 01:21:49,078
So?

622
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:51,254
Do you have it?

623
01:21:52,559 --> 01:21:54,755
You'’re gonna start a war
with the Arashikage, aren'’t you?

624
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:56,389
What do you care?

625
01:21:58,565 --> 01:22:02,134
Remember our deal,
and you will get
what I promised.

626
01:22:35,994 --> 01:22:37,735
This isn'’t my fight.

627
01:22:50,139 --> 01:22:51,140
Come here.

628
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,682
Mmm.

629
01:23:16,948 --> 01:23:18,341
Please,

630
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:20,212
enjoy your reward.

631
01:23:39,536 --> 01:23:42,495
You will get the Jewel
once I'’ve destroyed the clan.

632
01:24:45,341 --> 01:24:46,342
Who are you?

633
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:51,434
You killed my dad.

634
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:57,179
You'’re going to have to be
a little more specific.

635
01:24:58,005 --> 01:25:00,791
I killed a lot of people.

636
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:16,111
Roll.

637
01:25:17,808 --> 01:25:19,375
Win, you live.

638
01:25:20,289 --> 01:25:21,986
Lose, you die.

639
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:27,296
Roll!

640
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:29,733
Roll!

641
01:25:33,215 --> 01:25:34,607
Snake eyes.

642
01:25:36,653 --> 01:25:37,958
You better think!

643
01:25:41,745 --> 01:25:44,443
Okay, okay. All right.

644
01:25:44,617 --> 01:25:47,620
Now I remember you.
You attacked me,
tried to save your dad.

645
01:25:47,794 --> 01:25:49,796
Why did you kill him?

646
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:52,321
Cobra gives an order,
you don'’t question it.

647
01:26:04,898 --> 01:26:06,161
You'’re Cobra.

648
01:26:08,075 --> 01:26:09,338
I was.

649
01:26:10,643 --> 01:26:12,079
Until three weeks ago,

650
01:26:12,254 --> 01:26:15,300
when that bitch dragged me
off a chopper at gunpoint.

651
01:26:20,218 --> 01:26:24,266
You must be a big man for
the Baroness to hand me over.

652
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,447
Let'’s go. Let'’s do this.

653
01:27:04,001 --> 01:27:06,003
I have to stop Kenta.

654
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,711
There he is.

655
01:27:19,582 --> 01:27:20,844
Follow him.

656
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:35,250
What'’s he doing?

657
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:37,424
Looks like
he'’s heading back
to the castle.

658
01:27:55,531 --> 01:27:56,662
Let'’s go.

659
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:25,212
Did you see that?
Snake'’s fighting on our side.

660
01:28:49,498 --> 01:28:51,195
Tommy, listen to me.

661
01:28:51,369 --> 01:28:54,111
Kenta'’s got the Jewel
and is headed for the castle.

662
01:28:54,285 --> 01:28:55,504
Can you hear me?

663
01:28:55,678 --> 01:28:56,809
Tommy! Akiko!

664
01:28:56,983 --> 01:28:58,289
Shit!

665
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:30,843
We have to keep you safe.

666
01:29:31,017 --> 01:29:32,697
Nothing matters
but the safety of the clan.

667
01:29:32,845 --> 01:29:34,064
You are the clan!

668
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:36,153
I am nothing by myself.

669
01:30:48,181 --> 01:30:49,835
I guess the party started early.

670
01:31:13,337 --> 01:31:16,166
He needs help. He deserves to die.

671
01:33:07,886 --> 01:33:10,976
We have to stop Kenta.
He has the Jewel.

672
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,462
This isn'’t over.

673
01:33:29,821 --> 01:33:32,607
Leave! Now!

674
01:34:09,078 --> 01:34:11,254
I am the Arashikage.

675
01:34:13,473 --> 01:34:15,214
This is a terrible idea.

676
01:34:53,862 --> 01:34:57,866
Very noble.
But the promise
is not yours to make.

677
01:35:01,826 --> 01:35:03,045
The Jewel.

678
01:35:03,219 --> 01:35:05,177
The clan is destroyed.

679
01:35:05,351 --> 01:35:07,353
We kept our side of the bargain.

680
01:35:07,527 --> 01:35:09,399
I trust you'’ll keep yours.

681
01:35:15,187 --> 01:35:19,017
With this jewel,
Cobra will be invincible.

682
01:35:21,846 --> 01:35:23,413
Maybe I'’ll just keep it.

683
01:35:23,587 --> 01:35:25,154
No good deed, huh?

684
01:35:26,068 --> 01:35:27,199
Shut up.

685
01:35:27,373 --> 01:35:29,636
Cobra will annihilate you.

686
01:35:33,684 --> 01:35:36,905
You protect my grandmother.
I'’ll go after the Jewel.

687
01:35:39,603 --> 01:35:41,736
When you cast me out,

688
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:45,435
I warned you
this day would come.

689
01:35:46,566 --> 01:35:47,611
Kneel.

690
01:35:51,006 --> 01:35:52,355
Very well, then.

691
01:35:54,879 --> 01:35:55,880
Die.

692
01:35:58,709 --> 01:36:00,972
We'’re under attack!
It'’s Tommy.

693
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:06,891
Snake.

694
01:36:14,072 --> 01:36:16,683
You'’re in a tight spot, huh?
I'’ve been in worse.

695
01:36:16,858 --> 01:36:19,077
Still, I'’d like to propose
a very temporary alliance.

696
01:36:19,251 --> 01:36:21,558
All right.
But when it'’s over, I walk.

697
01:36:21,732 --> 01:36:23,908
Not a chance,
but I'’ll give you
a head start.

698
01:36:46,278 --> 01:36:49,760
You'’re losing your touch.
I saw you a mile away.

699
01:36:51,457 --> 01:36:52,850
Sure you did.

700
01:36:53,024 --> 01:36:55,679
Good of you
to join us, Tommy-san.

701
01:36:55,853 --> 01:36:57,420
And just in time.

702
01:36:58,508 --> 01:37:00,118
I count 20 men.

703
01:37:00,989 --> 01:37:01,989
Heavy odds.

704
01:37:02,077 --> 01:37:03,774
Yeah. For them.

705
01:37:31,628 --> 01:37:33,064
Snake Eyes,

706
01:37:33,238 --> 01:37:36,502
betray our trust again,
I'’ll kill you myself.

707
01:37:38,156 --> 01:37:39,592
What is she doing here?

708
01:37:39,766 --> 01:37:42,639
Let'’s just say our goals
are temporarily aligned.

709
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:47,252
Just for tonight.

710
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:29,991
They'’re mine.

711
01:40:05,216 --> 01:40:06,478
Yo, Joe.

712
01:40:13,616 --> 01:40:15,835
Hmm.Mm-hmm.

713
01:40:45,517 --> 01:40:46,605
Fuck this.

714
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:11,978
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

715
01:41:51,801 --> 01:41:53,063
Tommy!

716
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:05,336
Tommy-san, no! Tommy-san!

717
01:42:26,618 --> 01:42:28,011
Kenta'’s gone.

718
01:42:30,405 --> 01:42:31,406
Where'’s Snake?

719
01:43:08,269 --> 01:43:09,748
Just stay down.

720
01:43:39,256 --> 01:43:40,997
Abandon ego.

721
01:43:44,087 --> 01:43:46,132
Practice selflessness.

722
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:51,877
Strike with honor.

723
01:45:08,563 --> 01:45:10,304
This is where you die.

724
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:46,312
The Jewel of the Sun is secure.

725
01:46:53,929 --> 01:46:55,887
And it always will be.

726
01:46:57,236 --> 01:46:59,630
At least for another generation.

727
01:47:04,505 --> 01:47:08,117
I will be the last of our family
to lead the Arashikage.

728
01:47:10,946 --> 01:47:12,251
But Sen-sama...

729
01:47:15,733 --> 01:47:17,648
I had no choice.

730
01:47:20,172 --> 01:47:23,437
I only used the Jewel
to defend our people.

731
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:26,091
There is always a choice.

732
01:47:26,265 --> 01:47:29,704
Our clan swore an oath
to never use the Jewel,

733
01:47:29,878 --> 01:47:31,445
only to protect it.

734
01:47:33,098 --> 01:47:34,404
You can never...

735
01:47:36,885 --> 01:47:37,973
lead the clan.

736
01:47:38,147 --> 01:47:39,147
With respect...

737
01:47:39,278 --> 01:47:41,150
Remember your vows, Tommy,

738
01:47:41,324 --> 01:47:43,892
to forever serve the clan
in any capacity.

739
01:47:44,066 --> 01:47:45,328
"Serve"?

740
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:51,682
Serve?

741
01:47:54,729 --> 01:47:59,516
I have given my life
to this clan!

742
01:47:59,690 --> 01:48:01,953
I have sacrificed everything!

743
01:48:02,127 --> 01:48:03,172
Tommy.

744
01:48:03,999 --> 01:48:06,697
It is my blood right!

745
01:48:17,447 --> 01:48:21,582
You offered me your life.

746
01:48:25,803 --> 01:48:27,805
Next time we meet...

747
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:32,680
I will take it.

748
01:48:36,292 --> 01:48:37,946
Tomisaburo, wait.

749
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:43,038
You will always
be a part of this family.

750
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:06,017
I serve no one.

751
01:49:43,751 --> 01:49:46,362
I'’m going after Tommy.
I had a feeling you might.

752
01:49:47,363 --> 01:49:48,799
Are you sure that'’s wise?

753
01:49:48,973 --> 01:49:51,193
In his state,
who knows what he might do?

754
01:49:51,367 --> 01:49:53,195
That'’s why I have to find him.

755
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:56,590
This is all my fault.

756
01:49:56,764 --> 01:49:58,896
I have to do
everything I can
to make it right.

757
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:03,161
Well, this might be useful.

758
01:50:16,348 --> 01:50:18,089
Be careful.

759
01:50:20,962 --> 01:50:22,050
Excuse me.

760
01:50:22,224 --> 01:50:24,356
My commander,
General Joe Colton,

761
01:50:24,530 --> 01:50:26,620
wanted to share this with you.

762
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:49,643
I don'’t understand.

763
01:50:49,817 --> 01:50:52,471
Your father was one of us.
A Joe.

764
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,084
He was a Joe?

765
01:50:56,258 --> 01:50:58,782
You'’ll find no record
of you in there.

766
01:50:58,956 --> 01:51:01,132
He kept you off the grid
to protect you.

767
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:04,179
So why was he killed?

768
01:51:04,353 --> 01:51:06,442
Your father infiltrated
a Cobra cell.

769
01:51:06,616 --> 01:51:08,879
But they found out.

770
01:51:09,053 --> 01:51:11,403
By the time we got there,
he was dead and you were gone.

771
01:51:13,318 --> 01:51:16,670
But you should know
the intel he provided
saved thousands of lives.

772
01:51:18,410 --> 01:51:20,021
At the cost of his own.

773
01:51:20,195 --> 01:51:21,631
It was a price
he was willing to pay

774
01:51:21,805 --> 01:51:24,329
to make the world a safer place
for the rest of us.

775
01:51:24,503 --> 01:51:26,375
Safer for his son.

776
01:51:28,812 --> 01:51:31,075
He left some big shoes
to fill, your dad.

777
01:51:33,643 --> 01:51:36,559
It hasn'’t been easy finding
the right person to fill them.

778
01:51:36,733 --> 01:51:40,302
So you'’re saying
I could be a Joe?

779
01:51:40,476 --> 01:51:41,956
Anything'’s possible.

780
01:51:44,523 --> 01:51:46,874
We all make mistakes.

781
01:51:47,048 --> 01:51:49,311
It'’s what we do next
that really matters.

782
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:54,359
When you'’re ready,
Akiko knows where to find us.

783
01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:03,455
There'’s something
I need to do first.

784
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,937
Let'’s find Tommy
and bring him home.

785
01:52:53,288 --> 01:52:55,377
Something to drink
before takeoff?

786
01:53:03,951 --> 01:53:05,604
I'’m not here to kill you.

787
01:53:17,399 --> 01:53:18,966
I came to make you an offer.

788
01:53:24,275 --> 01:53:27,409
You'’ve lost an army, Tommy.

789
01:53:30,673 --> 01:53:32,283
But I can get you a better one.

790
01:53:40,465 --> 01:53:41,640
Storm Shadow.

791
01:53:47,646 --> 01:53:50,519
Call me Storm Shadow.
