[Emergency Department]


6
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
Are you alright?


7
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,600
Mr. Yuan, you're awake.


8
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,240
How could you


9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,880
treat yourself so badly?


10
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,560
You shouldn’t have pushed yourself so much.


11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
I’m fine now.


12
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,560
Su Chang,


13
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,160
see Ms. Qiao off.


14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,000
I have nothing to do.


15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,320
I’ll keep you company.


16
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,720
I’m fine.


17
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,240
There are nurses and doctors.


18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,000
You can go back.


19
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,200
Well, Ms. Qiao,


20
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
it’s not appropriate for you to stay here.


21
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,160
Let me see you off.


22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,880
I can take care of him.


23
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,040
Alright.


24
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,480
I'll come to see you tomorrow then.


25
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,280
Mr. Yuan.


26
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,600
Let me help you.


27
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,880
Where's Jiang Jun?


28
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,840
She was not here when we came.


29
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,400
How did Qiao Na know I had surgery?


30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,240
Mr. Yuan, I’ll admit it.


31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,560
She forced me to say it.


32
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,520
Please forgive me.


33
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,840
I’ll give you a chance to correct your mistake.


34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,520
Hello?


35
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,920
Jiang Jun, where are you?


36
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,920
Mr. Yuan felt bad in the hospital.


37
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,760
What happened?


38
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,000
It’s hard to explain clearly.


39
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,200
You should come here quickly.


40
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,600
Ok. I'll be there soon.


41
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,760
Excuse me!


42
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,680
Excuse me!


43
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,200
Hello,


44
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,200
how...


45
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,920
How is the patient in bed No. 45?


46
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,040
He’s fine.


47
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,480
We just changed the dressing.


48
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,560
He's up and about now.


49
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,920
You’re here.


50
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,760
You’re awake?


51
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,200
How do you feel now?


52
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,440
I haven't eaten for a day.


53
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,760
I’m hungry.


54
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,880
Peel an apple for me.


55
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,800
You’re a girl.


56
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,200
Can't you even peel apples?


57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Forget it. Stop peeling it.


58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,560
You can just feed me.


59
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,760
How can you be like this?


60
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,480
How come you’re eating it?


61
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,160
I just remembered


62
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,960
patients shouldn’t eat cold food after surgery.


63
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,440
But you can watch me eat.


64
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
How is the wound?


65
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,800
It hurts!


66
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,040
It hurts so much.


67
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,760
It hurts so much.


68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,840
Where?


69
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,080
Here.


70
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,840
Why did you want to hit me?


71
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
Because you lied to me.


72
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,840
You said you’ll be by my side


73
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,600
when I woke up.


74
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
Why were you not here?


75
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,040
Alright.


76
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,480
We’re even now.


77
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,840
I'm sorry.


78
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,960
I just knew that


79
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,240
you could actually run that fast.


80
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,320
Were you worried about me?


81
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,840
I'm not a cold-blooded monster like you.


82
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,880
I'll get worried no matter who it is, alright?


83
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,640
I’ll go ask the nurse what you can eat,


84
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,920
so you won't starve to death.


85
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,720
Why are you so eager to leave the hospital?


86
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,880
You can stay here for a few more days.


87
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,000
I won’t. I won’t.


88
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,240
If I stayed here any longer,


89
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,920
Wealth wouldn’t be able to recognize me.


90
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
Alright.


91
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,400
Give me the car key.


92
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,600
Why?


93
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,760
I’ll drive.


94
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,880
You drive?


95
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
What? You look down upon me?


96
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,360
Not that.


97
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,600
It’s just...


98
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,120
Don’t worry, Mr. Yuan.


99
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Just leave it to me.


100
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,880
I’ll make sure to send you home


101
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,160
within 20 minutes.


102
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Let’s go.


103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,360
20 minutes?


104
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,280
Slow down!


105
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,789
Be careful!


106
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,600
Jiang Jun, can you drive safely?


107
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,600
Don't disturb me!


108
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,920
I’m driving safely, alright?


109
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
So scary!


110
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,960
Jiang Jun, are you driving a rocket?


111
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,200
I’ll put up with you for now.


112
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,520
19 minutes. Perfect.


113
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,360
Are... Are you all right?


114
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,440
I’m fine.


115
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,000
I’m fine.


116
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,280
Road killer!


117
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,960
You’re so impressive!


118
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,000
I really admire you!


119
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,760
Are you abusing me indirectly?


120
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,560
No.


121
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,480
I’m praising you.


122
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,800
You just showed off your driving skills.


123
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,680
You can turn this area


124
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,040
into a barren land!


125
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,200
Seriously, Miss. Jiang,


126
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,000
where did you learn to drive a car?


127
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,520
I need to go there, too.


128
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,560
Maybe I can improve


129
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,040
my racing skills there.


130
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,040
Alright. Let’s go home.


131
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,360
Let me take it. You just got better.


132
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,800
I’m fine now.


133
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,360
You can go to work.


134
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,000
I can make breakfast myself.


135
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,400
It’s fine.


136
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,560
I’ll help you till the end.


137
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,040
Don't get too touched.


138
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,600
Look at these.


139
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,200
What are they?


140
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,560
Diced carrots.


141
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,160
Are these diced carrots?


142
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,600
You think they’re not?


143
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,040
You better let me do it.


144
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,960
Don't move.


145
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
You just had surgery.


146
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,840
Go sit there and have some rest.


147
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,120
The breakfast will be ready very soon.


148
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Then I’ll sit here


149
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,000
and wait for the nutritious breakfast you made.


150
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,720
Ok.


151
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,200
I read some recipes.


152
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,720
They said patients after surgery


153
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,560
should have soups and fluid food.


154
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,080
Have a try.


155
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,640
Ok.


156
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,640
Which one should I try first?


157
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,360
Try the chicken soup first.


158
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Ok.


159
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,840
How is it?


160
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
It’s wonderfully made.


161
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,960
The taste is imaginative.


162
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,080
Really?


163
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,640
I have stewed it for two hours.


164
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Then you should eat more. Finish them.


165
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
I’m going to work now.


166
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,240
Ok.


167
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,800
Be careful on the road.


168
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,360
How come the soup is sweet?


169
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,480
What about the fish soup?


170
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,920
Did she mistake sugar for salt?


171
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,680
I need to finish them.


172
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,080
I need to finish them.


173
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,800
I’ll just drink it like it’s milk tea


174
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,480
Morning.


175
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,840
Has Mr. Yuan got any better?


176
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,920
He’s fine. He was discharged today.


177
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,520
During these days


178
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,600
when he was in the hospital…


179
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,600
I felt really great!


180
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,800
I’ll tell him what you said just now.


181
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,000
Hello.


182
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,440
Honey, guess where I am right now.


183
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
In my heart.


184
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,720
I’m on my way back.


185
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,960
What?


186
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
How come you came back?


187
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,440
We’re having a holiday.


188
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,920
So I wanted to give you a surprise.


189
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,160
Honey,


190
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,200
I’ll have an emergency meeting later.


191
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,960
You should be good and wait for me.


192
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,520
Mr. Yuan,


193
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,200
I need your help!


194
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,960
Coming!


195
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,800
Sit here.


196
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,600
Coming!


197
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,440
Couldn’t you press the doorbell gently?


198
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,320
Mr. Yuan!


199
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,640
Mr. Yuan! Mr. Yuan!


200
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,840
Mr. Yuan!


201
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,960
You’re handsome and wise!


202
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,880
You have to help me.


203
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,240
Mr...


204
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,360
Don’t try to hug me.


205
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,640
Sit down and tell me.


206
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,480
Over there.


207
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,040
Go ahead.


208
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,680
My girlfriend is studying abroad.


209
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,080
I often went to see her before.


210
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,440
I didn’t expect she’d come back.


211
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
She said she wanted to give me a surprise.


212
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,600
Now she’s at Pudong Airport.


213
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,360
Are you trying to show off?


214
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,360
No, no, no.


215
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,520
I brought this upon myself.


216
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,200
I’m getting a taste of my own medicine.


217
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,200
I used to brag before her


218
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,960
saying I’m the ED of MH.


219
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,480
I have a Porsche.


220
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,480
I live in a high-end apartment


221
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
and have a personal assistant.


222
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,960
You dumbhead!


223
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,360
Kids shouldn’t copy others’ homework entirely.


224
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,040
What about you?


225
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,360
You copied others’ words


226
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,080
without changing anything?


227
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,520
I was wrong.


228
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,880
You dumbhead!


229
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Now you want me to clean the mess for you?


230
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,280
Mr. Yuan,


231
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,840
can we switch houses?


232
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,720
I promise


233
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,200
I’ll move out right away after she leaves.


234
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,640
I’m willing to do anything


235
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,600
for you in the future.


236
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,120
Please, Mr. Yuan!


237
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,080
If you don't want to live in my house,


238
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,480
I can book a hotel room for you.


239
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,400
I’ll cover the fees.


240
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,920
No!


241
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,080
Su Chang,


242
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,960
listen,


243
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,720
let your girlfriend live in my house.


244
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,000
I’ll help you.


245
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,600
Mr. Yuan,


246
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,720
where will you live then?


247
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Is this the only house I have?


248
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,920
You want to move next door?


249
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,640
Mr. Yuan, it's a rare opportunity.


250
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,520
You must grasp it.


251
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,800
A brewer's wife may drink of a tun.


252
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,760
The heart of a woman...


253
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,320
Leave here before I


254
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,720
change my mind.


255
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,480
Yes, Mr. Yuan!


256
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,589
Time is short.


257
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,920
Please pack up your things yourself.


258
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,109
Mr. Yuan!


259
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,829
Don’t try to hug me!


260
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,280
I won’t hug you.


261
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,640
I’m a man.


262
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,960
I'm leaving,


263
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,680
Yuan.


264
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,349
Yuan?


265
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,829
How dare you call me that? You dumbhead!


266
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,069
You dumbhead.


267
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,840
Wealth, we’re moving out.


268
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,880
Honey,


269
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,360
this place is really nice.


270
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,240
I like it very much.


271
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,680
And here. Here.


272
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,840
It’s also nice.


273
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,240
It’s a great place.


274
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,200
I like it very much.


275
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,520
Let’s go.


276
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,440
What’s wrong with you?


277
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,640
Nothing, Honey.


278
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,000
Let’s go up.


279
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,040
It’s 701, right?


280
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,480
Yes, right.


281
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,560
But why is the door open?


282
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,040
It’s...


283
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,800
This is...


284
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,840
This is my assistant.


285
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,040
Yuan Shuai.


286
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,200
Yuan.


287
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,800
Mr. Su.


288
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,120
Hello, Mr. Su.


289
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,720
I’ve packed up your things.


290
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,360
How do you want to dispose of them?


291
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,600
Throw them away.


292
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,480
Throw them away.


293
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,400
Throw them away.


294
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,480
Throw them away?


295
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Ok, Mr. Su.


296
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,960
Wait.


297
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,800
Isn’t this shirt


298
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,920
the latest model for autumn and winter?


299
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,600
And it’s brand new.


300
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,080
Why do you throw it away?


301
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,200
It’s fine.


302
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,440
We’re rich.


303
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,840
We’re rich.


304
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,120
But,


305
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
you were so thin before?


306
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,720
Honey,


307
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,280
since I got together with you,


308
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,600
my life has become very sweet.


309
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
So I’ve become fat.


310
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,600
But I’m happy.


311
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,240
How happy you are!


312
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,680
How sweet your life is!


313
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,280
How fat you are!


314
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,240
You're moving out?


315
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,200
Ms. Jiang.


316
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,040
Ms. Jiang?


317
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,000
Hello, Ms. Jiang.


318
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,120
I’m packing up things for Mr. Su.


319
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,560
Mr. Su?


320
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,120
Then she must be your girlfriend.


321
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,560
Hello.


322
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,800
I’m a colleague of Mr. Su,


323
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,760
Ms. Jiang.


324
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,520
Ms. Jiang.


325
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,400
Hello, I’m Xinxin.


326
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,680
Yuan,


327
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,800
after packing up Mr. Su's things,


328
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,840
go clean up my house as well.


329
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,240
Ok, Ms. Jiang. No problem.


330
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,760
No problem.


331
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,400
Well, we’re going in then.


332
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,920
Bye-bye.


333
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,760
Bye-bye, Mr. Su.


334
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,680
Yuan,


335
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
you’re recovering well.


336
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,560
You can move things now.


337
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,600
I had to do this. I need your help.


338
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,120
Honey,


339
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,960
your house is so well furnished.


340
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,320
Very classy, right?


341
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
Honey, it’s very classy!


342
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,960
Honey,


343
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,480
I want to give the best things to you.


344
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,160
You're so nice to me.


345
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
Well, I need to use the bathroom.


346
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,600
Ok. I’ll be back soon.


347
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,360
What did you say?


348
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,400
You... You want to live with me?


349
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,080
How can you live with me?


350
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,960
You’re a man, alright?


351
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,840
Stop! Stop!


352
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,880
So what if I’m a man?


353
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,040
I don’t quite understand.


354
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,520
It’s not just us, alright?


355
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,360
Who else is here then?


356
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,360
She!


357
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,280
She is also a girl.


358
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,280
Ok. She can stay.


359
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,240
You leave.


360
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,720
Jiang Jun, you!


361
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,200
How heartless you are!


362
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,440
How immoral you are!


363
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,720
You see,


364
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
Su Chang has worked hard


365
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,720
for me for so many years.


366
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,520
When he needed my help,


367
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,880
I lent my house to him


368
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,120
without even thinking about it.


369
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,200
What is this called?


370
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,920
This is called being grateful.


371
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,440
Not like someone.


372
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,640
I took Lin He there in time


373
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,680
during Kelang’s case.


374
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,800
I found someone


375
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,400
to repair the data in the phone


376
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,720
during Wan Shan’s case.


377
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,520
Also,


378
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,600
I rushed back to help you


379
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,480
during your meal with Ma Xiuran.


380
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,680
-Enough.
-You!


381
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,840
You’re so naggy!


382
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,400
You can live here.


383
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,200
I’ll go live with Li, alright?


384
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,960
My wound hurts so much!


385
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,240
It hurts so much!


386
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,000
So this is the way of the world.


387
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,360
I’m a sick man.


388
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,560
What if the wound breaks down


389
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,760
when I use the bathroom


390
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,720
at night?


391
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,080
My blood


392
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,000
would pour out


393
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,840
and fill the bathroom


394
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,560
until...


395
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,440
I’m drained of blood.


396
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,600
Stop pretending.


397
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,200
You’re determined


398
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,120
to live here, right?


399
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,760
Isn’t it very obvious?


400
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,880
What did you say?


401
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,480
I said it’s very natural, alright?


402
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,160
This is my house.


403
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,480
Of course I can live here when necessary.


404
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,840
Understand?


405
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,640
Very natural?


406
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,640
Where are you going?


407
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,400
I want to be alone.


408
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,200
Who is “Alone”?


409
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,400
Your sister.


410
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,120
I don’t have a sister called “Alone”.


411
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
I only have a sister called Jun.


412
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,200
Listen, don’t buy bananas anymore.


413
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,120
I don’t like bananas.


414
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,720
I like apples.


415
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,320
You should buy more apples.


416
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,400
Be gentle.


417
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,040
This is my house.


418
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,720
Who cares?


419
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,520
Kick it harder.


420
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,120
I’ll stay here anyway.


421
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,640
It’s so delicious.


422
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,420
[West World]


423
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,280
Working downstairs,


424
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,800
and sleeping upstairs.


425
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,360
It's perfect.


426
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,880
What’s inside the box?


427
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,520
Gifts.


428
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,560
Now we have a new office.


429
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,240
We need to have a sense of ritual.


430
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,480
This one is for Mr. Du.


431
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,200
It can match his mature temperament.


432
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,480
And this one is for you.


433
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,120
That one looks better.


434
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:26,840
Can I have that one?


435
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,160
No!


436
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,880
This is for your own good.


437
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,800
Think about it.


438
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,320
Our app is about love.


439
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,400
When our clients come


440
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,640
seeing our office


441
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,000
is filled with cute things,


442
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,080
they will think


443
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,960
you’re a very caring man.


444
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,320
And then they’ll trust your app more,


445
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,280
right?


446
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Alright.


447
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,880
What about...


448
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,720
Buy one and get one free.


449
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,880
It’s a good bargain, right?


450
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,520
Thank you.


451
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,440
You’re welcome.


452
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,720
What is this for?


453
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,040
This is


454
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,080
another gift I prepared


455
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,400
for our company.


456
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,080
I’ve checked the dates.


457
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,120
Tomorrow is a good day to move.


458
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,160
We can invite Jun


459
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,120
and Mr. Du here.


460
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,960
Then we can drink it.


461
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
And make a toast to West World!


462
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,760
To West World.


463
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,640
Mr. Li,


464
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,240
I’ve been doing physical work all day long.


465
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,000
Do you think you should treat me to a meal?


466
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,920
Ok.


467
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,160
Coming!


468
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,120
Your kebabs.


469
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,080
20 mutton kebabs, 10 beef kebabs,


470
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,280
10 pork kebabs, 10 gristle kebabs,


471
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,720
2 chicken wings, 2 lamb kidneys,


472
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,720
2 chicken kebabs, 4 needle mushroom kebabs.


473
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,600
Just let me know


474
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,880
if you want to order more.


475
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,720
-Enjoy. -Thank you.
-Thank you.


476
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,120
Can we eat so many kebabs?


477
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,080
I don't know.


478
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,280
I just wanted to order so many.


479
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,720
I actually wanted to order more.


480
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,320
No, no, don’t!


481
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,800
I found that


482
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,320
your way to celebrate is very special.


483
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,760
Your beer.


484
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,200
Thank you.


485
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,880
Xu Li.


486
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,920
I want to tell you something.


487
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,200
I’ve thought a lot about it.


488
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,480
Without you staying by my side,


489
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
advising me,


490
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,520
and helping me,


491
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,760
I wouldn’t have got the investment from Mr. Du.


492
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,560
So,


493
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
I've decided...


494
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,800
Oh my!


495
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,920
Is he finally getting what I meant?


496
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,800
Is he ready to confess his love for me?


497
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,360
What have you decided?


498
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,760
Hurry and tell me!


499
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,400
I've decided


500
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,240
to give 5% of West World's


501
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,360
shares to you!


502
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,560
Consider it as a technology investment.


503
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
From now on,


504
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,440
you’re my best buddy.


505
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,200
Come on, bro.


506
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,200
Fine.


507
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,480
I thought


508
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,160
you were going to...


509
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,360
Forget it.


510
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,280
I don’t care about the shares.


511
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,560
You can keep them.


512
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,520
Alright.


513
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,600
But


514
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,520
considering the current speed of development,


515
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,160
the 5% of shares


516
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,560
will become 500 thousand yuan,


517
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,720
or even


518
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,600
5 million yuan very soon.


519
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,240
Fine. So be it.


520
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
How much is it again?


521
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
5 million yuan.


522
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,720
I take back what I said just now.


523
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,800
I accept your gift.


524
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,440
Ok.


525
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,200
Cheers, bro.


526
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,080
To West World.


527
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,320
To West World!


528
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,200
Eat up. I’m so hungry.


529
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,240
Hurry! Eat!


530
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,360
Isn't it delicious?


531
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,560
This is the last one.


532
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,960
Very nutritious soup.


533
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,160
Done.


534
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,120
Why are you just standing there?


535
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,040
Sit down and eat.


536
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,040
You want to bribe me with just these things?


537
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,560
Bribe you?


538
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,600
Jiang Jun, you know what?


539
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,240
Your body reaction will give you away.


540
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,840
Try them.


541
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,240
How is it?


542
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,440
So delicious! How did you make it?


543
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,680
How did I make it?


544
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,880
That’s my secret.


545
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,200
You’ll know after


546
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,720
you live with me for a long time.


547
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,360
Here. Have some soup.


548
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,240
I want to discuss something with you.


549
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,680
It’s about


550
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,640
who gets to use the bed in your bedroom.


551
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,400
What do you mean, Yuan Shuai?


552
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,000
Are you going to draw a line


553
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,880
in the middle


554
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,560
and each of us


555
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,040
sleeps on our own side?


556
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,160
Am I that boring?


557
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,920
I wanted to say that


558
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,000
I should sleep in the bedroom


559
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,880
and you should sleep on the sofa.


560
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,480
Yuan Shuai,


561
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,400
don’t push your luck.


562
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,680
I already let you stay in my house.


563
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,640
Now you want to sleep in my bedroom?


564
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,400
Are you saying


565
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,960
you’ve agreed to let me live here?


566
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
I heard it.


567
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,560
Pulling tricks on me?


568
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,480
I didn’t, alright?


569
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,160
It’s just because you're too stupid.


570
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,760
Time to eat!


571
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,760
I’ll have some ribs.


572
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,720
I’ll have some sweet and sour pork…


573
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,400
Have...


574
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,240
Jiang...


575
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,560
This is mine.


576
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,480
I cooked it.


577
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,560
I cooked it.


578
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,480
This is mine.


579
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,800
I cooked it.


580
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,640
This is mine.


581
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,320
I cooked it.


582
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,720
Get away. These are all mine!


583
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,800
-I cooked them!
-You can't eat them!


584
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,720
--I cooked…
-You can’t eat them!


585
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,000
I cooked them! I…


586
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,760
All mine!


587
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,040
What’s wrong?


588
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,320
The wound is hurting? Sit down.


589
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,760
How do you feel?


590
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,240
Are you alright?


591
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,120
Are you worried about me?


592
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,240
I’ll be responsible if something


593
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,680
happens to you in my house.


594
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,040
How about this?


595
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,840
I’ll wash the dishes later.


596
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,960
You can have some rest.


597
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,760
Then I’ll make myself at home.


598
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,720
I’ll start eating.


599
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,080
I’ll have some ribs.


600
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,560
So good!


601
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,560
Then you should eat more,


602
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,960
till you’re stuffed to death.


603
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,800
I won't. I'm thin.


604
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,760
I'm done eating.


605
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,640
Have some nutritious soup.


606
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,480
I won't!


607
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,640
Have some.


608
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,000
Beg me.


609
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,400
It tastes so good!


610
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,720
So delicious.


611
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,560
I’ll eat


612
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
So delicious.


613
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,440
You’ll kiss me indirectly.


614
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,800
I can use the spoon.


615
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,710
Whatever!


616
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,320
How come you didn’t make a sound?


617
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,710
You didn't hear it, alright?


618
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,000
I thought about it.


619
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,560
I shouldn’t let a patient


620
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,520
sleep on the sofa.


621
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,600
You can sleep in the bedroom.


622
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,760
You' don’t have a fever.


623
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,160
Why are you so nice to me now?


624
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,320
You’ll let me sleep in your bed?


625
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,320
Before I change my mind,


626
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,720
you…


627
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,840
I’ll go!


628
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,840
Did you put


629
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,960
some nails on the bed?


630
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,760
You go...


631
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
I’ll go! I’ll go!


632
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,480
Locked the door?


633
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,760
I'm a girl, alright? How could you...


634
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,120
Fine.


635
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,200
I won't get angry.


636
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,520
You're a patient.


637
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,040
Getting angry will make me look older and uglier.


638
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,880
I won’t get angry.


639
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,240
I won’t get angry.


640
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,600
I'll drive you crazy.


641
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Ms. Jiang.


642
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,000
Ms. Jiang?


643
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,920
Hello, Ms. Jiang.


644
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,400
I’m packing up things for Mr. Su.


645
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,520
Mr. Su?


646
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,480
No wonder Su Chang and Assistant Yuan stuttered


647
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,640
when Ms. Jiang came back.


648
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,920
So there’s something fishy.


649
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,960
Little Sheep.


650
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,480
Crying Girl.


651
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,080
You're so clumsy.


652
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,400
You just finished one side?


653
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,120
How great it’d be


654
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,440
if you’re cute like this


655
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,120
when you're awake.


656
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Sleep well.


657
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,560
Good night.


658
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,880
Wait. Why am I happy?


659
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,400
I’m insane. I’m insane.


660
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,840
I’m insane!


661
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,280
I’m insane.


662
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:43,140
Love Is Sweet
