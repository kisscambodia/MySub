00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:25,815
Watch on kisskh.me

2
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,842
Hello, everybody.
Thanks for coming.

3
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,930
I am the Lorax. I
speak for the trees.

4
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,892
And I'd like to say a few
words, if you please.

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,603
Regarding the story that
you're about to see

6
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,731
it actually happened.
Just take it from me.

7
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,942
But there's more to this story
than what's on the page,

8
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,237
so please pay attention
while I set the stage.

9
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:18,702
We open in Thneedville, a city they
say that was plastic and fake,

10
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,704
and they liked it that way!

11
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,833
A town without nature,
not one living tree.

12
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,585
So, what happened to them?

13
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,005
Cue the music! Let's see.

14
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,391
Buzz. Buzz.

15
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:09,503
In Thneedville,
it's a brand new dawn.

16
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,883
With brand new cars
and houses and lawns.

17
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,928
Here in
Got-all-that-we-need-ville.

18
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:23,725
In Thneedville, we
manufacture our trees.

19
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:30,399
Each one is made in factories.

20
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,318
And uses 96 batteries.

21
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:39,324
In Thneedville, the
air's not so clean.

22
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,744
So we buy it fresh.

23
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,038
It comes out this machine!

24
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,916
In Satisfaction's-
guaranteed-ville.

25
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:53,422
In Thneedville, we
don't want to know.

26
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:59,511
Where the smog and
trash and chemicals go

27
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:04,057
I just went swimming,
and now I glow.

28
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,603
In Thneedville, we
have fun year round.

29
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,981
We surf and snowboard
right in town.

30
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,818
We thank the Lord
for all we've got.

31
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,697
Including this brand
new parking lot!

32
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,657
Parking lot!

33
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,953
Parking lot!

34
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,877
Oh, look, it's
Aloysius O'Hare.

35
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,422
Aloysius O'Hare.

36
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,843
The man who found a
way to sell air.

37
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,346
And became a zillionaire.

38
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,516
Hip-hip-hooray!

39
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,895
In Thneedville, we
love living this way.

40
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,649
It's like living in paradise.

41
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,777
It's perfect! And that's
how it will stay.

42
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,945
Oh, yeah!

43
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,614
Here in
Love-the-life-we-lead-ville.

44
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,491
Destined-to-succeed-ville.

45
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,368
We-are-all-agreed-ville.

46
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,829
We love it here in...

47
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,458
Thneedville!

48
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,374
Yes!

49
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,265
Oh, hi, Ted.

50
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,852
Oh, hey, Audrey. Hi.

51
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,771
Did your ball land in
my backyard again?

52
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,398
What? No.

53
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,400
A model airplane, this time.

54
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,862
Hey, do you want to
see something cool?

55
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,030
Come on.

56
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,079
Whoa!

57
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,463
Did you...

58
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,590
Did you paint this?

59
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,633
Do you like it? What?

60
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,554
Are you kidding?
This is amazing!

61
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,014
What are those?

62
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,184
Those are trees. Real ones.

63
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,479
They used to grow
all around here.

64
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,274
And people said that the
touch of their tufts

65
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,902
was softer than
anything, even silk.

66
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,738
And they smelled
like butterfly milk!

67
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,032
Wow! What does that even mean?

68
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,533
I know, right?

69
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:11,912
Oh, yeah.

70
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,582
What I want more than anything
in the whole world is to see

71
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,126
a real living tree

72
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,961
growing in my backyard.

73
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,131
So if, say... I'm just
thinking out loud here.

74
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,967
If a guy somehow
got you one...

75
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,345
I'd probably marry
him on the spot.

76
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,139
I bet that sounds crazy.
Does that sound crazy?

77
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,266
No! Not crazy.

78
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,685
Not crazy at all.

79
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,570
Ted, honey, don't
play with your food.

80
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,030
You, either, Mom.

81
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:56,665
So, Mom, do you happen to
know if there's any place

82
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,251
where I could get a real tree?

83
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,129
Ted, we already have a tree.
It's the latest model.

84
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,589
Yeah, but I mean a real one

85
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,801
that grows out of the
ground or whatever.

86
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,344
You know, a real tree.

87
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,512
Really?

88
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,432
You would rather have
some dirty, messy

89
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,101
lump of wood that just
sticks out of the ground?

90
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,561
And it does what? I don't
even know what it does.

91
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,770
What's it's purpose?

92
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,105
Look at what we've got.

93
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,525
It's the Oak-amatic. The only
tree with it's own remote.

94
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,611
Summer, autumn, winter,

95
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,946
and disco!

96
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,411
Mom? Come on, Ted. Get into it.

97
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,495
Dance with the tree.

98
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,622
Oh, it hurts, Mom. Please stop.

99
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,250
So, anyway...

100
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,210
Let's just say I need a tree.

101
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,879
Where would I go?
What do I do?

102
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,090
Then you know what? You
need to find the Once-ler.

103
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,176
The what?

104
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,514
Mom, it's not really the time for
one of your magical fables, okay?

105
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,892
That's
right, I forgot.

106
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,562
I'm old and can't even
remember to put my teeth in.

107
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,564
Stand down. That's
not what I meant.

108
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,649
No, really, I forgot my teeth.

109
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,527
Would you be a dear and
go get them for me?

110
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,155
Sure, Mom.

111
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,329
Okay, here's the deal.

112
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,540
The Once-ler is the man who knows
what happened to the trees.

113
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,918
You want one, you
need to find him.

114
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,670
The Once-ler? Mmm-hmm.

115
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,215
Okay. Grammy, is
this a real thing

116
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,674
that we're talking about now?

117
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,426
Oh, he's real all right.

118
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,553
Well, where can I find him?

119
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:40,268
Far outside of town where
the grass never grows

120
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,105
and the wind smells slow
and sour when it blows.

121
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,695
And no birds ever sing,
excepting old crows.

122
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,950
Quit doing that.

123
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,536
That's the place where
the Once-ler lives.

124
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,955
Wait, outside of town?

125
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,501
People used to say if you
brought him 15 cents,

126
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,710
a nail

127
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,881
and the shell of a great,
great, great grandfather snail,

128
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,636
he would tell you everything.

129
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,667
Hmm.

130
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,701
Mr. O'Hare, what
we've got for you

131
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,037
is something that is
going to take O'Hare Air

132
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,913
to the next level.

133
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,957
Now, Mr. O'Hare, I know
what you're thinking.

134
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,209
One, "I've gotten rich
selling people air that's"

135
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,378
"fresher than the
stinky stuff outside."

136
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,088
Two, and here is
the important one,

137
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,591
"How can I possibly
make even more money?"

138
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,593
We can tell you, sir!
We can tell you.

139
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,429
Check out this
commercial, huh?

140
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,392
Well, here goes another
lame Saturday.

141
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,729
Dude, I don't think so!

142
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Huh!

143
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,609
Hey!

144
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,363
Man!

145
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,405
Oh, yeah!

146
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,491
What!

147
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,496
Yeah!

148
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,916
O'Hare purified
air. Freshness to go.

149
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,417
Please breathe responsibly.

150
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,585
Ah?

151
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,420
Oh, my goodness.
Yeah! Love it.

152
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,923
You got to be kidding me.

153
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,967
You really think people are
stupid enough to buy this?

154
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,846
Our research shows that if you put
something in a plastic bottle,

155
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,972
people will buy it.

156
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,057
Exactly. And...

157
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,267
And what's more, when
we build a new factory

158
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,936
to make the plastic bottles,

159
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,522
the air quality is just
going to get worse.

160
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,691
Which will make people
want our air even more,

161
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,776
and drive sales where?

162
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,902
Through the roof!

163
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,657
So, in other words, the
more smog in the sky,

164
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,993
the more people will buy.

165
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,624
See, that's why he's the genius!
It even rhymes!

166
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,460
I'm aware it rhymes.

167
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,462
Coats. Big.

168
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,047
What do you two
knuckleheads want?

169
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,632
I'm in the middle
of a meeting!

170
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,636
What?

171
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,471
Why is he leaving town?

172
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,515
No one ever leaves town!

173
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,642
See what he's up to.

174
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,280
Whoa!

175
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,208
Huh?

176
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,503
Whoa! Whoa.

177
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,132
Oh, man.

178
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,652
Whoa!

179
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,445
All right.

180
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,985
Okay.

181
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,821
What the...

182
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,906
Whoa!

183
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,498
Who are you?

184
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,084
Who are you and what
are you doing here?

185
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,670
I'm Ted. I'm Ted.

186
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,506
I can't breathe. Are
you the Once-ler?

187
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,884
Oh, man. Didn't you
read the signs?

188
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,303
No one is supposed
to come here.

189
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,597
Get out of here and
leave me alone!

190
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,682
And don't let the boot
hit you on the way out.

191
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,767
The boot?

192
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,685
Hello!

193
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,770
Ow!

194
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,148
Listen! People say that if
someone brings you this stuff

195
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,233
that you will tell
them about trees.

196
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,610
No, no, no!

197
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,489
Trees?

198
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,032
Yeah, real ones.

199
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,868
You know, that grow
out of the ground?

200
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,496
Hello?

201
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,039
Sorry, it's just...

202
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,667
Well, I didn't think anyone
still cared about trees.

203
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,212
Well, that's me. The guy
who still cares. I'm here.

204
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,631
Hey! What?

205
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,175
Do you want to
know about trees?

206
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,594
About what happened to them?

207
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,723
Why they're all gone?
It's because of me.

208
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,808
Wait, what?

209
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,816
It's because of me!

210
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,571
And my invention, the Thneed.

211
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:35,118
It was an amazing product that
could do the job of a thousand.

212
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,495
All right.

213
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,789
Sounds ridiculous, but
I mean, that's cool.

214
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,958
You're darn right it was cool!

215
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,004
It all started a
long time ago.

216
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,256
Can we start not so
long ago, maybe?

217
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,549
Do you want a tree?

218
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,092
Yes, yes.

219
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,806
Then it all started a
long, long time ago.

220
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,435
I was a young man
leaving home.

221
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:04,188
Well, here I go, Mom. Off to
change the world with my Thneed.

222
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,775
I'm actually doing it!

223
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,528
Yes, but just remember, Oncie,

224
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,448
if somehow your invention
ends up a failure

225
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,700
instead of a success,

226
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,202
oh, it wouldn't
surprise me at all!

227
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,330
Nice wheels.

228
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,915
Burn!

229
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,125
Ow!

230
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,294
Yeah, "Burn!"

231
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,714
But you will see, okay? I'm
going to prove you all wrong.

232
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,257
Come on, Melvin!

233
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,260
So, there I was at
the very bottom.

234
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,637
With nothing but
a wagon, a mule,

235
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,975
and a completely irrational
sense of optimism.

236
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,065
I was searching the globe,

237
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,651
obsessed with finding the
perfect material for my Thneed.

238
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,115
But I'd had absolutely
no success.

239
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:01,120
Until one day, I found paradise.

240
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,205
Oh!

241
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,791
We're going to be
there soon, I'm sure.

242
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,125
Whoa!

243
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:19,931
This is the most
beautiful place,

244
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,016
okay, I have ever seen.

245
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,936
Oh.

246
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,562
Ta-da!

247
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,232
Whoa!

248
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,682
Yeah.

249
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,350
This is it.

250
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,106
This is the place.

251
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:15,111
These Truffula trees
are just what I need.

252
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,283
Gonna chop one down
and make my Thneed.

253
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,161
But first...

254
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,583
Now you!

255
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,628
That's great!

256
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,517
So now our friendship
can begin.

257
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,978
Hand in hand, and
wing and fin.

258
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,480
There's nothing you
and I can't do.

259
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,775
So let's all make
my dreams come true.

260
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,673
Hey, guys!

261
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,927
Come on, where is
my back-up chorus?

262
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,305
What?

263
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,892
Ah-ha! Oh.

264
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,234
Ooh!

265
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,974
Hey, hey, wait.
Wait a minute.

266
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,225
Excuse me?

267
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,894
Yeah, that's awesome.

268
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,106
Feeding junk food to forest
animals? That's great.

269
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,400
But, uh, is there
a musical number

270
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,901
where you show me
how to get a tree?

271
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,361
Because I would love
to hear that one.

272
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,364
Oh, yes. Right after the
musical number about the kid

273
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,283
who kept interrupting
the story,

274
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,201
and was never
heard from again.

275
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,329
Right, got it. Proceed.

276
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,374
All right, here we go.

277
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,794
About to make a Thneed,
about to change the world.

278
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,578
Check it out, guys...

279
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,080
Where did everybody go?

280
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,090
Little did I know that by
chopping down that tree

281
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:28,095
I had just summoned a mystical
creature as old as time itself.

282
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,558
The legendary,
slightly annoying

283
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,852
guardian of the forest.

284
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,229
The Lorax.

285
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,764
Hey! Whoo!

286
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,684
Did you chop down this tree?

287
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,145
Uh... No.

288
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,522
Who did it?

289
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,441
What's that?

290
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,444
I think he did it.

291
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,364
Leave! Vacate the premises!

292
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,575
Take your ax and get out!

293
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,036
And who are you?

294
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:01,332
I'm the Lorax! Guardian
of the forest.

295
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,417
I speak for the trees.

296
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,505
So you're telling me,
you just didn't see me

297
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,465
magically appear
out of that stump?

298
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,592
With all the lightning
and thunder and stuff.

299
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,760
You didn't see any of that?

300
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,721
No, but that sounds amazing.
Can I see some of that?

301
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,892
Uh, yeah, I could show you.
But that's not how it works.

302
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,352
Okay. Um...

303
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,978
Didn't really happen.

304
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,773
Oh, I know what you want!

305
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:31,403
I've got one of these for the
cutest little guy I ever saw!

306
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,032
Yummy, yummy, yummy,
yummy, yummy...

307
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,160
How dare you! Give me that!

308
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,120
Mmm.

309
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,373
I'm going to eat this,

310
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,625
but I am highly
offended by it.

311
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,551
What are you... Hey, Mustache!
Will you stop that?

312
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,096
What's your deal, man?

313
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,431
Time for you to go, Beanpole!
Pull them right out.

314
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,124
Just going to put them right
back in. We can do this all day.

315
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,441
Stop right there! Stop it!

316
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:15,948
So you would hammer one of
nature's innocent creatures?

317
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,826
What? No!

318
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,912
I would never hit this little
guy. You, on the other hand,

319
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,205
I would gladly pound you

320
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,040
and your mustache
into the ground!

321
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:30,004
Behold! The intruder
and his violent ways.

322
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,257
Shame on you. For shame!

323
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,385
All right, you know what?
That's it!

324
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,387
You listen to me,
you furry meatloaf.

325
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,973
I'm going to chop down as
many trees as I need. Okay?

326
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,392
Newsflash! Not going anywhere!

327
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,520
End of story.

328
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,981
Then you leave me no choice.

329
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:56,113
If you're not gone by the time
the sun sets on this valley,

330
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,867
all the forces of nature
will be unleashed upon you

331
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:05,080
and curse you until
the end of your days!

332
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:09,084
You have been warned.

333
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,468
Thanks. Yeah, okay.

334
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,887
You have been warned.

335
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,223
But I didn't listen
to his warning.

336
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,392
And you won't believe
what happened that night.

337
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,560
What?

338
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,979
If you want to hear more,
come back tomorrow.

339
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,565
Hey, wait, wait! Tomorrow?

340
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,733
Whoa!

341
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,610
Whoa-ho-ho.

342
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,986
Are you serious right now?

343
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,697
Ah! You live in the
middle of nowhere!

344
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,367
It stinks out here. Don't
make me come back!

345
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,078
I guess you don't really want
to hear the rest of the story.

346
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:50,959
No, no.

347
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,962
I do. I really do. I want to
hear the story. I just...

348
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,174
Nah! You don't have
what it takes. Goodbye.

349
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,802
Wait, wait! I have
what it takes.

350
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,683
It's all right. It's
okay, I'll come back.

351
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,934
It's no problem.

352
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,353
See, here I am, leaving.
Walking away now.

353
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,564
I'll see you tomorrow.

354
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,358
Mmm.

355
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,737
Maybe. Just maybe.

356
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,289
What did you wish for, Audrey?

357
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,782
Well, I would
love to tell you,

358
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:34,795
but, sadly, according to the
universal wish laws, I cannot.

359
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,298
I know what
she wished for.

360
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,146
Was it, perhaps...

361
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,149
This?

362
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,826
Ted, you didn't.

363
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:09,163
Oh, no. I totally did.

364
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,166
Happy birthday, Audrey.

365
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,127
Kiss him! Kiss him!

366
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,475
Ted.

367
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,893
Ted. Tedster. Huh!

368
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,188
You're kissing the
cereal again, hon. What?

369
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,191
I just... I like this cereal.

370
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,525
What one is this? Yeah!

371
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,235
Okay.

372
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,030
Well, I'll make sure to buy
extra next time for you.

373
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,949
All right, cool. Hey, I got to
run. I got to go do a thing.

374
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,701
So, I'll see you guys.

375
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,912
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

376
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,747
You're not going
anywhere, young man.

377
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,208
It's Sunday. You
know what that means?

378
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,294
Family time, and we're
all playing board games!

379
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,378
But...

380
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,673
Hmm.

381
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,091
Mmm?

382
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,927
Oh, man.

383
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,929
Mom, seriously, every turn?

384
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,639
Hey, back off!

385
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,433
Ooh!

386
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,728
No. Okay! Family time is over.

387
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:18,065
It is now personal time.
I'll be in my room.

388
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,902
Okay, dear. Have fun.

389
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,782
I knew I could break her.

390
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,116
Go. Huh?

391
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,368
Go see him!

392
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,786
Oh, yeah!

393
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,249
You rule! Thank you, Grammy.

394
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,838
Whoa!

395
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,646
Hey! Ted, right?

396
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,233
Um, Mr. O'Hare?

397
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,695
So, I hear you have become
interested in trees.

398
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,446
What's that all about?

399
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,656
Oh. Um...

400
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,492
Where did you hear that?

401
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,660
Oh.

402
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,537
Teddy, there's not much
that goes on in Thneedville

403
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,372
that I don't know about.

404
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,293
Here's the deal, I make a living
selling fresh air to people.

405
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,962
Trees? They make it for free.

406
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,882
So, when I hear people
talking about them,

407
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,468
I consider it kind of a
threat to my business.

408
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,346
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

409
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,515
You listen to me, boy.

410
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,144
Don't go poking around in
things you don't understand

411
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,354
or I'll be your
worst nightmare.

412
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,399
I'm Frankenstein's head
on a spider's body!

413
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,651
Yeah, um...

414
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,898
Okay, my mom is expecting me.
So, I'm just going to...

415
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,659
Of course, of course. Now, go
back to your family game time.

416
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,537
Grandma just
finished her turn.

417
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,497
How did you know?

418
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,626
Please. I have
eyes everywhere.

419
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,673
Huh!

420
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,176
You got a beautiful
town here, Ted.

421
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,721
Lots of fun stuff to occupy
your short attention span.

422
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,015
Why, I can't think
of any reason

423
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:19,853
you would ever want to go
outside of town again.

424
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,938
Ever.

425
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,906
Okay! Good talk.
Really good talk.

426
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,224
Oh, no.

427
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,184
Look out!

428
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,233
Hey, man? You know, you need
to change that door bell.

429
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,236
Oh, you missed me. What?

430
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:13,657
You're already back. Clearly,
you missed me a little. Right?

431
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:17,536
No, I didn't. I'm just here
to hear the end of the story.

432
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,413
Why are you so interested
in trees anyway?

433
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,914
Why aren't you
like other kids,

434
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,333
break dancing and
wearing bell-bottoms,

435
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,460
and playing the Donkey Kongs?

436
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,423
Yeah, right, right.
I don't know.

437
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:34,302
Uh, I just thought it would be kind
of cool to have one, you know?

438
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,595
Huh?

439
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,305
It's a girl, isn't it?

440
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,349
What? No!

441
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,352
Really? Because when a guy
does something stupid once,

442
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,062
well, that's because
he's a guy.

443
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,565
But if he does the same
stupid thing twice,

444
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,568
it's usually to
impress some girl.

445
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,361
Hey, she is not some girl!

446
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,531
She's a woman, in high school.

447
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,784
And she loves trees. And
I'm going to get her one.

448
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,244
Aw!

449
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:03,331
How nice to see someone so
undeterred by things like reality.

450
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,541
Thank you.

451
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,668
All right, but where
did we leave off?

452
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,567
Now that's a Thneed.

453
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,361
Nothing unmanly about knitting.
No, sir.

454
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,676
Look at that...

455
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,181
Oh! Who taught you guys
how to steal a bed?

456
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,646
Shh!

457
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,668
Okay, nice and easy.

458
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,886
Nice work, you guys. Couldn't
have done it without you.

459
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,725
You got to be kidding me.
Can he swim?

460
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,644
Of course he can't swim!

461
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,772
Hang on, Pipsqueak! I'm
coming to get you!

462
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,320
Hey, you fishies!
Stop that bed!

463
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,119
Whoo! Whoo!

464
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,584
Jump, jump!

465
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,752
Come on, get up there.
Come on.

466
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,964
Go, go! A little bit more!
A little bit more!

467
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,302
Now what?

468
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,221
Mmm-mmm.

469
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,640
Get up there.

470
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,103
Okay, Pipsqueak,
give me your hand.

471
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,468
Come on, reach out
for the Lorax.

472
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,443
Where did you go?

473
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,864
Bar-ba-loots.

474
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,457
Oh, that's bad.

475
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,630
Hey, Beanpole, wake up!

476
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,016
What's happening? Where am I?

477
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,019
Hey! We got trouble, and
it's coming up fast!

478
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,357
Whoo!

479
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,775
We're in a river!

480
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,378
Whew!

481
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,675
Oh, no.

482
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,346
Just do something!

483
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,182
Help is on the way!

484
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,020
No, no!

485
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,773
Just a minute!

486
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,087
Oh, no!

487
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,217
Wake up! Wake up!

488
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,554
Yuck!

489
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,727
Clear!

490
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,061
Ah!

491
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,691
I was heading into the light,

492
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,776
and you pulled me right
back and here I am!

493
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,278
You saved my life!

494
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,406
Yeah, I know. Well, no,
it's not that big a deal.

495
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,657
It is a big deal!

496
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:51,536
Look, I almost went over
that waterfall! Wait...

497
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,248
On my bed. How did my
bed get in the river?

498
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,876
Uh... About that...

499
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,505
Actually... I put your
bed in the water.

500
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,090
I didn't mean you any harm.

501
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,093
I just wanted to
calmly float you away.

502
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,139
Look, everyone here
needs the trees

503
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,974
and you're chopping them down!

504
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:17,270
So, we've got a big problem.

505
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,277
All right, look.

506
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:28,907
I hereby swear that I will
never chop down another tree.

507
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,659
I promise.

508
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,497
Thank you. But I'm going
to keep my eye on you.

509
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,916
Good. Now, I've got
a big day tomorrow

510
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,001
so I'm going to
get some sleep.

511
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,090
Right after I find my bed.

512
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:06,903
Ow!

513
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,030
Okay, what are you...

514
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,492
Question, what are
they doing here?

515
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,622
And follow up, if I may,
what are you doing here?

516
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,834
Well, after the
incident last night,

517
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,670
we found one of your socks
and came here to return it.

518
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,506
But when we got here,
you were asleep. What?

519
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,552
Ew! Exactly. And sleeping
is the body's way

520
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,929
of telling other
people to go away.

521
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:36,099
I know, but you
looked so cozy.

522
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,894
And it was cold outside, and we
just fell asleep. No harm done.

523
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,356
"No harm done"? "No harm done"?
Okay.

524
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,319
Okay, I put my lips on those.
Well, I used to, anyway.

525
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,906
Ew.

526
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,159
Did you just... In my bowl!

527
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,247
Why do you have one of these?

528
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,458
You don't even
have a mustache.

529
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,752
Okay, that's it!

530
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,838
What? I thought we made
a deal last night.

531
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,339
Yes, we did.

532
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,675
And I said I wouldn't
chop down any more trees.

533
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,802
And I said I was going
to keep an eye on you.

534
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,971
I'm starving. What's
for breakfast?

535
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,100
Breakfast is overrated.

536
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,272
You know what? I got work to do.
Yeah.

537
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:28,693
I got to go into town
and sell my Thneed.

538
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,696
You chopped down
one of my trees

539
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,448
to make that piece of garbage?

540
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,574
Look at that...

541
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:39,412
"Garbage"? Oh, no. Oh, no!
You do not get it.

542
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,123
This is a
revolutionary product

543
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,459
that will change the
world as we know it.

544
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,544
It has a million uses!

545
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:50,340
Look at this. It's a swimsuit!

546
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:53,009
Mud tracked all over your
floor by uninvited guests?

547
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,137
Well, the Thneed sure
comes in handy for that!

548
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,640
But wait, there's more!

549
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,517
Thanks to it's
all-natural microfibers,

550
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,936
the Thneed is super-absorbent!

551
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,604
It also works as a hat.

552
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,607
Of course, you probably
want to wring it out first.

553
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,984
Go ahead, knock yourself out.

554
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,612
But nobody is going
to buy that thing.

555
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,239
Good to know.

556
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:18,785
Well, fortunately, you are not
the target market, weirdo.

557
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,411
You're bringing a guitar?

558
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,497
Oh, yeah. I got a
little jingle.

559
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,041
I'm gonna blow some minds,
gonna sell some Thneeds!

560
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,292
Yeah.

561
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,048
Everybosy
needs a Thneed.

562
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,842
A fine thing that
all people...

563
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,762
Sit down, go on.

564
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,723
Unfortunately, I didn't
sell it the first day.

565
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,725
The Thneed is good.

566
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,852
The Thneed is great...

567
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,020
Hey!

568
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,942
Or the second day.

569
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,319
Hey!

570
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,030
Or the third, or
fourth, or fifth day.

571
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,409
Okay, that one hit
the tender spot.

572
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,828
Until finally...

573
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,413
That's it! You know what?

574
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,790
I'm done with this thing.

575
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,667
Aw.

576
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,211
My family was right. I quit!

577
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,722
Hey. Cool hat.

578
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,308
Oh, my gosh! I
totally want one.

579
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,768
That thing makes
me like you more.

580
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,155
Hey! Where's your Thneed,
did you sell it?

581
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:40,199
Hey. No, no. Didn't sell it.

582
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,077
Turns out, it's ahead
of it's time, I guess.

583
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:46,539
Hey, you gave it your best shot.
Right? What more can you do?

584
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,791
Come on, take a seat,
we'll deal you in.

585
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,460
What are we playing?

586
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:54,297
I'm playing poker. He's playing
Go Fish. And I think he's hungry.

587
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,050
Oh.

588
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,221
Pancake,
the pancake.

589
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,058
Up!

590
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,439
Who is up for ninths?

591
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,400
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

592
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,736
Whoa!

593
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,404
All right, pass them over.

594
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,947
Yeah, see?

595
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,075
What's going on?

596
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,044
Oh, no. That's a
lot of people.

597
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,805
Everybosy
needs a Thneed.

598
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,308
A fine thing that
all people need.

599
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,895
The Thneed is good
The Thneed is great.

600
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:56,317
Let's hope we're not too late.

601
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,321
It's a super trendy hat.

602
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:04,283
It's a tightrope
for an acrobat.

603
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,995
A net for catching
butterflies.

604
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:13,126
A thing we use for exercise.

605
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:18,214
Everybody needs a Thneed.

606
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,300
A fine thing that
all people need.

607
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,470
Everybody needs a Thneed.

608
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,348
Oh, yeah! We're in
business, baby!

609
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,059
We need a Thneed.

610
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:34,439
Mom? Hey, it's me! I told you
I was going to be a success!

611
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,400
You need to bring the whole
family here right now.

612
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,569
We're going to be rich!

613
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:44,615
What? I'm going to need all the
help I can get. Don't worry.

614
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,619
So, has he told you
how to get a tree yet?

615
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,496
Actually, no.

616
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,000
But I think he's going to get
to that part really soon.

617
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,003
Here we are. What?

618
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,005
I'll just be a minute.

619
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,010
Oh, wow. Hey, Audrey!

620
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,596
Oh, hi, Ted! What's up?

621
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,016
You know me, just cruising.
Putting out the vibe.

622
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,018
Just me and my thoughts.

623
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,646
Oh, is this the girl you're
always talking about?

624
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,190
Grandma! Stop
making things up.

625
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,984
She's even prettier than...
Okay, got to run! Bye.

626
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,114
Okay, Grammy, let's
get you home!

627
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,772
Yeah!

628
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,858
Whoa!

629
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,944
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

630
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,446
Did not wanna see that.

631
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,572
Whoa!

632
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,869
Whoa!

633
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,208
Whoa-ho-ho!

634
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,841
Hey!

635
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,138
Hey, I'm back.

636
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,598
What have you got there?

637
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,016
Yes!

638
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:38,938
Whoa!

639
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,234
Thank you, Ted.

640
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,697
Now, picture this.

641
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:53,286
Sun shining, a blue
sky, a perfect day.

642
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,167
It was all downhill
from there.

643
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,228
Whoa!

644
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,076
What a dump.

645
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,329
Hey, Aunt Grizelda!

646
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,249
Hey, Chet, check this out!

647
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,375
Go long!

648
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,961
No, Brett, that's
actually not a...

649
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,129
Okay.

650
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,006
Go long! Go long!

651
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,549
I got it! I got it!

652
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,345
Got it!

653
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,556
He totally ran into that tree!

654
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,558
Ow!

655
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,478
Oncie, is that you?

656
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,854
Mom!

657
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,692
There he is! There's my big,
suddenly successful son!

658
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,364
We always knew you would
make it, Oncie. Right?

659
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,533
Hey! I love this guy!

660
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,912
But you always said I wouldn't
amount to anything, remember?

661
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,040
Hush your mouth. I was just
trying to motivate you!

662
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,167
I am really glad that
you clarified that

663
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,212
because it actually hurt my
feelings for a really long time.

664
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,633
Anyway, you're all here, you all
work for me, and that's cool.

665
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,134
So, let's get to work.

666
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,804
Brett, Chet, set up the RV!

667
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,390
Would you stop
throwing that bear?

668
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,214
Time out. Back up. Stop. Don't move
an inch. Nobody's moving in here.

669
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,049
You got to go. Goodbye.

670
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,678
So, who invited the
giant, furry peanut?

671
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,013
You calling me a peanut, huh?

672
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,347
I'll go right up your nose!

673
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,599
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

674
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:21,976
You wouldn't hit a woman.

675
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,437
That's a woman?

676
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,273
Okay. Everyone, cool it.

677
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,400
Let's not get off on
the wrong foot here.

678
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,695
Um, family, this is my friend...
Acquaintance.

679
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:36,699
Yeah, acquaintance. Very good
acquaintance, the Lorax.

680
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,368
He speaks for the trees.
That's right.

681
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,121
And on behalf of the
trees, get out!

682
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:48,044
Will you just be nice!
This is my family.

683
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,368
And I'm going to
need their help

684
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,630
if my company is going
to get bigger. Okay?

685
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,049
Bigger?

686
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,719
Yeah, this isn't some
rinky-dink operation anymore.

687
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,055
I got plans. Big plans!

688
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:03,684
A vision of a world filled with
Thneeds. It's going to be huge!

689
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,229
Which way does a tree fall?

690
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,065
Uh, down?

691
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,193
A tree falls the way it leans.

692
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:15,654
Be careful which way you lean.

693
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,834
I mean, look at this.
It's amazing.

694
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,587
I am so proud of me.

695
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,341
Oncie, we've got us
a little problem.

696
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,926
Problem?

697
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,260
Mmm-hmm.

698
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,639
See, we're not making
Thneeds fast enough.

699
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:45,017
Harvesting the tufts
takes too long!

700
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,944
Well, what else can we do?

701
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:59,240
Well, and this
just came to me,

702
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,535
we could always start
chopping down the trees.

703
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,161
What?

704
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,206
Now you're thinking. That
would speed things up!

705
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,125
But... No "but" s, Oncie.

706
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,751
You're running a business now.

707
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,670
You have to do what's
best for the company,

708
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,213
and your momma.

709
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:20,010
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt
to chop down a few trees.

710
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,598
You've made me so proud, Oncie.
Come here!

711
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,518
Hey! I love this guy!

712
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,614
No! No, no, no! Stop it!
Please, stop.

713
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,909
Take that, you stupid tree!

714
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,250
Where do you think
you're going?

715
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,628
Excuse me, sir. I need
to talk with your boss.

716
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,215
Oh, I'm sorry,

717
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,552
but Mr. Once-ler's not
seeing anyone right now.

718
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:02,928
Yeah, well, he'll see me.
So...

719
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,597
Hey, keep your paws off me!

720
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,307
Give me a reason, Shorty.

721
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,350
Hey, you broke your promise.

722
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,768
You're better than this.

723
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,938
You gotta stop! This is bad!

724
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,608
Have a nice day!

725
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,321
Bad?

726
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,699
I'm not bad, I'm the good guy
here. He just doesn't get it.

727
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,784
Do you think I'm bad?

728
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,494
Thank you!

729
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,456
I mean, something good
finally happens to me,

730
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,959
and he just has to come along
and rain on my parade.

731
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,461
What's his problem?

732
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,087
See?

733
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,468
Yeah, bad! Right.

734
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,815
How bad can I be?

735
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,984
I'm just doin' what
comes naturally.

736
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,487
How bad can I be?

737
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,906
I'm just following my destiny.

738
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,450
How bad can I be?

739
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,827
I'm just doin' what
comes naturally.

740
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,247
How bad can I be?

741
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,374
How bad can I possibly be?

742
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,917
Well, there's a
principle in nature.

743
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,210
Principle in nature.

744
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,337
That almost every
creature knows.

745
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,870
Called survival of the fittest.

746
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,048
Survival of the fittest.

747
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,717
And check it, this
is how it goes.

748
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,011
The animal that wins
gotta scratch and fight.

749
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,930
And claw and bite and punch.

750
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,933
And the animal that doesn't
Well, the animal that doesn't.

751
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:35,729
Winds up someone else's
La-la-la-la lunch.

752
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,190
Munch, munch, munch, munch,
munch I'm just sayin'

753
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,859
How bad can I be?

754
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,153
I'm just doin' what
comes naturally.

755
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,447
How bad can I be?

756
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,033
I'm just following my destiny.

757
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,786
How bad can I be?

758
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,955
I'm just doin' what
comes naturally.

759
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,416
How bad can I be?

760
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,710
How bad can I possibly be?

761
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,295
There's a principle
in business.

762
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,421
Principle in business.

763
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,464
That everybody knows is sound.

764
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,259
It says the people with the
money People with the money.

765
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,553
Make this ever-loving
world go round.

766
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,180
So I'm biggering my company
I'm biggering my factory

767
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,505
I'm biggering my
corporate sign.

768
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,641
Bigger, bigger!

769
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,227
Everybody out there You
take care of yours

770
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:19,523
I'll take care of
mine-mine-mine-mine-mine.

771
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,650
Shake that bottom line.

772
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,652
Let me hear you say
Smogulous Smoke!

773
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:24,737
Smogulous Smoke!

774
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,155
Schloppity-Schlopp!

775
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,364
Schloppity-Schlopp!

776
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,659
Complain all you want It's never,
ever, ever, ever gonna stop.

777
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,869
Stop!

778
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,663
Come on, how bad
can I possibly be?

779
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,124
How bad can I be?

780
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,501
I'm just building the economy.

781
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,171
How bad can I be?

782
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,381
Just look at me
petting this puppy.

783
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,842
How bad can I be?

784
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,345
A portion of proceeds
goes to charity.

785
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,722
How bad can I be?

786
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,767
How bad could I possibly be?
Let's see!

787
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,271
All the customers are buying.

788
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,360
And the money's multiplying.

789
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,781
And the PR people are lying.

790
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,203
And the lawyers are denying.

791
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,582
Who cares if a few
trees are dying?

792
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,545
This is all so gratifying!

793
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,798
How bad?

794
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:31,345
How bad can this possibly be?

795
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,012
So, how are things?

796
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,682
What are you doing here?

797
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,602
Happy yet? You fill that
hole deep down inside you?

798
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,855
Or do you still need more?

799
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,774
Look, if you've got a problem
with what I'm doing,

800
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:30,487
why haven't you used your
quote-unquote powers to stop me?

801
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:35,033
I told you, that's
not how it works.

802
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:38,162
Right, I forgot.
You're a fraud.

803
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:41,081
I need you to get out. Now!

804
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,126
Why? Do I make you
uncomfortable?

805
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,086
Remind you of the
promises you made?

806
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,130
The man you used to be?

807
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,298
You know what?

808
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:52,759
You can just shut your mustache.
My conscience is clear.

809
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,636
I have done nothing illegal.

810
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,264
I have my rights, and I
intend to keep on biggering

811
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,476
and biggering, and turning more
Truffula trees into Thneeds.

812
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,855
And nothing is
going to stop me!

813
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,081
Well, that's it.

814
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,250
The very last one.

815
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,837
That may stop you.

816
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:51,693
Somebody sure made a
bundle on that thing.

817
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:55,197
I wonder what the next million
dollar invention's going to be.

818
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,164
Yeah, I wonder...

819
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:18,595
Son, you have let me down.

820
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,640
Brett, you are now
my favorite child.

821
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,828
Hey, look, I don't
want any trouble.

822
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:46,957
And you won't get any.
Not from them.

823
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,836
Thanks to you and your hacking,
and smogging and glupping,

824
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,921
they can't live here anymore.

825
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,931
So, I'm sending them off.

826
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,433
Hopefully, they'll
be able to find

827
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,518
a better place out
there somewhere.

828
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,398
Melvin?

829
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,943
Melvin...

830
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,321
Hey, Pipsqueak...

831
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:22,909
Hey...

832
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,526
So, this is really
all your fault.

833
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,444
You destroyed everything.

834
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,446
Yes.

835
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,074
And each day since
the Lorax left,

836
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:47,285
I've sat here regretting
everything I've done,

837
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:51,832
staring at that
word, "unless,"

838
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,585
and wondering what it meant.

839
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,795
But now I'm thinking...

840
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,005
Well, maybe you're the reason

841
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,258
the Lorax left
that word there.

842
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:04,594
Me? Why would he
leave that for me?

843
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:08,140
Because unless someone like
you cares a whole awful lot,

844
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,392
nothing is going
to get better.

845
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,145
It's not.

846
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,582
The last Truffula seed.

847
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,877
You need to plant it, Ted.

848
01:02:37,236 --> 01:02:40,446
Yeah, but, nobody cares
about trees anymore.

849
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:42,114
Then make them care.

850
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:45,451
Plant the seed in the middle of
town, where everyone can see.

851
01:02:45,869 --> 01:02:48,371
Change the way things are.

852
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,790
I know it may seem small
and insignificant,

853
01:02:50,874 --> 01:02:53,084
but it's not about what it is,

854
01:02:53,418 --> 01:02:55,461
it's about what it can become.

855
01:02:55,837 --> 01:02:57,046
That's not just a seed,

856
01:02:57,798 --> 01:03:00,258
any more than
you're just a boy.

857
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:09,850
I won't let you down.

858
01:03:11,645 --> 01:03:13,145
I know.

859
01:03:55,814 --> 01:03:56,897
Hey, Audrey!

860
01:03:57,357 --> 01:03:58,524
Audrey!

861
01:03:59,526 --> 01:04:00,568
Ted?

862
01:04:00,902 --> 01:04:02,820
What are you doing?
Meet me at my house.

863
01:04:03,113 --> 01:04:04,155
Wait, but...

864
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:05,823
My house, okay?

865
01:04:07,701 --> 01:04:09,243
Got to plant the seed.

866
01:04:09,328 --> 01:04:12,121
Okay, we're going
to need water.

867
01:04:12,581 --> 01:04:14,248
And uh, something to dig with.

868
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,125
Um, what do I have... Ted?

869
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,586
Mom, I'm busy, Mom.

870
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:20,310
Theodore Wiggins, get
down here right now,

871
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,340
and I am not kidding with you!

872
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,057
Ted, I would like you
to meet Mr. O'Hare,

873
01:04:31,141 --> 01:04:33,559
the most powerful man in town.

874
01:04:35,062 --> 01:04:36,687
There he is!

875
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:37,980
Hello, Ted.

876
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,982
Uh...

877
01:04:40,067 --> 01:04:42,818
Hi. Isn't he clever, Mr. O'Hare?

878
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,863
He knows his own
name and everything.

879
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:50,451
You know what I would love
right now, Mrs. Wiggins?

880
01:04:50,661 --> 01:04:52,620
A delicious cookie.

881
01:04:54,456 --> 01:04:55,581
Wonderful.

882
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:57,583
Teddy and I'll stay
here and talk.

883
01:04:57,668 --> 01:05:00,378
Sure, why don't you go
ahead and adopt him?

884
01:05:01,088 --> 01:05:04,548
I'm just kidding. That was
a joke. I was just joking.

885
01:05:05,509 --> 01:05:07,134
I'll get your cookie.

886
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,554
I know you have it, Ted.

887
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:12,848
So, let's put an end to
this nonsense, shall we?

888
01:05:14,351 --> 01:05:15,768
Hand it over.

889
01:05:15,852 --> 01:05:17,019
I'm sorry...

890
01:05:17,479 --> 01:05:19,271
I don't know what
you're talking about.

891
01:05:19,356 --> 01:05:21,107
Really? Well, then...

892
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:23,651
I guess you wouldn't mind
us checking your room.

893
01:05:23,735 --> 01:05:24,735
No, no, no!

894
01:05:24,861 --> 01:05:26,821
Morty! McGurk! Find the seed!

895
01:05:26,905 --> 01:05:28,197
No, you can't go up there!

896
01:05:28,281 --> 01:05:29,990
Guys, this is ridiculous.
Stop!

897
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,035
Hey!

898
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,870
No, you can't come in my room!

899
01:05:36,123 --> 01:05:37,206
Find it!

900
01:05:43,213 --> 01:05:44,505
Find it!

901
01:05:45,298 --> 01:05:46,674
What is going on here?

902
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:50,469
This doesn't involve you!
Get back downstairs!

903
01:05:50,554 --> 01:05:51,971
Excuse me, down there!

904
01:05:52,055 --> 01:05:54,390
I don't care who you are,
you little crazy baby-man!

905
01:05:54,474 --> 01:05:57,810
Get out of my house now.
This is outrageous.

906
01:05:57,894 --> 01:06:00,146
Fine. Sorry.

907
01:06:00,605 --> 01:06:03,524
Must have been a misunderstanding.
We'll be leaving now.

908
01:06:03,608 --> 01:06:06,360
And my apologies, Ted.

909
01:06:08,989 --> 01:06:10,364
You be safe.

910
01:06:12,951 --> 01:06:14,535
Mind telling me
what's going on here?

911
01:06:14,619 --> 01:06:16,245
The seed! Where is it?

912
01:06:16,329 --> 01:06:17,371
Seed?

913
01:06:18,915 --> 01:06:19,999
Where's Grammy?

914
01:06:23,003 --> 01:06:24,170
It's alive!

915
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,759
I remember you.

916
01:06:30,677 --> 01:06:32,511
Ted, what...

917
01:06:40,479 --> 01:06:41,979
Audrey!

918
01:06:44,024 --> 01:06:46,192
Hey, did you want to...
Well, okay!

919
01:06:47,152 --> 01:06:49,153
Ted, what is this about?

920
01:06:49,529 --> 01:06:51,363
It's about this.

921
01:06:52,032 --> 01:06:53,324
Wait, wait, wait.

922
01:06:53,408 --> 01:06:56,243
Is that... Yes. The
last Truffula seed.

923
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:58,287
And you're going to help me plant
it right in the middle of town

924
01:06:58,371 --> 01:07:00,206
where everyone can see it.

925
01:07:00,457 --> 01:07:02,208
I could just kiss
you right now!

926
01:07:06,171 --> 01:07:07,338
We don't have time for that.

927
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:09,548
I don't know, we
have a little time.

928
01:07:11,009 --> 01:07:13,719
But, you know what, let's just
go. Let's go. Forget about it.

929
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:43,123
Maniac! Hey!

930
01:07:45,502 --> 01:07:46,502
Ah!

931
01:07:48,755 --> 01:07:49,797
Here it comes!

932
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:54,844
I'm going for it.

933
01:08:12,779 --> 01:08:14,405
Oh, hello!

934
01:08:27,335 --> 01:08:29,545
Ted, big scary blimp coming.

935
01:08:41,182 --> 01:08:42,182
Whoa!

936
01:08:42,767 --> 01:08:45,102
You won't get away
with this, boy!

937
01:08:45,478 --> 01:08:46,562
Bam!

938
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,782
Go faster, you idiot!

939
01:08:59,868 --> 01:09:00,910
Yeah!

940
01:09:01,328 --> 01:09:03,203
Step on it, Ted!

941
01:09:03,496 --> 01:09:04,538
Whoa!

942
01:09:14,132 --> 01:09:15,966
You're fired!

943
01:09:17,093 --> 01:09:19,261
Whoa! Ted, look out!

944
01:09:22,891 --> 01:09:25,893
Nobody beats Aloysius O...
Ted...

945
01:09:37,447 --> 01:09:38,989
This is not good.

946
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:40,908
How's it doing?

947
01:09:47,916 --> 01:09:48,916
Whoa-ho-ho!

948
01:09:51,628 --> 01:09:52,670
Loser!

949
01:09:52,754 --> 01:09:54,713
Oh, really?

950
01:09:56,341 --> 01:09:57,925
Oh, no. The seed!

951
01:10:01,012 --> 01:10:02,680
Get that seed!

952
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:10,813
Hang on! Here we go!

953
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:14,984
Grammy!

954
01:10:23,201 --> 01:10:25,828
Seriously, how cool
is your grandma?

955
01:10:33,253 --> 01:10:34,336
No!

956
01:10:37,882 --> 01:10:39,091
Come on!

957
01:10:39,759 --> 01:10:40,926
Yeah, that's right.

958
01:10:41,344 --> 01:10:42,469
There it is!

959
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:54,940
Hey! Watch the road,
you meathead!

960
01:10:55,108 --> 01:10:56,108
Ah!

961
01:11:02,323 --> 01:11:03,323
Hey, ow, ow!

962
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,409
Oh, come on!

963
01:11:15,336 --> 01:11:16,420
What the...

964
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:20,299
Get it unstuck,
get it unstuck!

965
01:11:22,469 --> 01:11:24,094
Bring it on, Teddy!

966
01:11:25,221 --> 01:11:26,889
You don't have the guts!

967
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:28,724
Ted!

968
01:11:36,232 --> 01:11:37,858
Grammy!

969
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:44,323
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

970
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:48,160
Hey, hey, hey!

971
01:11:48,244 --> 01:11:49,661
Hey! It's Mr. O...

972
01:11:52,123 --> 01:11:53,540
Take that, shorty!

973
01:12:11,267 --> 01:12:13,477
Okay, we have to get
this in the ground.

974
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:16,271
But where? There's
no dirt anywhere.

975
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:21,443
No, Grammy...

976
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,281
Hey, get out of there!

977
01:12:29,869 --> 01:12:30,869
Ah!

978
01:12:33,873 --> 01:12:34,957
Hey!

979
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:38,168
What?

980
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:42,131
See, what did I tell you?
Easy. Huh?

981
01:12:43,424 --> 01:12:45,050
Hey, they broke O'Hare's head!

982
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,344
What do you think
you're doing, kid?

983
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,056
Um, I'm looking for a
place to plant a tree.

984
01:12:51,141 --> 01:12:52,141
A real one.

985
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:53,767
Why would we need a tree?

986
01:12:53,852 --> 01:12:56,186
Exactly.

987
01:12:58,815 --> 01:13:00,065
Oh, man.

988
01:13:00,733 --> 01:13:01,817
Folks...

989
01:13:02,527 --> 01:13:06,238
The last thing you want
around here is trees.

990
01:13:06,322 --> 01:13:08,073
They're filthy!

991
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:13,954
Spewing that sticky, nasty
sap all over the place.

992
01:13:15,165 --> 01:13:19,126
They bring poisonous
ants and stinging bees.

993
01:13:19,252 --> 01:13:20,752
Hey! Ouch.

994
01:13:20,837 --> 01:13:22,379
Think about the kids.

995
01:13:23,047 --> 01:13:27,092
And, I just thought, you
know, they make leaves!

996
01:13:27,177 --> 01:13:28,427
You know that, right?

997
01:13:28,511 --> 01:13:30,387
Then these leaves,
they just fall.

998
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:32,306
They just fall
wherever they want!

999
01:13:33,683 --> 01:13:35,851
Come on! We know why you're
really against trees.

1000
01:13:35,977 --> 01:13:38,103
Because they
produce fresh air.

1001
01:13:38,188 --> 01:13:39,438
For free!

1002
01:13:39,522 --> 01:13:41,148
Oh!

1003
01:13:41,232 --> 01:13:45,110
I am wounded! You have lied!

1004
01:13:45,195 --> 01:13:48,780
It is not a lie! It's
called photosynthesis.

1005
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:51,074
Come on. She's making that up!

1006
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:53,952
That's a made-up word, people!

1007
01:13:54,204 --> 01:13:58,040
Thneedville is perfect
just the way it is.

1008
01:13:58,124 --> 01:14:00,209
We don't need trees!

1009
01:14:00,835 --> 01:14:02,920
That boy has a seed.

1010
01:14:03,004 --> 01:14:05,756
We need to stop him!
Who's with me? Come on!

1011
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,132
O'Hare is right!

1012
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,426
Seeds will ruin us all!
Stop it!

1013
01:14:10,553 --> 01:14:13,222
Last chance, kid.
Hand it over!

1014
01:14:13,723 --> 01:14:15,057
Where do you think
you're going?

1015
01:14:15,183 --> 01:14:16,683
Come on, let's go!

1016
01:14:16,768 --> 01:14:18,810
Get in, get in!

1017
01:14:20,647 --> 01:14:22,147
Hey!

1018
01:14:22,232 --> 01:14:24,233
Stop that maniac!

1019
01:14:26,486 --> 01:14:28,570
Excuse me, excuse me.
Watch out!

1020
01:14:32,784 --> 01:14:35,661
Ted, you're going
to hit the wall!

1021
01:14:35,745 --> 01:14:37,579
Yeah. I know.

1022
01:15:02,355 --> 01:15:03,855
Wow. Did you see that?

1023
01:15:04,482 --> 01:15:06,858
Who does this kid
think he is, huh?

1024
01:15:08,444 --> 01:15:10,279
I am Ted Wiggins.

1025
01:15:10,947 --> 01:15:13,240
And I speak for the trees.

1026
01:15:13,866 --> 01:15:18,537
And the fact is, things aren't
perfect here in Thneedville.

1027
01:15:18,705 --> 01:15:20,163
And they're only
going to get worse,

1028
01:15:20,248 --> 01:15:22,541
unless we do
something about it,

1029
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:25,585
unless we change our ways.

1030
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:28,588
And we can start
by planting this!

1031
01:15:37,724 --> 01:15:40,726
Okay. Come on, now.
Everything is fine.

1032
01:15:41,602 --> 01:15:42,728
Right?

1033
01:15:42,812 --> 01:15:46,606
I say we tell this kid what
we think about that seed!

1034
01:15:49,652 --> 01:15:51,278
People, come on!

1035
01:15:55,033 --> 01:15:57,034
You! Get out there right now

1036
01:15:57,118 --> 01:16:00,996
and get these people on my
side, or else you're fired!

1037
01:16:02,332 --> 01:16:05,042
Go on, tell them
what you think.

1038
01:16:09,339 --> 01:16:12,632
You don't know
me, but my name's Cy

1039
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:17,804
I'm just the O'Hare
delivery guy.

1040
01:16:17,889 --> 01:16:22,100
But it seems like trees
might be worth a try.

1041
01:16:22,185 --> 01:16:25,520
So I say let it grow.

1042
01:16:28,858 --> 01:16:29,900
My name is Dan.

1043
01:16:30,234 --> 01:16:31,568
And my name's Rose.

1044
01:16:31,652 --> 01:16:34,363
Our son Wesley kind of glows.

1045
01:16:34,447 --> 01:16:37,240
And that's not good,
so we suppose.

1046
01:16:37,325 --> 01:16:38,992
We should let it grow.

1047
01:16:39,077 --> 01:16:41,661
Let it grow, let it grow.

1048
01:16:41,746 --> 01:16:44,373
You can't reap what
you don't sow.

1049
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:46,875
Plant a seed inside the Earth.

1050
01:16:47,377 --> 01:16:49,461
Just one way to know it's worth.

1051
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:52,422
Let's celebrate the
world's rebirth.

1052
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:54,091
We say let it grow.

1053
01:16:54,217 --> 01:16:56,551
My name's Marie,
and I am three!

1054
01:16:56,928 --> 01:16:59,721
I would really
like to see a tree

1055
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,142
I say let it grow

1056
01:17:04,227 --> 01:17:07,646
I'm Grammy Norma I'm old,
and I've got gray hair.

1057
01:17:08,147 --> 01:17:11,149
But I remember when
trees were everywhere.

1058
01:17:11,234 --> 01:17:13,819
And no one had to pay for air.

1059
01:17:13,903 --> 01:17:15,654
So I say let it grow.

1060
01:17:15,738 --> 01:17:18,323
Let it grow, let it grow.

1061
01:17:18,408 --> 01:17:21,493
Like it did so long ago.

1062
01:17:21,577 --> 01:17:23,954
It is just one tiny seed.

1063
01:17:24,038 --> 01:17:26,331
But it's all we really need.

1064
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:29,042
It's time to change
the life we lead.

1065
01:17:29,127 --> 01:17:30,919
Time to let it grow.

1066
01:17:31,003 --> 01:17:34,256
My name's O'Hare,
I'm one of you

1067
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:39,386
I live here in
Thneedville, too.

1068
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:42,806
The things you say
just might be true.

1069
01:17:43,099 --> 01:17:46,518
It could be time to start anew.

1070
01:17:46,602 --> 01:17:51,606
And maybe change
my point of view.

1071
01:17:52,275 --> 01:17:55,068
Nah! I say let it die!

1072
01:17:55,153 --> 01:17:57,362
Let it die, let it die.

1073
01:17:57,447 --> 01:17:59,197
Let it shrivel up and...

1074
01:17:59,282 --> 01:18:01,032
Come on, who's with me?

1075
01:18:01,659 --> 01:18:02,868
Nobody.

1076
01:18:03,744 --> 01:18:05,245
You greedy dirt-bag!

1077
01:18:05,329 --> 01:18:07,873
Let it grow, let it grow.

1078
01:18:07,957 --> 01:18:10,750
Let the love inside you show.

1079
01:18:11,043 --> 01:18:13,462
Plant a seed inside the Earth.

1080
01:18:13,546 --> 01:18:15,714
Just one way to know it's worth.

1081
01:18:15,798 --> 01:18:18,383
Let's celebrate the
world's rebirth.

1082
01:18:18,468 --> 01:18:22,804
We say let it grow.

1083
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:25,474
Let it grow, let it grow.

1084
01:18:25,558 --> 01:18:28,935
You can't reap what
you don't sow.

1085
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:31,188
It's just one tiny seed.

1086
01:18:31,272 --> 01:18:33,732
But it's all we really need.

1087
01:18:33,816 --> 01:18:35,984
It's time to banish
all your greed.

1088
01:18:36,068 --> 01:18:38,862
Imagine Thneedville
flowered and treed.

1089
01:18:38,946 --> 01:18:43,950
Let this be our solemn creed.

1090
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,703
Thank you, Ted.

1091
01:18:47,914 --> 01:18:51,500
We say let it grow.

1092
01:18:51,584 --> 01:18:53,418
In Thneedville.

1093
01:18:54,003 --> 01:18:57,506
We say let it grow.

1094
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:00,091
It's a brand new dawn.

1095
01:19:00,176 --> 01:19:03,595
We say let it grow.

1096
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,430
In Thneedville.

1097
01:19:05,848 --> 01:19:09,434
We say let it grow.

1098
01:19:09,519 --> 01:19:14,523
It's a brand new dawn.

1099
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:19,254
You done good, Beanpole.

1100
01:20:20,423 --> 01:20:22,132
You done good.

1101
01:20:35,771 --> 01:20:38,440
By the way, nice mustache.
