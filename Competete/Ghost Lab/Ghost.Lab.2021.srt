1
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,917
<i>Do you believe in the afterlife? </i>

2
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:46,333
<i>Do you believe ghosts are real?</i>

3
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,958
<i>Have you ever proven that your beliefs</i>

4
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:54,417
<i>aren't just nonsense</i>

5
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,292
<i>or just superstitions?</i>

6
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:11,875
<i>I'd like you all</i>

7
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,708
<i>to meet two important people</i>

8
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:16,875
<i>who will change your beliefs forever.</i>

9
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,208
Damn!

10
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,375
Damn it!

11
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,417
I-- Oh.

12
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,583
Hey, Dr. "I'm not afraid
of ghosts," you screamed so loud.

13
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:47,958
I didn't say I wasn't afraid.
I said I don't believe in them.

14
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,750
Shouldn't you be sleeping
before your shift tonight?

15
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,500
-Yeah, yeah.
-Dr. Gla. Dr. Wee.

16
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,708
-Heard about the ER case the other day?
-No.

17
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:02,792
Well, there was a third-degree burn case.

18
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,708
He felt slighted by his wife
so he tried to commit suicide by arson.

19
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:14,750
He was burnt to a crisp when he arrived
and the whole room stank like burnt flesh.

20
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,375
That's right,

21
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,958
plus, something fell on him
and split his head half open.

22
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:25,208
I heard he wailed and twisted
and turned until he died in his bed.

23
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:28,708
Damn!

24
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:35,042
-Update me if you hear more news, Joon.
-Sure.

25
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,958
What news could there be? He died.

26
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:41,667
Dude, I didn't mean that
sort of news. I meant news

27
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:44,500
of the paranormal.

28
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:47,958
You're a surgeon, not a shaman.

29
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,917
That was very funny, Dr. Wee.

30
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:54,375
Nice clapback.

31
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,750
I have to go now.

32
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,458
Madam's physio should be done.

33
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,083
<i>Dr. Ar-Jong to Room 237. Stat.</i>

34
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,375
"Ar-Jong" again!

35
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,167
<i>Dr. Ar-Jong to Room 237.</i>

36
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,250
It's "Arj-Ong."

37
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,833
They keep calling me "Ar-Jong."

38
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:19,250
Shitheads.

39
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,833
They do it in meetings too.

40
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,667
Just embrace your first-year nickname.

41
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,000
I've had it since preschool, actually.

42
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,583
OK.

43
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:30,625
Are you ready, Dr.--

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,958
"Ar-Jong"?

45
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,542
Very funny.

46
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:40,958
RATANARAJ HOSPITAL

47
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:49,667
Hi.

48
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,083
Did the physio see you today?

49
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,083
Hmm?

50
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,208
Do you feel better?

51
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,917
-Are you tired?
-Hey, Gla.

52
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,417
Oh, hey, Mai.

53
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,458
What's up?

54
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:10,000
Hey, how long
has Wee's mom been at the hospital?

55
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,125
Seven years? Eight?

56
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:15,750
He studied medicine
because of his mom's illness.

57
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,542
His paycheck
goes back to her hospital bills.

58
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,500
This is like his home now.

59
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,458
So,

60
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,708
need a doctor, cutie?

61
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,583
Of course I do.

62
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,708
I feel a sharp pain in my heart
as if my partner's got no time for me.

63
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,500
Want to get food?

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,833
Let's go.

65
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:01,042
Mom, do you want me to read
you something before bedtime?

66
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,958
Or are you too tired?

67
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,792
I see. You want to sleep right now? OK.

68
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,917
MORGUE

69
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,333
-Hey!
-What?

70
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,917
Do you think there are
any ghosts here in the dark?

71
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,542
How can they exist?

72
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,625
Just think.

73
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,583
CERN's machines can detect
particles from outer space,

74
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,917
but they've never detected any ghosts.

75
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,292
But are ghosts particles?

76
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:32,125
The things you see are just photons
that strike your eyes, isn't that right?

77
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,708
Basic science.

78
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,333
Maybe ghosts aren't photons.

79
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:40,583
Maybe they're energy or matter
that CERN scientists don't know about yet.

80
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,750
Like the platypus.

81
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,792
<i>Before the discovery</i>

82
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,167
<i>of the platypus</i>,

83
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,750
<i>no one thought mammals could lay eggs.</i>

84
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,125
You even believe
that aliens are real, duh!

85
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,833
Hey.

86
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,958
There are good reasons to support that.

87
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:02,875
<i>Life-forms can live on planets</i>
<i>with water, heavy elements, etc.</i>

88
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,208
What other energy is there
besides the law of physics?

89
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:15,625
The power of love.

90
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:23,000
Hey, dude.
Are you really gonna ignore Joon?

91
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,583
Our hospital doesn't have
many beautiful nurses.

92
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:31,792
When you were giving orders back there,
I saw her looking at you, smitten.

93
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,667
I have to look after Madam.

94
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,208
I have no time for anyone else.

95
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,917
Whoa. Get some real food
if you're that hungry.

96
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:48,125
You want snacks or you want me
to kick your ass? Help me carry these.

97
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,458
Wow. You're so mean these days.

98
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:55,750
Gla.

99
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:00,792
Damn you, Gla. Hey.

100
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,375
Wow, you're really committing to the bit.

101
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:12,167
Excuse you. Save these pranks
for the ladies. They won't work on me.

102
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:14,625
Hey.

103
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:23,833
A ghost!

104
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,583
Damn it. Wee!

105
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,292
Shit! Did you see what I saw?
Wee, you saw that, right?

106
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,458
An actual ghost, damn it!

107
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,542
A real ghost!

108
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,083
Oh my God!

109
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:01,750
<i>Damn it! </i>

110
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:05,875
<i>Wee, you saw it too?</i>

111
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,000
<i>An actual ghost, damn it. A real ghost!</i>

112
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,333
<i>Maybe we were hallucinating.</i>

113
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,042
Identical hallucinations?

114
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:16,417
That's impossible.

115
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,417
I don't get it.

116
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,167
There's no way to explain this.

117
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,875
Want to find a way?

118
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:40,167
MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDING,
RATANARAJ HOSPITAL

119
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,250
Why are we at this old place?

120
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,458
It's an employee housing building.

121
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,208
This is all storage.

122
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,292
-Ouch!
-Whoa.

123
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,083
It's a damn birdhouse.

124
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,958
Does no one clean up here?

125
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,792
I asked Namo to let me
use this room for my research.

126
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,000
I like this place.

127
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,792
No cameras here.

128
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:44,917
It's convenient.

129
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:51,625
You need a camera-free zone
for pediatric intestine research?

130
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,458
NORTHERN LIGHTS QUEST

131
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,583
What did you want to show me?

132
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,167
I'm researching ghosts.

133
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,167
I'm sure these videos and photos online…

134
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,250
are all fake.

135
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:26,250
I understand

136
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,500
that in the past,
images of ghosts were rare. Makes sense.

137
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,958
But now, cameras are everywhere.

138
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:34,958
Even security cameras.

139
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:38,250
So why can't they record
any clear videos of ghosts?

140
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,333
The conclusion is
cameras can't record ghosts, damn it.

141
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,125
That movie <i>Shutter</i> is bullshit.

142
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,208
GHOSTS = ?

143
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:52,417
DESERTED CEMETERIES

144
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,625
DESERTED WAREHOUSES

145
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,500
Hey. What is this shit?

146
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,250
Ghost research?

147
00:14:58,792 --> 00:14:59,792
Are you insane?

148
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,000
In second grade, my dad died.

149
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,000
<i>One night, after the wake,</i>

150
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,208
<i>I came downstairs.</i>

151
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,500
Though I only saw him for a split second,

152
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,333
I'm confident

153
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
that it was him.

154
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,792
Since I saw Dad's ghost

155
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,667
over 20 years ago,

156
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,333
I've always wondered about ghosts.

157
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:13,958
It's my life now.

158
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,167
Last night,

159
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,250
we both saw a ghost.

160
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,417
I'm really sure

161
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,417
Dad came to me back then.

162
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,417
It's like the questions
I've asked my whole life

163
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,042
are now answered.

164
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:28,958
Just think.

165
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,333
If I found a way
for others to see ghosts like we did…

166
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,458
what would happen?

167
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,292
I believe I was born to prove

168
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,750
ghosts are real.

169
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:47,083
I'm in.

170
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,125
Experiment log number 38,

171
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,458
16th May, 2019.

172
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,125
We have big news
about the Northern Lights Quest.

173
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,875
"Northern Lights Quest"?

174
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,208
It's inspired by ancient Inuit people.

175
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,625
They believed
the Northern Lights were departed souls

176
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,917
communicating with the living.

177
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,625
Well, say something, Dr. Specs.

178
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,625
Right. Well…

179
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,542
-Just talk.
-What's so funny? OK--

180
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,833
Hello, I'm Cheewee.

181
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,500
N-- Next,

182
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,458
the two of us

183
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:53,750
will try to prove the existence of
and find answers about ghosts--

184
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,583
It will be one of
the most important discoveries. Like--

185
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,250
Sir Isaac Newton's laws of gravity--

186
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,125
Franklin's electricity or--

187
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,708
Einstein's Theory of Relativity.

188
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,583
Our work
must be published in <i>The Experiment</i>,

189
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,208
the world's most famous research journal.

190
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,500
What research did you do
in the past four or five years?

191
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:24,375
I did field research.

192
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,833
So tell me what you saw.

193
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,625
<i>I interviewed everyone…</i>

194
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,667
You mean ghosts?

195
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,125
I saw it over there and I got goosebumps.

196
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,167
<i>…who saw ghosts.</i>

197
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,542
Here?

198
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:43,167
<i>I performed every superstitious ritual</i>

199
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:45,750
<i>to try and see ghosts.</i>

200
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,292
<i>I went to famous haunted places like</i>

201
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,833
<i>a cemetery in Kanchanaburi,</i>

202
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,750
<i>the House of Four Corpses in Chonburi,</i>

203
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,000
<i>an abandoned prison in Vietnam,</i>

204
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,417
<i>a haunted house in Korea,</i>

205
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,208
<i>the Suicide Forest in Japan.</i>

206
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,875
<i>I went to all the famous spots.</i>

207
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,917
<i>But I never saw ghosts anywhere.</i>

208
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,250
Patients die here every day.

209
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,917
I've looked at all
the reported ghost sighting sites.

210
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:32,042
But I never saw any ghosts. Not until…

211
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,958
We both saw one by the vending machine.

212
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,667
How do you find time for this?

213
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,583
What do you think I do
while you look after Madam?

214
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:52,625
And if I'd told you,
you'd have said I was mad.

215
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,750
If cameras can't record ghosts,

216
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:04,542
there's only one way to prove
ghosts are real. All we can do…

217
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,667
is make people see them like we did.

218
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,958
First, we'll have to find
some mechanisms or scenarios

219
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:15,042
to control the ghosts' appearance.

220
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,833
APPEARANCE TRIGGER, PROOF, PUBLIC

221
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:22,833
To date, I've seen ghosts
just twice and you've seen one just once.

222
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,417
We need to see more
to find out what makes them appear.

223
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,750
OK.

224
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,000
So first, we need to…

225
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,958
FIND GHOSTS AS PARTICIPANTS

226
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,250
Alright. Good night, babe.

227
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,792
Why not tell Mai about this?

228
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,208
There's no point.

229
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,958
Hey, it's past 3 a.m. already.

230
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,208
Is her condo near here?

231
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,625
If you're sleepy,
go get some sleep. I'll stay here.

232
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,417
We've been here over a week now.

233
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,625
We've seen nothing.

234
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,000
It's not working.
Let's try something else.

235
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,833
A new method.

236
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,458
It's the wind.

237
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:54,750
Shit.

238
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,083
Damn! Wee!

239
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,708
We were so focused on visible ghosts,

240
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,375
but there are other kinds.

241
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,458
For example, poltergeists are invisible.

242
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,125
What are poltergeists?

243
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,458
Some of my interviewees

244
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,583
said they saw
objects moving, heard strange noises,

245
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:21,417
and often felt
the temperature suddenly drop.

246
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,125
This past week,

247
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,792
I looked at the hospital's CCTV

248
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,000
and found these images.

249
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,417
Hold on. It's crashed.

250
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,000
Come on.

251
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:17,917
You go first.

252
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,958
-Are you scared?
-I told you to go first.

253
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,792
It's so dark. Turn on the light.

254
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,000
Will it scare the ghosts away?

255
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:53,875
-Damn it.
-Hey!

256
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,208
-Sorry.
-Dumbass!

257
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:01,292
-What?
-Watch your step, jackass!

258
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,667
You made me hold
all this. You're holding one thing.

259
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:13,792
Which way now?

260
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,417
-Left.
-Sure. You go first.

261
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,000
Hey.

262
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,042
Why's the wheelchair here?

263
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,333
Shit.

264
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:06,917
Hey!

265
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,208
Shit!

266
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,833
-Hey!
-It--

267
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:28,833
What's the temperature?

268
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,500
Unnatural, don't you think?

269
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,917
<i>This time,</i>
<i>we're one step closer to ghosts.</i>

270
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,042
We witnessed energy
and temperature fluctuation.

271
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,583
<i>But our videos are no better than</i>
<i>those that have been shared online.</i>

272
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,375
<i>Our evidence isn't solid yet.</i>

273
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,833
<i>I need to review my interviews.</i>

274
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,625
<i>I may learn more.</i>

275
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,250
Gla, you can do it later, man.

276
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,250
Dr. Gla.

277
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,125
Are you alright?

278
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,042
-Stop the bleeding.
-Apply pressure.

279
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,500
Someone get Dr. Namo in here stat.

280
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,875
Immediately, please!

281
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,125
You messed up
the tracheotomy. You nicked the thyroid.

282
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,417
Do better, top student.

283
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:09,708
Your late-night research is your business.

284
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,708
But you should know

285
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,583
that doctors' stupid mistakes

286
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,750
cost patients' lives.

287
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,167
Yes.

288
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,958
Certainly. Thank you so much.

289
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,083
Gla.

290
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,833
-Hmm?
-I have bad news.

291
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,000
Listen,

292
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,250
in December,

293
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,417
I have to oversee
a condo project in Pattaya.

294
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,583
Can we postpone
our Northern Lights trip to, like,

295
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,542
around next February?

296
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:58,833
-Oh.
-Hmm?

297
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,500
If that's convenient.

298
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,917
Hey! Wait a minute.

299
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:08,583
Are you being smooth?

300
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,250
You forgot about our trip?

301
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:16,000
I can tell. I know you.

302
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:21,500
Sorry, babe.

303
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,333
I hardly see you now.

304
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:28,958
It's fine.

305
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:33,083
When you're obsessed with work,

306
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:35,708
it's so terribly sexy.

307
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:43,667
I have to go.

308
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,833
Sure.

309
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:49,500
I'm going now.

310
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,000
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye, babe.

311
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:32,667
FIND GHOSTS AS PARTICIPANTS,
APPEARANCE TRIGGER, PROOF

312
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,458
Your platypus story gave me an idea.

313
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:39,375
-Tell me, how do we classify animals?
-What? Why?

314
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:40,708
How do we group them?

315
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:42,750
We use criteria.

316
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,125
Some are vertebrates.

317
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:46,750
Some lay eggs. Some don't.

318
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:51,167
-The number of legs varies.
-How might we classify ghosts?

319
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:58,375
Have you noticed that when we saw ghosts,

320
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:01,875
we knew some of them,
but some of them were strangers?

321
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,667
-We knew some.
-Uh-huh.

322
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,083
-Like my dad.
-That's right.

323
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,917
The burn victim was a stranger to us.

324
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,083
KNOWN VS UNKNOWN

325
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,042
Just think.

326
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:16,292
Unknown ghosts.

327
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,917
Why do they appear to us?

328
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:25,167
-I don't know, man.
-Exactly. We don't know. It's dumb luck.

329
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,875
Consider the known ghosts.

330
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,708
Why did your dad's ghost come to you?

331
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,875
Maybe he missed me or wanted to see me.

332
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,750
If we focus on ghosts we know,

333
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:40,625
we'll know where
and with whom to go find them.

334
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:41,542
We could try

335
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:45,708
observing someone
whose relative or lover has recently died.

336
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:48,292
The only problem is…

337
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,750
who'd let us do that all night?

338
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,667
Especially if they know
we're researching ghosts!

339
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,083
We can't do that.

340
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,708
Here's another way.

341
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,625
Don't be afraid.

342
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:06,792
Alright?

343
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:15,542
<i>I know this girl,</i>

344
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:20,292
<i>a first-year student who's</i>
<i>in the final stage of cancer.</i>

345
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,375
<i>I heard she's single.</i>

346
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,583
<i>Imagine that.</i>

347
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,292
<i>She's never dated and she's dying.</i>

348
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:30,083
<i>But if you or I</i>

349
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:33,167
<i>become her first and only boyfriend,</i>

350
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,833
<i>when she's gone,</i>
<i>she'll surely come back to us.</i>

351
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,792
<i>Are we going too far?</i>

352
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:45,125
Fooling a dying person for our experiment?

353
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,250
I think we'd be crossing the line.

354
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,417
So what?

355
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:56,417
She gets some love
before she dies. We get a participant. So,

356
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,208
win-win, right? Wee?

357
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:01,917
That feeling when we saw the ghost…

358
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,542
The universe opened
its door of secrets to us.

359
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,583
My curiosity's unstoppable now.

360
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:21,708
Hello?

361
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,083
What?

362
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:39,167
<i>The brain can survive</i>
<i>without oxygen for three minutes.</i>

363
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,042
<i>The brain can survive</i>
<i>without oxygen for three minutes…</i>

364
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,250
I resuscitated her.

365
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,375
She's still unresponsive.

366
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,667
Mucus blocked
her airway awhile before we arrived.

367
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:55,458
No oxygen reached her brain
for seven minutes. You have to choose.

368
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,583
-Hey!
-Hey, Wee!

369
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:18,417
Mom…

370
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:21,625
do you remember…

371
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:27,167
the robot you bought me when I was a kid?

372
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:35,083
One day, I threw it a bit too hard,
and after that, it couldn't walk anymore.

373
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,792
Back then, you said

374
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,333
that it couldn't walk…

375
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,750
because it was broken inside…

376
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,458
and we'd be able to fix it.

377
00:34:57,917 --> 00:34:58,792
But…

378
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:04,583
I know what's wrong with you,

379
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,417
so why can't I help you at all?

380
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:26,667
<i>So you're sure</i>

381
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,292
<i>the afterlife's real?</i>

382
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,875
Do you want to go now, Mom?

383
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:42,875
Am I torturing you here?

384
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:50,292
I believe

385
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:52,292
that it's real.

386
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,000
<i>I'll let you go, Mom.</i>

387
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,083
<i>Please come back to see me.</i>

388
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:56,458
<i>There's no new patient here yet,</i>

389
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:58,917
<i>so I installed a camera</i>

390
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:01,542
<i>to capture any weird movements.</i>

391
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:06,500
<i>And tonight,</i>

392
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,125
<i>I think I should be by Wee's side.</i>

393
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,083
Mom?

394
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:50,958
Mom!

395
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:19,667
<i>Mom seemed to be saying</i>
<i>something, but I couldn't tell what.</i>

396
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:26,500
<i>I saw her crying.</i>

397
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,917
<i>Did I make the wrong choice?</i>

398
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,583
<i>Maybe the truth is</i>

399
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:43,000
<i>she didn't want me to let her go.</i>

400
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,917
<i>After that day,</i>

401
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,917
<i>Mom never let me see her again.</i>

402
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:06,500
<i>I have so many questions in my head,</i>

403
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:09,958
<i>I feel like I'm drowning.</i>

404
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:22,208
So I decided to do PHQ-9, fMRI,
as well as blood and urine lab tests

405
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,625
for chemical imbalances.

406
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,667
We found nothing.

407
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,500
<i>That means</i>

408
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,958
<i>I'm not depressed</i>
<i>because of what happened.</i>

409
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,167
<i>Therefore, my decision</i>

410
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,750
<i>isn't influenced by anything else.</i>

411
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,917
I will cross over.

412
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,917
"Cross over"? To where?

413
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:31,208
I'll die and go to the other side,

414
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,542
and I'll come back
to do the experiment with you.

415
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,708
Dude. Chill, man.

416
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:41,333
It's what we need
for our experiment to continue.

417
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,333
Even if the cancer patient fell for you,

418
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:46,875
even if she came to you,

419
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,292
how much could you experiment with her?

420
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,042
She could disappear
in an instant like your dad.

421
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:58,292
She doesn't know our experiment
like us or understand what we're doing.

422
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,750
Only I can come back for our experiment.

423
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:01,833
Snap out of it.

424
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,417
You're upset about your mom.

425
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,083
You're just depressed, so you're suicidal.

426
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:12,167
Wee, listen to me, damn it.

427
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:16,250
You lost your mom,

428
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,667
but you didn't lose everything.

429
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,792
-You still have so much to do.
-Like what?

430
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:24,917
Huh?

431
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:27,833
What's left to do?

432
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:31,083
Why care if I die?

433
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:32,042
You're my friend!

434
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,667
And you're my friend too.

435
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,542
I'm doing your experiment.

436
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:40,250
Since we saw that ghost together,

437
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:43,792
and my mom came back to see me,

438
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:46,250
I'm not afraid of the afterlife anymore.

439
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,042
In this world,

440
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:52,083
there's no one left for me to worry about.

441
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,833
I just want to see my mom.

442
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,167
I wanna know what she said.

443
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:10,958
You're the one who told me

444
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:15,208
"the universe has opened
its door of secrets to us"

445
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:16,958
and you expect me to do nothing?

446
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:20,625
It's not unusual, Gla.

447
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:25,542
Lots of scientists trade
their lives for discoveries.

448
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:27,417
Didn't you say so yourself?

449
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,208
That you were born to do this?

450
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:35,792
This is it! This is how you prove it!

451
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:38,083
You don't understand shit!

452
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:40,333
I got you into this!

453
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:42,958
How can I let you die?

454
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:46,083
Think it through.

455
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,125
I can't let you die for this!

456
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,292
Don't stop me!

457
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:55,167
You'll get a participant.
I'll get to see my mom.

458
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:57,125
Win-win, yeah?

459
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:16,958
Just admit it.

460
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,625
This is the only way
our experiment can continue.

461
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:36,792
If someone must die,

462
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:39,750
it will be me.

463
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,208
What the hell?

464
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:49,375
Fine, I admit it.

465
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,333
Yeah, you're right.

466
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,625
This is the only way we can continue.

467
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,500
But I started this project.

468
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:03,167
-This crucial task should be mine!
-You're talking shit. I volunteer!

469
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,667
I volunteer too!

470
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:07,375
I will die

471
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:10,083
for the research I started.

472
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,500
I have that right too!

473
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:24,958
So let's make it fair.

474
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:37,000
If it's heads,

475
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:38,958
I'll go.

476
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:40,958
If it's tails,

477
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:43,667
you'll go.

478
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,375
Whatever the result is,

479
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
you'll accept it.

480
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:01,042
I thought it through.

481
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,583
<i>I'll write a suicide note.</i>

482
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,917
<i>I'll say I got depressed</i>

483
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:10,625
<i>after my mom died.</i>

484
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:13,708
<i>You'll just pretend you found my body.</i>

485
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:17,792
<i>Forensics will say</i>
<i>that I killed myself for sure.</i>

486
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,625
<i>Just keep our experiment secret</i>

487
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:24,083
<i>so the cops won't bother us.</i>

488
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:34,458
I'll wait on the other side to see
our names on that front cover.

489
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:38,792
<i>A free solo mountain climber,</i>

490
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:42,500
<i>or a climber who uses</i>
<i>bare hands and no cables or safety gear,</i>

<i>in the US state of California.</i>

495

Why do people do this stuff?

496
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:55,625
What do they get from it?

497
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:58,542
Is it worth dying for?

498
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,042
<i>Experiment log number 65,</i>

<i>Every life has an ending.</i>

<i>But what</i>

<i>True science</i>

<i>to knowledge,</i>

505
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:38,208
<i>from stupidity to wisdom,</i>

506
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:42,208

<i>My journey today</i>

508
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:50,458

<i>the truth of the universe.</i>

509
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:53,625
This video clip will record

510
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:58,208
my entire journey to the other side.

511
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,417
Dr. Arjong Soonyata

512
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,750
will conduct the research on this side.

513
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,167
If I don't return soon,

514
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:13,292
Dr. Ar-Jong may have to work harder.

515
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,083
I think

516
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:21,792
it's time

517
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:25,375
for us to begin our journey.

518
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:52,833
I don't know what it'll be like there.

519
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,417
But I will do everything
to make contact with you.

520
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:01,917
And you have to do
everything you can to contact me too.

521
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,208
I swear I will, man.

522
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,667
I won't stop until you get back,

523
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:08,708
until we succeed.

524
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:44,917
Shit!

525
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:38,625
I was born to prove ghosts are real.

526
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,333
I'm in.

527
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:44,333
Our work must be published
in the most famous research journal.

528
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:49,833
I'll wait on the other side to see
our names on that front cover.

529
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,625
<i>Come back to me, Mom.</i>

530
00:52:57,125 --> 00:52:59,000
What are you two doing, honey?

531
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:13,667
Mom!

532
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:38,125
I can't do it.

533
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,875
I really can't. My mom, she…

534
00:53:42,792 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:54,125
It's OK, man.

536
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:56,333
I'll come back.

537
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:32,000
-Doctor, it's your cue.
<i>-</i>Alright.

538
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,292
<i>Have you ever proven</i>

539
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:37,875
<i>or just superstitions?</i>

540

Ready?

541
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:41,625
<i>I'd like you all to meet</i>
<i>two important people</i>

542
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:45,083
<i>who will change your beliefs forever.</i>

543
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,875
Do you believe in the afterlife?

544
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:05,042
And spirits? What do you think they are?

545
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:06,667
I, Dr. Cheewee Prometheus,

546
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,500
and Dr. Arjong Soonyata,

547
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:10,292
our key research participant,

548
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:12,667
are standing side by side right now.

549
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:17,000
We'll now present our results
as seen in the world-class journal,

550
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:18,042
<i>The Experiment.</i>

551
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:20,750
You are the first group to witness this.

552
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,167
Are you ready,

553
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:24,792
Dr. Ar-Jong?

554
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,500
It doesn't work!

555
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:40,250
<i>Dr. Cheewee,</i>

556
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:44,333
<i>I'm happy for… your success.</i>

557
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:48,042
<i>But for this discovery,</i>
<i>which you say is so amazing,</i>

558
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:51,333
<i>were you really willing</i>
<i>to sacrifice a person's life?</i>

559
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:58,875
Do you even have a heart?

560
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,750
You let your friend kill himself

561
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,542
for an experiment
you don't know will succeed or not.

562
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:09,750
You're not the researcher
or scientist you think you are.

563
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:13,875
You're a murderer.

564
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,542
Mai.

565
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:23,625
Hey. No!

566
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:04,750
NO CONTACT

567
00:57:08,042 --> 00:57:09,542
ON-CALL ROOM SUICIDE!

568
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,042
WHY DID DOC SHOOT SELF?

569
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:13,250
DOC KILLS SELF IN HAUNTED HOSPITAL!

570
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:14,958
TRAGIC DOC'S MOTIVE UNKNOWN

571
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,792
<i>I tried everything I could</i>

572
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:31,500
<i>to stop Wee's thoughts.</i>

573
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:41,750
<i>I never thought of this method.</i>

574
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,875
<i>But once he said it,</i>
<i>my heart started beating hard.</i>

575
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:50,042
<i>I felt…</i>

576
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:52,500
<i>Damn!</i>

577
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:56,292
<i>Is this the solution we seek?</i>

578
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:05,292
<i>I'll come back.</i>

579
00:58:15,917 --> 00:58:16,750
I'm sorry.

580
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,792
Come back now.

581
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:33,250
Gla donated his body
to the hospital for educational purposes…

582
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:34,292
DR. ARJONG

583
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:35,958
…to benefit others.

584
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:38,750
But the monk said

585
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:41,792
that suicide is a grave sin.

586
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,958
I'm doing everything
to make him pure like anyone else.

587
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:50,583
Wee, do you think

588
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:53,208
what I'm doing

589
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:57,833
will help Gla find peace, sweetheart?

590
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,208
Thank you, Wee.

591
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,625
I'll bring it all to his mom.

592
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:20,792
Could you think it over again?

593
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,917
Why would Gla do this?

594
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,792
I really don't know.

595
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:32,875
I'm sorry.

596
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:52,917
Not knowing anything

597
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:56,208
really freaking hurts.

598
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:01,833
It's like I meant nothing to him.

599
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:55,333
Shit!

600
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:20,417
Whoa! Shit!

601
01:02:32,042 --> 01:02:32,875
Jackass!

602
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,500
You're back, asshole?

603
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:41,917
It's you, right?

604
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:47,125
Gla!

605
01:02:49,792 --> 01:02:50,625
Gla?

606
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:58,167
You're here?

607
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,042
You're back? Why can't I see you?

608
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,167
Why don't you show yourself to me?

609
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,792
Maybe… you can't show yourself yet.

610
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:13,542
Communicate.

611
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,208
Make sounds. Or--

612
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,333
Or do whatever you can.

613
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:18,958
Do your poltergeist shit.

614
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:01,833
Hey… you're communicating with me, right?

615
01:04:04,292 --> 01:04:06,125
Why can't you communicate more?

616
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:11,000
I was falling and you pulled me back!

617
01:04:19,917 --> 01:04:20,792
Hold on.

618
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:24,833
You saved me when I was falling?

619
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:30,333
Let me guess.

620
01:04:30,417 --> 01:04:32,167
What boosts your power

621
01:04:33,042 --> 01:04:34,958
is me being in danger, right?

622
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:38,417
If I put myself at risk again,

623
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,750
will it boost your energy again?

624
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:16,208
I'm a surgeon.

625
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:20,417
Save my finger, OK?

626
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:23,750
Dr. Wee?

627
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:26,000
Shit.

628
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:30,250
Please sign the schedule.
I called but you didn't pick up.

629
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,167
Alright.

630
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:51,208
Shit!

631
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:05,292
Is my hypothesis correct?

632
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:06,417
Is my idea right?

633
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:25,625
Ghost participant

634
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,167
found. You're back.

635
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:31,542
Next, we need to find
a way for you to appear.

636
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:34,750
So do you know what ghosts are now?

637
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:40,958
Gla's return doesn't answer
all the questions we're asking,

638
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:42,458
but we've learned a lot.

639
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:45,917
First of all, Gla can't see other ghosts.

640
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,125
How about there? Can you see anything?

641
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:51,792
Secondly,

642
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,667
he only sees what's around me.

643
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:57,500
He says that before this, he saw nothing,

644
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:00,250
until I jumped.

645
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:05,417
Suddenly, he saw me and saved me.

646
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:11,667
It's like something connects
me to Gla, who's in the afterlife.

647
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,458
That means the soul's power increases

648
01:07:16,042 --> 01:07:17,750
when triggered by something.

649
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:24,708
In our case,
Gla was worried about me being in danger.

650
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,042
Let's say ghosts are natural phenomena.

651
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:30,750
If ghosts are like wind…

652
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:33,167
Wind, initially, can't be seen, right?

653
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:36,542
But add air pressure
to wind and you get a storm,

654
01:07:37,792 --> 01:07:40,958
which can increase in both speed and size.

655
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:42,417
And then,

656
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:45,375
when that mixes with water vapor,

657
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,708
it creates an electric charge. Finally,

658
01:07:48,792 --> 01:07:49,625
we will see…

659
01:07:54,292 --> 01:07:57,375
the shape of an actual storm. I believe

660
01:07:57,917 --> 01:08:00,667
that if I can boost your power like this,

661
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:04,000
you'll be able to appear for sure, man.

662
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:12,208
"Weird"? How are my thoughts weird?

663
01:08:16,917 --> 01:08:17,750
"Beach"?

664
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,458
No beach pictures in here.

665
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:24,917
Where do you see a beach?

666
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,292
Gone already?

667
01:08:37,917 --> 01:08:41,083
W-- What stupid beach
are you talking about?

668
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,208
Aunt Koy?

669
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:55,583
This picture…

670
01:08:56,667 --> 01:08:57,708
Where was this?

671
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:00,583
Oh, that was taken in Ranong.

672
01:09:01,792 --> 01:09:03,042
It's Gla's hometown.

673
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:07,417
When his dad passed away,
I moved back to Bangkok.

674
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,917
You said you wanted to talk to me

675
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:19,917
about Gla.

676
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:23,750
What is it?

677
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:31,125
Well…

678
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:37,958
I saw Gla in a dream.

679
01:09:43,083 --> 01:09:45,042
He told me to tell you something.

680
01:09:47,042 --> 01:09:47,875
He said…

681
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:51,792
he's still around.

682
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,667
He can't be reborn yet.

683
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:01,042
What do I need to do?

684
01:10:02,667 --> 01:10:03,917
Did he tell you?

685
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,625
I guess suicide is a very serious sin.

686
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:16,208
I'm afraid that he's going to
carry on as a wandering ghost.

687
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:31,375
I got goosebumps.

688
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:34,458
Wee, do you feel it too?

689
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:38,417
-I do.
-Maybe Gla is here somewhere.

690
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:43,208
Mom.

691
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:48,833
Excuse me, Wee.

692
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:52,208
What you're saying is upsetting my mom.

693
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:57,417
Plus, you're a doctor. You aren't
supposed to believe in this stuff?

694
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,833
I'm just worried for Gla.

695
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:05,833
What you said…

696
01:11:07,917 --> 01:11:09,667
don't you think it hurts Gla?

697
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:13,292
He might be here with us now.

698
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:14,708
That's nonsense.

699
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,542
You're only hurting my mom more.

700
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:20,625
You should leave.

701
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:22,167
Please go.

702
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:25,042
-Gift.
-Hush, Mom.

703
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:41,000
"<i>Kha Kai</i>."

704
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,042
I just remembered.

705
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:57,917
In my dream, Gla said, "<i>Kha Kai</i>."

706
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,917
"Chicken legs"?

707
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:00,917
I don't get it either,

708
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,792
but he really said, "<i>Kha Kai</i>."

709
01:12:08,417 --> 01:12:09,250
Wee.

710
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:12,958
Do stay for dinner.

711
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:21,292
Gla loved my <i>Kha Kai</i> curry.

712
01:12:24,417 --> 01:12:25,250
Oh.

713
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:28,000
He meant curry.

714
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,875
He must want me to offer alms for him,

715
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:33,583
so he told you.

716
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:39,000
Whoa.

717
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,667
Wow. Your cooking is amazing, Aunt Koy.

718
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:46,333
You could open your own restaurant.

719
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:54,833
That's what Gla said too.

720
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:58,333
Gla complimented me.

721
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:00,167
He said my curry was so good

722
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:02,500
that I could run a restaurant.

723
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:05,542
I didn't buy that.

724
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:08,958
So he dared me. He said
he'd have you come to taste it.

725
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:22,042
He said you'd say the same thing.

726
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,917
Gla said that I'm not confident…

727
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:34,667
that I think I'm not good at anything.

728
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,083
He said, "But

729
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:43,583
if that's true,

730
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:46,958
how did you raise your kids alone?"

731
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:53,083
He said, "You raised a doctor, right?"

732
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,833
"Compared to that, <i>Kha Kai</i> is so easy."

733
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,833
"Why won't you believe
you're a great cook?"

734
01:14:09,792 --> 01:14:11,000
Thank you, Wee.

735
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:17,250
Now I understand
what Gla wanted to tell me.

736
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:42,917
The curry brought your mom peace.

737
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:46,083
Did you derail my experiment on purpose?

738
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,208
You know the plan.

739
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:58,125
I'm trying to make you worry
as much as I can. It worked, see?

740
01:15:08,542 --> 01:15:09,500
I understand

741
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,417
if you don't like me doing this.

742
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:16,583
But it's for the experiment.

743
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:23,250
Right now?

744
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:34,250
So is this the beach
in Ranong, your hometown?

745
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:38,500
Hey, Gla!

746
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:40,875
Gla! Hey!

747
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:43,458
Damn it, Gla!

748
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:49,458
Gla has been missing for three days.

749
01:15:51,625 --> 01:15:52,750
Is this normal?

750
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:56,792
Does every spirit have this phase?

751
01:15:58,667 --> 01:16:02,167
Or maybe he left
because he's consoled his mom.

752
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,167
WORLD OF THE LIVING

753
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:07,833
GLA

754
01:16:07,917 --> 01:16:09,625
Or is the beach another world

755
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:13,125
the dead have to
cross to, like how some folks say

756
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,667
"the dead go to find peace."

757
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,083
Come back.

758
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:47,750
Three…

759
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:52,417
two…

760
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,000
one!

761
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:15,625
Wee. If you have any problems

762
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:17,500
or stress, you can tell me.

763
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,125
Or the hospital

764
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:21,833
has professionals who can help--

765
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:22,958
Meaning what?

766
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:28,667
A nurse says you tried
this once before. Is it true?

767
01:17:32,667 --> 01:17:34,042
Who maims themselves?

768
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:41,667
-So is it true?
-I can handle it. I don't need help.

769
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:53,375
Shit.

770
01:17:57,042 --> 01:17:57,875
Oh, hi, Mai.

771
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:03,375
Why are you here?

772
01:18:04,917 --> 01:18:06,000
I came to see you

773
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:08,125
to ask you this.

774
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:10,833
The day I returned Gla's stuff,

775
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:13,167
his laptop was missing.

776
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:14,875
The one with the red cover.

777
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:19,083
It's not at his mom's place
and the cops didn't take it.

778
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:21,125
Have you seen it?

779
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:25,458
I haven't.

780
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:30,667
I'll look for it and let you know ASAP.

781
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:35,583
OK. I understand.

782
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:37,917
I have to go.

783
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:47,750
Mai.

784
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,708
Gla chose to do what he did.

785
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:56,458
Looking for answers
is putting you through pain.

786
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:01,917
So can you stand it?

787
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:04,750
Wondering and never knowing?

788
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:22,250
Shit.

789
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:45,333
How'd you get in?

790
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:48,542
-Let me explain--
-About hiding Gla's laptop?

791
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:50,500
-Mai--
-Explain to the cops.

792
01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:52,667
Mai, no! Hey! Mai, wait.

793
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:55,083
Mai, listen to me first.

794
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:58,458
I found his laptop
two days ago, in the trunk of my car.

795
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:03,042
Earlier, I had to lie about not finding it

796
01:20:03,542 --> 01:20:07,958
because you made it sound like
the laptop was evidence. That scared me.

797
01:20:09,042 --> 01:20:11,208
I swear I knew nothing about it.

798
01:20:11,292 --> 01:20:13,125
I want to know Gla's story too.

799
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:17,333
But his laptop is locked.

800
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,458
I can't get in.

801
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,917
Hey. We've tried for almost an hour.

802
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:36,000
We've gotten nowhere.

803
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,292
It'll be easier to hire an expert.

804
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:42,083
I know this friend

805
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:44,000
with IT qualifications.

806
01:20:44,792 --> 01:20:45,958
Should I ask them?

807
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:48,458
Sure.

808
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:52,792
Alright. I'll take it to my friend ASAP.

809
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:02,500
You think I'm that stupid?

810
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:06,542
You're lying.

811
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,042
People like Gla

812
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,375
never just suddenly kill themselves.

813
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:15,417
I was his girlfriend.

814
01:21:16,417 --> 01:21:17,625
I knew him the best.

815
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,708
I've been his friend for longer.

816
01:21:48,625 --> 01:21:49,792
So what now?

817
01:21:52,292 --> 01:21:54,125
Do I have to just accept it?

818
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:57,625
That all this time
I didn't know Gla at all?

819
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,667
I should have known

820
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,167
what Gla was thinking.

821
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:07,750
The night
before he killed himself, I was with him.

822
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:12,500
I was with him in this room.
I should have known what he was thinking.

823
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:20,250
Why didn't he tell me
that something was wrong?

824
01:22:20,917 --> 01:22:21,792
Or maybe

825
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:24,542
he tried to tell me,

826
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,083
but I didn't listen.

827
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,417
Didn't I pay attention or…

828
01:22:30,458 --> 01:22:33,500
What was wrong?
Was I such an awful girlfriend?

829
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,250
Was I so shitty that I didn't know
what was wrong with my boyfriend?

830
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:41,833
What was wrong?

831
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,000
Breathe, Mai.

832
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:46,750
I mean, look.

833
01:22:47,417 --> 01:22:49,708
Even my boyfriend's password.

834
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:55,333
-I don't even know it, shit!
-Mai.

835
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,333
It's alright.

836
01:23:41,042 --> 01:23:42,875
I'll take this to my friend.

837
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:44,375
We might unlock it tonight.

838
01:23:54,292 --> 01:23:55,417
What the fuck, man?

839
01:23:56,667 --> 01:24:00,042
Didn't we agree
that no one could know about the research?

840
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:03,292
If Mai finds out,
she'll tell someone for sure.

841
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,042
What happens to it then? Do you care?

842
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:22,917
You were MIA so long.

843
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:26,417
You came back to tell your girl the truth?

844
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,917
I called for you, remember?

845
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:30,917
Why didn't you come?

846
01:24:33,917 --> 01:24:36,333
Do you still care about what we're doing?

847
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:38,375
Huh?

848
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,292
Forget her!

849
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:52,750
Let her feel guilty. It won't kill her.

850
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:15,125
Whoa!

851
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:32,542
Shit!

852
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:39,833
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

853
01:25:39,917 --> 01:25:43,750
The elevator's stuck
on the 13th floor. Please help me.

854
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:45,875
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

855
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:52,542
Shit.

856
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:15,083
It's hot.

857
01:27:16,917 --> 01:27:19,417
So you'll tell me the truth about Gla?

858
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:21,583
You found out more?

859
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:23,208
Yep.

860
01:27:25,417 --> 01:27:27,000
I asked you to meet me here

861
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,833
so you could see for yourself.

862
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:33,708
You'll understand it all.

863
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:37,625
I have to go and prepare something.

864
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:39,417
I'll be back.

865
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:58,667
<i>At Mai's condo yesterday,</i>

866
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:02,583
<i>I learned of another way</i>
<i>to boost the spirit's power.</i>

867
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:10,000
ENERGY = WORRIES

868
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:16,792
ENERGY = WORRIES / VENGEANCE

869
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:27,250
Oh! Wow! I thought
that you weren't coming back anymore!

870
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:30,167
How's the beach?

871
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:32,208
Huh?

872
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:40,417
Experiment log number 103.

873
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,042
I decided to redesign
the experiment again.

874
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:46,000
This time, I'm sure that it will succeed.

875
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:51,458
So close now.

876
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:55,125
I'm this close to making the ghost appear.

877
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:14,458
Hey!

878
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:22,167
You said it yourself.

879
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:26,125
You want Mai to know
about the experiment. Look!

880
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,125
I got her to participate.

881
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:32,750
Isn't this good?

882
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:37,708
You want this, right?

883
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:48,125
Hey!

884
01:30:54,042 --> 01:30:55,667
Deep down, you know, right?

885
01:30:57,375 --> 01:30:58,208
The truth is

886
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,167
I like Mai too.

887
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,833
Oh, right.

888
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,625
I forgot that you're dead.

889
01:31:06,292 --> 01:31:07,292
Shit. Sorry, man.

890
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:12,000
You mind if I take Mai

891
01:31:12,542 --> 01:31:13,375
for myself?

892
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:40,083
Where are you?

893
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:41,000
Tell me.

894
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:42,917
Where are you?

895
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,083
So close. We're this close.

896
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:02,667
GHOSTS = ?

897
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:33,792
Hey!

898
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,167
Gla!

899
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,042
You can show yourself now.

900
01:32:41,542 --> 01:32:42,500
Can you hear me?

901
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:45,458
We succeeded, damn it!

902
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:55,167
Hell yeah, we're on the right track!

903
01:35:28,542 --> 01:35:29,375
Shit.

904
01:35:41,667 --> 01:35:43,042
<i>Experiment log</i>

905
01:35:44,667 --> 01:35:46,292
<i>number 104.</i>

906
01:35:47,167 --> 01:35:48,583
The results show that…

907
01:35:51,708 --> 01:35:53,000
using his girlfriend

908
01:35:54,792 --> 01:35:57,083
to trigger negative emotions…

909
01:36:00,292 --> 01:36:03,042
made the spirit of Dr. Arjong…

910
01:36:07,417 --> 01:36:09,958
show his true form for the first time.

911
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:13,833
<i>This is our first time</i>
<i>seeing his "Northern Lights."</i>

912
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:26,958
Fuck you, Gla!

913
01:36:27,583 --> 01:36:28,417
Not so hard!

914
01:36:31,917 --> 01:36:33,375
Now I know what to do.

915
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:36,125
Now, if you wanna expose the truth

916
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:37,500
or deal with someone,

917
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,625
I'll set it up. Maybe next time,

918
01:36:40,167 --> 01:36:41,292
I'll get your sis--

919
01:36:58,833 --> 01:36:59,667
Hey!

920
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:07,542
Hey--

921
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:11,542
You can get back in your body?

922
01:38:13,583 --> 01:38:14,417
Damn, this is

923
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:17,375
even more than we expected.

924
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:21,167
If I can keep you
in this form for everyone to see…

925
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:27,000
Our experiment is coming together!

926
01:38:29,708 --> 01:38:30,708
I must film this.

927
01:38:32,292 --> 01:38:33,417
Let me record this.

928
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,625
Wasn't it you who told me…

929
01:38:56,042 --> 01:38:57,958
"If we really want the truth,

930
01:39:00,708 --> 01:39:02,375
we must cross the line"?

931
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:10,917
When you shot yourself…

932
01:39:13,542 --> 01:39:16,333
you didn't even think
of your mom, or Gift,

933
01:39:16,875 --> 01:39:18,000
or even Mai at all!

934
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:24,417
You really want to go
to your beloved  beach?

935
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:26,792
I won't let you.

936
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:30,292
We've come this far already.

937
01:39:31,042 --> 01:39:32,292
I have to finish it.

938
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:35,583
Whatever shit I must do,

939
01:39:36,292 --> 01:39:37,125
I will do it!

940
01:40:01,083 --> 01:40:02,083
Whoa!

941
01:41:25,167 --> 01:41:26,875
How did we get to this point?

942
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:34,083
Gla.

943
01:41:40,542 --> 01:41:41,875
I've become a monster.

944
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:46,875
And I'm turning you into one too.

945
01:41:53,125 --> 01:41:54,250
Wee.

946
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:56,333
Thanks, man.

947
01:41:57,792 --> 01:41:58,917
You kept your word.

948
01:42:00,542 --> 01:42:01,792
Now you must stop.

949
01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:04,458
No way, Gla.

950
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:07,917
If you don't stop,

951
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:12,500
what other evil things
will you do for the experiment?

952
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:22,583
But we've come this far already.

953
01:42:24,917 --> 01:42:26,208
We're almost there.

954
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,250
To reach this point,

955
01:42:30,458 --> 01:42:32,042
what did you have to sacrifice?

956
01:42:36,667 --> 01:42:38,917
I've hurt enough people around me.

957
01:42:42,917 --> 01:42:44,417
Everything must stop here.

958
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,833
Are you telling me
to let you die for free?

959
01:43:08,333 --> 01:43:09,167
Wee…

960
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:13,167
you did your best for me…

961
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:16,083
for your mom,

962
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:19,375
and for this experiment.

963
01:43:22,042 --> 01:43:23,958
You don't have to feel guilty anymore.

964
01:43:49,208 --> 01:43:50,208
I have to go now.

965
01:43:53,083 --> 01:43:54,292
My journey goes on.

966
01:44:00,042 --> 01:44:00,875
Damn you, Gla!

967
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:12,333
Gla!

968
01:45:27,042 --> 01:45:29,292
Sir, everything that happened

969
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:32,167
was caused by his severe emotional trauma.

970
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:33,917
after the loss of his mother

971
01:45:34,958 --> 01:45:36,500
and his friend's suicide.

972
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:41,333
I know you want to protect your resident.

973
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,667
But the Council must investigate.

974
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,667
He may never practice again.

975
01:46:32,917 --> 01:46:36,083
<i>In my first year, I once asked Gla</i>

976
01:46:37,125 --> 01:46:39,500
<i>why he was so fascinated with science.</i>

977
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,875
<i>He told me</i>

978
01:46:43,667 --> 01:46:45,167
<i>that every day we live</i>

979
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:47,667
<i>is like a science experiment.</i>

980
01:46:50,708 --> 01:46:51,875
<i>We set hypotheses</i>

981
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:54,333
<i>and our expectations.</i>

982
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:58,667
<i>We try to control the variables.</i>

983
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:04,750
<i>Some are controllable. Some aren't.</i>

984
01:47:08,917 --> 01:47:10,583
<i>Sometimes what's been done</i>

985
01:47:11,875 --> 01:47:13,542
<i>is almost completely ruined.</i>

986
01:47:20,792 --> 01:47:22,458
<i>Whatever the result is…</i>

987
01:47:28,458 --> 01:47:30,458
<i>we still learn something from it,</i>

988
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,125
<i>more or less.</i>

989
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:35,958
NORTHERN LIGHTS QUEST

990
01:47:42,417 --> 01:47:45,667
NORTHERN LIGHTS QUEST

991
01:48:03,917 --> 01:48:05,625
I got the laptop unlocked.

992
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:16,417
Mai, listen…

993
01:48:22,833 --> 01:48:23,667
That night--

994
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:25,875
Wee. You don't have to say anything.

995
01:48:28,333 --> 01:48:29,542
I talked to Namo.

996
01:48:31,083 --> 01:48:35,250
I know. Back then,
you weren't really emotionally stable.

997
01:48:39,542 --> 01:48:40,500
And maybe…

998
01:48:43,292 --> 01:48:45,542
I wasn't in my right mind yet either.

999
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,875
You know what?

1000
01:48:51,333 --> 01:48:53,667
The night I fell asleep in your office,

1001
01:48:55,583 --> 01:48:56,417
I think…

1002
01:48:59,042 --> 01:49:00,375
Gla came to see me.

1003
01:49:05,583 --> 01:49:06,458
In my dream,

1004
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:08,875
we were at the seaside.

1005
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:14,583
<i>But I don't know where exactly.</i>

1006
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:52,250
<i>In my dream, I didn't say anything to him.</i>

1007
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,958
<i>Just seeing him happy</i>

1008
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,667
<i>was enough to make me so happy.</i>

1009
01:50:18,875 --> 01:50:19,708
Hey, Wee.

1010
01:50:21,375 --> 01:50:22,208
In my dream,

1011
01:50:24,667 --> 01:50:26,792
Gla was holding this magazine.

1012
01:50:28,333 --> 01:50:30,458
On the cover was a photo of you two.

1013
01:50:58,583 --> 01:50:59,792
Wee.

1014
01:51:03,792 --> 01:51:04,917
I'm jealous of you.

1015
01:51:07,833 --> 01:51:09,083
You still have a chance.

1016
01:51:16,542 --> 01:51:18,417
Live your life for the both of us.

1017
01:51:25,792 --> 01:51:26,917
<i>I think he's right.</i>

1018
01:51:30,208 --> 01:51:31,833
<i>We just have to learn from it.</i>

1019
01:51:36,667 --> 01:51:37,792
<i>As long as we live,</i>

1020
01:51:38,458 --> 01:51:41,250
<i>we must continue</i>
<i>our experiments until the end.</i>

1021
01:57:02,542 --> 01:57:05,542
