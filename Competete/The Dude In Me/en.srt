What is it now?

9
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:39,939
Dad won't give me
the Gangnam gallery.

10
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:43,176
So annoying.

11
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:47,346
So what then?

12
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,216
Don't wear that tie pin!

13
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:52,718
Good morning, boss!

14
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:05,180
Tell them I'd like to invest in the Uzbekistan copper mine.

15
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:08,815
And make sure we get 30 percent of the shares.

16
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,960
We will establish a local corporation.

17
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:14,237
So just carry on

18
00:03:14,604 --> 00:03:15,826
with the deal.

19
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:25,585
What?

20
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:28,154
About the Jungwoon district mall,

21
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,656
we got rid of most of the tenants,

22
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:33,659
but the carpenter's shop
is holding out.

23
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:38,664
Choi.

24
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:40,933
You've been doing this
for how long?

25
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:45,605
21 years starting
from liquor distribution.

26
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:51,811
Wearing a tie made you forget
how to wield a knife?

27
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,180
- Bang!
- Yes, boss.

28
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:00,720
Take the boys and wrap up
the Jungwoon case.

29
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:02,889
Right away.

30
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:18,337
Is something wrong, sir?

31
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:20,006
Of course not.

32
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,875
I'm going to go for a smoke.

33
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:29,649
Told you there are plenty here
to use as weapons.

34
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,785
Pros need professional gear.

35
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,855
Mr. Kim Jong-ki?

36
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:38,057
Hand up.

37
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,364
Mr. Kim Jong-ki?

38
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:47,834
This is illegal.

39
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:51,204
I have the right
to keep my property.

40
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:54,240
You can discuss that
with my boss later.

41
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:57,458
One clean signature

42
00:04:57,877 --> 00:04:58,296
Lease Termination Agreement.

43
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:00,777
and I'll buy you lunch.

44
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:02,515
Nosong Carpentry.
I'll count to three.

45
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:05,685
One.

46
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:09,922
Two.

47
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:13,960
Three.

48
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:37,596
Whoa, look who it is!

49
00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:39,298
It's big bro Jang!

50
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:41,801
Aren't you more used
to the peasant food?

51
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:47,306
I need to grease
my intestines too.

52
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:50,876
But why are you here eating
by yourself?

53
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:52,344
Where's the Mrs.?

54
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,580
Yang, mind your business.

55
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:56,916
Hand over Chungdo Precision to me.

56
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,020
I worked on that place
for 6 months.

57
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:03,989
Not because Osung Logistics
didn't work out?

58
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:05,558
Say what?

59
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:10,396
Want to get down and dirty
in this day of high tech?

60
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,166
You went to a good school,
were you this anal?

61
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,534
So what?

62
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:18,671
What what?

63
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,308
You smart twit,

64
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:27,646
"high tech" coming out of you
sounds very tacky.

65
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,416
God darn it.

66
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,788
Do you still see me
as your butt-kissing minion?

67
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:38,791
You couldn't even wax
my shoe properly.

68
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,495
Can you handle it?

69
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,164
Of course not.

70
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:49,468
Who can handle your face?
Never, no one can.

71
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:58,677
Let's go get some peasant food!

72
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:06,886
Yes, it's me.

73
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,396
Will Chungdo Precision accept it?

74
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:21,300
With private loans,
we can have the controlling stake.

75
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,205
I heard Yang's men
are working on Chungdo.

76
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:30,376
We got in first,
so he can't do much with it.

77
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,912
Don't forget.

78
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,116
Knife to the neck
is the norm to a gangster.

79
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:45,124
It took us 18 years
to reach this far.

80
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,460
Congratulations, sir.

81
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:50,629
Congrats?

82
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:54,433
That's too early.

83
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,341
Where are you going, sir?

84
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:03,909
To receive grace.

85
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:35,908
My, my, aren't you dressed up
for mackerel ramen?

86
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:41,080
A young woman ran this shop
10 years ago.

87
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,581
Did she sell it?

88
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,017
She's dead.

89
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:52,625
Kiddo, have your fill. Okay?

90
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:10,910
Check please.

91
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,678
Not going to eat?

92
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,381
It's not the same as before?

93
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:18,117
May I just pay?

94
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:23,656
You don't like eating alone, huh?

95
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,126
- Don't have anyone to eat with?
- What?

96
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,962
I'll be right there.

97
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,698
- So sad.
- How much?

98
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:42,541
Ma'am, I'm really sorry,
but I lost my wallet...

99
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,709
That's okay,

100
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:46,312
this gentleman will pay for it,
go on.

101
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:47,513
What?

102
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:51,150
- Take care.
- I'm in a rush...

103
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:54,353
- Thank you! Thank you!
- Don't worry, see you!

104
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,022
- Get going!
- Hey! Buddy!

105
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:57,990
Take care, kiddo.

106
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:01,293
Sir, ready to pay?

107
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:05,297
$10 per dish, total of $50.

108
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:07,800
$10 for ramen?

109
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:09,869
But why is it $50?

110
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:14,540
God darn fathead.

111
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:20,846
I got a gift coming your way.

112
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:25,684
You're a successful man,
you can be generous.

113
00:10:28,187 --> 00:10:30,656
(Hope Snack)

114
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:59,552
I'm never coming back
to this dump.

115
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:18,037
It's me.

116
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:19,872
Did you look into Yang's gang?

117
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,818
(THE DUDE IN ME)

118
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:40,126
Jesus, were am I?

119
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:47,766
Right, something hit me,
and I must have fainted...

120
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:58,444
- Kid.
- What? What kid?

121
00:11:58,677 --> 00:11:59,645
You're awake?

122
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:01,881
What's she saying?

123
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:04,583
Don't call me a kid.

124
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:08,020
Don't force yourself to speak,
I'll get the doctor.

125
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,403
You're up?

126
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:25,538
What? You know me?

127
00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:26,806
You okay, kid?

128
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:29,475
Who are they calling "kid?"

129
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:34,480
What the...

130
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,792
Why am I lying here?

131
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,494
You there.

132
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:51,630
You shouldn't walk around,
return to your room.

133
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:53,258
Your father's on the way,
please wait a bit.

134
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:54,526
My father died more than
10 years ago...

135
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,328
- Dong-hyun!
- There he is.

136
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:58,330
- Dong-hyun!
- Who's that baldy?

137
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:00,532
Son, I thought you'd
never wake up!

138
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,567
Son?

139
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:03,769
Are you okay?

140
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:05,771
Hold on, Dong-hyun.

141
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:07,172
What are they...

142
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:14,646
That's a mirror...

143
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:21,620
I don't believe this...

144
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:25,891
Amnesia?

145
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:32,765
Yes, it's a form of amnesia caused
by accidents.

146
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:36,368
Does that affect
his speech pattern?

147
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:38,804
He doesn't talk like before.

148
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:43,876
Brain injury could lead people
to mistake their identity.

149
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,478
Behavior and speech
could change in that case.

150
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,481
It's Dad, you don't recognize me?

151
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,084
No, I don't!

152
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:53,619
How many times
do I have to tell you?

153
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,856
What's with this voice?

154
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:05,130
How was his personality before?

155
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:07,533
Well, he likes to eat,

156
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:10,335
but he'd never get into fights.

157
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:13,739
- Gentle?
- Yes.

158
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:20,446
A high school student?

159
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:29,254
That's okay.

160
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:31,056
This gentleman will pay for it.

161
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:32,057
What?

162
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:34,526
Could he be...

163
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:37,863
and...

164
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:42,801
I got a gift coming your way.

165
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:44,503
That old fart?

166
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:54,880
What the...

167
00:14:55,681 --> 00:14:58,917
That snack shop went out
of business long ago!

168
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:02,955
I ate ramen here yesterday,
don't you get it?

169
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:06,825
It was that good?

170
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:08,527
Is that why?

171
00:15:10,362 --> 00:15:15,768
Yesterday, a 17-year-old boy
jumped off a building

172
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:17,002
and fell on a man in his 40s,

173
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:20,305
who is currently in a coma.

174
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:25,811
In a stroke of luck,
Don Jang is in a coma.

175
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:27,646
Jang Pan-soo?

176
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:33,986
Incredible!

177
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:42,494
Stupid woman...

178
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:46,165
where the heck did she go?

179
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,675
Dang it...

180
00:15:57,142 --> 00:15:59,244
my precious necklace...

181
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,582
why did it break...

182
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:04,883
Jesus...

183
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:07,820
Who are you?

184
00:16:09,421 --> 00:16:10,556
Um, I am...

185
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:12,157
I'm Pan-soo.

186
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,026
Your husband Pan-soo.

187
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,928
Something strange happened to me.

188
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:16,895
Stay back!

189
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:18,497
- I'll explain everything.
- Stay back!

190
00:16:18,597 --> 00:16:20,799
- Please sit down.
- Police!

191
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:22,501
Will you listen to me?

192
00:16:22,735 --> 00:16:24,536
- What are you doing?
- Stay back!

193
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:28,140
I'm really Pan-soo.

194
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:30,776
I'll prove it, so put that down.

195
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:33,245
If you're Pan-soo,
then I'm your mom, fatso!

196
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,013
How did you know
the door passcode?

197
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:36,582
Did you escape from a psych ward?

198
00:16:36,682 --> 00:16:39,284
I'll explain everything,
so put that down.

199
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:40,719
No way! Stay back!

200
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,287
Han Suh-yeon!

201
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:43,555
Listen to me!

202
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:45,824
Hold still!

203
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:47,526
Let me go! This is my home!

204
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:48,761
Don't move!

205
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:51,697
Why did you go in there?

206
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:55,033
To steal some food?

207
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,002
Listen, buddy, what did you say?

208
00:16:57,136 --> 00:16:58,804
Wait! Dong-hyun!

209
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:01,974
My boy may be thick-boned,

210
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,843
but he's not the type
to steal other people's food.

211
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:07,813
He injured his head recently,
so he's not himself,

212
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:10,449
so he must've mistaken it
for our home, right?

213
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:13,786
Since he's a minor,
we'll release him with a warning.

214
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:15,888
It's your last warning.

215
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:17,923
Of course! My apologies!

216
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:19,558
I'll teach him properly!

217
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:23,462
Dong-hyun, come on.
Sorry, officer!

218
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:37,776
Come out, you rascal.

219
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:43,449
This doesn't work.

220
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:45,217
I got it.

221
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:47,019
Huh? Excuse me.

222
00:17:51,023 --> 00:17:51,857
Hey, jerk!

223
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:53,959
What were you doing to my boss?

224
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:55,561
It's not what you think.

225
00:17:55,694 --> 00:17:57,062
Then what?

226
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,997
Did Yang send you?

227
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:02,167
You son of a... wait a minute...

228
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:04,703
you're fat... it's you!

229
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:06,338
The butterball!

230
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:09,007
You crushed my boss with your fat!

231
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:11,643
So savage!

232
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:15,047
Bring my boss back! Wake him up!

233
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:16,915
I hear you.

234
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:18,784
Let go.

235
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:20,452
Let what go, you nitwit!

236
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:21,920
What's going on?

237
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:22,921
This is ICU!

238
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:23,889
Let's talk later.

239
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:25,657
Hey! Butterball!

240
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:29,328
If I catch you again,
I'll smoke and grill you!

241
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:43,442
Go inside.

242
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:47,813
- Good.
- Thanks for hospitality.

243
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:51,250
I'll leave when I get
my own place.

244
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,819
This is your home, Dong-hyun!

245
00:18:54,386 --> 00:18:56,555
Why do you keep saying that?

246
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,892
You got a job?

247
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:03,128
Huh? I did.

248
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:06,265
I work at a grocery store
for the moment.

249
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,233
Wait.

250
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:15,174
A man must look tidy.

251
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,327
Go ahead and eat, son.

252
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:41,266
All this... by myself?

253
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:45,037
It's half your usual amount,

254
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,039
but I can cook more if you want.

255
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,142
You must be mistaken.

256
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:52,678
I don't eat junk food.

257
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:55,047
Give it a try.

258
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:57,916
These are your favorites.

259
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:02,888
Here, for the sake of my effort.

260
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:22,541
What's wrong?

261
00:20:27,246 --> 00:20:30,082
See? You love them.

262
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,761
I love that you eat so well,
my dear son.

263
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:46,965
So greasy...

264
00:20:51,103 --> 00:20:55,340
Get some sleep
and we'll go to school tomorrow.

265
00:20:56,942 --> 00:20:57,876
School?

266
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:01,847
I have to go
and see what exactly happened.

267
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:05,384
I can't let this slide.

268
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,721
How dare they do this to my son.

269
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,881
(Basic Carpentry)

270
00:21:52,064 --> 00:21:53,599
Mr. Vice Principal.

271
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:54,700
Hello.

272
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:57,236
Good to meet you, I'm Jang...

273
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:01,373
I mean Kim Dong-hyun.

274
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,410
Dong-hyun injured his head...

275
00:22:04,676 --> 00:22:05,811
I see.

276
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:07,813
- Please sit down.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:19,158
Dong-hyun, over there.

278
00:22:32,371 --> 00:22:38,243
I've been told
that he can't remember that day.

279
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:42,614
Did something happen at school?

280
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:45,651
He's not a boy
who'd attempt suicide.

281
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:47,486
Maybe he had a reason...

282
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:49,088
Are you implying that

283
00:22:49,221 --> 00:22:53,625
my students did something to him?

284
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:57,796
Well, who knows.

285
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:01,734
Mr. Kim,

286
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:04,703
I've told the police,

287
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:07,005
but nothing like that happened.

288
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:13,812
Hey, I'll look into it,
so you can go home.

289
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:16,014
What?

290
00:23:17,683 --> 00:23:19,318
Vice principal, right?

291
00:23:20,452 --> 00:23:22,254
Let me get back in class.

292
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:31,296
Quiet!

293
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:35,801
Dong-hyun's not fully himself
due to the accident,

294
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:38,537
so please help him out
until he recovers.

295
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:39,972
Yes, ma'am!

296
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,041
Go take a seat.

297
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:02,261
I had to cover for you
while you were away.

298
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:04,930
All right, open your books.

299
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:08,767
Jae-ik, share your book
with Dong-hyun.

300
00:24:12,638 --> 00:24:14,306
Page 111.

301
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,579
What's "adjust?"

302
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,514
Alter or regulate, right?

303
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:27,019
Then the correct answer is D,
right?

304
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:51,659
Imagine how I feel.

305
00:24:54,896 --> 00:24:55,930
Where's mine?

306
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:58,266
- So cute.
- What a cutie.

307
00:24:58,466 --> 00:24:59,667
It's Hyun-jung.

308
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:04,138
Not eating?

309
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:06,741
- Too bland?
- Maybe it's not good.

310
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,612
That looks delicious.

311
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:12,247
It's seasoned properly.

312
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,382
- Go on, eat.
- Eat.

313
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:22,423
Look at her poker face,
no reaction at all.

314
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:28,596
Stop it, please.

315
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:35,303
- Stop it.
- Please.

316
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:41,542
Oops, sorry. My mistake.

317
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:44,979
Hey, children!

318
00:25:45,914 --> 00:25:47,382
Let me eat in peace.

319
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,484
So eat, fatso!

320
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:51,686
Why does he need our permission?

321
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,390
He must be starved.

322
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,031
Is this happening?

323
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:07,468
This super loser must've
lost his mind as well.

324
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:09,304
Super loser?

325
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:12,173
Should I help you remember?

326
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:13,541
Hey!

327
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:15,577
What's going on there?

328
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:18,846
Those rascals.

329
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:21,616
See me after school.

330
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:35,129
Wow, he really came.

331
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,966
- Go easy, Tae-wook.
- Don't kill him.

332
00:26:47,742 --> 00:26:49,143
Who are you?

333
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:50,712
Who are you?

334
00:26:51,346 --> 00:26:53,715
You sure you don't
remember anything?

335
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:56,217
Talking like an idiot.

336
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:59,053
Buddy.

337
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:02,523
Nothing's changed,
listen carefully.

338
00:27:02,924 --> 00:27:05,126
Come see me at every break,

339
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:07,462
with a burger and strawberry milk.

340
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:16,704
Was I your so-called
snack delivery boy?

341
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:21,376
Are we not good together?

342
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:22,844
Need a beating?

343
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:24,379
Then you'll remember!

344
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:29,584
- You rascal!
- Sorry.

345
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:31,586
I don't like getting hit.

346
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:32,954
You crazy rascal!

347
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,225
Not again! Dang it!

348
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:38,192
Wait!

349
00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:42,230
I got a question.

350
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:49,304
Did this Dong-hyun bloke...

351
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:53,575
did he do anything to offend you?

352
00:27:53,808 --> 00:27:55,743
Listen to this guy.

353
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,246
There's no such thing,
you fat pig!

354
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:00,782
Which means,

355
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:03,084
in a word,

356
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:07,088
- he's easy?
- Yeah.

357
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:08,790
Not just easy,

358
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,492
he's too frigging easy!

359
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:19,133
Did you start going to the gym?

360
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:20,868
This joke is too much!

361
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:23,605
Kim Dong-hyun!

362
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:25,106
You okay?

363
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:28,276
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

364
00:28:28,476 --> 00:28:30,612
- You rascal!
- Hey! Stop!

365
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:32,614
Let me go!

366
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:46,461
Frigging jerk...

367
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,668
Did you see us yesterday?

368
00:28:54,135 --> 00:28:55,937
I didn't see anything...

369
00:28:57,972 --> 00:28:59,474
You rascal, you want to die?

370
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:01,376
I'll kill you if you're lying.

371
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:02,610
Buddy!

372
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:04,245
This guy's got big balls.

373
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:07,315
Let's strip him
and film him as insurance.

374
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:08,917
That's a good idea.

375
00:29:09,484 --> 00:29:10,818
No, please!

376
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:13,855
This isn't sound between friends!

377
00:29:13,988 --> 00:29:15,623
What did this idiot say?

378
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:16,791
Strip him.

379
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:17,825
Hold still, Jae-ik.

380
00:29:17,926 --> 00:29:19,093
- Here we go.
- Wait a minute!

381
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:20,595
- Don't move.
- Please, don't!

382
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:23,364
Dong-hyun...

383
00:29:46,354 --> 00:29:48,156
Give me that, you fat idiot!

384
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:49,691
What?

385
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:52,427
Give it back before I hurt you!

386
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:54,462
Is there something
I shouldn't see?

387
00:29:54,596 --> 00:29:55,663
Give it to me!

388
00:29:56,564 --> 00:29:58,132
You okay? Dude!

389
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,102
I'll return it tomorrow.

390
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:02,237
What do we do?

391
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:03,938
Tomorrow for sure!

392
00:30:20,822 --> 00:30:22,924
This is Kim Dong-hyun,
how about a comment?

393
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:27,662
I... I just have to bring
that back?

394
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:31,032
Yup.

395
00:30:31,132 --> 00:30:33,434
I won't bother Hyun-jung again,
I promise.

396
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:35,670
But walk all the way down
that rail

397
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,907
to retrieve her shoe.

398
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:40,808
Then it's mission clear.

399
00:30:40,942 --> 00:30:42,510
Hey, what are you doing?

400
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:45,113
Dong-hyun, stop it!

401
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:47,548
He's going all out
to get your shoe.

402
00:30:47,782 --> 00:30:49,350
It's really dangerous!

403
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,019
It's really dangerous!

404
00:30:58,993 --> 00:31:02,864
And I was right below?

405
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,572
Did I tell you to delete
that video or not?

406
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,674
That loser won't do anything.

407
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,043
Hey, high school boys!

408
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,855
You fat jerk, give me my phone!

409
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,664
Interesting video.

410
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:42,767
So what?

411
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:45,736
Going to take it to the cops?

412
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:51,842
You gained balls
after smashing your head.

413
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,914
I'm not a big fan of cops either.

414
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:00,885
Nor getting involved
in other people's affairs.

415
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,154
Other people's affairs?

416
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,158
I made a copy, as insurance.

417
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,703
Stay out of my sight.

418
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,905
Got it?

419
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,538
You're finally here!

420
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,742
Dang it, I almost died waiting!

421
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:00,678
Mrs. Jang! Good evening!

422
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:01,779
Yang?

423
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,415
Choi, have you been well?

424
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,250
Zip up, man.

425
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,918
Just kidding.

426
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,291
What's going on here?

427
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,360
Yo, bring it!

428
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:21,699
My boys took a lot
of photos of you two,

429
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,102
so I was going to send them
to Chairman Han.

430
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:27,171
This is nasty! So much skin!

431
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,641
You know how much
your father hates affairs.

432
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,044
He's got a weird moral compass.

433
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:35,179
What should I do with this?

434
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,881
What do you want?

435
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,102
Who ordered you to guard him?

436
00:33:58,235 --> 00:33:59,637
You fat twit!

437
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,441
Didn't I tell you I'd grill you?

438
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,177
Should I get the BBQ ready?

439
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,987
- Stupid rascal!
- Bang Man-cheol!

440
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,090
43-years old, single,
DB Community College graduate.

441
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,658
Began working for Hanho Group

442
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:21,726
on October 21, 2001.

443
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:24,729
Promoted to supervisor
in February, 2004.

444
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,397
How did you know?

445
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,166
Because I'm Jang Pan-soo.

446
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,405
Bull, my boss is over there.

447
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,606
Your eye,

448
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,575
was slashed with a broken bottle

449
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,443
at 11 PM, March 21, 2005.

450
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:42,079
20 stitches at Jinsung Hospital,

451
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:45,016
costing me $385.20.

452
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,052
How did you...

453
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,733
I received the wrong grace.

454
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,715
You sure eat a lot.

455
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,519
My appetite won't die down.

456
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,527
What is it?

457
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,163
Those eyes...

458
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,701
you really are my boss.

459
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:38,969
My apologies.

460
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,341
When else would I pinch
your cheeks?

461
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,578
Why are you guarding me every day?

462
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,918
There's a rumor
about Yang's next move,

463
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,355
that he's after your life.

464
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,866
Don't worry.

465
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,935
I'll return to my body.

466
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,603
No matter what.

467
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,705
But you shouldn't.

468
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:15,906
What?

469
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,576
You obtained a fresh new body.

470
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:26,183
Well, doing military service again
could be drawback,

471
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:30,721
but it's better than
being a veggie.

472
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,296
Don't eat.

473
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,371
Meet us at Burger Prince

474
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,807
after 7th period, okay?

475
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,941
Burger Prince.

476
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,077
We have some proposals.

477
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,247
Sorry, but I have
student council meetings later.

478
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,051
We got plenty of time,
we can wait until midnight.

479
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,219
I can't do that.

480
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,722
- Of course you can.
- We're good at waiting.

481
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:09,293
Could you step aside?
She can't walk through.

482
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,931
Go ahead.

483
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,534
She stinks up the hallway
whenever she walks by.

484
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:19,203
- What?
- Stop it.

485
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,372
It's nothing.

486
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:26,410
I'm going to quit school.
Find me a place to stay.

487
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,646
Right away, boss?

488
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,616
I figured out the cause,
so no need to stay any longer.

489
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,786
And the boy's father's a bit much.

490
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,421
You should stay a while.

491
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:41,025
Enjoy the youth
and school meals too.

492
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,194
What the heck?

493
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,400
Hey, kiddo!

494
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,039
Take this.

495
00:37:59,907 --> 00:38:01,709
Do you resent me or something?

496
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,946
I told you not to get involved.

497
00:38:06,513 --> 00:38:07,915
You did all that for nothing.

498
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:11,485
I'm sorry, I don't remember well.

499
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:14,421
Hyun-jung!

500
00:38:19,293 --> 00:38:21,695
Where did you go
after skipping class yesterday?

501
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:25,432
You didn't even come by to eat.

502
00:38:27,568 --> 00:38:30,070
I can't eat at the bar.

503
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,707
You can eat before
the drinkers come in.

505
00:38:37,411 --> 00:38:38,445
Mi-sun?

506
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:41,181
Wait, Dong-hyun?

507
00:38:41,382 --> 00:38:43,384
Hey, kiddo! It's been so long!

508
00:38:43,651 --> 00:38:47,254
You look so much better
since I last saw you!

509

He injured his head recently
and lost his memories.

510
00:38:50,691 --> 00:38:51,925
Go home.

511
00:38:52,426 --> 00:38:53,427
Stay for a meal.

512
00:38:53,694 --> 00:38:56,964
Mi-sun, why are you here?

513
00:38:58,065 --> 00:38:59,667
Where...

514
00:39:01,935 --> 00:39:03,537
are your manners?

515
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:06,273
How dare you call an adult
by the first name!

516
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,777
He injured his head,
he's not himself!

517
00:39:09,977 --> 00:39:12,179
That has nothing
to do with manners!

518
00:39:12,846 --> 00:39:14,548
You little brat!

519
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:17,484
Am I your pal or something?

520
00:39:18,485 --> 00:39:19,753
Run! Go!

521
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:35,035
Mi-sun...

522
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:38,672
is Hyun-jung's mom?

523
00:39:52,353 --> 00:39:54,488
Are you dying for a beating?

524
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,860
You've got a foul mouth
for a newscaster hopeful.

525
00:40:28,555 --> 00:40:30,124
There's, uh...

526
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:33,627
something on your hair...

527
00:40:35,095 --> 00:40:36,397
Ow! What are you doing?

528
00:40:38,766 --> 00:40:41,869
Dong-hyun grabbed
Hyun-jung's hair.

529
00:40:42,136 --> 00:40:43,070
I'm sorry.

530
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:53,247

It's too dangerous!

534

She's... my daughter?

535

That's what the science says,
99.9% positive.

537
00:41:33,187 --> 00:41:36,390
She is definitely your daughter.

538

It's an awkward situation,

539
00:41:43,497 --> 00:41:46,433

Is something wrong?

00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:09,990
- Bugger!
- What is it?

Hey!

Did you steal my lip stain?

549
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,314
It wasn't me.

550
00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:31,051

Only you stayed behind
during gym class!

552
00:42:37,357 --> 00:42:40,894
Yoon-ji, it's useless now.

553
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:42,830
Anything she touches rots.

554
00:42:44,598 --> 00:42:46,767
- I stole it!
- What?

555
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:54,641
I've always wanted one,
so I took it.

556
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,045
You stole it?

557
00:42:58,312 --> 00:42:59,880
He went full crazy.

558
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:01,482
Then show me.

559
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:03,250
I put some on and tossed it.

560
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:06,119
It wasn't my color.

561
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:10,924
Stupid idiot.

562
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:13,827
Pervert?

563
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:16,497
What's going on?
Back to your seats.

564
00:43:21,835 --> 00:43:23,871
Turn to page 206.

565
00:43:24,805 --> 00:43:27,808
Invasion of Japan
and deployment of national guards.

566
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:42,656
4 targets.

567
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:45,025
Break one limb each.

568
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:47,227
Show no mercy.

569
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,866
But boss...

570
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:55,936
I don't think this is right...

571
00:43:56,537 --> 00:43:58,705
minors aren't my field
of expertise.

572
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:02,176
So, you won't do it?

573
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:07,281
I think you should consult
with her directly.

574
00:44:27,935 --> 00:44:30,504
My baby is a loner?

575
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:32,673
Because of me?

576
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:35,275
Not just because of you.

577
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:40,247
It's complicated,
with her grades and all.

578
00:44:40,914 --> 00:44:43,484
I should call her teacher--

579
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:47,554
It looked like the teachers
were overlooking it

580
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,890
to avoid any problems.

581
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:52,292
Then...

582
00:44:53,994 --> 00:44:55,395
what am I supposed to do?

583
00:44:57,231 --> 00:45:00,200
Um, I came here
to consult you about it.

584
00:45:09,776 --> 00:45:11,745
It's all my fault...

585
00:45:12,613 --> 00:45:15,616
I shouldn't have raised her
as a single mother.

586
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:19,853
Jang Pan-soo, that rascal!

587
00:45:21,688 --> 00:45:24,591
Hope he rots in hell!

588
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:27,561
I bet he's enjoying
a blissful life.

589
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:31,999
Not knowing
how his own kid is suffering.

590
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:36,436
Then, how about...

591
00:45:37,437 --> 00:45:39,306
I take care of the situation?

592
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:40,674
You?

593
00:45:42,008 --> 00:45:45,411
If I talk openly with the kids,

594
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:47,477
maybe it could help.

595
00:45:52,973 --> 00:45:57,711
Pan-soo embezzled $3 million?

596
00:46:03,984 --> 00:46:06,153
Check for yourself, Dad.

597
00:46:17,664 --> 00:46:19,966
(Transaction Record:
Total - $3 million)

598
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:29,576
What...

599
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:35,482
can I do to...

600
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:39,753
become close to my kid?

601
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:45,325
I'm still single...

602
00:46:46,193 --> 00:46:47,027
Right.

603
00:46:47,794 --> 00:46:52,966
I think physical affection
could be the best solution.

604
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:58,405
Plus, it helps body and mind.

605
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:00,307
Is that so?

606
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:05,612
By the way, boss.

607
00:47:07,414 --> 00:47:10,150
You should work
on this body a bit.

608
00:47:11,485 --> 00:47:13,520
Before you return to your body,

609
00:47:13,687 --> 00:47:18,358
diabetes and high blood pressure
could get you first.

610
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:36,643
The doors are closing.

611
00:47:46,787 --> 00:47:47,721
It was you?

612
00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:51,391
You told my mom to send me here?

613
00:47:52,492 --> 00:47:54,094
What do you mean?

614
00:47:54,795 --> 00:47:57,030
I came here to lose weight.

615
00:47:59,399 --> 00:48:01,334
I can't do this with you here.

616
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:03,069
I'm going to go.

617
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:05,639
Says who?

618
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:13,847
I'm your trainer, Master Bang.

619
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,352
Could I just get a refund?

620
00:48:19,486 --> 00:48:20,954
Shut your mouth, girl!

621
00:48:21,154 --> 00:48:25,725
There's no refund,
no absence, no mercy!

622
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,104
You won't get away with this.

623
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:39,773
I sure will.

624
00:49:04,831 --> 00:49:06,766
Keep your eyes wide open.

625
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,602
Not like that!

626
00:49:08,768 --> 00:49:09,603
Look.

627
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:12,973
Your waist, use your waist!

628
00:49:13,373 --> 00:49:14,674
Shut up and go away.

629
00:49:14,975 --> 00:49:15,809
Fight!

630
00:49:19,412 --> 00:49:20,247
Ow!

631
00:49:24,184 --> 00:49:25,085
Do it right!

632
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:28,955
Come in! Good!

633
00:49:29,723 --> 00:49:30,624
Keep going!

634
00:49:34,027 --> 00:49:34,961
You okay?

635
00:49:47,707 --> 00:49:48,608
One more.

636
00:51:23,673 --> 00:51:25,875
Why do you have to eat ramen
at my place?

637
00:51:25,975 --> 00:51:28,311
I'm starving to death, okay?

638
00:52:11,621 --> 00:52:13,022
Wait a bit.

639
00:52:13,222 --> 00:52:14,057
Sure.

640
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:24,133
(My Child Can Be Happy
Even Without Dad)

641
00:52:30,873 --> 00:52:32,575
(Would we be happy
if he was here...)

642
00:52:47,523 --> 00:52:52,095
We're eating steaks tonight,
wait for me, my son!

643
00:52:52,228 --> 00:52:53,396
Jong-ki!

644
00:52:53,496 --> 00:52:55,198
Made some money?

645
00:53:04,274 --> 00:53:06,075
Boys, don't hit his face.

646
00:53:14,617 --> 00:53:15,685
What's that?

647
00:53:15,785 --> 00:53:17,420
If you give me
a little more time...

648
00:53:17,553 --> 00:53:19,255
But there isn't any!

649
00:53:22,058 --> 00:53:23,860
Hey, muscle heads!

650
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:26,162
Muscle heads?

651
00:53:26,596 --> 00:53:28,831
We got a brave kid.

652
00:53:29,632 --> 00:53:30,600
Who are you?

653
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:31,935
And you?

654
00:53:33,903 --> 00:53:34,837
Kiddo!

655
00:53:35,905 --> 00:53:38,041
He's got a loan
he needs to pay back.

656
00:53:38,141 --> 00:53:39,542
Head on home now!

657
00:53:40,276 --> 00:53:44,347
Using violence is so 20th Century.

658
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:47,383
Dong-hyun, go home, okay?

659
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:48,484
Your son?

660
00:53:49,218 --> 00:53:50,687
Boy! Come here.

661
00:53:50,787 --> 00:53:52,822
- You come here.
- Did you hear that?

662
00:53:52,956 --> 00:53:55,725
Dong-hyun, listen to me!

663
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:56,960
Go home!

664
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,896
How did you raise him?
Look at his attitude!

665
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:01,864
Watch your own attitude.

666
00:54:02,098 --> 00:54:04,267
I've had it with this twit.

667
00:54:04,634 --> 00:54:05,635
God darn it!

668
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:09,205
For goodness' sake!

669
00:54:10,607 --> 00:54:13,176
Dong-hyun! No! Please!

670
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:14,877
Dong-hyun, no, not him!

671
00:54:14,978 --> 00:54:16,346
Step on him! The kid.

672
00:54:16,479 --> 00:54:17,547
Let me go!

673
00:54:18,348 --> 00:54:20,016
Kick that little scoundrel!

674
00:54:21,117 --> 00:54:22,552
That's enough, stop it!

675
00:54:23,186 --> 00:54:24,954
What a tenacious twit.

676
00:54:26,022 --> 00:54:30,793
I'll give you 1 week,
call me with $80,000.

677
00:54:39,269 --> 00:54:40,403
Get off of me.

678
00:54:41,704 --> 00:54:42,705
They're gone.

679
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:46,509
Mister, can you hear me?

680
00:54:54,317 --> 00:54:56,786
Hey, Kim Jong-ki.

681
00:54:57,787 --> 00:54:58,788
Wake up!

682
00:55:09,032 --> 00:55:09,899
Who are you?

683
00:55:10,066 --> 00:55:11,668
- Got a boyfriend?
- What?

684
00:55:12,402 --> 00:55:13,469
Close your eyes.

685
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:17,106
What's with the commotion?

686
00:55:17,907 --> 00:55:20,143
Who's Choi Dong-gu?

687
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:21,644
Hand up.

688
00:55:21,744 --> 00:55:24,347
That'd be me,
who the heck are you?

689
00:55:42,398 --> 00:55:43,266
Hand.

690
00:56:24,774 --> 00:56:29,112
You have a client
named Kim Jong-ki.

691
00:56:29,245 --> 00:56:30,079
Yes, yes, yes.

692
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,883
Let's lightly erase his debt.

693
00:56:36,286 --> 00:56:38,788
It's not a small amount,
we can't just erase it.

694
00:56:39,422 --> 00:56:41,357
Never used white-out in school?

695
00:56:43,459 --> 00:56:46,095
If it summed up to $80K
over 2 years...

696
00:56:46,296 --> 00:56:48,564
The principal must've been
about $5K, no?

697
00:56:49,065 --> 00:56:51,501
Yes, you are indeed correct,

698
00:56:51,634 --> 00:56:54,037
but that's still...

699
00:56:54,504 --> 00:56:57,140
You know Don Jang
of Hanho Partners?

700
00:56:57,974 --> 00:56:59,976
Of course I do.

701
00:57:00,877 --> 00:57:02,378
But what about him?

702
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:05,949
Kim Jong-ki is his father.

703
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:10,420
What?

704
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:16,826
It's okay.

705
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:19,662
Just accept it.

706
00:57:20,029 --> 00:57:21,497
But that doesn't...

707
00:57:27,103 --> 00:57:30,073
What's this? This is amazing!

708
00:57:30,206 --> 00:57:31,307
Incredible!

709
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,922
How are you feeling?

710
00:57:48,992 --> 00:57:50,827
If I pass out,

711
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,297
you should take me
to the hospital, you know.

712
00:57:57,233 --> 00:57:59,269
I got a call from the loan sharks.

713
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:02,672
They'll drop the interest.

714
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:08,645
My defensive strategy worked.

715
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,581
So what?

716
00:58:14,584 --> 00:58:15,919
Hey, son!

717
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:20,990
Don't lose so much weight.

718
00:58:22,325 --> 00:58:24,827
You're handsome as is.

719
00:58:29,699 --> 00:58:31,000
Hot, that's hot!

720
00:58:32,902 --> 00:58:33,870
So hot!

721
00:58:35,338 --> 00:58:36,906
Teacher! Teacher!

722
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:54,057
- Dang it.
- Sorry.

723
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,793
Screw that,
my lunch is all rotten now.

724
00:58:56,926 --> 00:58:58,027
My gosh...

725
00:58:58,494 --> 00:58:59,829
you stink like crazy.

726
00:59:00,797 --> 00:59:02,165
Want a new plate?

727
00:59:02,398 --> 00:59:03,499
Forget it.

728
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,234
What if it's not rotten?

729
00:59:05,335 --> 00:59:06,269
What?

730
00:59:06,436 --> 00:59:07,804
Want to bet $100?

731
00:59:08,404 --> 00:59:10,673
Here, you eat first.

732
00:59:14,944 --> 00:59:17,180
What did you just say?

733
00:59:21,217 --> 00:59:22,385
Are you nuts?

734
00:59:31,094 --> 00:59:34,230
You freakin' trying to be cool?

735
00:59:34,397 --> 00:59:37,267
So desperate to mess up
your school life?

736
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,703
Doesn't matter,
it's already messed up.

737
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:43,840
But I'd like to change that.

738
00:59:48,144 --> 00:59:49,112
Dang it!

739
00:59:56,999 --> 00:59:58,034
Dig in.

740
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,436
I'm treating you
for helping Hyun-jung's problem.

741
01:00:00,569 --> 01:00:01,704
Is this...

742
01:00:02,204 --> 01:00:05,441
It's Mackerel ramen.
Not sure if it's your taste.

743
01:00:18,854 --> 01:00:22,725
I used to eat this a lot
with someone.

744
01:00:25,194 --> 01:00:28,464
It's great,
you should put this on the menu.

745
01:00:29,899 --> 01:00:30,766
No way.

746
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,336
Don't need a reminder of him.

747
01:00:34,303 --> 01:00:35,304
Him?

748
01:00:36,572 --> 01:00:37,807
Hyun-jung's dad.

749
01:00:41,777 --> 01:00:44,680
Things ended badly with him?

750
01:00:49,485 --> 01:00:53,456
I still regret it
when I think about him.

751
01:00:58,694 --> 01:01:01,497
What regret?

752
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:05,601
Not killing him.

753
01:01:08,371 --> 01:01:09,205
I'm sorry.

754
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:18,481
Actually, you remind me
of him quite a bit.

755
01:01:20,816 --> 01:01:24,020
He used to wipe everything down.

756
01:01:29,225 --> 01:01:32,495
I'll pack you a few dishes
so you can go eat with your dad.

757
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:34,997
Thank you.

758
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:39,335
Ma'am!

759
01:01:39,702 --> 01:01:41,637
- A Soju, please.
- Sure thing.

760
01:01:41,771 --> 01:01:43,706
Where did you go?

761
01:01:44,173 --> 01:01:45,408
I had a guest.

762
01:01:47,376 --> 01:01:49,078
I was saying...

763
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,814
Here you go.

764
01:01:52,615 --> 01:01:55,184
- Hey!
- Firm butt!

765
01:01:57,019 --> 01:01:57,887
What was that?

766
01:01:59,288 --> 01:02:01,324
Ma'am, is this your son?

767
01:02:01,724 --> 01:02:06,362
Your mom's pretty,
so I touched her.

768
01:02:08,464 --> 01:02:09,498
Got a death wish?

769
01:02:09,966 --> 01:02:13,736
How dare you bark at the customer!

770
01:02:14,103 --> 01:02:15,538
Don't want to make money?

771
01:02:15,638 --> 01:02:17,840
Don't yell at the boy!

772
01:02:17,974 --> 01:02:19,342
You witch!

773
01:02:20,943 --> 01:02:22,078
Let him go!

774
01:02:22,211 --> 01:02:23,045
Dong-hyun...

775
01:02:23,212 --> 01:02:24,880
Go inside, I'll take care of this.

776
01:02:25,014 --> 01:02:25,848
You go home, all right?

777
01:02:25,982 --> 01:02:28,050
Bugger, that's so sweet, eh?

778
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,555
Mi-sun, are you okay?

779
01:02:33,923 --> 01:02:36,025
Get in the kitchen. Now.

780
01:02:36,425 --> 01:02:37,793
- You...
- Listen to me.

781
01:02:41,497 --> 01:02:42,898
How dare you...

782
01:02:42,999 --> 01:02:47,236
If you're drunk, you rascal,
you should head home.

783
01:02:49,305 --> 01:02:51,173
Look at this punk.

784
01:02:53,075 --> 01:02:54,210
You good for nothing!

785
01:02:59,081 --> 01:03:01,417
You grabbed my woman's hair?

786
01:03:03,285 --> 01:03:04,420
Who are you?

787
01:03:04,654 --> 01:03:06,222
You sleeping with her?

788
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,766
Stop, please!

789
01:03:18,634 --> 01:03:20,403
You'll kill him!

790
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:25,975
Who are you?

791
01:03:29,245 --> 01:03:30,780
Answer me!

792
01:03:34,216 --> 01:03:37,253
Why do you keep calling me Mi-sun?

793
01:03:44,794 --> 01:03:47,296
You expect me to believe that?

794
01:03:48,564 --> 01:03:51,167
You body-swapped
after an accident?

795
01:03:55,638 --> 01:04:02,945
Yes, I admit that you talk
and act like him.

796
01:04:03,279 --> 01:04:06,082
But that doesn't mean
you're Jang Pan-soo.

797
01:04:07,283 --> 01:04:10,386
You have a small peach-shaped mole
by your belly button.

798
01:04:10,987 --> 01:04:11,821
What?

799
01:04:12,221 --> 01:04:16,058
Want me to tell you about
more intimate spots?

800
01:04:18,894 --> 01:04:19,895
Wait...

801
01:04:23,733 --> 01:04:26,836
which restaurant did we
first meet?

802
01:04:27,236 --> 01:04:28,638
Arpeggio in Yeonnam,

803
01:04:29,005 --> 01:04:32,174
you ordered a caffé latte,
I ordered a Bud.

804
01:04:33,743 --> 01:04:34,777
Where did we break up?

805
01:04:34,877 --> 01:04:36,178
Coffee shop in Sinsa Hotel.

806
01:04:36,979 --> 01:04:40,850
The last time we met,
you ordered a lemon tea.

807
01:04:42,251 --> 01:04:43,219
Are you...

808
01:04:45,554 --> 01:04:46,922
really Jang Pan-soo?

809
01:04:48,224 --> 01:04:49,058
Yes.

810
01:04:52,528 --> 01:04:55,965
Why didn't you tell me
you were pregnant?

811
01:04:57,833 --> 01:04:59,201
Sorry, but she's not your child.

812
01:04:59,335 --> 01:05:01,103
I already did a paternity test.

813
01:05:04,373 --> 01:05:06,342
Right, that's what
Jang Pan-soo would do.

814
01:05:09,645 --> 01:05:10,946
My turn to ask.

815
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,883
Why show up here out of the blue?

816
01:05:14,283 --> 01:05:16,085
We were long over.

817
01:05:16,652 --> 01:05:17,887
You thought I'd be moved

818
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:20,089
if you kicked out a few drunks?

819
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,258
You'd still be...

820
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,261
a gangster.

821
01:05:27,363 --> 01:05:28,798
And get it straight,

822
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:32,401
I did not raise your kid,

823
01:05:32,535 --> 01:05:34,337
I raised my own.

824
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:38,274
You don't deserve to be a father.

825
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:41,844
Leave.

826
01:05:42,678 --> 01:05:44,480
- Mi-sun, listen...
- Get out!

827
01:05:46,649 --> 01:05:48,084
Should I call the police?

828
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
[VIU Ver]
Ripped by Soultreeagasshi

829
01:06:09,171 --> 01:06:10,939
You never answered my calls...

830
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,644
you even moved away.

831
01:06:16,078 --> 01:06:18,080
You said you can't live
with a criminal.

832
01:06:18,213 --> 01:06:19,281
Of course!

833
01:06:19,415 --> 01:06:20,249
What kind of woman

834
01:06:20,382 --> 01:06:22,384
wants his man to be a criminal?

835
01:06:22,684 --> 01:06:23,886
That's why.

836
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,922
I told you
our paths are different.

837
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:36,965
I'm getting married next month,
to my boss' daughter.

838
01:06:39,034 --> 01:06:40,002
What?

839
01:06:40,169 --> 01:06:42,371
Leave memories in the past.

840
01:06:42,805 --> 01:06:44,940
No need to get pathetic
and worked up.

841
01:06:45,474 --> 01:06:46,675
Pan-soo...

842
01:06:48,343 --> 01:06:49,344
I'm leaving.

843
01:07:10,566 --> 01:07:14,036
Did you say something wrong
to my mom again?

844
01:07:14,503 --> 01:07:16,438
She told me to stay away from you.

845
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:25,681
I made a big mistake

846
01:07:27,015 --> 01:07:28,450
to your mom.

847
01:07:30,919 --> 01:07:33,922
You called her
by her first name again?

848
01:07:36,959 --> 01:07:39,061
You're Oh Hyun-jung, right?

849
01:07:41,663 --> 01:07:42,498
Um, yeah...

850
01:07:42,598 --> 01:07:44,767
Want to come to my birthday party

851
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,235
at my villa this weekend?

852
01:07:48,337 --> 01:07:51,373
I want to throw the last party
before we become seniors.

853
01:07:52,174 --> 01:07:54,076
I can come?

854
01:07:55,577 --> 01:07:56,645
Of course!

855
01:07:57,813 --> 01:07:59,882
I'll take that as a yes
and call you later.

856
01:08:03,485 --> 01:08:04,386
Let's go.

857
01:08:06,155 --> 01:08:08,123
Someone you like?

858
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:11,694
No way.

859
01:08:13,562 --> 01:08:16,365
He must be, you're blushing.

860
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:17,866
No way!

861
01:08:23,138 --> 01:08:24,039
I'm off.

862
01:08:57,106 --> 01:08:58,874
(Please see me, I'm begging you)

863
01:09:23,165 --> 01:09:23,999
You came.

864
01:09:24,133 --> 01:09:27,569
Uh, happy birthday.

865
01:09:28,037 --> 01:09:28,937
Thank you.

866
01:09:29,772 --> 01:09:30,906
Shall we?

867
01:09:33,642 --> 01:09:35,177
Hey, hi.

868
01:09:35,677 --> 01:09:36,945
Get us some grilled meat.

869
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:38,380
Sure, go inside.

870
01:09:40,382 --> 01:09:42,084
Why isn't he here yet?

871
01:09:43,085 --> 01:09:44,586
What took you so long?

872
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:50,125
You promised me
I'd get weekends off.

873
01:09:50,259 --> 01:09:51,093
Yo!

874
01:09:51,226 --> 01:09:53,562
Whine again
and I'll call Cheol-ho.

875
01:09:53,729 --> 01:09:54,897
Leave that and piss off.

876
01:09:55,664 --> 01:09:57,466
Hyun-jung must be
having a blast by now.

877
01:09:57,566 --> 01:09:59,301
She was so happy to be invited.

878
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:02,638
She's so clueless, stupid witch.

879
01:10:03,305 --> 01:10:04,973
She deserves it.

880
01:10:13,849 --> 01:10:14,917
You came.

881
01:10:25,294 --> 01:10:26,295
What'd you like?

882
01:10:27,696 --> 01:10:28,897
Anything.

883
01:10:29,131 --> 01:10:32,434
Caffé latte for her
and a Bud for me.

884
01:10:33,702 --> 01:10:35,204
May I see your ID?

885
01:10:37,406 --> 01:10:41,610
I'll take the Bud
and an orange juice for him.

886
01:10:42,144 --> 01:10:42,978
Sure.

887
01:10:46,014 --> 01:10:47,383
What do you have to say?

888
01:10:48,817 --> 01:10:52,755
I know you won't forgive me

889
01:10:54,022 --> 01:10:55,691
no matter what I say.

890
01:10:57,226 --> 01:11:00,596
But I want you to know

891
01:11:02,498 --> 01:11:06,935
that I regret it deeply
and I am sorry.

892
01:11:12,374 --> 01:11:14,209
If it wasn't for this...

893
01:11:16,245 --> 01:11:19,048
if this unbelievable thing
didn't happen,

894
01:11:19,815 --> 01:11:22,184
would you have apologized?

895
01:11:23,018 --> 01:11:24,920
Or even looked for me?

896
01:11:26,121 --> 01:11:28,223
You lived just fine until now.

897
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,327
Wasn't I someone

898
01:11:33,328 --> 01:11:38,067
you wanted to erase
from your life?

899
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,334
Mi-sun.

900
01:11:39,435 --> 01:11:41,236
What's the point, then?

901
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,238
You're a married man!

902
01:11:45,941 --> 01:11:47,876
I just...

903
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:52,081
Don't make me more miserable.

904
01:12:06,795 --> 01:12:08,597
Mi-sun, what I...

905
01:12:08,797 --> 01:12:10,065
You rascal!

906
01:12:20,242 --> 01:12:23,379
Mi-sun, please,
listen to me, okay?

907
01:12:23,812 --> 01:12:25,481
Just once, please?

908
01:12:28,283 --> 01:12:30,219
I'm sorry, I really am.

909
01:12:32,454 --> 01:12:33,922
How dare you kiss me!

910
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:38,327
Do I look that easy?

911
01:12:39,795 --> 01:12:41,964
You're driving me mad.

912
01:12:43,799 --> 01:12:46,235
Come. Let's go to the police.

913
01:12:46,835 --> 01:12:48,570
Wait, don't go overboard.

914
01:12:53,008 --> 01:12:53,842
What is it?

915
01:12:53,976 --> 01:12:56,078
I just heard something,

916
01:12:56,245 --> 01:12:58,213
Hyun-jung may be in trouble.

917
01:12:58,447 --> 01:12:59,448
Where?

918
01:13:03,685 --> 01:13:05,721
We'll have to go
to the station later.

919
01:13:06,488 --> 01:13:07,856
I got an urgent matter.

920
01:13:08,757 --> 01:13:09,725
Hey!

921
01:13:10,325 --> 01:13:11,593
Bang?

922
01:13:11,894 --> 01:13:13,195
Bring me a car ASAP.

923
01:13:15,798 --> 01:13:21,136
Dong-hyun,
we're not old enough to drive.

924
01:13:21,704 --> 01:13:23,939
Shut up and give me directions.

925
01:13:25,474 --> 01:13:26,842
Is this the right way?

926
01:13:28,277 --> 01:13:30,212
It is, but...

927
01:13:31,146 --> 01:13:33,449
Cheol-ho will kill me.

928
01:13:34,983 --> 01:13:37,419
Better than getting killed by me.

929
01:13:42,624 --> 01:13:44,159
- Are you okay?
- Don't!

930
01:13:58,006 --> 01:13:59,007
Here.

931
01:13:59,274 --> 01:14:00,142
Drink.

932
01:14:00,476 --> 01:14:01,410
Bottoms up.

933
01:14:02,277 --> 01:14:04,913
No, thanks, I don't drink.

934
01:14:06,482 --> 01:14:08,450
You can't back out now.

935
01:14:09,318 --> 01:14:11,387
Everyone's watching,
save me some face.

936
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:15,457
How does me drinking this
save you face?

937
01:14:16,658 --> 01:14:19,161
We put on this party for you,

938
01:14:19,294 --> 01:14:20,929
so don't disappoint us.

939
01:14:22,064 --> 01:14:23,999
Just go with it, okay?

940
01:14:26,802 --> 01:14:28,804
What do you mean?

941
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,742
Come on, drink.

942
01:14:36,178 --> 01:14:37,846
God darn it...

943
01:14:46,955 --> 01:14:49,725
why would anyone invite
a loser loner like you?

944
01:14:50,983 --> 01:14:53,785
Cheol-ho recommended a loser
who wouldn't retaliate.

945
01:14:53,885 --> 01:14:56,989
Who do you think you are?

946
01:14:57,155 --> 01:14:58,090
You witch.

947
01:15:00,692 --> 01:15:02,928
Don't you know who his father is?

948
01:15:03,662 --> 01:15:04,529
Forget it.

949
01:15:28,387 --> 01:15:29,254
Can I help you?

950
01:15:29,388 --> 01:15:30,422
This is a members only...

951
01:15:35,794 --> 01:15:36,895
Did you see that?

952
01:15:57,015 --> 01:15:57,916
Dong-hyun!

953
01:16:06,091 --> 01:16:07,292
Who are you?

954
01:16:07,659 --> 01:16:08,794
What's all this?

955
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:11,596
We're just having some fun.

956
01:16:13,765 --> 01:16:15,701
Let's go, you don't belong here.

957
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:17,235
Where are you going?

958
01:16:17,969 --> 01:16:19,338
We're just getting started,

959
01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:20,572
she can't leave now.

960
01:16:21,773 --> 01:16:22,607
Boys.

961
01:16:23,175 --> 01:16:24,376
Dong-hyun!

962
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:27,546
Bunch of little brats.

963
01:16:27,746 --> 01:16:29,781
Did you lose your brain

964
01:16:30,449 --> 01:16:32,017
after bumping your head?

965
01:16:32,651 --> 01:16:34,553
Get him.

966
01:16:37,089 --> 01:16:38,590
Who the heck are you?

967
01:16:41,526 --> 01:16:43,729
Hey, what's up?

968
01:17:10,055 --> 01:17:11,857
He's a god darn maniac!

969
01:17:20,565 --> 01:17:23,535
My punch tastes different, huh?

970
01:17:24,469 --> 01:17:25,904
Cute twit.

971
01:17:27,939 --> 01:17:28,874
You.

972
01:17:30,409 --> 01:17:31,410
Try me.

973
01:17:37,649 --> 01:17:39,084
Cheol-ho! Get it together!

974
01:17:39,785 --> 01:17:42,220
I'm fine, I just slipped.

975
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:45,257
Come on!

976
01:17:47,926 --> 01:17:49,094
Oh, no!

977
01:17:50,929 --> 01:17:52,130
He's so cool.

978
01:18:01,773 --> 01:18:03,008
For goodness' sake!

979
01:18:17,589 --> 01:18:20,192
Dress neatly, huh?

980
01:18:25,931 --> 01:18:27,632
Let me go, you rascal!

981
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:30,268
You want to die?

982
01:18:30,569 --> 01:18:32,471
Going to hit me?

983
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:34,506
Try me, fool.

984
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:36,308
You crazy witch.

985
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:47,786
Help me!

986
01:18:49,421 --> 01:18:51,423
I can't swim! Help!

987
01:18:54,126 --> 01:18:55,060
You okay?

988
01:18:56,061 --> 01:18:56,895
Yeah.

989
01:18:58,664 --> 01:19:00,532
Well done. Let's get out of here.

990
01:19:12,444 --> 01:19:13,445
What's this?

991
01:19:13,578 --> 01:19:16,381
By chairman's order,
no one is allowed inside.

992
01:19:29,544 --> 01:19:33,548
Everyone thinks
that you got into an accident

993
01:19:33,915 --> 01:19:35,950
while embezzling $3 million.

994
01:19:37,485 --> 01:19:41,055
Your wife is siding with Yang.

995
01:19:51,546 --> 01:19:53,214
How should I proceed?

996
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:29,350
Hyun-jung told me everything.

997
01:20:29,484 --> 01:20:30,785
How are you feeling?

998
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,555
You know...

999
01:20:35,123 --> 01:20:36,424
how is she?

1000
01:20:36,591 --> 01:20:39,460
If you're worried about her,
leave her be.

1001
01:20:40,828 --> 01:20:41,663
Forever.

1002
01:20:42,497 --> 01:20:43,431
Mi-sun.

1003
01:20:43,665 --> 01:20:45,934
What exactly can you do
for her in that body?

1004
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:48,536
What if she figures it out?

1005
01:20:51,506 --> 01:20:52,740
All right.

1006
01:20:54,509 --> 01:20:55,677
I'll do that.

1007
01:21:09,724 --> 01:21:11,025
What do you want?

1008
01:21:11,593 --> 01:21:13,561
Did you come for Hyun-jung?

1009
01:21:13,962 --> 01:21:16,631
Why?
Want to get your revenge on her?

1010
01:21:16,998 --> 01:21:18,833
No, it's not like that.

1011
01:21:20,134 --> 01:21:24,305
I just wanted
to apologize to you two.

1012
01:21:26,908 --> 01:21:31,179
Are you going out with her?

1013
01:21:31,579 --> 01:21:32,714
Are you nuts?

1014
01:21:34,382 --> 01:21:36,417
We're not like that!

1015
01:21:38,419 --> 01:21:39,621
In that case...

1016
01:21:41,456 --> 01:21:42,924
what about me?

1017
01:21:45,193 --> 01:21:47,095
You want me to date
a high school chick?

1018
01:21:49,297 --> 01:21:50,798
You're in high school too.

1019
01:21:52,233 --> 01:21:53,601
My answer is no.

1020
01:21:53,902 --> 01:21:55,470
Go home and study.

1021
01:21:58,139 --> 01:21:59,007
Here.

1022
01:22:03,444 --> 01:22:04,479
Bye!

1023
01:22:05,813 --> 01:22:07,081
What a pest...

1024
01:22:10,785 --> 01:22:12,153
Dong-hyun, I like you!

1025
01:22:14,622 --> 01:22:15,957
What are you doing here?

1026
01:22:18,426 --> 01:22:20,428
What did she want?

1027
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:23,898
It's nothing.

1028
01:22:24,232 --> 01:22:26,067
Did she ask you out?

1029
01:22:28,469 --> 01:22:29,637
It's nothing like that.

1030
01:22:29,737 --> 01:22:31,472
So you'll go out with her?

1031
01:22:32,273 --> 01:22:35,743
Don't want to go to jail
when you're 40-something.

1032
01:22:36,177 --> 01:22:38,546
Who's 40-something?

1033
01:22:40,281 --> 01:22:43,685
Forget it. I won't ever date her.

1034
01:22:44,085 --> 01:22:45,753
- Then go out with me.
- Hey!

1035
01:22:46,321 --> 01:22:48,590
Don't you care about me?

1036
01:22:48,957 --> 01:22:50,625
Then why are you so nice to me?

1037
01:22:51,526 --> 01:22:53,261
I'm asking you out now!

1038
01:22:53,494 --> 01:22:55,663
Answer me by weekend!

1039
01:23:00,702 --> 01:23:03,204
Who did you ask out?

1040
01:23:04,138 --> 01:23:05,273
Dong-hyun.

1041
01:23:06,241 --> 01:23:08,076
I thought you liked him.

1042
01:23:10,845 --> 01:23:11,880
Are you insane?

1043
01:23:12,313 --> 01:23:15,483
No! Never! Not in a million years!

1044
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:18,319
He's a weirdo,
don't even think about it!

1045
01:23:18,419 --> 01:23:21,189
I told you he saved me
at the party.

1046
01:23:21,322 --> 01:23:23,224
He risked his life to rescue me.

1047
01:23:24,392 --> 01:23:25,326
Hyun-jung.

1048
01:23:26,227 --> 01:23:27,996
Baby, please.

1049
01:23:28,096 --> 01:23:30,765
Listen to me, this is all wrong.

1050
01:23:30,965 --> 01:23:33,101
Tell me why I can't.

1051
01:23:33,535 --> 01:23:36,304
He takes care of me like a father.

1052
01:23:36,437 --> 01:23:38,273
That's exactly why!

1053
01:23:38,506 --> 01:23:40,141
I grew up without a dad.

1054
01:23:41,476 --> 01:23:42,343
I can't even have a boyfriend

1055
01:23:42,477 --> 01:23:43,645
who's like a dad?

1056
01:23:59,427 --> 01:24:01,763
Will you just listen to me?

1057
01:24:06,534 --> 01:24:10,271
What exactly did you do
to make her ask you out?

1058
01:24:11,272 --> 01:24:14,576
It's a misunderstanding,
I only wanted to be nice to her.

1059
01:24:15,376 --> 01:24:16,277
Does it feel good

1060
01:24:16,377 --> 01:24:18,580
to ruin our lives completely?

1061
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,381
Mi-sun...

1062
01:24:20,882 --> 01:24:25,620
Leave at once,
and don't ever come back!

1063
01:24:28,122 --> 01:24:30,058
If you ever show up
around Hyun-jung,

1064
01:24:31,226 --> 01:24:33,161
you and I are both dead.

1065
01:24:34,062 --> 01:24:38,466
What can I do
for you to forgive me?

1066
01:24:43,705 --> 01:24:47,075
If there was a way,
I would have already.

1067
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,385
Even if I did,

1068
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:55,122
this is infidelity, remember?

1069
01:24:58,326 --> 01:24:59,527
Infidelity?

1070
01:25:01,295 --> 01:25:02,897
What do you mean?

1071
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:05,666
Hyun-jung...

1072
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:10,171
What did you mean?
Forgive? Infidelity?

1073
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:12,974
What are you two talking about?

1074
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:16,878
Hyun-jung.

1075
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:19,347
I'm sorry.

1076
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:24,418
I love...

1077
01:25:28,422 --> 01:25:29,957
I love your mom.

1078
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:31,459
- What?
- What!

1079
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:36,597
Sweetie, that's not it,

1080
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,132
listen to me.

1081
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:39,734
This is why you were mad

1082
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:41,202
when I said I asked him out?

1083
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:42,904
Sweetie...

1084
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:45,640
So disgusting...

1085
01:25:46,874 --> 01:25:47,775
Hyun-jung...

1086
01:25:48,242 --> 01:25:49,443
Sweetie!

1087
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:57,385
Jang Pan-soo,
why did you say that?

1088
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:00,721
Well, what's done is done,

1089
01:26:01,455 --> 01:26:04,091
and it's better
than dating my own daughter.

1090
01:26:04,892 --> 01:26:05,726
What?

1091
01:26:06,994 --> 01:26:08,162
You crazy rascal!

1092
01:26:09,096 --> 01:26:13,367
How could you even say that,
you crazy rascal!

1093
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:15,570
Can I help you?

1094
01:26:16,904 --> 01:26:17,738
What the heck?

1095
01:26:26,847 --> 01:26:28,115
Jang Pan-soo!

1096
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:33,087
It's a good day to die, no?

1097
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:38,726
Look at this twit's beard.

1098
01:26:40,394 --> 01:26:42,864
You should've led a good life.

1099
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:48,035
You messed up your life,
and so you're doomed.

1100
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:50,037
Pan-soo.

1101
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,208
Don't hate me too much.

1102
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:57,245
We all live once,

1103
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,982
I'll send you away comfortably.

1104
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,087
Mister, your zipper's down.

1105
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:07,054
Huh?

1106
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:08,656
Thank you.

1107
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:13,494
What? You!

1108
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,542
There.

1109
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:35,583
Dong-hyun?

1110
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:39,620
Good timing,
I made a special dish...

1111
01:27:40,795 --> 01:27:41,862
Dad...

1112
01:27:43,497 --> 01:27:45,232
I became a weird man...

1113
01:27:45,366 --> 01:27:46,901
what do I do, Dad?

1114
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:51,739
Don't call me "Dad." Who are you?

1115
01:27:51,872 --> 01:27:55,109
I'm your son, Dong-hyun!
Kim Dong-hyun!

1116
01:27:55,576 --> 01:27:59,447
You have the wrong house,

1117
01:27:59,747 --> 01:28:03,117
this... isn't your home...

1118
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,222
wait, you're...

1119
01:28:08,856 --> 01:28:10,391
Don Jang?

1120
01:28:10,524 --> 01:28:11,959
I'm Dong-hyun!

1121
01:28:12,059 --> 01:28:13,194
I have no memory

1122
01:28:13,294 --> 01:28:15,196
after I fell off the roof!

1123
01:28:15,296 --> 01:28:17,198
What do I do, Dad?

1124
01:28:17,298 --> 01:28:18,165
Stay back! Please!

1125
01:28:18,265 --> 01:28:19,266
- Dad!
- Don't come near me!

1126
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,234
Dad!

1127
01:28:20,534 --> 01:28:21,402
Daddy!

1128
01:28:22,937 --> 01:28:23,804
What is it?

1129
01:28:23,904 --> 01:28:26,374
- Dad! Dad!
- Get out of here!

1130
01:28:30,745 --> 01:28:32,780
What in the world? You woke up?

1131
01:28:34,482 --> 01:28:36,684
You look like someone...

1132
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:41,555
wait, are you me?

1133
01:28:42,656 --> 01:28:47,194
But I lost so much weight!

1134
01:28:47,495 --> 01:28:49,030
Dang it, yes, I'm you.

1135
01:28:49,397 --> 01:28:50,698
By the way,

1136
01:28:51,866 --> 01:28:53,300
is your body okay?

1137
01:28:53,934 --> 01:28:55,002
Dad! He's a thief!

1138
01:28:55,102 --> 01:28:56,904
He stole my body!

1139
01:28:57,038 --> 01:28:58,739
Call the police! Call 9-1-1!

1140
01:29:00,307 --> 01:29:01,142
Jesus...

1141
01:29:01,275 --> 01:29:02,109
Hey, why did you...

1142
01:29:02,243 --> 01:29:03,711
he got hurt because of you,

1143
01:29:03,844 --> 01:29:05,713
how can you hit him?

1144
01:29:06,047 --> 01:29:07,915
I'm sorry, he injured his head...

1145
01:29:08,015 --> 01:29:08,916
Why'd you hit me?

1146
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:11,519
Be quiet and just sit down.

1147
01:29:11,752 --> 01:29:13,254
I'll explain everything.

1148
01:29:19,994 --> 01:29:21,095
That's impossible.

1149
01:29:21,429 --> 01:29:25,433
So you're saying this man's you,

1150
01:29:25,566 --> 01:29:27,601
and you're this man.

1151
01:29:28,202 --> 01:29:29,136
Right.

1152
01:29:29,337 --> 01:29:32,306
Then I gotta live my life
as an old man?

1153
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:33,874
Daddy...

1154
01:29:33,974 --> 01:29:36,043
Yes, sir, you were saying?

1155
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:39,880
I don't know
what will happen next.

1156
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:45,219
You gained 30 years
but I lost a lifetime of 30 years.

1157
01:29:45,586 --> 01:29:47,455
This is so unfair.

1158
01:29:47,722 --> 01:29:49,023
Unfair?

1159
01:29:49,623 --> 01:29:50,925
Listen, kid.

1160
01:29:51,225 --> 01:29:53,627
Who lost all that tremendous fat?

1161
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:55,463
- Am I right?
- That's true.

1162
01:29:55,596 --> 01:29:57,431
Whose side are you on, Dad?

1163
01:29:57,965 --> 01:29:58,799
My apologies, sir.

1164
01:29:58,899 --> 01:29:59,867
Stop talking funny,

1165
01:30:00,001 --> 01:30:01,235
it's me, Dong-hyun!

1166
01:30:01,335 --> 01:30:03,637
I'll get used to it eventually.

1167
01:30:07,475 --> 01:30:08,442
Wait a minute.

1168
01:30:10,644 --> 01:30:13,481
You expect me to believe all this?

1169
01:30:13,748 --> 01:30:16,350
You two are trying to trick me!

1170
01:30:16,484 --> 01:30:18,152
I'm not done, sit back down.

1171
01:30:18,419 --> 01:30:19,653
You little...

1172
01:30:19,987 --> 01:30:21,989
- Dad, sit.
- Yes, sir.

1173
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:32,633
When I had measles at 6,

1174
01:30:33,467 --> 01:30:34,502
you had a bike accident

1175
01:30:34,635 --> 01:30:36,337
and we stayed
in the same hospital.

1176
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,975
A glass piece got stuck
in my throat

1177
01:30:41,108 --> 01:30:43,978
when I was in Grade 3,

1178
01:30:44,111 --> 01:30:46,781
and you pulled it out
and saved my life.

1179
01:30:48,916 --> 01:30:50,551
I remember, sir.

1180
01:30:52,386 --> 01:30:56,457
I'm your son, Dong-hyun,
you gave me that name.

1181
01:31:00,094 --> 01:31:02,029
- Are you...
- Dad...

1182
01:31:02,163 --> 01:31:04,665
- really my son?
- Dad!

1183
01:31:04,799 --> 01:31:07,501
How in the world did this happen?

1184
01:31:07,635 --> 01:31:08,936
Dad...

1185
01:31:10,938 --> 01:31:14,742
You smoke, right?
I get so much mucus!

1186
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:17,178
You have a wart on your butt.

1187
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:19,313
It hurts whenever I sit.

1188
01:31:21,315 --> 01:31:22,616
In any case...

1189
01:31:24,985 --> 01:31:26,220
you need to help me.

1190
01:31:26,754 --> 01:31:27,922
Me?

1191
01:31:28,456 --> 01:31:31,125
You like Hyun-jung, right?

1192
01:31:34,261 --> 01:31:37,865
If you help me,
I'll help you date her.

1193
01:31:38,265 --> 01:31:41,335
Crap, when I woke up,
he was already gone!

1194
01:31:41,469 --> 01:31:42,536
How could you screw up?

1195
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:44,238
You said you'd take care of it!

1196
01:31:44,338 --> 01:31:45,306
Hey!

1197
01:31:46,907 --> 01:31:48,275
Am I your freakin' husband?

1198
01:31:48,642 --> 01:31:49,910
Watch your mouth.

1199
01:31:50,277 --> 01:31:52,279
If he goes to Dad...

1200
01:31:52,713 --> 01:31:54,115
My boys are searching for him,

1201
01:31:54,215 --> 01:31:56,584
so you go get the darn money!

1202
01:31:59,153 --> 01:32:01,622
Shouldn't have listened
to that greedy pig.

1203
01:32:01,789 --> 01:32:03,024
How dare she!

1204
01:32:03,157 --> 01:32:04,025
Got it.

1205
01:32:05,026 --> 01:32:08,029
We found the cabby
who drove Don Jang.

1206
01:32:22,076 --> 01:32:23,177
Mi-sun.

1207
01:32:37,591 --> 01:32:38,926
What's going on?

1208
01:32:41,896 --> 01:32:47,868
When he woke up,
we got back in our own bodies.

1209
01:32:49,737 --> 01:32:51,739
I'm Dong-hyun and...

1210
01:32:53,374 --> 01:32:55,910
this man is the real Pan-soo.

1211
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:00,881
Your souls swapped back?

1212
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:05,886
This man, I mean, the kid's right.

1213
01:33:16,664 --> 01:33:17,965
I'm really sorry.

1214
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:23,137
I want to apologize
with all my heart.

1215
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:31,045
I've never once
forgotten about you.

1216
01:33:32,313 --> 01:33:33,180
You...

1217
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:38,130
Gosh!

1218
01:33:38,131 --> 01:33:39,289
So hard to find!

1219
01:33:46,964 --> 01:33:48,265
Who are you?

1220
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:49,967
Jang Pan-soo.

1221
01:33:51,068 --> 01:33:54,171
You should've led a quiet life.

1222
01:33:55,272 --> 01:33:59,376
Tie them up together
and toss them in the ocean.

1223
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:00,344
Yes, boss.

1224
01:34:00,444 --> 01:34:02,947
Excuse me, one moment, please.

1225
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:04,348
What is it?

1226
01:34:05,516 --> 01:34:08,218
You want to say your last words?

1227
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,022
Don't kill us...

1228
01:34:13,524 --> 01:34:17,061
I just woke up,
I can't die like this...

1229
01:34:18,429 --> 01:34:21,265
Who are you people?

1230
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:23,901
Sorry, chump,

1231
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:27,671
being in a coma
made you very weird.

1232
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:33,911
You two get in the kitchen.

1233
01:34:34,011 --> 01:34:34,845
Yes.

1234
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,147
What's this?

1235
01:34:38,015 --> 01:34:39,817
What can you do by yourself?

1236
01:34:42,186 --> 01:34:43,187
Hold on!

1237
01:34:46,290 --> 01:34:48,058
Make sure she doesn't come out.

1238
01:34:48,459 --> 01:34:49,793
- Yes, sir.
- Wait...

1239
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:54,732
Ma'am, stay here.
They're really scary men!

1240
01:34:57,301 --> 01:34:59,036
What a load of nonsense.

1241
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:01,605
Boys.

1242
01:35:02,006 --> 01:35:03,307
Bring them out.

1243
01:35:24,528 --> 01:35:25,729
Look at this punk.

1244
01:35:26,230 --> 01:35:27,898
Yang, chatty as usual.

1245
01:35:29,133 --> 01:35:29,967
Yang?

1246
01:35:32,536 --> 01:35:36,173
How dare you bark at an adult,
you little twit!

1247
01:35:37,207 --> 01:35:38,909
Watch your mouth!

1248
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:41,512
- So what?
- What what?

1249
01:35:43,314 --> 01:35:44,615
This is déjà vu.

1250
01:35:45,816 --> 01:35:47,451
Who the heck are you?

1251
01:35:49,153 --> 01:35:50,854
Obviously a high school student.

1252
01:35:51,422 --> 01:35:52,690
Got a problem?

1253
01:35:53,324 --> 01:35:54,425
High school?

1254
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:58,062
Which grade and class?

1255
01:35:59,763 --> 01:36:02,566
Enough census inquiry, come at me.

1256
01:36:04,835 --> 01:36:08,539
Need to open up the bar soon.

1257
01:36:10,808 --> 01:36:12,142
This is nuts...

1258
01:36:12,676 --> 01:36:13,944
Why are you standing around?

1259
01:36:14,044 --> 01:36:16,814
Get rid of this bookworm!

1260
01:36:18,382 --> 01:36:19,350
Hey, Jo!

1261
01:36:21,418 --> 01:36:22,653
Where's Jo?

1262
01:36:23,988 --> 01:36:25,189
You sleeping?

1263
01:36:43,474 --> 01:36:44,775
Gwak?

1264
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:03,127
You can fight some.

1265
01:37:11,285 --> 01:37:12,719
Take off your tie, schmuck.

1266
01:38:09,977 --> 01:38:12,713
- Boys.
- Yes, sir!

1267
01:38:19,319 --> 01:38:23,056
Ma'am, don't go out!
Please, stay here.

1268
01:38:44,845 --> 01:38:46,079
Let's wrap this up.

1269
01:38:54,154 --> 01:38:56,056
I told you to take off your tie.

1270
01:38:56,957 --> 01:38:57,791
What?

1271
01:39:11,505 --> 01:39:12,339
Hey.

1272
01:39:12,839 --> 01:39:13,674
Yo.

1273
01:39:15,576 --> 01:39:16,443
Buddy!

1274
01:39:22,282 --> 01:39:24,284
Jang Pan-soo, watch this!

1275
01:39:25,986 --> 01:39:28,856
Dang it,
I shouldn't be killing minors.

1276
01:39:29,022 --> 01:39:30,190
Stop!

1277
01:39:33,126 --> 01:39:34,595
Don't hurt him!

1278
01:39:37,497 --> 01:39:38,465
Shoot...

1279
01:39:39,867 --> 01:39:42,836
He's the father of my girl.

1280
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:44,204
Your girl's what?

1281
01:39:44,304 --> 01:39:46,006
Father of my girl.

1282
01:39:47,307 --> 01:39:52,479
So, if you touch him, we all die.

1283
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:54,548
God darn it.

1284
01:39:55,516 --> 01:39:57,150
I'm going to count to 5.

1285
01:39:58,151 --> 01:39:59,419
If you don't leave by then,

1286
01:40:00,387 --> 01:40:02,122
we die together.

1287
01:40:03,156 --> 01:40:06,627
If you want to live,
you better run.

1288
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:08,395
Hey, ma'am!

1289
01:40:10,097 --> 01:40:12,299
If you light that, you die, too.

1290
01:40:12,599 --> 01:40:14,501
Do I look like I'm afraid to die?

1291
01:40:14,935 --> 01:40:17,671
This scoundrel destroyed my life,

1292
01:40:17,804 --> 01:40:20,474
and I'm barely hanging on!

1293
01:40:21,575 --> 01:40:24,478
Why, doesn't look it?

1294
01:40:26,046 --> 01:40:28,715
Thought I lived fine without you?

1295
01:40:31,084 --> 01:40:35,222
Why do you think I kept her,
dang it...

1296
01:40:36,523 --> 01:40:39,326
I wanted at least a child
who resembles you!

1297
01:40:41,562 --> 01:40:45,832
I gave you a chance,
but you still left me.

1298
01:40:46,567 --> 01:40:47,467
What is she saying?

1299
01:40:47,801 --> 01:40:49,336
After all this time,

1300
01:40:49,469 --> 01:40:52,806
did you think
a simple apology would work?

1301
01:40:53,674 --> 01:40:55,042
She's completely mad.

1302
01:40:55,142 --> 01:40:57,544
Did she just say that
she had this kid's kid?

1303
01:40:58,045 --> 01:41:01,982
If you want to live, get out now.

1304
01:41:03,584 --> 01:41:06,220
- One!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1305
01:41:11,592 --> 01:41:13,493
Stop it, you gangster!

1306
01:41:14,695 --> 01:41:15,896
You're no different!

1307
01:41:17,064 --> 01:41:17,965
Two!

1308
01:41:19,967 --> 01:41:20,801
Three!

1309
01:41:21,134 --> 01:41:22,536
We better leave!

1310
01:41:22,669 --> 01:41:25,272
But Jang's in there!

1311
01:41:25,472 --> 01:41:26,406
Four!

1312
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,175
No!

1313
01:41:59,239 --> 01:42:00,073
Mi-sun...

1314
01:42:04,378 --> 01:42:05,445
are you okay?

1315
01:42:08,549 --> 01:42:10,184
Ma'am, I smell gas in here.

1316
01:42:10,717 --> 01:42:12,186
I feel dizzy.

1317
01:42:13,754 --> 01:42:15,155
Stay back.

1318
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:22,029
I have something to say to him.

1319
01:42:25,465 --> 01:42:28,001
- Mi-sun.
- I know, I know!

1320
01:42:32,206 --> 01:42:40,314
But... the one I loved
is Jang Pan-soo over there,

1321
01:42:40,414 --> 01:42:41,515
so just...

1322
01:43:10,167 --> 01:43:12,436
I've waited so long.

1323
01:43:14,971 --> 01:43:16,273
Jang Pan-soo.

1324
01:43:18,875 --> 01:43:21,912
Watching Hyun-jung grow up
more and more like you...

1325
01:43:24,181 --> 01:43:26,249
whenever I see her...

1326
01:43:29,086 --> 01:43:31,154
I've missed you so much.

1327
01:43:34,191 --> 01:43:36,059
You can't even imagine.

1328
01:43:38,428 --> 01:43:40,564
1 year turned into 10,

1329
01:43:43,633 --> 01:43:45,769
and after 17 years,

1330
01:43:48,772 --> 01:43:50,507
we finally meet like this.

1331
01:43:54,911 --> 01:43:56,747
Do I look old?

1332
01:44:01,418 --> 01:44:02,686
Thank you.

1333
01:44:13,864 --> 01:44:19,102
Yes, it's this face.

1334
01:44:55,005 --> 01:44:57,073
What's going on, Dad?

1335
01:44:57,574 --> 01:45:00,443
Do you know
what I detest the most?

1336
01:45:02,012 --> 01:45:02,846
What?

1337
01:45:07,017 --> 01:45:08,818
Holding a knife
against the family.

1338
01:45:20,897 --> 01:45:23,300
"Dear Chairman Han,
my father-in-law,

1339
01:45:24,167 --> 01:45:25,936
if you're reading this,

1340
01:45:26,069 --> 01:45:28,538
I've fallen victim
to their conspiracy,

1341
01:45:29,172 --> 01:45:31,908
and I would be
labeled as your traitor."

1342
01:45:34,044 --> 01:45:40,984
He states the conspiracy
you plotted with Yang.

1343
01:45:41,451 --> 01:45:43,286
It's impossible, Dad.

1344
01:45:43,486 --> 01:45:47,390
How can someone in a coma
write this letter?

1345
01:45:47,991 --> 01:45:50,026
His handwriting has been verified!

1346
01:45:51,027 --> 01:45:53,129
This really is impossible!

1347
01:45:53,296 --> 01:45:54,698
Yang got to me after the accident,

1348
01:45:54,831 --> 01:45:55,765
so how could he...

1349
01:46:02,105 --> 01:46:03,406
In other words,

1350
01:46:04,808 --> 01:46:08,945
are you admitting that you
conspired with Yang?

1351
01:46:13,416 --> 01:46:14,417
Come in.

1352
01:46:30,901 --> 01:46:34,971
Boss, is it okay
to send him in alone?

1353
01:46:36,473 --> 01:46:38,308
Who'd believe me if I went in?

1354
01:46:39,009 --> 01:46:42,412
Chairman wants Jang Pan-soo.

1355
01:46:46,416 --> 01:46:50,186
Don't say anything else,
stick to my plan.

1356
01:47:04,634 --> 01:47:05,702
I called for him.

1357
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:08,004
Have a seat.

1358
01:47:11,474 --> 01:47:15,712
Jang Pan-soo,
what exactly are you planning?

1359
01:47:15,812 --> 01:47:17,013
Shut your mouth!

1360
01:47:22,218 --> 01:47:24,988
What should we do now?

1361
01:47:26,056 --> 01:47:28,858
Ask the chairman what he wishes.

1362
01:47:30,627 --> 01:47:32,929
Ask the chairman what he wishes!

1363
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:37,234
What did you say?

1364
01:47:37,968 --> 01:47:41,938
I mean, ask you, chairman...

1365
01:47:43,673 --> 01:47:47,177
what he, no,
what you would like to do.

1366
01:47:54,551 --> 01:48:00,156
I pronounce you
as the heir to Hanho Group!

1367
01:48:01,491 --> 01:48:02,792
Dad!

1368
01:48:03,493 --> 01:48:05,929
I'll vest your entire fortune,

1369
01:48:06,196 --> 01:48:10,133
including the money you stole,
to the company!

1370
01:48:10,267 --> 01:48:12,369
How could you?

1371
01:48:12,502 --> 01:48:14,938
I'm your daughter!

1372
01:48:15,171 --> 01:48:19,709
You won't get any inheritance,
so don't ever come back!

1373
01:48:21,011 --> 01:48:22,545
What about what he did to me?

1374
01:48:24,047 --> 01:48:25,548
He had an affair

1375
01:48:25,649 --> 01:48:27,584
and even has
a 17-year-old daughter.

1376
01:48:30,287 --> 01:48:32,289
Thought I wouldn't
investigate you?

1377
01:48:32,689 --> 01:48:35,859
You went straight to her bar
after leaving the hospital.

1378
01:48:36,393 --> 01:48:37,928
Is this true?

1379
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:42,432
Uh, tell him
it's a misunderstanding.

1380
01:48:43,366 --> 01:48:48,705
I, um... please, help.

1381
01:48:48,805 --> 01:48:50,807
Sir, I can't hear you.

1382
01:48:50,974 --> 01:48:52,409
Hey, Dong-hyun.

1383
01:48:52,909 --> 01:48:54,210
Can you hear me?

1384
01:48:54,711 --> 01:48:56,813
Sir, I need your help.

1385
01:48:57,547 --> 01:48:58,448
I can't hear you.

1386
01:48:58,715 --> 01:48:59,950
Explain yourself!

1387
01:49:05,221 --> 01:49:06,756
- It's true.
- What?

1388
01:49:06,856 --> 01:49:07,924
But the child wasn't born

1389
01:49:08,058 --> 01:49:11,094
while living with this lady.

1390
01:49:11,261 --> 01:49:13,096
My ex-girlfriend gave birth
without him,

1391
01:49:13,229 --> 01:49:16,066
I mean, me, knowing this.

1392
01:49:16,466 --> 01:49:18,301
Do you even hear yourself?

1393
01:49:18,902 --> 01:49:20,270
Fact is, that you have a daughter,

1394
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:22,072
you weasel!

1395
01:49:22,672 --> 01:49:24,674
Don't swear, ma'am.

1396
01:49:24,874 --> 01:49:27,110
Hyun-jung is a lovely gal.

1397
01:49:27,244 --> 01:49:30,213
Dad, listen to him, he's gone mad.

1398
01:49:30,347 --> 01:49:31,948
How could he say that?

1399
01:49:32,048 --> 01:49:33,717
Stay out of this!

1400
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:37,254
Continue.

1401
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:42,325
I finally understood,
after the accident.

1402
01:49:42,926 --> 01:49:44,628
Should I go in?

1403
01:49:49,299 --> 01:49:55,138
What's more important
than being with your family?

1404
01:49:55,605 --> 01:50:00,210
Are you saying you will give up
your heirship?

1405
01:50:03,713 --> 01:50:08,084
I don't know how rich you are,
but yes.

1406
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:12,789
What did he just say?

1407
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:25,168
Are you sure...
that you'll not regret it?

1408
01:50:25,902 --> 01:50:29,105
I've lived so far
with plenty of regrets.

1409
01:50:30,106 --> 01:50:31,141
But I'm telling you this

1410
01:50:31,341 --> 01:50:34,844
so that I won't regret anymore.

1411
01:50:35,211 --> 01:50:37,013
You're all crazy.

1412
01:50:42,452 --> 01:50:43,954
Good bye, ma'am.

1413
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:50,393
As the father
of a foolish child...

1414
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:56,967
I have no right to stop you.

1415
01:50:59,769 --> 01:51:00,937
Do as you wish.

1416
01:51:03,206 --> 01:51:05,175
Thank you. I'll then...

1417
01:51:06,076 --> 01:51:07,410
good bye.

1418
01:51:18,791 --> 01:51:20,026
Kim Dong-hyun!

1419
01:51:41,944 --> 01:51:43,012
Thank you.

1420
01:51:44,714 --> 01:51:46,649
You're a better man than me.

1421
01:51:47,283 --> 01:51:48,785
You too.

1422
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:52,889
You fight really well.

1423
01:52:01,798 --> 01:52:02,999
Crazy idiots...

1424
01:52:16,712 --> 01:52:18,347
Sir, wake up!

1425
01:52:19,816 --> 01:52:20,817
Boss.

1426
01:52:21,751 --> 01:52:23,319
You have to keep the mask on!

1427
01:52:26,722 --> 01:52:30,793
Take care of... my daughter.

1428
01:52:31,094 --> 01:52:33,096
I understand.

1429
01:52:41,504 --> 01:52:45,174
Sir, wake up, Hyun-jung's here!

1430
01:52:45,875 --> 01:52:46,909
Dong-hyun!

1431
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:55,985
Excuse me...

1432
01:52:58,488 --> 01:53:01,758
Mom, is he...

1433
01:53:04,093 --> 01:53:06,362
my dad?

1434
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:12,435
I saw him in a photo you hid away.

1435
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:15,004
Am I right?

1436
01:53:16,806 --> 01:53:18,074
Sweetie...

1437
01:53:18,908 --> 01:53:24,614
I'm... I'm your dad.

1438
01:53:26,749 --> 01:53:27,717
What?

1439
01:53:28,684 --> 01:53:32,688
My daughter, Hyun-jung.

1440
01:53:34,357 --> 01:53:36,793
That's absurd.

1441
01:53:38,795 --> 01:53:39,829
Did you...

1442
01:53:41,798 --> 01:53:44,033
already get married?

1443
01:53:45,201 --> 01:53:46,035
What?

1444
01:53:46,536 --> 01:53:52,708
No, I'm really your dad.

1445
01:53:58,314 --> 01:53:59,549
Please...

1446
01:54:05,588 --> 01:54:06,589
forgive me.

1447
01:54:09,158 --> 01:54:13,996
I wasn't there when you were born,

1448
01:54:15,565 --> 01:54:19,602
when you said your first word,
or for your first step.

1449
01:54:21,370 --> 01:54:23,639
I was never there...

1450
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:27,310
What is this bull?

1451
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:33,750
My baby...

1452
01:54:37,453 --> 01:54:39,489
don't ever forget...

1453
01:54:41,891 --> 01:54:46,129
that I love you...

1454
01:54:49,432 --> 01:54:50,366
Pan-soo...

1455
01:54:50,466 --> 01:54:51,667
- Dong-hyun!
- Sir!

1456
01:54:55,438 --> 01:54:57,073
Help! Over here!

1457
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:01,944
- Dong-hyun!
- Boss! I mean, boss!

1458
01:55:17,927 --> 01:55:20,129
Did you like my gift?

1459
01:55:23,633 --> 01:55:24,867
It's you!

1460
01:55:25,334 --> 01:55:31,441
Was it hard taking care
of your woman and daughter?

1461
01:55:33,619 --> 01:55:35,354
Get some sleep.

1462
01:55:42,252 --> 01:55:44,721
(6 months later)

1463
01:55:46,802 --> 01:55:48,904
- It's Dong-hyun!
- Holy cow!

1464
01:55:49,038 --> 01:55:50,239
- He's here!
- Wow!

1465
01:55:53,242 --> 01:55:56,412
Hey, Dong-hyun!

1466
01:55:56,612 --> 01:56:01,150
Dong-hyun! Dong-hyun!

1467
01:56:05,387 --> 01:56:08,991
Thanks to you,
the bullies got transferred.

1468
01:56:39,521 --> 01:56:40,756
Hey, Dad!

1469
01:56:45,494 --> 01:56:48,564
Want to go get
some strawberry milk?

1470
01:56:49,031 --> 01:56:50,266
Hyun-jung, hey.

1471
01:57:01,076 --> 01:57:01,911
How do you feel?

1472
01:57:02,044 --> 01:57:03,545
I'll fully cooperate
with the police.

1473
01:57:04,146 --> 01:57:07,917
But it was all
Jang Pan-soo's fault!

1474
01:57:08,784 --> 01:57:11,253
That lamebrain high school boy!

1475
01:57:11,453 --> 01:57:13,355
He got a kid to fight!

1476
01:57:16,025 --> 01:57:20,696
Where's your strength?
Knead with more power!

1477
01:57:21,163 --> 01:57:22,631
Kids will rush in soon.

1478
01:57:22,765 --> 01:57:26,869
- What about him?
- He's way better than you.

1479
01:57:27,169 --> 01:57:28,804
I'm pretty good at kneading.

1480
01:57:29,505 --> 01:57:32,841
Oh, come on,
I even gave you this building.

1481
01:57:33,609 --> 01:57:37,212
You think I'd live off rents?

1482
01:57:37,346 --> 01:57:38,948
Know the value of labor?

1483
01:57:39,281 --> 01:57:40,115
Sorry, boss,

1484
01:57:40,249 --> 01:57:42,318
landlord, I'll do my best.

1485
01:57:44,753 --> 01:57:46,522
- I'm back!
- Come on in.

1486
01:57:46,655 --> 01:57:48,390
- Good afternoon!
- Hello, Dong-hyun.

1487
01:57:48,524 --> 01:57:51,794
Go get changed and start cleaning.

1488
01:57:52,695 --> 01:57:54,029
Allow me, ma'am.

1489
01:57:54,330 --> 01:57:56,865
He wants to do it, not me.

1490
01:57:56,999 --> 01:57:58,601
Do it together then.

1491
01:57:59,001 --> 01:58:01,870
Promise you'll at least
pay me minimum wage.

1492
01:58:02,004 --> 01:58:04,206
Or I'll file a report.

1493
01:58:04,406 --> 01:58:05,374
What?

1494
01:58:05,841 --> 01:58:08,244
Report for me
and I'll bump your allowance.

1495
01:58:08,344 --> 01:58:10,279
They're scheming!

1496
01:58:10,646 --> 01:58:12,514
- Keep kneading!
- Yes, ma'am!

1497
01:58:13,749 --> 01:58:15,451
Get changed right away!

1498
01:58:15,551 --> 01:58:17,052
- All right.
- Boss?

1499
01:58:17,152 --> 01:58:18,120
Where do you want this?

1500
01:58:18,254 --> 01:58:20,689
Go put it somewhere.

1501
01:58:21,123 --> 01:58:24,393
I was asking our landlord.

1502
01:58:25,694 --> 01:58:27,329
Put it in the kitchen, please.

1503
01:58:27,429 --> 01:58:31,033
Ma'am, do I have to wear this?

1504
01:58:31,667 --> 01:58:34,670
Yes, please do me a favor.

1505
01:58:39,041 --> 01:58:40,609
Quite cold indeed?

1506
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:43,479
We'll open very soon!

1507
01:58:44,914 --> 01:58:46,682
- Knead! Knead!
- Kneading! Kneading!

1508
01:58:47,316 --> 01:58:48,918
Come on down!

1509
01:58:49,118 --> 01:58:50,686
Where are my clothes?

1510
01:58:50,786 --> 01:58:53,255
It's in there!

1511
01:58:53,355 --> 01:58:54,456
Almost done!

1512
01:58:58,027 --> 01:59:00,796
- Come on, hurry!
- Guys!

1513
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:02,064
Is it good here?

1514
01:59:02,531 --> 01:59:05,434
