DAY 1

2
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,480
<i>We have breaking news, it happened
just a few moments ago apparently...</i>

3
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:54,056
<i>We have very little
information available...</i>

4
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,580
<i>We are... We have I understand, an
eyewitness on the phone right now...</i>

5
00:00:57,604 --> 00:00:59,864
- Roge!
<i>- Where are you right now?</i>

6
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:19,333
<i>...a loud noise, and everything shook,
I went outside.</i>

7
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:22,655
<i>...of the plaza at 8:52 AM.</i>

8
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:26,496
<i>We have limited information
at this point.</i>

9
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,678
<i>We don't know about the injuries
in the building...</i>

10
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:30,111
What the hell happened?

11
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:31,797
A bomb.

12
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:33,454
I think.

13
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:35,288
So sad.

14
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,607
Roger, I gotta...

15
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:41,523
- Yeah, just go.
- Thanks.

16
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,200
Wanna go higher?

17
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,737
<i>So, the Red Sox with two down...</i>

18
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,026
- First time through the order?
- Third.

19
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,513
The third?

20
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:49,902
- What inning is this?
- Fifth.

21
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:51,376
Oh, boy!

22
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,257
Your hands are… disgusting.

23
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,530
Let me do it.

24
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:01,343
Disgusting?

25
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:03,266
Disgusting.

26
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:04,713
Wow!

27
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,729
Just breathe.

28
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,817
<i>...pops out one down
the line. Come on, Beltran...</i>

29
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:32,971
<i>it's ducking in! It falls in...</i>

30
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,041
- What's the inning of that game?
- Third.

31
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:36,491
Let's go!

32
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:40,134
Come on, Henry!

33
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:41,744
You got it, you got it.

34
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:44,254
Dive! Dive! Dive!

35
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:45,450
<i>He's out!</i>

36
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:50,425
Hey, how do you say, 'dive'?

37
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:54,462
- Dive?
- It's a tough one.

38
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,053
Come on!

39
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:17,613
<i>Ball.</i>

40
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:28,430
Shit.

41
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:31,520
Shit!

42
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,188
<i>Check one!</i>

43
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,341
It's alright.

44
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:41,646
It's alright.

45
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,703
Goddamn thing.

46
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,308
<i>Check two!</i>

47
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:54,082
Let's go.

48
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:01,879
<i>Alright folks, that's the game.</i>

49
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,288
<i>We all head to our cars, okay?</i>

50
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,427
- Okay, let's go.
- Ollie!

51
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:13,826
- Hey.
- Hey.

52
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,473
- What was that?
- I don't know.

53
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:18,309
- I don't know what that was.
- Honey, take the kids home. Okay?

54
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,280
Okay. Yeah. My truck's
up on main street. So...

55
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:22,584
Okay. Alright.
Everybody in. Let's go.

56
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:23,739
I'll go with Dad.

57
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:26,097
Okay. Straight home.

58
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:27,517
Lee. Lee.

59
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:42,365
- Hey, you alright?
- Yeah. Good.

60
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:45,405
Your brother say anything
going on at the base?

61
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:46,878
Not that I know of.

62
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:48,706
He just called,
let me call him back.

63
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,338
Alright. Yeah.
Let me know.

64
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:01,588
- My truck's up there.
- Okay.

65
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,287
Look out!

66
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:22,700
Don't worry.

67
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:25,574
Wait here.

68
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,236
Ronnie, what do we got?

69
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,498
We got units headed out there now.
EMS and Fire.

70
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:42,960
- Where about?
- I think up on Walker's farm.

71
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:54,640
What's wrong?

72
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,991
It's alright.

73
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,229
It's okay, honey.

74
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,205
It's okay, baby.

75
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:13,829
- Mom?
- Yeah.

76
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:17,071
What is happening?

77
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:24,602
Oh my God!

78
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:29,296
It's okay. It's okay.
We're okay. We're okay.

79
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,331
- Dad, that's dad! Dad!
- Where? Where?

80
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:32,839
Mom! Mom!

81
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:34,429
Oh my God!

82
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:37,339
Mom! Mom!

83
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,984
- You're okay, baby.
- I'm okay.

84
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,174
It's okay. It's okay.

85
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:08,223
Go! Go to the buildings!

86
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:33,756
<i>I'm okay. I'm okay.</i>

87
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,217
<i>...we were on Main Street
and then...</i>

88
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,016
<i>I'm don't...</i>

89
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:39,725
<i>Are you there?</i>

90
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,764
Mom?

91
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,380
Our Father, Who art in heaven,

92
00:10:00,553 --> 00:10:02,845
hallowed be Thy name;

93
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:08,031
Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

94
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,498
Give us this day our daily...

95
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,974
There's daddy! There's daddy.
It's Dad!

96
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:30,701
Get down! Get down!

97
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,367
Let's go!

98
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:05,637
Subtitled by <font color="#ffff80">CLARITY</font>

99
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:14,112
DAY 474

100
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:15,051
Wait here.

101
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,934
I'm going back in…

102
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:24,603
Stay here.

103
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,662
Run!

104
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,571
Baby, please!

105
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:54,927
Please!

106
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,906
Please! No!

107
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,485
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

108
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:17,269
It's okay.

109
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,744
It's okay.

110
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:30,835
It's okay.

111
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:45,923
Go!

112
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,134
You can't stay.

113
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,556
I don't know why you came all the way
up here. But you can't stay.

114
00:24:32,744 --> 00:24:33,915
Up?

115
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,853
There is not enough food...

116
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:39,611
...water, there is not enough of
anything.

117
00:24:42,077 --> 00:24:44,464
How do you know
we traveled up?

118
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:48,096
There is nothing I can do.
You won't survive.

119
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:55,063
Show me your face.

120
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,104
I can't help you.

121
00:25:00,654 --> 00:25:03,767
Please, I can't help you.

122
00:25:09,085 --> 00:25:10,246
Emmett?

123
00:25:13,863 --> 00:25:15,018
Emmett?

124
00:25:40,316 --> 00:25:41,944
Please...

125
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,536
Breathe baby.

126
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,741
How does it work?

127
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:09,159
It's three feet of concrete.

128
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:12,253
That must be right above us to hear.

129
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:21,123
What's this?
Some kind of...

130
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,851
...some kind of
feedback from the microphone?

131
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,187
It just works.
I don't know...

132
00:28:30,862 --> 00:28:33,249
I've never seen one dead before.

133
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:37,915
How is he?

134
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:40,849
He's...

135
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:46,615
I didn’t reach the bone.

136
00:28:50,065 --> 00:28:52,049
But that wrap won't last.

137
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:11,535
I'm sorry.

138
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:16,852
- Of what?
- The boys.

139
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:24,019
- I assume.
- That day...

140
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:28,186
And Nora?

141
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:30,652
Eleven weeks ago.

142
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:35,686
She was sick.

143
00:29:39,757 --> 00:29:42,545
We held out as long as we could
in the house.

144
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:45,145
But the pain didn't.

145
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,775
Just when she started screaming...

146
00:29:53,301 --> 00:29:54,841
we had to come here.

147
00:29:58,178 --> 00:29:59,708
It was smart.

148
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:03,741
It wasn't enough.

149
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,145
Can I ask you a question?

150
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:22,313
When you saw the flame,

151
00:30:23,646 --> 00:30:25,279
night after night,

152
00:30:29,939 --> 00:30:32,445
did you know it was him?

153
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,100
Yes.

154
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:44,284
And did you ever think
to come for us?

155
00:30:49,676 --> 00:30:50,950
No.

156
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:00,980
The people that are left...

157
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,063
...what they have become...

158
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,964
...you don't know, do you?

159
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:12,264
I knew.

160
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:17,897
They are not the kind of people
worth saving.

162

- Have you heard this?
- Ah. Yes.

168
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:48,796
No. Dad would've heard this.

169
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,209
It's the same song that has been playing
over and over the last four months.

170
00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:55,129
You're lying!

171
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:57,881
My Dad used the radio every day!

172
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,079
What she's saying?

173
00:32:00,112 --> 00:32:02,229
She thinks he would have heard it.

174
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,931
Who?

175
00:32:04,254 --> 00:32:05,791
Lee.

176
00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:14,436
It's the valley.

177
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:18,568
It's the valley, I tried the radio,
from our house too. But...

178
00:32:18,592 --> 00:32:21,708
We never heard anything
until we got up here.

179
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,158
Your dad was never
gonna make it work.

180
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,878
You're nothing like him!

181
00:32:32,774 --> 00:32:34,950
Does this mean that
there are more people?

182
00:32:34,974 --> 00:32:37,240
- I don't know, baby. I don't...
- No!

183
00:32:37,718 --> 00:32:39,474
There is nothing left.

184
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:42,661
I told you, there is nothing left.

185
00:32:48,295 --> 00:32:49,861
I want you gone tomorrow.

186
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:54,285
It's not a song.

187
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:55,577
On the radio.

188
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,413
Beyond The Sea… Right?

189
00:33:58,855 --> 00:34:00,457
It's not a song…

190
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:02,750
It's a signal.

191
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:06,629
They're telling us where to look.

192
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:09,549
I looked up the radio station.

193
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:12,677
…where the song is coming from.

194
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:23,855
It's an island!

195
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:26,857
I can follow the train tracks…

196
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:29,958
It's not even one day.

197
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:33,406
Then I can find a boat.

198
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:35,749
You can't do this.

199
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,163
If I can find the song.
Where it's coming from…

200
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:42,942
I can use this…

201
00:34:43,108 --> 00:34:44,960
to change this…

202
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,713
into this!

203
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:53,255
Mom, will never… let you go.

204
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:59,699
I can save them.

205
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:03,411
I can save us.

206
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:04,954
I'll tell her.

207
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,499
Mom… I'll tell her.

208
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:11,336
Please don't do this!

209
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:14,731
I need to try.

210
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:16,050
Why?

211
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,179
Because Dad would.

212
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:20,595
And look what happened to him.

213
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:20,624
KEEP LISTENING

214
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,702
You have to find her for me.

215
00:36:44,726 --> 00:36:48,768
She's gonna get help, and I need you to go
and find her for me, bring her back to me.

216
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,058
Alright, listen to me.

217
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,669
Please, Emmett, I am begging you!

218
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:53,135
- No, Evelyn!
- I am begging you!

219
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,492
We were friends, Emmett, please.

220
00:36:57,562 --> 00:36:59,695
Lee is gone.

221
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:06,523
Now he's gone.

222
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:13,687
It's a shame, because
if he was here,

223
00:37:15,003 --> 00:37:16,517
he'd look you right in the eye,

224
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:19,337
and he'd tell you that
his little girl is absolutely

225
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:22,097
the kind of person
worth saving.

226
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:30,038
So please go, find her.

227
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:33,938
And bring her back to me.

228
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,733
Alright, listen to me!

229
00:43:21,757 --> 00:43:25,248
We stay here until they're
gone, and then we go.

230
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:26,472
You understood?

231
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,655
You can't hear?

232
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:34,345
You can't hear, shit!

233
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:42,989
I'll take you home, we'll wait here,
until they are gone.

234
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,268
Goddammit!

235
00:43:57,326 --> 00:44:02,139
Enunciate… Remember?

236
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,595
I'm...

237
00:44:09,988 --> 00:44:11,828
...taking you...

238
00:44:12,248 --> 00:44:13,408
...back.

239
00:44:17,293 --> 00:44:19,385
They heard...

240
00:44:19,794 --> 00:44:21,803
...the shot, okay?

241
00:44:25,043 --> 00:44:26,336
No!

242
00:44:26,602 --> 00:44:29,270
You can't do this!

243
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:31,817
Help me.

244
00:44:32,526 --> 00:44:34,939
Enough! Please, enough!

245
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:38,605
I'm taking you home.

246
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:42,966
What home?

247
00:44:47,494 --> 00:44:50,774
You said…your wife…

248
00:44:50,798 --> 00:44:52,244
Hey, don't.

249
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:56,457
Do not talk about my wife.

250
00:44:59,354 --> 00:45:02,249
You said…

251
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:07,055
…that you could not do enough.

252
00:45:07,529 --> 00:45:12,050
Now you can.

253
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,009
I found a boat.

254
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,868
Don't go.

255
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:45,150
I will be right back.

256
00:49:45,842 --> 00:49:47,927
A matter of hours.

257
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:50,113
But the baby, I don't know how...

258
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,365
I showed you how to do it.

259
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,016
Stay calm.

260
00:49:56,796 --> 00:49:59,482
You have everything you need.

261
00:50:00,023 --> 00:50:02,167
Everything.

262
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:05,307
Please…

263
00:50:07,356 --> 00:50:09,083
Look…

264
00:50:09,564 --> 00:50:11,592
If I don't go…

265
00:50:11,616 --> 00:50:14,886
Soon you'll be in a lot of pain.

266
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,555
And I won't know…

267
00:50:22,939 --> 00:50:26,209
… I won't lose you too.

268
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,054
Breathe…

269
00:50:38,726 --> 00:50:40,953
I'll be right back.

It's okay.

279
00:59:46,697 --> 00:59:49,515
Hey, look at me!

280
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,464
Hey!

281
01:07:08,202 --> 01:07:10,284
Baby! Marcus!

282
01:07:10,308 --> 01:07:11,318
Marcus!

283
01:07:11,342 --> 01:07:12,809
Marcus, wake up!

284
01:10:11,221 --> 01:10:12,321
Oh.

285
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:13,710
Thank you.

286
01:10:23,814 --> 01:10:25,247
You heard the song?

287
01:10:26,447 --> 01:10:27,681
Figured it out?

288
01:10:29,806 --> 01:10:30,957
She did.

289
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,845
- I thought she was...
- ...figured it out.

290
01:10:44,591 --> 01:10:47,245
Not sure anyone here
can actually believe it.

291
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:52,349
The most people had finally
given up hope.

292
01:10:53,934 --> 01:10:55,721
In a long time.

293
01:10:57,054 --> 01:10:58,338
How long?

294
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,987
That day.

295
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,792
We got here the same way as you.

296
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:18,659
We were in this city.

297
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,442
When we heard the hurricane sirens.

298
01:11:22,759 --> 01:11:25,293
Once they knew, they couldn't swim.

299
01:11:26,193 --> 01:11:30,126
The National Guard were told to
start loading people on to boats.

300
01:11:31,493 --> 01:11:33,459
Any boat that they could find.

301
01:11:36,134 --> 01:11:39,334
So as soon as people saw
the first one got out safe,

302
01:11:45,063 --> 01:11:47,863
everyone just started pushing forward.

303
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,073
That's when they started screaming.

304
01:11:56,452 --> 01:12:00,752
They had 12 boats lined
up on the dock that day.

305
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,569
Only two got out.

306
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:14,077
Anyway, you're here now.

307
01:12:15,143 --> 01:12:16,310
A new day.

308
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:18,977
And where are you coming from?

309
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,544
Ah, just over the Appalachian Ridge.

310
01:12:23,157 --> 01:12:24,511
And how long did it take?

311
01:12:25,768 --> 01:12:27,609
Just under two days.

312
01:12:27,706 --> 01:12:29,426
That's determination!

313
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:32,696
It's necessity.

314
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,497
To get out?

315
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:39,774
No.

316
01:12:41,937 --> 01:12:43,437
To give in.

317
01:13:13,991 --> 01:13:15,891
He said he will do it.

318
01:13:22,714 --> 01:13:23,880
Yes.

319
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,180
He said yes.

320
01:13:38,885 --> 01:13:40,218
I wanted to say...

321
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,193
I'm sorry.

322
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,093
I doubted you.

323
01:13:49,727 --> 01:13:51,193
I was wrong.

324
01:13:57,754 --> 01:13:59,051
And you were right.

325
01:14:02,307 --> 01:14:04,461
I am nothing like him.

326
01:14:08,142 --> 01:14:09,851
You are.

327
01:16:21,392 --> 01:16:22,920
Get inside!

328
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,571
Get inside!

329
01:16:28,999 --> 01:16:30,473
Get inside!

330
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:16,299
Get inside!

331
01:17:17,202 --> 01:17:18,958
They are everywhere!

332
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:28,731
Go!

333
01:17:43,578 --> 01:17:45,010
Stay down!

334
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:46,528
Stay down!

335
01:18:24,052 --> 01:18:26,509
Hey! The doors' locked,
you got a key?

336
01:18:26,533 --> 01:18:27,734
Where is it?

337
01:18:28,107 --> 01:18:30,583
We went too fast.
What if we lost it?

338
01:18:30,607 --> 01:18:31,841
Give me the key.

339
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:34,971
Jesus Christ, it went back.

340
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,929
- My family.
- No, alright, listen to me.

341
01:18:37,953 --> 01:18:39,670
I have to get back to my family.
