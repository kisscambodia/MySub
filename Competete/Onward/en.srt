an accountant.

there was magic."

helped all in need."

a simpler way to get by."

So start practicing,
young sorcerer.

531
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:30,779
(SIGHS) Okay, Dad.
Let's try some magic.

532
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,577
LAUREL: Hey, sweetie?

533
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:39,913
Ugh! Blazey. Oh, this dragon
is always under my feet.

this levitation spell to work.

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,544
Maybe I could try something else

540
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,254
like Arcane Lightning?
(SCOFFS)

541
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:31,089
Yeah, like a level-one mage
could bust out

542
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,733
the hardest spell in
the <i>Enchanter's Guide Book.</i>

543
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,568
(CHUCKLING) Maybe we'll stick
with the easy ones.

544
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:37,054
Yeah, well, it's not working.
Am I saying it wrong?

545
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,223
Well, mmm, you said it right.

546
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:40,724
It's just,
for any spell to work,

547
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,643
you have to speak
from your heart's fire.

548
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,478
- My what?
- Your heart's fire.

BARLEY: All right, listen.
First, let me do the talking.

566
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:40,492
Secondly, it's crucial we show

567
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,077
the Manticore
the respect she deserves,

568
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,913
or she will, thirdly, not give
us a map to the Phoenix Gem.

569
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,456
Wait, wait, wait. The map?

570
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:48,166
I thought she had a Phoenix Gem.

571
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:50,669

It's just,

Look, I'm sorry about that.

But if you get hurt

guess who gets sued
and loses her tavern?

My brother is a wizard.

I can't believe that worked.

Oh! You're gonna nail
Dad's spell now.

708
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,773
Except we don't have a map.

00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:10,447
Look, on a quest, you have
to use what you've got.

712
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,073
And this is what we've got.

713
00:33:12,114 --> 00:33:15,452
Best part is, little Kayla
already solved the puzzle.

714
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:17,495
Well, according to Kayla,

715
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:19,998
we just have to look
for Raven's Point.

716
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:24,377
Raven's Point. Raven's Point.

717
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:26,755
Yes! The gem
must be in the mountain.

718
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,231
We could be there
by tomorrow morning.

719
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:29,466
Tomorrow morning?

720
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,635
That still gives us
plenty of time with Dad.

(SIGHS)

722
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:37,015
Yeah. Well, it looks like

723
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,850
the expressway should take us
right there.

724
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:43,396
Mmm. Expressway is
a little too obvious.

725
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:45,899
On a quest, the clear path
is never the right one.

726
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,983
What?

727
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,610
During one
<i>Quests of Yore</i> campaign,

728
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,570
Shrub Rosehammer and I
took the easy route,

729
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,531
led him straight into the
belly of a gelatinous cube.

730
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,533
Only reason
I didn't suffer the same fate?

731
00:33:55,574 --> 00:33:56,952
I followed my gut.

732
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,372
And it's telling me
we take an ancient trail

733
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:02,916
called the Path of Peril.

734
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,834
IAN: But the expressway
is faster.

735
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,211
Maybe not in the long run.

736
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,629
I know you want this to be

737
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,506

738
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:10,799
but all that matters

739
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:12,509
is that we get to spend
as much time

740
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:14,219
as possible with Dad.

(SIGHS)

742
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:22,269
So, we should just take
the expressway, right?

743
00:34:24,186 --> 00:34:26,064
Yeah, you're right.

744
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,191
But if you end up
inside a gelatinous cube,

745
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,569
you are on your own.

a weird family issue come up,

there were two teenage elves.

Oh! Those are my sons.
Where did they go?

Oh. They went on a quest

But don't worry, don't worry.

I told them about the map,
I told them about the gem,

771
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:31,421
I told them about the curse.

about the curse.

that when their blood

am I right, Dad?

A growth spell
is a bit more advanced.

853
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:48,284
Not only do you have to speak
from your heart's fire,

854
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:50,662
but now you also
have to follow a magic decree.

"To magnify an object,"

858

"you have to magnify
your attention upon it."
