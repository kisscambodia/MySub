1
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,890
Since Paris doesn't want us,
we'll just go to the Moon,

2
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,893
just like in Jules Verne's book!

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,438
How do you figure you'll breathe
in space, birdbrain?

4
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,690
Come, my dear pigeons!

5
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,860
In space,
no one can hear you coo!

6
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,656
(Gasps) I know how to use
my Lucky Charm!

7
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,993
Let's bring him back to Earth
before he hurts himself!

8
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,954
CAT NOIR: Power up!

9
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,710
ALYA: <i>Oh!</i>
<i>Check out Cosmobug and Astrocat</i>

10
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,211
<i>flying in those new suits!</i>

11
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,922
<i>Yo, Peeps! This is Alya Césaire,</i>
<i>live from Paris,</i>

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,217
<i>where our heroes are battling</i>
<i>Mr Pigeon for the 51st time!</i>

13
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,929
<i>They really are miraculous,</i>
<i>aren't they? (Gasps)</i>

14
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,809
‐ There you go!
‐ CAT NOIR: There you go.

15
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,770
Oops! You've said that already.

16
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,149
Cat Noir, I've told you
to stop bringing me flowers!

17
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,486
Yeah, I know. When I tried
to offer you a red rose,

18
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:54,364
you told me that red symbolizes
"passion," so you refused it.

19
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,658
And I offered you a white rose,

20
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,119
but you said white stood for
"pure love," and refused it too.

21
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,997
So now I'm offering you
a yellow rose.

22
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,750
I've looked it up and yellow
represents friendship.

23
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,586
Here's to a perfect partnership.

24
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:11,215
Are you sure yellow roses
don't represent jealousy?

25
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,717
Uh... No.
That would be blue roses.

26
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,887
Hang on, no, purple!
Or was it orange?

27
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,056
(Chuckles) You don't
need to give me flowers.

28
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,060
I already know you're
the best partner ever, Cat Noir.

29
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:27,898
It smells really good anyway.
Thanks, kitty!

30
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,694
(Sighs) She's so amazing.
And so am I, by the way.

31
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,655
I should be
giving myself flowers!

32
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,034
Spots off!

33
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,832
(Chomping)

34
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,299
(Gasps) Oh!
A new poster of Adrien!

35
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,885
Marinette,
you'll be late for school.

36
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,972
Ah! He's so perfect!

37
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,725
I thought you'd stopped
collecting photos of Adrien.

38
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,936
Ah, but it's different
this time, Tikki!

39
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,813
This is... uh, for work!

40
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,566
It's, um, research
for my future designs!

41
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,317
Adrien and I are done!

42
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,570
See?
I can even look into his eyes

43
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,155
without being mesmerized!

44
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,953
‐ Ah...
‐ Marinette!

45
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,372
Yes! Let's get going!

46
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,544
<i>And that's how the friendship</i>
<i>between George Washington</i>

47
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,880
<i>and Frenchman</i>
<i>Marquis de Lafayette was born,</i>

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,674
<i>between two men</i>
<i>who believed that freedom</i>

49
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,342
<i>should have no boundaries.</i>

50
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:42,806
Congratulations, that truly was
a sensational student film!

51
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,184
And completed just in time
for our departure

52
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,353
to French‐American
Friendship Week... in New York!

53
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,856
(Cheering)

54
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,109
Ah! Good thing my parents
aren't letting me go with you!

55
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,778
Not seeing you all for a week
will feel like a vacation!

56
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,822
But, Miss Bourgeois,

57
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,116
your parents
already gave the authorisation.

58
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,452
You <i>are</i> coming along
with everyone!

59
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,787
What? You're gonna
hear from Daddikins!

60
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,373
I, on the other hand,
regret to inform you

61
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,958
that I can't
come with you after all.

62
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,920
‐ Oh, no! But why?
‐ I just have

63
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,132
a few medical exams
I couldn't postpone, because...

64
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,967
I will soon be having a baby!

65
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,637
(Cheering)

66
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,473
Miss Mendeleiev will be
substituting Miss Bustier.

67
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,975
‐ Aw...
‐ She's not cool.

68
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,228
New York with her
will be so lame.

69
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,480
She won't let us do anything!

70
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,234
Something wrong, buddy?

71
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,070
My father isn't going to
let me go. As usual.

72
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,030
I'm stuck in Paris too.

73
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,075
I have obligations
because of my charity work,

74
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,494
but we could see each other,
if you'd like.

75
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,872
‐ Uh, thanks, Lila!
‐ No!

76
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,000
0Uh, I mean... no,
we made that film together,

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,462
all of us, which means
Adrien must come with me!

78
00:04:55,462 --> 00:05:00,342
I mean, us! He's our friend
and you don't let a friend down!

79
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,469
Just like in the film,
when sock‐Lafayette

80
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,056
comes and helps his friend
sock‐Washington find freedom.

81
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,433
Adrien,
you're our sock‐Washington!

82
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,311
You're our friend,
and as your friend,

83
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,522
it is my duty
to go and see your father

84
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,816
and convince him
to let you come with us!

85
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,318
Yeah!
And we're coming with you!

86
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,904
Thank you, Marinette.

87
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,906
But my father's
a difficult man to convince.

88
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,326
I will never let a friend down!

89
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,872
‐ Adrien, your friend?
‐ Absolutely!

90
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,374
It was time I moved on!

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,627
It was so painful, not being
able to tell him how I felt.

92
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,963
It made me act completely crazy!

93
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,048
(Coughs) No kidding!

94
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,511
Oh! It's so liberating to
finally just be Adrien's friend

95
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,472
instead of "the girl
who's in love with Adrien!"

96
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,017
I no longer get lost
in his beautiful green eyes,

97
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,436
I no longer spray his Adrien n.4
cologne on my pillow,

98
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:56,064
and I stopped binge‐watching
my montage of his best ads!

99
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,067
What about
your poster collection?

100
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,612
That... that's strictly
for research purposes!

101
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,989
But are you sure you'll be fine

102
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,576
spending a week with him?
Isn't that too romantic?

103
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,828
No! Of course not!

104
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,955
We'll have
a great time as friends!

105
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,792
But first,
I've gotta convince his dad.

106
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,795
<i>Last night the New York Museum</i>
<i>kicked off</i>

107
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,798
<i>French American Friendship Week</i>
<i>with a special exhibition!</i>

108
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,383
<i>Reporter Clara Contard</i>
<i>was there.</i>

109
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,427
<i>That's right, Nadja.</i>

110
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,220
<i>For the first time ever</i>
<i>and only until Sunday,</i>

111
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,390
<i>the museum is putting</i>
<i>Lafayette's sabre on display,</i>

112
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,225
<i>as well as</i>
<i>the eagle‐talon necklace</i>

113
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,896
<i>‐ he gave George Washington.</i>
‐ This is no mere jewel.

114
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,441
Eagle talon is without
a doubt a lost Miraculous.

115
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:40,817
(Doorbell rings)

116
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,700
Have my plane ready
for take‐off.

117
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,578
That's what makes
our friendship so precious!

118
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,539
And since your son is my friend,
I mean, <i>our</i> friend,

119
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,376
that means he has to come
to New York with us!

120
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,295
‐ Young lady, I ‐‐
‐ I won't leave this place

121
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,048
‐ until you've ‐‐
‐ I've decided to let Adrien go

122
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,591
along with his classmates.

123
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:10,222
‐ Uh... You have? But usually...
‐ You've convinced me.

124
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,600
You really are
a good friend to my son.

125
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,895
(Cheering)

126
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,315
She just unknowingly offered you
an unexpected opportunity.

127
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:24,152
Yes. Letting Adrien
go to New York will be simpler

128
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,571
than hiding
my absence here from him.

129
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,450
Besides, this will allow me to
continue keeping an eye on him.

130
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,206
(Grunts)

131
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,591
What's wrong, Adrien?

132
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,844
My whole class is
going to New York tomorrow.

133
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,262
I wish
I could be going with them.

134
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,223
I'm sad for you,
but happy for us.

135
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,850
This'll give us
more time to practise.

136
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,436
When you're as weak
as you were today,

137
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,522
the pleasure of beating you
is lessened.

138
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,985
‐ I'll see you tomorrow.
‐ See you tomorrow, Kagami.

139
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,199
♪ New York, New York,
I'm going to New York...

140
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,742
with Adrien Agreste!

141
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,496
Uh... As friends, of course!
Heh heh!

142
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,541
By the way, Marinette,
who'll protect Paris

143
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,917
while we're
in the US for the week?

144
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,712
All taken care of, my Tikki!

145
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,174
‐ You're going away?
‐ Only for a few days.

146
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,718
It's nothing important,
kittycat!

147
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,971
‐ But I can't tell you more.
‐ To protect our identities.

148
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,766
‐ I know the drill, Milady.
‐ But in case anything happens

149
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,312
in Paris, an akumatised villain,
a sentimonster, anything...

150
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,814
all you have to do
is click here,

151
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,983
and I'll come back
as fast as I can!

152
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,904
For emergencies only, of course!

153
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,615
Of course!
Just go and rest easy.

154
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,159
I'll be Paris'
substitute guardian!

155
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,411
Am I not
the perfect partner after all?

156
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,998
I'm counting on you.
No funny business, OK?

157
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,209
Have I ever struck you
as the funny kind?

158
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,960
I'm as serious as they get!

159
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,672
(Groans)

160
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,760
I... I can go to New York?
Really?

161
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,805
You can thank your friend
Marinette for convincing me.

162
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,850
But, actually,
I hadn't planned on...

163
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,853
What about my fencing lessons?
And Chinese?

164
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,272
Nathalie has already
packed your bags.

165
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,526
Your bodyguard will go with you.
You take off this afternoon.

166
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:32,239
Uh... yes, very well, Father.

167
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,118
I've been dreaming about this

168
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,038
ever since <i>the Gentlemen's</i>
<i>Cheese</i> came out.

169
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:43,041
Blue Marble Jack, Cougar Gold,
the legendary Monterrey...

170
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,919
All those wonderful
American cheeses

171
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,213
are just waiting
for us to taste them!

172
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:52,342
We can't go, Plagg. I promised
Ladybug I'd watch over Paris,

173
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,553
and I don't want
to let her down.

174
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,848
But your father will never let
you stay. You want more freedom,

175
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,559
and, for once, your father
is letting you have fun!

176
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,145
Enjoy! You'll be in New York
with your friends!

177
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,065
She's gonna be so disappointed.

178
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,403
Of course not! She can't be
if she doesn't know!

179
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,614
Besides, she told you not to
call unless a villain shows up.

180
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,325
See any in the house?

181
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,036
What if something happens
while we're gone?

182
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:24,040
Don't you have
an akuma alert on your phone?

183
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,166
Of course.

184
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,837
In case of emergency
I can transform into Astrocat

185
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,256
‐ to fly back quickly!
‐ Perfect!

186
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,924
And then you can tell Ladybug!

187
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,802
That way,
she'll never be disappointed!

188
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,845
Pound it!

189
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,849
My love, being far away from you

190
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,142
will be
nothing short of torture.

191
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,604
But I may have found a piece
of jewellery in New York,

192
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:49,065
which might enable me
to beat Ladybug and Cat Noir,

193
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,443
to get their Miraculous
and to make the wish

194
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,028
that will bring you back to me.

195
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,793
Oh, I'm sorry, Luka.
We'll never catch up to the bus!

196
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,838
We will. I know how important
this trip is to you.

197
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,883
You're saying it's important
because of Adrien.

198
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,052
But his being there
isn't important.

199
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,429
I mean,
it's important to Adrien,

200
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,433
because it's an important trip,
but he's just a friend!

201
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,480
(Sighs)

202
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,524
Look! Marinette!

203
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:39,991
You know what's important?

204
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,994
That this trip
helps you get some clarity.

205
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,080
Thank you, Luka.

206
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,886
Ugh...

207
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,151
Yes, turns out
you're in luck, I'm coming.

208
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,195
But only because I decided to.

209
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,615
Uh, but there is no way I'm
travelling in these conditions.

210
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,283
I'm going to sit down
in first class.

211
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,801
(Groans)

212
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,391
Hey, Marinette!
What's your seat number?

213
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,979
Uh... Baby... BB... 32B.

214
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,440
Oh, great!
You're sitting next to me!

215
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,233
(Gasps)

216
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,195
Awesome, Marinette.
Go and sit next to your <i>friend!</i>

217
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,448
So you can enjoy
a nice flight together.

218
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,908
A very long flight.

219
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:10,290
Uh, sure! Next to my husban...
my friend... no problem!

220
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,673
He's a friend. Just a friend.
He's a just a friend.

221
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,678
‐ Uh... Everything OK?
‐ Oh, yeah, yeah, great!

222
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,181
Ooh, hoo‐hoo! It's just
a little hot in here, huh?

223
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,684
Here, let me help you.

224
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,645
Whoa!

225
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,777
‐ Oh, sorry!
‐ No, I'm fine!

226
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:42,655
‐ Are you feeling cooler now?
‐ Gee! No! Not at all!

227
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,575
It must be the seat!
It's a warming seat, right?

228
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,951
Ooh! It's burning hot!

229
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,038
Um... no... it's a regular seat.

230
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,916
But you can have mine if you'd
like. Come on, let's switch!

231
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,043
(Alarm)

232
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,045
Help, Alya!
I can't sit next to him!

233
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,297
I might need more training
to be just his friend.

234
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,050
There's still time
to get off plane.

235
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,969
Because New York is <i>the</i> most
romantic city in the world,

236
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,763
after Paris, obviously.

237
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,725
New York is, like, carriage
rides with pretty white horses,

238
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,936
little dogs and kittens
on your lap,

239
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,771
the sun setting
over Central Park,

240
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,774
‐ the ferry to Liberty Island!
‐ Aaah!

241
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,734
‐ I have to get outta here!
‐ What's going on?

242
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,945
Marinette gets airsick.

243
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,322
It would be better
if she could sit at the centre.

244
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,533
Out of the question.

245
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,202
Each student is to keep the seat
they have been assigned!

246
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,955
Oh, Miss Bustier
would've totally have said yes!

247
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,373
Please, Miss Mendeleiev,

248
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,708
this is a plane,
not a classroom!

249
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,546
Um... All right, fine.

250
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,923
You may have my seat, Marinette.

251
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,968
Guess
I'll see you later, then?

252
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,888
Right, later! Much later!
I mean, see you later!

253
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,517
<i>We are about to take off.</i>
<i>Please fasten your seatbelt.</i>

254
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,521
SOOTHING VOICE:
<i>On a scale of one to ten,</i>

255
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:59,524
<i>how would you rate</i>
<i>your fear of flying?</i>

256
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,860
<i>Select the relaxation level</i>
<i>you require.</i>

257
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:07,282
<i>You are a dolphin,</i>
<i>leaping from wave to wave</i>

258
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,617
<i>in an ocean of tranquillity.</i>

259
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:12,537
(Gasps)

260
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,959
<i>We're about to take off.</i>
<i>Please fasten your seatbelt.</i>

261
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,759
(Snoring)

262
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,929
(Mysterious music)

263
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,606
(Grunts)

264
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:44,819
(Sighs)

265
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,965
MARINETTE: Whoa! Oh! Shoot!

266
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,893
(Sighs)

267
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,489
ADRIEN:
It's beautiful, isn't it?

268
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:34,202
Aaah! Forry, I... I mean, sorry!

269
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,913
‐ Sorry, Marinette.
‐ (Chuckles)

270
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,434
ADRIEN:
My father told me everything.

271
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,354
The only reason I can enjoy
this beautiful sunset is you.

272
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,190
I thought it'd be impossible,
but you believed in it.

273
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,485
You're always willing to take a
chance on something or someone,

274
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,861
even when no one else is.

275
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,573
You've got something,
Marinette.

276
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,034
Som... something?

277
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,246
‐ Yeah, there. In your hair.
‐ (Gasps)

278
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,749
I can't decide whether they're
the cutest people I know,

279
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,836
‐ or the most embarrassing.
‐ Yep. I love Adrien,

280
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,713
but he's like a baby chick

281
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,589
that's just started
cracking out of his egg.

282
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,092
He has a hard time
understanding signals.

283
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,387
What signals? Marinette isn't
exactly sending them clearly.

284
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,432
I mean, look.
What is she doing with her arms?

285
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,226
Telling him what to do
in case of an emergency landing?

286
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,812
(Indistinct)

287
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,149
(Sighs) If only this trip

288
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,860
could help Adrien
finally come out of his shell.

289
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,113
And if only it could help
Marinette be honest with herself

290
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,074
and clearer about her feelings!

291
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,162
‐ Operation New York?
‐ Operation New York!

292
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,998
‐ Let's help them loosen up!
‐ After all,

293
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,792
isn't the United States
the land of the free?

294
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,589
OK, then... So...

295
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,673
OK.

296
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:18,056
ADRIEN:
Well, what I meant to say was

297
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,016
thanks for managing
to convince my father.

298
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,851
(Lively music)

299
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,645
Ooh! Sure thing!
Ha, ha! Don't mention it!

300
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,149
That's what friends are for!
For holding each other tightly

301
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,693
in delicious aroma of cologne!

302
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,278
(Hysterical laugh)

303
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,914
Oh, no! That's Techno‐Pirate,

304
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,708
the supervillain
who steals technology!

305
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,847
<i>Don't worry, sweethearts.</i>
<i>We have this under control.</i>

306
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,893
<i>Dear passengers, the United</i>
<i>Heroes are here to protect you.</i>

307
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,937
(Gasps) Uncanny Valley!

308
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:09,440
The first superhero with AI,
created by Majestia!

309
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,566
(Gasps) Which means...

310
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,985
(Heroic music)

311
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,252
(Alarm)

312
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,257
Wow! Majestia in person!

313
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,383
So cool!

314
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,557
It's time to show
those American superheroes

315
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,851
how French superheroes do it!
Hoo‐hoo!

316
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,104
(Groans)

317
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,622
Techno‐Pirate,
you're under arrest.

318
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,166
Watch and learn!

319
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,169
The legendary
Knight Owl and Sparrow!

320
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,590
Your runaway ends here.

321
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,518
Were you hurt, sweetheart?

322
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,812
I'm 100% operational, Mother!

323
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,611
Welcome to the United States,
and enjoy your stay!

324
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:47,622
It is now the hour of the owl!
Hoo, hoo!

325
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,332
Duh? Oh...

326
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,295
Wow! That all happened so fast!

327
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,672
I didn't have time
to transform or help out!

328
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,342
Good thing the Americans
superheroes were here.

329
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:02,053
I couldn't have transformed.
I'm supposed to be in Paris!

330
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:07,183
Relax! Let the local superheroes
handle their own problems.

331
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,437
So far,
nothing to report from Paris.

332
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,981
(Lively music)

333
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,837
Hey! What's that guy doing?

334
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,966
Oh, it's just Captain Redlight,
organising the traffic.

335
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,885
There's a superhero
for everything here, you know.

336
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,639
So, what happened on the plane
with your "friend" Adrien?

337
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:51,018
Nothing! We just watched
the clouds and the sunset.

338
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,981
But only as friends!
It's a typical thing to do!

339
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,983
Grr!

340
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,901
<i>Paris is safe</i>
<i>from supervillains!</i>

341
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,194
<i>Have Ladybug and Cat Noir</i>

342
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,405
<i>put an end to Hawk Moth?</i>

343
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,283
<i>‐ A segment by Clara Contard.</i>
‐ Forget about Paris, dude!

344
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:08,369
You're in New York now!
Your old man's not here,

345
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,913
and when the cat's away,
the mice will play!

346
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,790
Open your eyes,
you know what I mean?

347
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,917
Take it all in!

348
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,880
It is beautiful!

349
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,882
The Little Croissants
are en route.

350
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,260
‐ <i>Good. Don't leave them.</i>
‐ Roger that.

351
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,678
Meet you in the lobby.

352
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,322
‐ Two of them are missing.
‐ (Bang)

353
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,156
Oh! There they are!

354
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,203
(Bang)

355
00:22:58,628 --> 00:22:59,462
(Bang)

356
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,215
Hey! You guys
are the cool French kids

357
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,761
that made that movie! We're from
Armstrong High in Queens!

358
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,185
Baby‐sitting some tourists
and their socks?

359
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,896
I mean, don't they have
anything better for us to do?

360
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,939
Those two
are made for each other.

361
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,233
Seriously, Aeon? Not again!

362
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,569
But I am programmed
to help people, Jess.

363
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,405
Just stop meddling
with people's private lives!

364
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,241
You're right.
Let's just follow the orders

365
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:34,038
‐ and protect the tourists.
‐ (Clapping) Listen, students!

366
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,998
You'll go to your rooms
by groups of four.

367
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,042
Everyone come
take your itinerary.

368
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,960
And when I come up
in two minutes,

369
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,421
you had better be in your rooms,
with the lights out!

370
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,549
‐ Come on!
‐ Can we stay up a little bit?

371
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,426
Hey! Sock buddies!

372
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,804
We're throwing
a little party on the roof.

373
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,514
Hang with us, but be quiet, OK?

374
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:59,105
I think there's an American boy
who'd love to see you there.

375
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,524
And you might make... a <i>friend.</i>

376
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:02,525
(Chuckles)

377
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,946
‐ You... you think so?
‐ A rooftop party in this slum?

378
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,117
You want me to catch lameness
and coodies? That's ridiculous!

379
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,868
Sabrina! Suitcase!

380
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,040
Group D. Awesome!
At least we're in the same room.

381
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,877
(Gasps) As Chloé!

382
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,589
Césaire and Dupain‐Cheng?
That is the last straw!

383
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,801
JESS:
Oh, no, this could go wrong.

384
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,804
What do you think, Aeon?
Should we do something?

385
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:35,057
‐ You think we should?
‐ No! I was just kidding.

386
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:38,436
This whole situation
is just plain boring.

387
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,865
(Mysterious music)

388
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,495
MISS MENDELEIEV:
What's that noise?

389
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,972
ADRIEN:
Oh. Sorry. We're so sorry.

390
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:19,602
Uh... Hi! I'm Marinette and this
is my very good friend, Adrien,

391
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:20,519
who's just a friend!

392
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,939
See?
They're made for each other.

393
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,151
(Groans) Fine.
If you want to get to the roof

394
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,821
without attracting attention,
there are stairs outside.

395
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,375
Why do that? I thought
we weren't meant to meddle?

396
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,294
If we're going to
watch over them,

397
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,713
there might as well be
something to watch!

398
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:48,756
Isn't that what you wanted?

399
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,090
(Laughs)

400
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,259
(Lively music)

401
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:19,829
(Window opens)

402
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,550
‐ Is it a bird?
‐ Is it a plane?

403
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,260
No, it's Hot Dog Dan!

404
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:46,897
Hey, hey, hey! Hot Dog Dan's
here, so get in the mood!

405
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,859
I'm the hero of picnics
and tasty food!

406
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:55,614
Hmm. Usually he teams up with
Ketchup Boy and Mustard Justice,

407
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,533
but he's
patrolling solo tonight.

408
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:01,579
You should hurry if you wanna
try one of his magic hot dogs.

409
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,758
Sorry, guys,
I only have two hotdogs left

410
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,261
‐ for the four of you.
‐ Not a problem.

411
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:20,347
My girl and I will take one
and you two take the other!

412
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,059
‐ Between friends...
‐ (Chuckles)

413
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,229
It's all yours, Adrien.
My pleasure, as your friend.

414
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,606
No, you take it, Marinette.

415
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,818
Come on now,
one hot dog for two, coming up!

416
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:44,997
(High‐pitched voice)
Oh, finally!

417
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,999
My chick's wings are growing!

418
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:47,958
(Laughter)

419
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,046
You were right, they really
seem to be made for each other.

420
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:56,050
Yeah, no. With those two,
the situation's far from simple.

421
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,346
Hey, you play the guitar!
Maybe you can give them a hand!

422
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,014
Do you know this song?

423
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,610
Oh! That's the song we danced to
at Chloé's party, remember?

424
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,071
Ooh, yes! (Chuckles)

425
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,406
Then, will you?

426
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,797
(Romantic music)

427
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,935
<i>Picture yourself</i>
<i>a beautiful sunflower.</i>

428
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,938
(Lively music)

429
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,070
It was so romantic, you two
dancing in the moonlight,

430
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,280
‐ wasn't it?
‐ Yeah... So, ro...

431
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,450
Friendly! Friendly!
It was a very friendly dance!

432
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,244
Hey, look, that teacher!

433
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,788
That's Dean Gate,
aka "Door Man"!

434
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:10,916
He can turn a door
into a teleporting passage!

435
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,086
Superheroes don't need to hide
their identity in America!

436
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,256
Amazing! I'm going to ask him
for a quote for the Ladyblog!

437
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:24,972
(Bang)

438
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,727
(Bang)

439
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,230
Those two seem to exhibit
repetitive behaviours.

440
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,026
Tough luck, right?
We always end up together!

441
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,946
I mean, stuck together.
Ha, ha! (Sighs)

442
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,323
I don't mind being stuck
with a friend like you.

443
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,910
Right! As friends!
It's all good!

444
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,249
I know what to do. If anything's
gonna change between them,

445
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,877
they'll need to find themselves
in a dangerous situation.

446
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,296
What? Are you out of your mind?

447
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,214
Statistically speaking,

448
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,675
humans confronted
with extreme situations

449
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,261
often cause their feelings
to become stronger.

450
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,847
They must believe
they won't see each other again

451
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,641
and it's the last chance they'll
get to say how they feel.

452
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,977
Here's what we'll do.
During the visit,

453
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,480
get them to go
to the Lafayette room alone.

454
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,149
Boom! That's when supervillain
Solitude shows up

455
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,360
and threatens to kidnap
any person that nobody loves.

456
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,905
He threatens Adrien,
and in order to save him...

457
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,907
"No, don't kidnap him,
I love him!"

458
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:29,036
OK... It's so stupid,
it could actually work.

459
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,662
Wow! Cool impression!

460
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,956
Hey, hold on!
A supervillain? How... ?

461
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:33,540
(Bang)

462
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,380
‐ Trust us.
‐ (Clapping)

463
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,675
Get them to the room
and we'll take care of the rest.

464
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,929
For someone
who didn't want me to meddle,

465
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,680
you seem deeply involved.

466
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,808
This is more fun
than babysitting socks!

467
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,269
This is the famous sabre
of Marquis de Lafayette.

468
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,147
And the necklace he gave
George Washington as a symbol

469
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,691
of friendship between
their nations.

470
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,402
Careful! The security system
is very sensitive!

471
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,946
You don't want to
set off the alarm.

472
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:08,116
Let's go to the next room, where
we'll see the Statue of Liberty!

473
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:12,454
The Marquis de Lafayette was 19
when he participated

474
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,373
in the War of Independence.

475
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,708
So young, and already gifted
with an incredible ability

476
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,920
to galvanize people. He helped
Washington's troops win

477
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,255
the Battle of Yorktown.

478
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,341
Everyone thinks it was all due
to Lafayette's potential.

479
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:27,261
I think it was also due
to something special.

480
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,971
A Miraculous.

481
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,598
Nathalie,
you take care of Paris,

482
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,517
I'll take care of New York.

483
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,895
Nooroo, dark wings rise!

484
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,981
(Ominous music)

485
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,906
Techlonizer, I am Hawk Moth.

486
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,784
You were robbed of your
technological arsenal

487
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,828
by those heinous superheroes.

488
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,873
I can give you the power to
steal and clone any technology

489
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,833
so you can get
your revenge on them!

490
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,253
In exchange, you will
bring me Lafayette's sabre.

491
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,047
Wouldn't you rather have
an atomic bomb?

492
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,633
HAWK MOTH: No. I want the sabre.

493
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,475
France gave the Statue of
Liberty to America in 1886.

494
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,686
Gustave Eiffel
built the armature

495
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,855
for the inside of the statue!

496
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,815
Could you take a pic
of Lafayette's sabre?

497
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,443
I completely forgot,
and I must film Dean Gate!

498
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,278
Of course!

499
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,905
The real statue
has a hollow stone in its base,

500
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,657
containing
the Declaration of Independence.

501
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,411
I can't find my headphones.
Could you check the other room?

502
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,205
‐ I'll look here.
‐ No problem. I'm on it!

503
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,375
In this hollow stone, there's
also a safe that contains

504
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,545
artefacts left by the people
who unveiled the statue.

505
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,381
No one's opened it since.
I don't know about you all,

506
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,593
but I, for one, would love
to know what's inside that safe.

507
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,763
Uh, excuse me, sir, but, um...
why not use your superpower

508
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,806
to enter the door
that leads there?

509
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,851
Superpowers should never be used
for personal gain,

510
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:01,271
only for the greater good!
Besides, even if I got inside,

511
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:04,107
I couldn't open the safe,
because its key is in Paris,

512
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,694
‐ inside the Eiffel Tower.
‐ Wow!

513
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,953
‐ Uh... A‐Adrien?
‐ Marinette?

514
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,207
(Gasps) What's happening?

515
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,961
‐ That's strange.
‐ (Phone alert)

516
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:29,967
<i>Akumatised villain, Robostus,</i>
<i>is spreading panic in Paris.</i>

517
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,843
<i>And, so far,</i>
<i>no sign of Ladybug and Cat Noir!</i>

518
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,514
Robostus? But Markov can't
have been akumatised in Paris,

519
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,724
he's right here
in New York with us!

520
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,685
‐ What are they doing?
‐ I'm not sure.

521
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,146
But their stress levels are
high enough to engage Phase 2.

522
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:43,981
OK, go!

523
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,906
I am Solitude,
and I am here to take captive

524
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,908
of those who are
loved by no one!

525
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,873
(Rumbling)

526
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,962
(Ominous music)

527
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,814
(Evil laugh)

528
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,942
Techno‐Pirate! He escaped?

529
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:32,029
He seems more powerful.
But I can't read fully, as if...

530
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,865
magic was interfering
with my scanning tools!

531
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,909
(Action music)

532
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,839
Hey! I thought your thing
was new technology?

533
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,842
What are you planning to do?
Use the sabre as an antenna?

534
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,136
I don't have time
to play with annoying kids!

535
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,936
Cat Noir should have told me
Robustus is back.

536
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,064
‐ I hope he's not in trouble.
‐ What do we do?

537
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:10,067
Shouldn't we head back
ASAP to warn Ladybug?

538
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:24,915
Run, run! Come on!

539
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,640
Sparrow to United Heroes!
Enhanced Techno‐Pirate... Aaah!

540
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,393
This way, kids!
Let the adults handle this!

541
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,942
Your power is mine!

542
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,205
‐ What?
‐ Nobody escapes my sight!

543
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,594
Marinette's in danger!
Plagg, claws out!

544
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,472
(Action music)

545
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,876
Vacation is over!

546
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,878
Tikki, spots on!

547
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,505
(Action music)

548
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:13,857
Ladybug?

549
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:14,983
Cat Noir?

550
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,028
BOTH: What are you doing here?

551
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,615
Uh... It's a long story!
Where's Marinette?

552
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,868
I got her to safety. But why
aren't you back in Paris?

553
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,042
I'll explain later!

554
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,966
Nathalie, you can get rid
of the sentimonster.

555
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,968
We will no longer be needing it!

556
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,474
Let's see if I can
absorb you whole!

557
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,018
Aaah!

558
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,897
You've come from Paris
to help us out?

559
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,692
Yeah. We thought it'd be
friendly to give you a hand

560
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,444
in honour of Friendship Week!

561
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,371
See that? They don't need
permission to take action!

562
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,706
That's right.
He never asks for anything.

563
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,292
Do you, Cat Noir?

564
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,881
Sparrow, did you warn
Knight Owl and Majestia?

565
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,134
I couldn't,
but you know what?

566
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,096
We don't need
anyone's permission either!

567
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,641
Sure you want to step out
of the procedure?

568
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,018
It's our chance to prove
we're like these two,

569
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,480
autonomous, bonded together
by trust and super efficient!

570
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,942
"Just go and rest easy!
Leave Paris with me!"

571
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,570
I... I didn't know
I was going to leave!

572
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,738
It was a last‐minute decision,
that's all!

573
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,869
Do you realize there's no one
in Paris to protect the city?

574
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,043
LADYBUG: He's running away!

575
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,628
CAT NOIR:
You sound like Captain Obvious!

576
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,005
Why not tell me
you were leaving?

577
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:03,758
‐ I was afraid you'd get angry!
‐ And you were right,

578
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,428
because, as you can see,
I am angry!

579
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,180
Autonomous, bonded by trust
and super efficient?

580
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,433
Yeah, I might have
overestimated them.

581
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:18,273
Surrender, Techno‐Pirate!
There's nowhere to run now!

582
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,400
(Ominous music)

583
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,861
Cataclysm!

584
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,822
(Heroic music)

585
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,952
Lucky charm!

586
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,585
A bicycle pump? What are
you going to do with that?

587
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,463
I may have an idea,
but you wouldn't like it.

588
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:44,382
Why run away when I can
finally get me revenge

589
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:48,928
by eliminating the kids of
America's most beloved heroes!

590
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,931
I didn't tell you because
I feared losing your trust.

591
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,392
Well, I can't trust you
any longer, can I?

592
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,371
No!

593
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,885
HAWK MOTH:
That's it for now, Techlonizer.

594
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,389
What... What happened?

595
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,518
Get in. Leave the sabre behind.

596
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,706
What have you done?

597
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,459
It's my fault.

598
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,925
Why didn't you call us? And you,
what are you doing here?

599
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,469
‐ I might be able to help.
‐ Oh, really?

600
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,221
With your magical bicycle pump?

601
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:15,849
Precisely.

602
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,185
Miraculous Ladybug!

603
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,819
‐ (PC rebooting sound)
‐ Rebooting.

604
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,531
Oh, thank you, Ladybug!

605
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,871
‐ You two are too dangerous.
‐ No, they tried to ‐‐

606
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,539
So are you. You disobeyed me!

607
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,291
You were supposed to call us,
and didn't.

608
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,835
I order you to revert
to your civilian identities

609
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:47,422
and hand me your powers. We'll
return them when you leave.

610
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,424
We can't do that!

611
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,509
It's true we made a mistake,
but I've fixed everything!

612
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:55,305
If your power is fixing
his mistakes, we don't need you!

613
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,390
It's better like this.

614
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,352
What would have happened if
Uncanny hadn't been an android?

615
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,354
We can't give them
our Miraculous.

616
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,361
Stop right there!
That's an order!

617
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,750
(Panting)

618
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,294
OK! Let's feed our kwamis
and get back to Paris

619
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,338
to take care of Robostus.

620
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:31,716
<i>Paris was attacked by a villain</i>
<i>who disappeared on his own.</i>

621
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,844
<i>‐ Clara Contard is on the scene.</i>
<i>‐ Parisians are surprised.</i>

622
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:36,513
<i>Why didn't</i>
<i>our superheroes step in?</i>

623
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:40,058
<i>And will Ladybug repair the</i>
<i>damages caused by the villain?</i>

624
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,310
We waited too long
to return to Paris.

625
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,395
There's nothing
I can do any more.

626
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,773
Can't you just do
a lucky charm when we're back?

627
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,068
My power allows me
to create a magical object

628
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,196
that repairs damages
caused by a specific villain.

629
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,031
But the villain is already gone.

630
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:57,242
Then there's no longer
a chance for repairs?

631
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:08,795
It's all my fault.
You were perfect, as always.

632
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,674
Knight Owl is right to want
to confiscate my Miraculous.

633
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:14,634
I left Paris without
telling you.

634
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,177
I ruined everything.

635
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,972
And if Uncanny Valley
hadn't been a robot,

636
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,765
I would have caused
irreparable harm.

637
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:22,934
Spots off.

638
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:26,855
Claws in.

639
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,399
Please forgive me, my friend.

640
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,318
‐ No!
‐ I renounce you, Plagg.

641
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:34,737
What?

642
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,990
I never want to risk harming
anyone again. Least of all you.

643
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,033
Wait!

644
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:42,829
Cat Noir?

645
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:59,137
Ah! It's been a long time since
we stretched our wings, Gilbert!

646
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,765
‐ Gilbert? Mr Marquis?
‐ I was right.

647
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,351
The jewel was indeed
the Miraculous of the Eagle!

648
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:09,898
‐ You're not Gilbert.
‐ I am your new master.

649
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:13,776
Just like your former one,
I have a great dream to achieve.

650
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,528
And I believe you can help me.

651
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,574
Oh, you know, I'm just Liiri,
the kwami of Freedom.

652
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,118
My power is to free people
from anything

653
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,787
that prevents them
from reaching their potential.

654
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,581
Nothing too powerful!
(Nervous laugh)

655
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:29,959
Well, that potential
is all I need

656
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,921
to seize Ladybug and Cat Noir's
Miraculous!

657
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,215
‐ Adrien Agreste.
‐ He's not here, ma'am!

658
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,133
Neither is Marinette!

659
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,429
You had one mission... to keep
an eye on the French students!

660
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,724
We did! That's how we discovered
she was unclear about

661
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:47,810
her relationship with Adrien.
So, we created a villain

662
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,105
‐ to clarify their feelings.
‐ You did what?

663
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,275
‐ Barb. Honey.
‐ Mother, I don't understand.

664
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,569
You always say
that all that is necessary

665
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:59,113
for the triumph of evil is that
good people do nothing.

666
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,157
What did I do wrong?

667
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,159
My darling,
by trying to help them,

668
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:06,245
you've put the French students
and yourselves in danger.

669
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,373
Doing good doesn't
necessary mean fighting.

670
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:12,001
We tried to be helpful, because
we'd nothing better to do!

671
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,587
We're not babysitters,
we're superheroines!

672
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:17,840
Superheroes, whose mission was
to keep an eye on the students

673
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,426
and you failed!
You're forbidden to take part

674
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,221
in the hunt for Techno‐Pirate.
You're not ready.

675
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,849
How will I ever be ready if you
never let me spread my wings?

676
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,977
No one prohibits them
from fighting villains!

677
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,063
And I almost lost you
because of that.

678
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,649
Come on, Olympia.
We're expected.

679
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,030
(Phone alert)

680
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,034
(Phone alert)

681
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:46,869
This is all my fault.

682
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:49,998
I should've stopped him
from leaving!

683
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:53,126
He made his choice.
What were we supposed to do?

684
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,880
Mike Rochip,
AKA Techno‐Pirate,

685
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,590
is still on the run!

686
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,508
Until we capture him,

687
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,637
the French‐American friendship
ceremony will be postponed.

688
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:05,972
President Hombee is right.

689
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:08,474
Any mass gathering
would be too dangerous.

690
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,436
As long as Techno‐Pirate
roams free, we're asking you,

691
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:15,356
dear New Yorkers, dear guests,
to stay safe wherever you are!

692
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:18,067
Meanwhile, we will keep
patrolling the city

693
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,028
and won't rest
until we've captured him!

694
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:23,990
Release me!
I'm not done with me revenge!

695
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:28,369
All that anger... Who am I to
stop you from giving into it?

696
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:33,166
Techlonizer, I'm returning
your powers back to you!

697
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,044
And as a bonus,
to make it up to you

698
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:38,421
and allow you to fulfil
your fantasies of revenge,

699
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,882
I'll give you another weapon!

700
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:44,677
To receive your powers,
say, "Liiri, wings of prey."

701
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:49,390
‐ Marinette?
‐ Adrien?

702
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,529
<i>Get in the car. I shouldn't</i>
<i>have listened to your friend.</i>

703
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,865
<i>This city is much too dangerous.</i>

704
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,201
Dude, no! Stay!

705
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,038
I have to go.
I'm sorry, Marinette.

706
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,541
You fought so hard
for me to be here.

707
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,419
I wouldn't have minded being
stuck here a little longer

708
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,378
with a friend like you.

709
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:27,053
My father's right. I should have
never come to New York.

710
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,724
What is wrong with you,
Marinette?

711
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,811
Couldn't you see he was waiting
for you to tell him to stay?

712
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:36,979
What? But I...
He... he made his choice.

713
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,817
‐ What did you expect me to do?
‐ Never mind what I expected!

714
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,653
Who's Adrien to you?
A friend or more than that?

715
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,948
There'll never be
a better time to be clear!

716
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,450
Do you want him to leave
or do you want him to stay?

717
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,955
Adrien! Stay!

718
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:57,333
I've already lost Cat Noir,
I can't lose Adrien too!

719
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:57,875
No!

720
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,463
Come back!

721
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,884
You have to stay! Aaah!

722
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:13,349
Adrien... I... love you.

723
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,111
I wanna surrender!

724
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,323
I never wanted to stop the
French‐American Ceremony!

725
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:33,870
If I have to lose my freedom for
everyone to celebrate theirs,

726
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:39,083
then fine, I surrender!
Put me in jail!

727
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,877
I'll go first.

728
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:43,171
Whatever his powers may be,
I'm the only one he can't harm.

729
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,470
Don't be scared.

730
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:56,434
I genuinely wish for nothing
but your freedom! Liberation!

731
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,899
Majestia,
you're afraid of your own power.

732
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,692
I release you from your fear!

733
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:10,156
Ah! All the things
I never dared to try!

734
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,915
Wa‐ha‐ha! Too easy!

735
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:22,376
Knight Owl! Your morality keeps
you from bringing justice

736
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,003
more swiftly than you wish?

737
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:26,464
I release you
from your code of ethics!

738
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:30,843
Why should I show more leniency
than the people who show none?

739
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,638
You don't know how to park, huh?

740
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:38,351
Victory, you once swore
you would devote your life

741
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:42,855
to protecting people's freedom.
I release you from that promise!

742
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,983
You'll see who's leader
of the free world!

743
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:49,278
You will obey me!
No more freedom!

744
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,829
Door Man,
you can go anywhere you want,

745
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,207
but you resist personal
gain for the better good.

746
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,751
I release you from your qualms!

747
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,338
I've always wanted to visit
the Vatican Secret Archives!

748
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,840
No! I know! The Queen
of England's treasure room!

749
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,303
(Hysterical laugh)

750
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:18,140
Good job, Miraclonizer.
Now hook me up!

751
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:24,021
<i>Ladybug, Cat Noir,</i>
<i>I'm in New York too!</i>

752
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,315
<i>If you don't want</i>
<i>the party to be ruined,</i>

753
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,902
<i>your only option is to hand</i>
<i>your Miraculous over to me.</i>

754
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,572
‐ We have to go.
‐ They told us not to move,

755
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,741
‐ remember?
‐ Yes, but my mom

756
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:39,495
told me that being human meant
learning when to bend the rules.

757
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,789
Let's go!

758
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,545
We're the only ones left!
What if we fail?

759
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,922
Incorrect. Ladybug
and Cat Noir are here too!

760
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:54,051
Are you serious? They almost
deactivated you permanently!

761
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,638
We're dealing with a villain
with extra powers.

762
00:50:57,638 --> 00:51:00,349
We have a zero probability
of success without them.

763
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,769
‐ But they're just teenagers!
‐ And so are we.

764
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:08,441
OK. You know what? We have to
give ourselves a chance,

765
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,818
because we are the last chance!

766
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,862
Statistically speaking,
that is correct.

767
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,781
But how will we find
Ladybug and Cat Noir?

768
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,492
No one can keep their identity
a secret from me.

769
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,666
OK. On one side there's me,
my basic training,

770
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,752
and zero weaponry.

771
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:30,963
On the other, an army
of powerful heroes gone insane.

772
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,386
Sounds evenly matched!

773
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,515
You didn't recycle
and you didn't return your book!

774
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,810
‐ You're both going to prison!
‐ That's not how you trained us.

775
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,771
I ordered you
to stay at the hotel!

776
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,610
Respect your leaders!

777
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,287
Marinette Dupain‐Cheng,
New York needs Ladybug.

778
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:06,332
I'm sorry.
I‐I‐I can't help you.

779
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,001
‐ I don't know her!
‐ Your suit's quantum masking

780
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:11,837
is meant to confuse humans'
minds, Ladybug. I am not human.

781
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,798
What?

782
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,717
Miraclonizer is an akumatised
Techno‐Pirate.

783
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,387
Which means Hawk Moth
is in New York too.

784
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:23,265
We cannot defeat them without
the girl who can fix everything.

785
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,267
I don't know if I can do this.

786
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,437
I can't imagine
being Ladybug without him.

787
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,314
This, I can fix!

788
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:34,777
(Heroic music)

789
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:50,918
Cat Noir!
New York and Ladybug need you.

790
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:54,755
I'm no longer Cat Noir.

791
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,383
To err is human, apparently.

792
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,094
My mistakes are unforgivable.

793
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:03,013
I couldn't bear to see
the disappointment in her eyes.

794
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,932
LADYBUG:
I don't know if I can do this.

795
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,977
I can't imagine
being Ladybug without <i>him.</i>

796
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,062
Your lady is waiting for you.

797
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:18,529
‐ Glad to see you again, Plagg!
‐ No need to get so cheesy!

798
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,991
‐ Who are you talking to?
‐ My kwami.

799
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:24,118
Kwamis can't be detected
by technology,

800
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:27,163
which means your robobuddy
can't see or hear me.

801
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:29,790
(Makes mocking sounds)

802
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,586
There's no time to lose.
We have to get back!

803
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,005
Plagg, claws out!

804
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,966
(Heroic music)

805
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,922
We've got to break the object
where the akuma is.

806
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:20,841
I bet it's in his handcuffs.
He had them on, at the museum.

807
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,053
Something else has changed.
He was wearing the necklace

808
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:27,848
‐ Lafayette gave Washington.
‐ (Gasps) A Miraculous!

809
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:31,352
That would explain his power
upgrade. Good insight, Milady!

810
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:33,979
Don't ever do that to me again!

811
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,815
I'm sorry. I was so afraid
to disappoint you

812
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:40,319
that I didn't dare tell you
the truth. I was so stupid.

813
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:46,700
Miraclonizer! It's time to
proceed to the next step!

814
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,285
Give me that!

815
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:06,845
<i>Ladybug, Cat Noir, if the rocket</i>
<i>were to take off because of you,</i>

816
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,056
<i>a world war would be declared!</i>

817
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,725
<i>Unless you give me</i>
<i>your Miraculous, of course!</i>

818
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,938
<i>You have five minutes!</i>
<i>Tick‐tock, tick‐tock...</i>

819
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,982
OK.
The first thing we need to do

820
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,109
is seize
Miraclonizer's Miraculous.

821
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:23,153
That way, we'll break the spell
and free the adults,

822
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,197
and in turn they'll help us
de‐akumatise him!

823
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:26,949
But we can't get near him!

824
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:28,951
Nothing's impossible
for Ladybug.

825
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,078
Lucky Charm!

826
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:37,293
So we're supposed to defeat
superheroes with a key chain?

827
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:39,503
‐ Interesting.
‐ Yes. Well...

828
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,505
as soon as I figure out
how to use it.

829
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:47,094
Four minutes 35...
four minutes 34...

830
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:50,139
Uncanny, can you show me how
the Statue of Liberty is built?

831
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,934
Look!
There's a ladder inside the arm

832
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,895
‐ that leads to the platform.
‐ Awesome!

833
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:01,025
But how will we get inside when
there's an army attacking us?

834
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:01,608
BOTH: Door Man!

835
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,029
Thanks to his tele‐doortation
power, he could get us

836
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,613
inside the statue unnoticed.

837
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:10,200
But Door Man only uses his power
to satisfy his own curiosity.

838
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,495
‐ He'll never agree to help us.
‐ Besides, how will we find him?

839
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,997
He could be anywhere!

840
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,666
By using his curiosity
to our advantage!

841
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,920
Sparrow, grab a cardboard box
and that newspaper

842
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,589
and make a giftbox!

843
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,382
Uncanny!

844
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:30,346
Dear sir, we got you
a little gift to thank you

845
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:34,099
for our day at the museum!
We hope you enjoy the surprise!

846
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,393
Meet you on Liberty Island!
Good luck!

847
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:41,690
Kids?

848
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:43,859
(Laughs)

849
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:48,447
"We know how fascinating
you think keys are,

850
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,823
so we hope you like this."

851
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,993
Signed, Jess and Aeon!
Of course!

852
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,995
That's where
I should have started!

853
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,382
Here it is! The key!

854
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:08,842
The one that opens the safe
hidden in the statue!

855
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:19,937
No! At least let me see
what's inside the safe!

856
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,940
Only a few seconds left!

857
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:35,119
I'll take that!

858
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:38,956
Sparrow!

859
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,843
Hello, fledgling!
All you have to say is,

860
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:53,011
"Liiri, Wings of Liberty!"

861
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,180
Liiri, Wings of Liberty!

862
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:03,564
Cool down!

863
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,035
They can't say
I didn't warn them.

864
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,582
Ladybug, Cat Noir!
This be your last chance

865
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:23,000
to give me your Miraculous!

866
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:24,877
BOTH: Never!

867
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:30,757
(Ominous music)

868
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:37,890
(Heroic music)

869
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,833
Cataclysm!

870
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,214
No more evildoing for you,
little akuma!

871
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,802
Time to de‐evilise!

872
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:20,766
Gotcha!

873
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:23,852
Bye‐bye, little butterfly!

874
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,897
Miraculous Ladybug!

875
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,658
Seriously, what happened?

876
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:43,830
Keep it.
I know you'll use it well.

877
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:48,085
I've disobeyed again,
which means...

878
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,462
I'll never get
my weapons back, right?

879
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:53,090
With the powers
of the Miraculous,

880
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,550
you won't need them anymore.

881
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,552
And I was wrong.

882
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,470
My little sparrow was ready
to become a fearsome eagle.

883
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:02,182
Thank you, Mom!
I mean, thank you... sir!

884
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:05,185
It doesn't matter anymore.

885
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:08,313
With this new suit, everyone
now knows Sparrow is a female,

886
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,941
not a male, and that
the legendary Knight Owl

887
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,193
and Sparrow are long gone.

888
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:15,279
Maybe it's a sign.

889
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,906
That the time has come
to embrace who we really are!

890
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:21,660
And even though it still worries
us, the only way for you to grow

891
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,869
is for us
to let you take chances.

892
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:25,706
Thank you for inspiring them.

893
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:27,874
And please forgive us
for misjudging you.

894
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,876
ALL: Pound it!

895
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:35,257
My theory was correct.
There are other lost Miraculous.

896
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:39,886
And wherever they are
in the world, they will be mine!

897
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,268
Uncanny, what about
our secret identities?

898
01:00:46,602 --> 01:00:48,812
Don't worry.
Once we've said goodbye,

899
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:51,648
I'll erase this information
from my memory.

900
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,817
Thank you for bringing
us back together.

901
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,279
I'll see you back in Paris,
Milady!

902
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:04,995
<i>The Mayor's office</i>
<i>has set to work</i>

903
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,872
<i>to repair the damage</i>
<i>Robostus caused in Paris.</i>

904
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,958
<i>We did miss our local heroes,</i>
<i>Ladybug and Cat Noir,</i>

905
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:12,044
<i>but for good reason.</i>

906
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:14,087
<i>At the same moment,</i>
<i>they were busy saving New York!</i>

907
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:17,299
Marinette, everyone's
waiting for you. Remember?

908
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:20,552
The surprise for Adrien,
your "friend"?

909
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:23,221
Oh! I don't know, Alya.

910
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,140
We're going back
to Paris tomorrow.

911
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,726
You can ask yourself
the question then. Come on.

912
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:31,980
HELLO ADRIEN!

913
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,906
Oh, Chloé! I'm so glad to see
you're finally having some fun!

914
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:44,618
Of course not! I'm only happy
because we're leaving tomorrow!

915
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,788
<i>Now you're a big puffy cloud.</i>

916
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,915
(Heroic music)

917
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,849
Now the Eagle's Miraculous
has been found,

918
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:09,810
it must return to its box.

919
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,105
I have come a long way,
so give it back with no fuss.

920
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,107
‐ I'm not in the mood.
‐ Negative!

921
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:18,652
Eagle has proved that she is
a worthy Miraculous holder!

922
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:19,361
Why not stay here?

923
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:23,824
We could create a new generation
of heroes together!
