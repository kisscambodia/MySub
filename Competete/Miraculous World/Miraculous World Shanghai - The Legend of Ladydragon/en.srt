FEI: <i>It all took place</i>
<i>on the day</i>

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,183
<i>of the magical eclipse.</i>

6
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,527
<i>Wu Shifu was desperate.</i>

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,655
<i>The secret he guarded</i>
<i>was in danger.</i>

8
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,700
Shame on us, Master! Our Kung Fu
is not up to your teaching!

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,827
You still have so much to learn!

10
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,206
FEI: <i>What had become</i>
<i>of the ancestral values?</i>

11
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,167
<i>Courage, honesty, loyalty?</i>

12
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,461
<i>A mysterious stranger</i>
<i>was doing all he could</i>

13
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,172
<i>to force the master</i>
<i>to sell his school.</i>

14
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,383
<i>Someone clearly wanted</i>
<i>to take over the land</i>

15
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,093
<i>upon which it was built.</i>

16
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,972
<i>The greed of the world</i>
<i>was destroying everything.</i>

17
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:58,684
<i>His school was his life, and hs</i>
<i>students were like his childre.</i>

18
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,435
<i>Without a family of his own,</i>

19
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,728
<i>he would have no one</i>

20
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,021
<i>to pass on his legacy</i>

21
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,690
<i>and all the responsibilities</i>

22
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,024
<i>that came with it.</i>

23
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,192
<i>To whom would he entrust</i>

24
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:07,985
<i>his heavy secret?</i>

25
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>What if no one was there</i>

26
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,280
<i>to protect the sacred cave</i>

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,156
<i>during the next magical eclips?</i>

28
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,745
<i>Now alone, he had lost all hop.</i>

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,499
<i>And that was when we met.</i>

30
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,293
(Crying)

31
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,088
<i>He gave me my name.</i>
<i>In Mandarin,</i>

32
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,091
<i>it means "to fly in the sky".</i>

33
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,972
<i>My name is Fei.</i>

34
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,807
<i>My adoptive father, Wu Shi Fu,</i>

35
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,935
<i>would go on to teach me</i>
<i>the values of Kung Fu</i>

36
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,062
<i>and make me the new guardian.</i>

37
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,443
<i>But they were still trying</i>
<i>to chase us away.</i>

38
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,321
<i>And when they took away</i>
<i>my adoptive father,</i>

39
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,323
<i>they destroyed the school.</i>

40
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,705
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>they even got the bracelet.</i>

41
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,462
(Gasps)

42
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,800
<i>Now I was the only one left</i>

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,636
<i>to protect the secret</i>
<i>of the cave</i>

44
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,221
<i>during the next magic eclipse.</i>

45
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,647
<i>So, school was finally out</i>
<i>and it was gonna be amazing!</i>

46
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,108
<i>We'd go swimming,</i>
<i>hang out at the cinema,</i>

47
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,568
<i>visit the museum,</i>
<i>take long walks...</i>

48
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,655
<i>We even organized a huge</i>
<i>potluck picnic for all of us,</i>

49
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,324
<i>and, this time,</i>
<i>Adrien would join us!</i>

50
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,243
<i>His father</i>
<i>had given him permission.</i>

51
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,122
<i>That's right, holidays</i>
<i>were off to a great start!</i>

52
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,082
<i>Even for Cat Noir and me!</i>

53
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,750
<i>We did have a few missions,</i>

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,627
<i>but no akumatized villain</i>
<i>in sight.</i>

55
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,755
<i>It seemed like Hawk Moth</i>
<i>had taken holidays, too!</i>

56
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,758
<i>We relaxed</i>
<i>'cause we still didn't know</i>

57
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,927
<i>what holidays</i>
<i>for Hawk Moth meant.</i>

58
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,805
<i>Basically, we thought</i>
<i>everything was going well,</i>

59
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,975
<i>until everything</i>
<i>started to go wrong.</i>

60
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,770
Sorry, but I can't get away
from the bakery today.

61
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,314
If the package
doesn't get sent off today,

62
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,942
Uncle Wang won't get it
in time for his birthday!

63
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,985
All right. I'll go.

64
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,404
Thanks, sweetie!

65
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,247
(Phone rings)

66
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,418
MARINETTE: <i>I'm experiencing</i>
<i>a little setback.</i>

67
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,129
Why does that not surprise me
in the slightest?

68
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,631
Save me a seat
next to you‐know‐who, please!

69
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,300
I'll be there as fast as I can!

70
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,635
But don't you know?
I thought you knew!

71
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,345
<i>What?</i>
<i>What am I supposed to know?</i>

72
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,972
Adrien's gone to Shanghai!

73
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,767
Huh? There must be a mistake!

74
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,603
I know everything!
His five first names

75
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,022
and every name day,
his yearly schedule

76
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,232
and even his shoe size!
If there were anything

77
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,359
to know about him, I'd know it!

78
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,111
Well, he didn't know either.

79
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,156
He told Nino the opening
of his father's shop in Shanghai

80
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,699
had been moved up
at the last minute.

81
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,580
Shanghai?

82
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,043
RELAXING VOICE:
<i>You are a dolphin,</i>

83
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,630
<i>leaping from wave to wave</i>
<i>in an ocean of tranquility.</i>

84
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,509
This store is essential

85
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,552
for the future
of the Agreste family.

86
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,262
Opening it much sooner
than expected

87
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,639
is very good news.

88
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,098
There will be other fun times

89
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:07,933
with your friends.

90
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,393
You're right. Besides,

91
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,063
I'm glad I get to spend
time with you, Father.

92
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,774
I'm looking forward to it, too.
But before that,

93
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,735
I still have to sort out
organizational details.

94
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,945
(Sighs)

95
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,369
Did you check everything out?

96
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,372
<i>All the conditions necessary</i>
<i>for the magical eclipse</i>

97
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,207
<i>will be met tomorrow as planne.</i>

98
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,303
Please, Master, think!

99
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,555
It is for good reason

100
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,056
the Prodigious was abandoned

101
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,599
in favor of the Miraculous.

102
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,976
It was secured in that cave

103
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,144
because it is too dangerous!

104
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,896
Precisely, Nooroo.

105
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,898
Ladybug and Cat Noir's
Miraculous

106
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,025
have held me in check
for too long.

107
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,820
I won't pass up an opportunity
to destroy them

108
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,530
with this higher power.

109
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,490
What I started 15 years ago,

110
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,327
I will finish tomorrow, at last.

111
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,455
‐ Mom!
‐ The package!

112
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,125
‐ It'll never make it in time!
‐ Yes, it will.

113
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,586
Because I'm gonna hand it
to Uncle Wang myself.

114
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,504
‐ Uh...
‐ You see,

115
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,799
because it's high time
I visit my uncle in person!

116
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,967
Because my uncle...

117
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,555
is my roots! And I've tried
to connect with Adri ‐‐

118
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,224
I mean, my roots for so long.

119
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,602
And he keeps...
I mean, they keep eluding me.

120
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,522
And without him, uh, I mean,
them... without my roots,

121
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,108
‐ I mean, I feel incomplete.
‐ Marinette,

122
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,359
are you saying that...

123
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,945
you want to go to Shanghai?

124
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,327
Your mother and I
have been waiting

125
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,661
for this moment for so long.

126
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,665
We always thought
you'd want to connect

127
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,167
with your Chinese family!

128
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,752
We've been putting
money aside

129
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,462
since you were born,

130
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,672
enough for a family trip.

131
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,549
We were just waiting
for you to ask.

132
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,678
For you to be ready!
Still, this is a bit sudden!

133
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,514
We can't close the bakery now.

134
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,309
If you want to give Uncle Wang
his gift in person...

135
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,685
You'll have to go alone.

136
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,649
You're the best parents
in the whole world!

137
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,203
WANG:
What a joy to see you again!

138
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,373
I'm so happy
you finally made the trip!

139
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,626
Yes, it's good, and this way
you'll get your present on time!

140
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,961
Your visit is my present,
Marinette.

141
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,673
Your mother said you wanted
to connect with your roots,

142
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,716
and that's the happiest
you can make me.

143
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,135
The restaurant
had many guests planned,

144
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,805
but I cancelled everything.
I took a vacation

145
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,848
for the first time since...

146
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,976
Since your mother
moved to France.

147
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,312
You didn't have
to do that for me!

148
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,357
Of course I did.
Family is sacred.

149
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,902
Your English has improved
since you last came to Paris.

150
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,489
I have worked hard so it'd be
easier to communicate with you.

151
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,617
And now I can tell you
all about your ancestors

152
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,661
and show you every family photo.

153
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,163
Next time,
I'll take you to visit Shanghai

154
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,833
and teach you all the Chengs'
traditional songs.

155
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,960
The Chengs
have traditional songs?

156
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,881
The Bund District
is so impressive, Father!

157
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,759
Have you ever spent time
in Shanghai outside of work?

158
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,969
Of course I have.

159
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,804
You must have places to show me!

160
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,723
I'd love to see them together!

161
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,475
I suppose. But before we do,

162
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,854
I have some details to work out
for tomorrow's opening night.

163
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,356
I guess I'll just stay
at the hotel and wait for you.

164
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,318
No. Take advantage of this
beautiful day to walk around.

165
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,654
I'll join you
in the early afternoon.

166
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,370
Your great‐great‐great‐
grandfather designed dresses

167
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,330
for the Beijing opera
performers.

168
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,667
Marinette! Marinette!
It's Marinette!

169
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,171
Yes, Bastille. I'm very proud to
finally introduce my grandniece

170
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,422
Marinette to you!

171
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,842
Nice to meet you, uh, Bastille.

172
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,511
Bastille has always been
in the family. Look!

173
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,680
He was already there
with Grandpa Yan

174
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,309
and Granny Mei Cheng,
and with Xia‐Bing, your mother.

175
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,478
‐ Xia‐Bing?
‐ Yes.

176
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:25,273
She only took the name Sabine
when she moved to France.

177
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:29,277
Wow! I've never seen
that photo of Mom.

178
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,155
Magic ingredient!
Magic ingredient!

179
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,657
Yes, Bastille.
I haven't forgotten.

180
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,659
Do you remember
my style of cooking?

181
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,995
Huh? Uh... Oh, right! Ha, ha!

182
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,248
You improvise around something
that fate brings you!

183
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,501
And today fate has
brought you, Marinette!

184
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,628
But I don't have
any ingredients on me!

185
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,963
‐ (Phone buzzes)
‐ Oh! (Giggles)

186
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,761
Oh! I know!
I could go for a walk

187
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,513
and see if fate brings me Adr ‐‐

188
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,973
I mean, a magic ingredient!

189
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,767
Aren't you afraid
of getting lost?

190
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,978
‐ You don't even speak Mandarin!
‐ I won't get lost.

191
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,148
I have my phone.
It has a GPS, and a translator.

192
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:11,027
Very well, but don't go too far.
Everything you need is nearby.

193
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,365
I'm sure our meal tonight
will be very special indeed.

194
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,366
Croa!

195
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,330
You want to put Adrien
in a soup?

196
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,667
Of course not, Tikki! We'll look
for a magic ingredient

197
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,129
and go say "hi" to Adrien.

198
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,799
‐ You mean "ni‐hao"?
‐ You speak Mandarin?

199
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,260
Of course!
Kwamis speak all languages.

200
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,972
That makes sense. You never know
who your next holder will be!

201
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,642
‐ But how will you find Adrien?
‐ See? It's easy.

202
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,563
We're here, he's there.
We just need to follow this map!

203
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,606
This is gonna be super easy!

204
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,238
Hey, aren't you Adrien Agreste,
the famous model?

205
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,783
‐ Grr!
‐ Please, let them.

206
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,826
I don't mind.

207
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,632
Ah! Hmm.

208
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,645
Hey!

209
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,060
I'm here, Nathalie.
Now all I need

210
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,561
is to find
the perfect person

211
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,021
to akumatize.

212
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,527
Oh, wow. It didn't look
so far away on the map!

213
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,161
<i>I'd like to see</i>
<i>people as people,</i>

214
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,456
<i>think of them as stories.</i>

215
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,625
<i>Their smallest pleasures,</i>
<i>their greatest joys,</i>

216
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,418
<i>their disappointments,</i>
<i>their successes.</i>

217
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,254
<i>That's how my adoptive father</i>

218
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,922
<i>would've wanted me to see them.</i>

219
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,594
Ah! Ah!

220
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,723
(Crying)

221
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,609
Huh?

222
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,196
<i>To be the guardian</i>
<i>he wanted me to be,</i>

223
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,365
<i>I must forget who I really am.</i>

224
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,242
<i>I must get the key back</i>
<i>at all costs.</i>

225
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,703
<i>And for that, I need money.</i>

226
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,372
<i>There is someone who could</i>
<i>tell me what happened</i>

227
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>to my adoptive father,</i>
<i>but I have to pay him.</i>

228
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,222
Hmm?

229
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,645
(Phone rings)

230
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,774
Father? You're done? Oh...

231
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,068
Yes, of course. I understand.

232
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,197
Later? Yeah, sure. As you wish.

233
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,657
See you later, then.

234
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,619
PLAGG:
Your father will never change!

235
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,204
You can depend
on the consistency

236
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,539
in a soft cheese,

237
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,666
but in a human being? Ugh!

238
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,002
What I wouldn't give
for something to eat!

239
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,131
Ah! I've got what you need,
Plagg!

240
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,467
Remember Wang Shifu?
Marinette's uncle?

241
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,927
His Thousand Delights restaurant
is in this town!

242
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,220
Ah!

243
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,141
There's a place
I'd like to go. Do you mind?

244
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,820
Sorry!

245
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,917
Adrien! Adrien!

246
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,294
Adrien!

247
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,549
Adrien...

248
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,013
Sorry!

249
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,392
Oh, no!
That poor girl needs help!

250
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,146
Shoot!

251
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,532
Tikki, spots on!

252
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,659
Tikki?

253
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,496
Tikki!

254
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,333
Aaah!

255
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,628
(Anxious heartbeat)

256
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,173
Tikki!

257
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,444
Huh?

258
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,910
Marinette is in Shanghai?
What an incredible coincidence!

259
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,496
‐ Or fate!
‐ Ah! Love is beautiful!

260
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,748
‐ Love! Love!
‐ Ha, ha!

261
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,417
No, Marinette's just a friend!

262
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,044
Oh! Maybe we could surprise her.

263
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,963
Do you mind
if we wait here with you?

264
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,340
Oh, my!
That would be delightful!

265
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,467
You can help me
prepare our meal.

266
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,016
‐ (Uncle Wang laughs)
‐ Croa!

267
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,562
MARINETTE: <i>I had lost</i>
<i>my Miraculous, my kwagatama,</i>

268
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:24,483
<i>and Tikki. Without my smartphoe</i>
<i>to guide me or to translate,</i>

269
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,402
<i>I had no way</i>
<i>to get back to Uncle Wang</i>

270
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,696
<i>or get myself understood</i>
<i>to get help!</i>

271
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,325
Uh... uh...

272
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,304
Bastille, get some chili peppers
from the pantry, please!

273
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,474
Chili pepper!
Chili pepper! Coming in hot!

274
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,024
I'm looking for these earrings.

275
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,234
Did you see anyone
wearing them?

276
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:24,418
‐ Is Marinette often late?
‐ Marinette? Yeah. All the time!

277
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,463
It would actually be unusual
for her to be on time!

278
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,465
I'll call her anyway.

279
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,429
(Phone rings)

280
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,356
<i>It's Marinette, leave a messag.</i>
<i>Beep!</i>

281
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:49,151
Marinette, this is Uncle Wang.
I hope you didn't get lost!

282
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,653
‐ I've got Adr ‐‐
‐ Shh!

283
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:54,448
Uh, a... surprise! See you soon!

284
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,434
Oh! These are nice!
Thank you, ma'am.

285
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,270
It's not what I'm looking for,
but it's very kind of you.

286
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,319
Thank you.

287
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,200
<i>I'd come here every day, to sel</i>
<i>whatever I'd gotten my hands o.</i>

288
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,036
<i>Little by little,</i>
<i>I'd pay the one</i>

289
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,537
<i>who'd carry out my revenge.</i>

290
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,496
Cash!

291
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:48,294
Fei, what treasures
do you have for me today?

292
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,674
‐ Hmm.
‐ You're going to tell me

293
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,970
‐ there's nothing of value?
‐ I want to help you, really!

294
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,305
But everything has a price.

295
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,515
And the price of these things

296
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,435
‐ is not very high.
‐ I'm tired of stealing!

297
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,020
I want you
to tell me his name!

298
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,855
Until you bring me enough things

299
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,023
to pay that price,

300
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,608
I can't give it to you.

301
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,654
This purse is not bad.
This phone's just junk.

302
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,989
‐ The earrings...
‐ But they're antiques!

303
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,743
I know more about that than you.
They're commonplace.

304
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:26,624
Ugh! How awful. But at least
that can go in the claw crane.

305
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,461
‐ Two hundred yuans for it all.
‐ What? Are you kidding me?

306
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,464
You know, Fei, I like you a lot.

307
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,259
At 200 yuans,
I'm actually doing you a favor,

308
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,389
in memory of the noble Wu Shifu
and all he stood for.

309
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,017
So, if you respect his values,
why not introduce me to the man

310
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,186
who can tell me
who burnt down the school?

311
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,856
Because, just like the school,
those values no longer exist.

312
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,401
What matters today
is driven by the market!

313
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,987
Cash is king, baby! It's sad,

314
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:01,659
but adapting is the key
to success! Two hundred yuans.

315
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,870
At that price, I'd rather
take them to that poor girl!

316
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:10,167
Wait!
Hmm. That's a great idea!

317
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:14,338
If you find her, your "poor"
girl can buy them back!

318
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:19,135
This pitiful stuffed animal
must be very valuable... to her!

319
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,930
Sentimental value.
And feelings are priceless!

320
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,478
If I bring you
the owner of these things

321
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,355
and she buys them all back,

322
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,524
will you finally tell me
what I want to know?

323
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,901
A deal's a deal!

324
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,130
Hey!

325
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,264
<i>I had lost all hope</i>
<i>of finding my things.</i>

326
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,768
<i>Now, I was just trying to find</i>
<i>my way back to the restaurant</i>

327
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,437
<i>to ask for his help.</i>
<i>But I was completely lost.</i>

328
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,324
Sorry!

329
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,826
You're the girl
they were chasing!

330
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,161
They're running after me, now!

331
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,789
I guess you don't speak English?

332
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,752
Yes, I speak English. Follow me!

333
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,560
‐ We lost them!
‐ (Groans)

334
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,395
‐ Something wrong?
‐ I'm so glad

335
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,523
I found somebody
who understands me!

336
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,983
People here are so nice,
but I can't explain

337
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,276
my situation to them!

338
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,736
I'm sure I can help.

339
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,071
Tell me what happened to you.

340
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,948
Someone stole all my things.

341
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,075
My purse, my phone, my earrings.

342
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,996
‐ You found them?
‐ What? These? No.

343
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,790
A nice old lady
gave those to me.

344
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,125
What about the real ones?
Do they have

345
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,585
sentimental value?

346
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,254
Oh, yes. Someone important

347
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,463
gave them to me.

348
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,798
Someone who trusted me.

349
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,470
I also had a jewel
stolen from me...

350
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,848
one that someone special
had entrusted me with.

351
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,642
Like you,
I want it back, at any cost.

352
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,145
‐ So, you get it.
‐ Yes. I'll help you!

353
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,399
Really? Thank you.
I need to go back to my uncle's.

354
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,861
He has a restaurant in Shanghai,
but I don't know the address.

355
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,822
It's them again! Follow me!

356
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,826
Wham! Bam! Pow!

357
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,079
‐ (Laughs)
‐ Marinette, it is me again.

358
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,416
I and... "surprise"
are very worried!

359
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,667
Please, call me back!

360
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,670
I should not have let her
go out alone.

361
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,132
‐ I'm sure everything's fine.
‐ I'll still call the police.

362
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,925
And I'll go see
if I can find her.

363
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,553
‐ Are you sure?
‐ She can't be very far.

364
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,971
And I do speak Mandarin.

365
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,432
Stay here. I won't be very long!

366
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,312
It'll be easier
to find Marinette as Cat Noir.

367
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,149
And how will you explain
Cat Noir's presence in Shanghai?

368
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,152
I'll figure something out.
Plagg, claws out!

369
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,644
I think we're OK now.
Why were you alone in Shanghai?

370
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,437
I'd gone out
to meet with a friend

371
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,357
and then I realized that someone
had stolen my things.

372
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,734
‐ Hmm?
‐ Hmm?

373
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:04,944
Come on!

374
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,324
Put these on, in case
we bump into those kids again!

375
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,493
Why d'you have
all these costumes?

376
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,746
I... I just got back
from a costume party!

377
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,707
Let's take a bike.
I thought about your earrings.

378
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,834
I know a street
filled with pawnshops.

379
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,629
Maybe your thief tricked them
into buying your things,

380
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,674
‐ pretending they were theirs.
‐ Oh. OK.

381
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,635
Oh! Do you think
we could find my uncle's number

382
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,553
so I can call him?
He must be worried.

383
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,307
Uh, I ran out of credit.
I can't call anyone. Sorry!

384
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:39,144
Don't worry, you can reassure
him in person very soon.

385
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,858
‐ What's your name, by the way?
‐ Fei.

386
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,696
I'm Marinette.
I'm so lucky I ran into you!

387
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,618
Mi‐Hao.

388
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,328
Don't worry. I'm Cat Noir,

389
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,496
Paris's superhero!

390
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,499
Paris? What are you doing here?

391
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,419
I'm looking for a French girl
who went missing in Shanghai.

392
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,964
French superheroes
deal with lost tourists?

393
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:10,634
Uh... yes, among other things.
Part of our public service!

394
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,722
Sorry. I haven't seen her.
Good luck finding your citizen.

395
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,228
Oh, I knew I should've studied
Mandarin a long time ago.

396
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,773
What about you?
How come you speak English, Fei?

397
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,609
My father loved that language.
He wanted me to know it.

398
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,696
Besides, his school had lost
all its local customers,

399
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,699
but he thought he could teach
Kung‐Fu to tourists.

400
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,617
But his school went up in smoke,

401
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,120
and, with it,
everything he believed in.

402
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,748
Not everything.
You're still here.

403
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,128
I have become the complete
opposite of what he believed in!

404
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,923
I don't get it. He wanted you
to be a mean and selfish coward?

405
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,425
Why would you say that?

406
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,927
Fei, you've been
helping me for hours now

407
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,804
even though
you don't even know me,

408
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,182
and you were super brave,
protecting me from those

409
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,641
who were chasing me!

410
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,061
You're such an amazing person!

411
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,773
So, if your father
wanted the opposite for you...

412
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,859
I'm not as amazing
as you think.

413
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,362
We're here.

414
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,035
<i>It's Marinette, leave a messag.</i>
<i>Beep!</i>

415
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,332
<i>You've reached the voicemail</i>
<i>of Adrien Agreste...</i>

416
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,796
‐ Gonna be OK! Gonna be OK!
‐ I hope so, Bastille.

417
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,130
I hope so.

418
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,761
Look this way.
I'll go that way.

419
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,147
(Gasps)

420
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:52,069
There! They're here!
My Miracu... uh, my earrings!

421
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,488
Wow! What luck!

422
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,199
Hello.
I really need to get these back.

423
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,118
They're very,
very important to me.

424
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,329
I'm so happy to have found them!
Could you translate?

425
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,499
That won't be necessary.
I speak English.

426
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,211
So...

427
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,923
these earrings
are very precious to you?

428
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,425
Yes! Infinitely precious!

429
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,554
100,000 yuans to get them back.

430
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,890
100,000 yuans? Is that a lot?

431
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,523
That's the law
of supply and demand!

432
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,859
If it's precious to her,
it's precious to me!

433
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:42,244
That's disgusting! Using
people's misfortune to get rich!

434
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,121
You're the one
who robbed the girl.

435
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,748
You're the one who
brought her to me. So, tell me,

436
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,334
which one of us
uses people's misfortune more?

437
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,882
‐ Marinette!
‐ I'll get you out of here.

438
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:58,468
‐ Stop it, Fei, I'll pay.
‐ But that's a huge sum!

439
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,804
I'll call my uncle
and explain everything.

440
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,139
Could I please use your phone?

441
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,935
May I have the number to
the Thousand Delights, please?

442
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,354
I know it.
Your uncle is a great chef.

443
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,357
Yes, and I'm so ashamed
I have to ask him.

444
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,668
‐ Here's the number.
‐ Thank you, sir,

445
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,629
that's very nice of you.

446
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,971
‐ We'll find another way.
‐ But, Fei...

447
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,598
If you don't buy them now,

448
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,808
I can't guarantee
I'll still have them later.

449
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,394
If a customer wants to buy them,
I'll sell them!

450
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,481
‐ Fei, I can't lose them again.
‐ Believe me,

451
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,858
no one will buy them
at that price.

452
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,735
CASH: Fei? What are you doing?

453
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,405
You don't want to know
who went after your father?

454
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,783
Have you forgotten who you are?

455
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,786
Actually, I just remembered
who I really am!

456
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,418
‐ I'm taking you to your uncle.
‐ I can't leave without ‐‐

457
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,879
Hop on the bike, quick.

458
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,757
You stole my earrings?

459
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,550
Didn't you want them back?

460
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,096
Yes! But not like that!
Stealing is wrong!

461
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,140
That seller paid a lot
of money to buy my earrings!

462
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,851
This way,
he'll have lost all his money!

463
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,813
Marinette, I promise
I'll explain everything,

464
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,856
but you've gotta get
on the bike, now!

465
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,697
Hmm?

466
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,741
Where's the red plush toy?

467
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:55,168
She duped me.
That little brat duped me!

468
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,462
Argh! Get them!

469
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,799
What if that poor man's taken on
a debt to buy these earrings?

470
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,469
Marinette, stop arguing and run!

471
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,021
These guys... see? Mad at us!

472
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,357
Believe me, you have no idea
how furious they are!

473
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,827
Tikki!

474
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,626
‐ Tikki!
‐ No, no, no! Stick with me!

475
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:40,005
‐ These guys are dangerous!
‐ What do you mean "these guys"?

476
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:44,176
The other ones
seemed pretty dangerous too!

477
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,143
Fei, please, let me go get help!

478
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,145
The only person
who can help us here is me

479
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,651
and the Kung Fu
my father taught me!

480
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,573
What's happening?

481
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,492
We, the Street Vigilantes,

482
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,869
fight evil,
even when, uh,

483
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,246
it strikes out at, uh,
more evil.

484
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,790
Go home! You'll get hurt!

485
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,249
We don't take orders
from a thief!

486
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,418
‐ A thief?
‐ He doesn't know

487
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,419
what he's talking about!

488
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,841
Run!

489
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:46,363
This city is too big.
I can't do this alone.

490
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,533
Oh!

491
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,371
Milady, a girl we both know,
Marinette Dupain‐Cheng,

492
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,540
is missing in Shanghai.
I'm already there.

493
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,917
If you get this message,
meet me. I need help.

494
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,011
The time has come.

495
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,805
Master, please reconsider!

496
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,181
You'll trigger a magic that is

497
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,850
much too powerful for you!

498
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,601
The Guardian of the Prodigious

499
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,103
is a formidable opponent.

500
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,063
You'll never be able
to defeat him!

501
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,024
Who said I would be
the one challenging him?

502
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,528
‐ What's this place?
‐ This is where I live.

503
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,781
Marinette Dupain‐Cheng?

504
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,993
This is where I have to be...

505
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,828
right now.

506
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,087
Sorry, that's all I have.

507
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,970
Fei, why do we have to be here?

508
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,972
I have to guard
my father's legacy.

509
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,891
But your father...

510
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,810
Disappeared with his school.

511
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,605
Oh, I'm so sorry.

512
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:05,025
They did everything
to make us leave. Everything.

513
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:08,570
Intimidation. Burglary.
They took everything from us.

514
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,363
Even the bracelet
he had entrusted me with.

515
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,200
The jewel I told you about
it's as precious to me

516
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,161
as your earrings are to you,
except that it had a power.

517
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,956
Who are "they" exactly?

518
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,375
Precisely. I don't know.

519
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,712
My search for their identities
brought us together today.

520
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,757
There's something
I've got to tell you... I ‐‐

521
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,384
You really thought you could
get away from me, Fei?

522
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,514
‐ You... You know each other?
‐ (Hysterical laugh)

523
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,725
Of course we know each other!

524
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,229
How do you think I ended up
with your earring, kid?

525
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:46,858
She stole them from you
and then she stole them from me!

526
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:52,489
I was about to tell you,
Marinette, I... I swear!

527
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,492
You saw how desperate I was
to get my earrings back

528
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,536
and you knew I'd be willing
to pay a huge price for them!

529
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,456
I'm sorry! He told me he knew
someone who could tell me

530
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,626
what happened to my father!
But he demanded a huge sum

531
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,128
‐ in exchange for the truth!
‐ Truth isn't free.

532
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,506
No pain, no gain, baby!

533
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,591
You're gonna call your uncle
right now

534
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,551
and ask him
for the money he owes me!

535
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,473
I won't let you do this!
Run, Marinette!

536
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:23,478
All this greed. Even back then,
it worked in my favor!

537
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,315
CASH: A deal's a deal!

538
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,237
Nooroo! Dark wings rise!

539
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,878
I want my money!

540
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,966
And you're gonna give it to me
or you'll never get answers!

541
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,844
I just want you to tell me
the truth, once and for all!

542
00:34:56,136 --> 00:35:00,390
The truth? If that girl
doesn't call her uncle,

543
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,684
you'll meet the same fate
as your father!

544
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,940
Don't you dare
talk about my father!

545
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,152
I may have failed him,
but it's over.

546
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,321
I'll find the answers
all by myself!

547
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,866
You have to stay with me.
I can protect you!

548
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,827
You haven't protected me.
You've just lied to me!

549
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,995
You have to trust me!

550
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,498
‐ I can't.
‐ I shouldn't have stolen.

551
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,042
Please forgive me.

552
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,293
You did what you had to do.

553
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,711
And so must I.

554
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:40,305
King Cash, I am Hawk Moth.
You want to be rich?

555
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,975
Something very valuable
is hidden behind that waterfall.

556
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,977
If you help me
get my hands on it,

557
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,189
I will make you rich
beyond your wildest dream.

558
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,232
A deal's a deal!

559
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,156
The silver blades on your fan
will slice through anything.

560
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,618
The gold ones will turn anything
they touch into a statue.

561
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,289
Time to get rich!

562
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,626
Tikki, Hawk Moth's
here in Shanghai too.

563
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,628
Do you think Fei
is being sincere, Marinette?

564
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,880
I'm not sure yet. But for now...

565
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,550
Tikki, spots on!

566
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,259
Yeah!

567
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,322
<i>Milady, a girl we both know,</i>
<i>Marinette Dupain‐Cheng,</i>

568
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,491
<i>has gone missing in Shanghai.</i>
<i>I'm there.</i>

569
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,119
<i>If you get this message,</i>
<i>meet me. I need your help.</i>

570
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,287
Aw, nice kitty.

571
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,581
(Phone rings)

572
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,543
‐ Miaow, Milady!
‐ I've just arrived in Shanghai.

573
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,837
‐ Have you found her?
‐ Not yet, but with you here,

574
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:57,924
‐ I'm sure we will together!
‐ She's not the only one here.

575
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:02,011
‐ I just saw an akuma!
‐ What? I'll be right there!

576
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,388
Hurry up, Cat Noir!

577
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,187
It's time to prove
that money can open any door.

578
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,025
No one is allowed
into the sacred cave!

579
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,698
Who do you think you're
dealing with, little mosquito?

580
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,539
‐ You're wasting your time!
‐ And time is money!

581
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,499
Aaah!

582
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,306
Grab on!

583
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,951
Where's the fortune
you promised me?

584
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,580
Soon, soon. Have patience.

585
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,461
‐ Who are you?
‐ Ladybug!

586
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,714
I'm Fei. You're one
of the good guys, right?

587
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,299
Yes.

588
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:28,640
Now I can finally see
if this was a good investment.

589
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,059
So you were my mysterious buyer!

590
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,394
I've never made so much money

591
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,523
on a lousy trinket! (Evil laugh)

592
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:49,869
I've been waiting
for this moment for 15 years.

593
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:56,417
‐ That's my bracelet!
‐ Is it special?

594
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,671
I don't know. I was supposed to
protect the cave and bracelet.

595
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,713
And I failed.

596
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,640
Human, prepare to face
the judgment of Mei Shi,

597
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,976
the Lion Protector
of the Prodigious.

598
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,937
‐ The Prodigious?
‐ Do you know what this is?

599
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:19,148
No, but if Hawk Moth wants it,
I must stop him from getting it!

600
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,025
You stay right here!

601
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,201
Hmm.

602
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,121
Put the Prodigious
around your neck, human,

603
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,206
and prepare to face my judgment.

604
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,835
Who told you I had
any intention of facing you?

605
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,170
‐ Huh?
‐ King Cash,

606
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,840
the time has come
to honor our deal.

607
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,301
Turn him into a gold statue.

608
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,262
Oh, no, you won't!
That's not in the rules!

609
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,477
No!

610
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,106
I'm taking over
my father's mission!

611
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,108
Fei, I told you to stay away!

612
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,986
You're the one
I'll be judging then, human.

613
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,582
Hurry, Cat Noir!

614
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,398
THE RENLING:
Greetings to our new Renren!

615
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,108
‐ New what?
‐ Renren!

616
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,861
The person
who wears the Prodigious!

617
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,238
Who are you talking to?

618
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,659
Only the Renren can see us.

619
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,369
Some kind of magic creatures,

620
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,829
but apparently,
only I can see them!

621
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,165
The Prodigious is mine,
King Cash!

622
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,879
We are the Renling,
the spirits of human values.

623
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,465
Each of us can turn you
into a different animal,

624
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,301
if you are worthy
of the virtues it represents.

625
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,807
If you want me, Tang Tang,
the Renling of Patience,

626
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,394
to turn you into a Mantis,
you must show patience.

627
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,854
I don't have
any patience right now!

628
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,399
I am Xiong Xiong,
Renling of Calm!

629
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,193
‐ Calm? Is this a joke?
‐ Calm as a bear.

630
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,862
Big and strong like a bear.

631
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,161
Xiong!

632
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:49,298
‐ All right!
‐ Thanks... Uh...

633
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,634
Lady Bear, apparently. For now!

634
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:53,845
Lucky charm!

635
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,810
What are you supposed
to do with that?

636
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,062
I don't know yet.

637
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,447
Tang!

638
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,618
OK, I'm starting
to get the hang of it!

639
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,786
Xiong!

640
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,332
She!

641
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,922
We've gotta destroy his fan
in order to de‐akumatize him!

642
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:30,965
Got it! Long!

643
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,931
‐ What's wrong?
‐ I should be able

644
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,433
to turn into a dragon

645
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,393
and gain control
of natural elements.

646
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:46,314
I'd love to electrify his armor
but I can't transform!

647
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,525
The power of the dragon is
the most powerful of them all.

648
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:53,362
Your intentions must be noble
and just if you aim to use it.

649
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,364
Of course
my intentions are just!

650
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,950
I want revenge on the guy
who destroyed my life!

651
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,162
Revenge is the opposite
of the values of the Dragon.

652
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,664
Your judgment
and intentions are clouded.

653
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,958
Revenge isn't
the same thing as justice!

654
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,669
Then I'll find another way
to defeat him! Hou!

655
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,564
‐ No!
‐ Who would have thought?

656
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,650
The Prodigious
and your Miraculous,

657
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,485
both in one day.

658
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,833
Cataclysm!

659
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,381
No!

660
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,384
Where's my money?

661
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:02,223
It's just you against us three
Hawk Moth! It's over.

662
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,268
You mean you're over.

663
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,570
Yan Luo Shi, I am Hawk Moth.

664
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,614
Surely, you're not going to let
a girl who mistakes revenge

665
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,951
for justice become
the holder of your Prodigious?

666
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:24,328
Like Yama,
the King of the Infernal,

667
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,622
I will cause
carnage and destruction

668
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,417
until she returns
the jewel to me.

669
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,804
We've gotta break the ball,
the akuma's inside!

670
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,894
Fear, humans!

671
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,357
Adrien. No, not the Bund!

672
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,610
Yan Luo Shi, stop,
or I'll remove your pow ‐‐

673
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:59,822
I take orders from no one!

674
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:05,119
OK...
Is this bad news or good news?

675
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,169
Let's recharge
and meet up to think of a plan.

676
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,640
Aaah!

677
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,111
Aaah!

678
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,112
Ying!

679
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:45,826
Hou!

680
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,043
Ma!

681
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,014
It's all my fault.

682
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,474
Give me back the Prodigious!

683
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,310
You are not worthy of it!

684
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,688
‐ He's right.
‐ No!

685
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,731
You alone can defeat him.

686
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,651
Only the power of the dragon
can reach the akumatized object

687
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,778
‐ inside of him.
‐ I wish I could use

688
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,154
the power of the dragon,

689
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,823
but I am not worthy.

690
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,409
‐ You can do this.
‐ No.

691
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,077
I can't do anything right.

692
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,163
‐ No, wait!
‐ Ying!

693
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:39,130
We don't have a choice.
I'll try to use my power on him!

694
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,798
Cat Noir, no!

695
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:43,968
Cataclysm!

696
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:47,680
No!

697
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,155
(Sobbing)

698
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,288
Fei...

699
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:17,710
Marinette?

700
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,963
I'm sorry I couldn't
forgive you earlier.

701
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,632
No, I don't deserve
your forgiveness.

702
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,426
I lied to you, I stole from you,

703
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,429
and everything that's happening
is because of me.

704
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:31,599
My father would be sad to see
how miserably I have failed.

705
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,269
I know that you were just trying
to do the right thing.

706
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,607
Yes. But I failed
to follow my father's values.

707
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,776
He would never have devoted
all his energy

708
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,402
to seeking revenge.

709
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,738
He'd have kept on
doing good around him.

710
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,615
Then you know
what you have to do.

711
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,457
My Prodigious!

712
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:57,958
Long!

713
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,965
Aaah!

714
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:22,191
Mei Shi!
Stop destroying everything!

715
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,666
Tikki, spots on!

716
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,503
Lucky charm!

717
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,099
Perfect!

718
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:03,023
Calm down, Mei Shi!
I don't want to hurt you.

719
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,818
I'm not here to destroy you
or to get revenge.

720
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:09,488
I'm here to save you and to
bring you back to your senses!

721
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,825
I'm not Mei Shi any more!
I'm Yan Luo Shi!

722
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,500
I did a little shopping!

723
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,171
Red with black spots? Strange
pattern for a Chinese vase!

724
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,630
This isn't a Chinese vase,

725
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,008
it's the solution
to our problem!

726
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,178
Kinda like a giant pill!
To be swallowed

727
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,804
with a lot of water,

728
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,181
if you get my drift.

729
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,057
Absolutely!

730
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,105
Yan Luo Shi!

731
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,858
You're finally giving me back
what's mine?

732
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,568
Yes. But first,

733
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,236
you should have a big drink
of water

734
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,362
to cool down.

735
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,381
(Vomits)

736
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:11,967
VoilÃ !

737
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,262
No more evil‐doing for you,
little akuma!

738
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,477
Time to de‐evilize!

739
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:25,731
Gotcha!

740
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,068
Bye‐bye, little butterfly!

741
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:39,662
What happened? You were able to
access the power of the dragon?

742
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:41,747
I had some help.

743
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:43,541
BOTH: Pound it!

744
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,459
Huh?

745
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,296
I am the one
who did all of that?

746
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,675
What a terrible
violation of humanity.

747
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,261
Don't worry.
We'll fix everything for you.

748
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,471
Miraculous Ladybug!

749
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:04,728
Huh?

750
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,107
Kitty!

751
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,736
You focused on the greater good
and let go of your revenge.

752
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:16,323
You now possess all
the required values of humanity.

753
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,326
The Prodigious is in good hands
with you, Renren.

754
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,626
Wow!

755
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:34,466
Come on,
let's wipe the slate clean!

756
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,010
How much do you want?

757
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,847
Hold on, hold on!
We can talk this out, right?

758
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,182
You destroyed
my father's school,

759
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,852
made me an orphan
and forced me to steal for you.

760
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,063
You caused me to betray
all the ancestral values

761
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,733
that my father had taught me.
From the beginning,

762
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,444
you have always been
the source of my misfortune!

763
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,404
And for what? Money!

764
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,615
There are no words
to describe what you are.

765
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,491
But today, I will...

766
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,913
let justice take its course.

767
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:09,001
‐ Well done, Fei!
‐ Here's to a true, wise Renren!

768
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:24,350
About time! I was wondering when
you'd finally put it back on!

769
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,684
ALL: Mei Shi?

770
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,810
You thought that was

771
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,187
the end of my mission?

772
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,397
It was only the beginning!

773
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,026
Ladybug, Cat Noir,
thank you for your help.

774
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,820
Now we only need
to find Marinette!

775
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,616
Yes, that's right!
We've gotta... find Marinette!

776
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:43,994
Don't worry! I brought her
to safety during the battle.

777
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:44,703
Ying!

778
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,832
How about a little trip
to the Shanghai courthouse?

779
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,755
So, we're going home?

780
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,467
Sure. Why not?
I mean, only if you insist.

781
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,763
Say, which direction
would be the shortest way

782
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:06,183
to go around the world? Across
the Arctic, or the Antarctic?

783
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,310
Oh! What a fascinating question!

784
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,562
It so happens
I've always wondered myself,

785
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,898
but never had the chance
to find out!

786
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,234
You know what?
We should do it right now!

787
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,277
And next time we see each other,
in Paris,

788
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,906
‐ we can check our stop watches!
‐ That's an excellent idea!

789
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,117
‐ I'll go this way!
‐ Then I'll go that way!

790
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,077
‐ See you soon!
‐ Woohoo!

791
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:28,956
Phew!

792
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,754
You know, on your birthday,
it's a tradition

793
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:39,508
that you try to slurp a long
noodle without breaking it,

794
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,510
as it represents longevity!

795
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,137
(Laughter)

796
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:48,726
In China, your 60th birthday is
often the first you celebrate.

797
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:51,854
What? You've never celebrated
your birthday before?

798
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:55,649
Never. And I'm very happy to do
it for the first time with you

799
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:59,903
‐ and your boyfriend Adrien.
‐ BOTH: Uh, we're just friends!

800
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,240
Anyway...
Come on, open your gift.

801
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,700
(Door bell rings)

802
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,580
Sorry,
we didn't mean to scare you.

803
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,373
We just wanted
to give this back.

804
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,169
Ah! My kwam...
My homemade necklace!

805
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,463
Thank you. Thank you!

806
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,339
Let your friends in!

807
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:21,967
An accordion?

808
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,636
It's a nod to Sabine,
Marinette's mom.

809
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,472
I raised her.
I've always told her

810
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:29,141
how I dreamed
of playing the accordion.

811
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,685
But I never took the time.

812
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,313
I know how to play if you want!

813
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,499
Congratulations, Marinette!

814
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:58,086
It seems like you have found
the magic ingredient after all.

815
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,589
I think if someone's
the magic ingredient,

816
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:02,841
it's definitely
sister Marinette!

817
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:07,012
‐ Is it OK if I call you sister?
‐ It's more than OK, sister Fei.

818
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,347
How do you say it in Mandarin?

819
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,476
(Laughter)

820
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,810
Oh, no! What did I say?

821
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,980
It's too embarrassing
to translate, Marinette!

822
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:20,817
If you wanted, back in Paris,
I could teach you some Mandarin.

823
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,780
Badly. I mean, gladly!
Amazesome! Argh! Mmm...

824
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,783
Sometimes even her English
sounds weird, right?

825
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,245
MARINETTE: <i>Coming to China,</i>
<i>I've found so much more</i>

826
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,371
<i>than I'd ever hoped for.</i>

827
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:37,084
<i>An amazing uncle,</i>
<i>a new friend...</i>

828
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,919
<i>and a new Mandarin teacher.</i>

829
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,587
Ah!
