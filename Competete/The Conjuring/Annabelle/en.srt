just thinking about it.

3
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,969
When you hear it, you're
gonna think we're insane.

4
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,560
It started out small...

5
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,967
like a hand or a leg
was in a different position.

6
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,191
And then its head was looking
up instead of down...

7
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:14,070
and then one day, it
was in a completely different room.

8
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,281
It was moving around by itself.

9
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,780
Camilla got in touch with a medium.
We learned from her...

10
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,067
that the doll was possessed
by a girl named Annabelle Higgins.

11
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,838
She had lost her parents and had
taken a liking to my doll.

12
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:29,774
All she wanted
was to be friends.

13
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,767
When we heard this, we felt
really sorry for her. I mean,

14
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,387
we're nurses, we help people.

15
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,386
But then things got worse.

end up with it?

00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,729

from my mom, for my birthday.

18
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,983
I don't know where she got it...

19
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,403

And our sacrifices touch
God's heart and move his hand.

23
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,908

"This is my commandment."

Oh.

John. But he cheats.

35

I had to do something, right?

36
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,019
Yeah, right.

- We appreciate the lift, Pete.
- PETE: Sure thing.

You just make sure to take care
of this wife and baby of yours.

50

Did we ask about names yet?

- Sharon.
- What? It's not prying.

52
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,223
- I don't know her.
- It's just conversation.

53
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,768
- We're still working on them anyway.
- But we're pretty sure "John" if it's a boy.

54
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,354
- And we're thinking "Phyllis" if it's a girl.
- Heh. We were?

55
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,658
- Yeah. You said you liked it.
- Heh. I never said that.

56
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,985

Indeed they are.

67
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,799
And then they learn to talk.

- Oh, you.

00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,568
Bye.

on Phyllis?

72
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,278

so much in front of them.

- I just think it isn't right.
- Why not?

74
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,701
Well, they only lost
their daughter two years ago.

75
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,737
They didn't lose
their daughter, Mia.

76
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,905
She ran away and joined
up with the hippies.

77
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,117
By now she's probably got three husbands
and calls herself "Star."

78
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:47,469
Well, even "Star" is a better
name than Phyllis.

79
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,376
Oh, you didn't lock it?

80
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,128
No. Why would I?

81
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,932
You have to start locking it, John.
I mean, it's a different world now.

MAN: (ON TV)
They call themselves "The Family."

83
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,848
But police officials have
labeled them a dangerous cult.

00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,476
Residing on the grounds
of Spahn Ranch...

85
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,604
once used as the backdrop
for many well-known Westerns...

86
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,078
the Family is estimated to have
close to 30 members...

87
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,462
many of them with histories of heavy
drug use and criminal behavior.

88
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,281
Currently, several Family
members are in custody...

89
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,202
awaiting charges for the brutal
Tate and LaBianca murders...

90
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,121
which held Los Angeles
in the grip of fear...

91
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,041
before police investigators
were led to the suspects...

92
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,209
Hey, honey?

93
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:36,296
Do you think you could shut off the TV?
It's making it a little hard to concentrate.

94
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,466
MAN: (ON TV) Their leader, Charles
Manson, was sometimes referred to...

95
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,803
as both "God" and "Satan"
by his devoted followers...

96
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:47,700
and had predicted an Armageddon-like
event he called Helter Skelter.

97
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,701
Thank you.

98
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,193
Hey. You know what, you shouldn't
even be watching that stuff. All right?

99
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,612
It could upset the baby.
There's new research out there...

100
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,114
- Oh, boy, more new research?
- It's true.

101
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,200
They are learning
that babies in utero...

102
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,703
experience more of the outside world
than they ever thought possible.

103
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,373
They recognize voices
and noises, songs.

104
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,669
You know, I bet the men that did
that research spent millions of dollars...

105
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,722
when they could have just
asked the mother for free.

106
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,592
How's it going in here?

107
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,927
Um...

108
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,444
Well...

109
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,065
I am trying my hardest to enjoy it.

110
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,425
Everyone keeps
telling me that...

111
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:34,604
once you're in the residency
it gets a million times worse.

112
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,440
I haven't even mentioned the fact
that I'm about to be a new father.

113
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,162
Why not?

114
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,861
I don't know.

115
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:45,031
Sometimes you just don't wanna
hear how difficult it's gonna be.

116
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,708
"Difficult"?

117
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,911
No, maybe difficult's not
the right word.

118
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,589
Uh, challenging?

119
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:01,599
Are you talking about the residency,
or me and the baby?

120
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,884
I don't know.

121
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,802
All of it, I guess.

122
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,982
I mean, it's not like this is an ideal
situation for what I'm about to go through.

123
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,282
Like what we're
about to go through.

124
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,723
I didn't mean for that to sound
like it did. I'm sorry.

125
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:41,264
It's not like difficult or challenging
are bad things, anyway.

126
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:47,218
Look, I know that I've been a little caught
up in my own world lately.

127
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,180
- Some people might call it self-centered.
- "Some people"?

128
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,527
Most people?

129
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,283
Everyone?

130
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,454
Can we just go back and redo
the last two minutes, please?

131
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,496
Please?

132
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,837
It's fine.

133
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,669
I know you're stressed.

134
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,666
I'm just a little, uh,
oversensitive lately.

135
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,092
Yeah.

136
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,338
- Do you want me to tell you why?
- Yes, doctor.

137
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,881
- Okay, well, good. So...
- Heh.

138
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,718
In my, um, almost
expert opinion...

139
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,804
you are a little sensitive...

140
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,527
because you are a lot pregnant.

141
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,395
Honey, I'm sorry, Mia. I am.

142
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,940
Yes. I'm stressed
about finishing med school...

143
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,359
and I'm freaking
out about matching...

144
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,332
but I've never been happier.

145

Ever.

146
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,175
Okay?
And that's because of you.

147
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,472
And it.

148
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,387
Oh, you know what?

149
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,393
There's something
I wanna give you.

150
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,592
Oh, no. The last time you said
that I ended up pregnant.

151

All right. Hold on a second. I was waiting
on this until the baby, but...

155

Guilty, yes. Because
of what I said.

00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,424
Okay. Open your eyes.

you know how long I've been looking?

as reminiscent of a horrific
occult ritual...

221
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,947
a man and his wife were
brutally stabbed to death...

222
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:55,076
by their estranged daughter, Annabelle
Higgins, and her unidentified boyfriend.

223

I would want to know about it.

here to get away from what happened.

up our furniture. We packed up the good memories.

find that their act wasn't devotional.

672
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:17,629
That they were actually trying
to conjure something up.

691
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:41,549
They called themselves "The
Disciples of the Ram."

692
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,728
Hello again.

693
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,640
Is there anything
I can help you with?

694
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,945
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just browsing, really.

695
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,239
I just learned something.

696
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,158
You're a terrible liar.

697
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,837
Now, what is it
you're looking for?

698
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,450
- Maybe I'll come back.
- Mia.

699
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,035

700
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:28,009

little that surprises me anymore.

701
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,424
And if it does, I'm
too tired to show it.

702
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,952
Now, you gonna tell me?
Or we just...

703
01:03:34,053 --> 01:03:37,623
I think my family's being
haunted by a ghost.

704
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:41,852

705
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:51,061
I know it sounds crazy, the ghost
of this girl haunting us, but I just...

706
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:54,064
No crazier than the Red
Sea parting.

707
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,274
To nonbelievers, it's all crazy.

708
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,951
So you believe in this stuff?

709
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:03,615
Let's just say that I've had
one or two experiences in my life...

710
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:07,590
that have helped me
to keep an open mind.

711
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:20,106
I don't particularly think what you're
experiencing is the ghost of that girl.

712
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,092
Why not?

713
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,511
Well, ghosts haunt
specific places.

714
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,514
Usually where something
terrible has happened.

715
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,566
Like your old house.

716
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:33,186
But we moved
and it's still happening.

717
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,563
Which is why I don't
think it's a ghost.

718
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,649
But now, that cult?

719
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:41,328
You said that they were
trying to summon something.

720
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,905
From what I've read
in the past...

721
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:47,334
these cults, they don't
summon ghosts.

722
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,095
They summon inhuman spirits.

existed in the flesh.

725

What do they want?

726
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,765
A soul.

727
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:05,276
And they won't stop
until they get one.

728
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,567
What do I do?

729
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:13,451
Hopefully, the answer
is in one of these books.

730
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,844
My daughter, Ruby.

731
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,890

she was about your age.

732
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,469
I'm sorry.

733
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:45,734

nothing else to live for, so...

for it all to end...

wasn't my time.

another purpose for me.

- The same.

1045
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:39,496
- Bye, Father.
- Goodbye, Mia.

1046
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:41,764
Oh, I almost forgot.

1047
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:46,140
MIA: Oh. It's beautiful.
Thank you, Father.

1048
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:49,965
The loveliest masterpiece
of the heart of God...

1049
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:52,188
is the love of a mother.

1050
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:56,900
Thank you.

1051
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,919
WOMAN #1: Anything
I can help you with?

1052
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:32,474
WOMAN #2: Oh, I'm just trying to find
something for my daughter. Thanks.

1053
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:34,342
She's a nurse.

1054
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,815
Always helping people.

1055
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:40,724
We looked everywhere
for one of these.

1056
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:43,026
Never did find one.

1057
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:45,437
WOMAN #1: It's a collector's item,
supposedly.

1058
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:48,411
That's why we price it
a little higher than the rest.

1059
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,998
- You want me to ring it up?
- WOMAN #2: Yes, please.
