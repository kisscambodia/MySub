00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
[switch clicks]

2
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,871
[Ed] It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

3
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,396
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.

4
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,029
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,152
[nurse 1] What's an inhuman spirit?

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,752
[Ed] It's something that's
never walked the earth in human form.

7
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,635
It's something demonic.

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,713
[nurse 2] So, the doll
was never possessed?

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,040
[Lorraine] No, it was used as a conduit.

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,874
It was moved around
to give the impression of possession.

11
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,635
Demonic spirits don't possess things.

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,314
They possess people.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,190
It wanted to get inside of you.

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,000
And given this unusual feature,

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,830
the doll will need to be
properly cared for.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,434
- Cared for?
- [Ed] Mmm-hmm.

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,079
It should be destroyed.

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,519
[Ed sighs]

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,671
That would only make things worse.

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,876
We think it best the doll come with us.

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,033
We'll keep it somewhere safe.

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,592
That sounds like a great idea.

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,480
She's all yours.

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,712

<i>Love could be</i>

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,432
How much longer, do you think?

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,000
Eh, about an hour.

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,016
Why don't you put your head back?
Get some rest.

32
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,953
No, you get lost coming home
from the supermarket.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,158
[chuckling] If I do that,
we might end up in California.

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,951
Well, so you wake up
to the sound of the Pacific.

35
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,152
- Nothing wrong with that.
- [both chuckle]

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,799
I'll pick up Judy on the way.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,390
Ah, that actually sounds so nice, Ed.

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,119
We should plan on it.

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
[Ed] Uh-oh.

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,480
What's this?

41
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,990
[turns off music]

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,592
You folks need to turn around.
Pretty bad accident up ahead.

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,910
Uh, anything we can do?

44
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,994
You a doctor or something?

45
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,880
Or something.

46
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,396
He just meant if you need
an extra set of hands.

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
Yeah.

48
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,433
We got it covered. Thanks.

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Nice doll.

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,594
That's what you think.

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,395
All right, you're gonna head
three miles back to the last exit.

52
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,473
You'll hop on 26,
that'll loop you around.

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,593
- Twenty-six. Got it.
- Thank you, Officer.

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,350
[car engine starts]

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,752

[pop rock playing on car stereo]

58
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,073
I think we missed our turn.

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,675
We didn't miss it.
Bridgewater's just up ahead.

60
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,992
Bridgewater? Old Ridge Road.
Where did you get Bridgewater from?

61
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,271
You know what?
I think we missed our turn.

62
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,836
- I'll keep my eye out for the Pacific.
- [chuckling]

64

- Ed?
- Hang on, hang on.

[thunder rumbling]

00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,749
- [car halts]
- Come on.

68
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
What just happened?

69
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,595
[sighs] I'll pop the hood and find out.

70
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,640
Well, be careful.

71
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,710
There we go.

[whispering] I like your doll.

[Lorraine gasps softly]

76
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,077
I feel cold.

[Lorraine breathing shakily]

78
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,792
[Lorraine] You were just in an accident.

79
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,595
[young woman] I was?

80
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,875
- [car horn honks]
- [gasps]

81
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,710
Sorry. Wires crossed.

82
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,595
That should do it.

83
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,079
Honey, you okay?

[Ed] I'm okay.

91
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,016
[truck driver] I'm so sorry!

92
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,176
All of a sudden it was like
somebody took over my truck.

93
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,271
I had no control. Are you okay?

94
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,999
- I'm fine.
- [both panting]

95
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,040
[Lorraine] It's the doll, Ed.

96
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,951
It's a beacon for other spirits.

97
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,792

Father, sooner the better. Yeah?

106

Yeah.

[Father Gordon clears throat]

108
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,552
Be not wise in thine own eyes.

109
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,031
Fear the Lord and depart from evil.

[hissing softly]

111
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,760
The curse of the Lord is in the house
of the wicked.

112
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,439
But he blesseth
the habitation of the just.

113

[holy water sprinkling]

114
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,400
Surely, he scorneth the scorners,

115
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,310
but he giveth grace unto the lowly.

116
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,839
The wise shall inherit the glory,

117
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,200
but shame shall be
the promotion of fools.

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,998
We need another barrier of protection.

123
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,990
A holy one.

124
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,470
I agree.

125
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,910
The blessing will only do so much.

126
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,675
That chapel glass we got from
Trinity Church before it was torn down,

127
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,910
where is that?

128
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,440
[softly] Let us forgive those
who trespass against us

129
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,957
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

130
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Amen.

- Did it work?

133
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,911
Hmm. The evil is contained.

I just saw Mary Ellen pull up.
Go and get your things.

But first put your cereal in the...

Well?

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,120
You're my hero.

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,071
[Mary Ellen] Perfect.

157
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,896
[Ed] And we'll be back early
tomorrow morning.

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,515
Well, and take your time, we'll be fine.
Right, Judy?

Yeah.

- Absolutely.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,790
I'm fine.

173
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,560
Well, it's just a couple more hours
until the weekend.

174
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,736
I'm gonna run to the market for supplies
during my free period.

175
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,920
I'll pick you up after, okay?

176

[Mr. Palmeri] Mrs. Faley,
it's right over here. Let me show you.

183
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,016
How could you not tell me
what the Warrens did for a living?

184
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,474
Shouldn't you be in math class?

185
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,000
[Daniela] Mary Ellen!

186
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,232
I babysat the Smiths for over two years
and never told you what they did.

187
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,629
Oh, what do they do?

188
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,996
They're podiatrists.

189
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,880
- So not the same.
- [chuckles]

190
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,792
Well, obviously, I'm coming over later.

191
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,519
We do have that social studies project

192
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,034
- that we need to work on.
- Uh...

193
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,520
We don't have any project.

194
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,955
Okay, but how would they know?

195
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,630
She's psychic.

196
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,513
Then, they're heroes.

197
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,559
I think they're concerned parents

198
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,110
who wouldn't want negative influences
around their child.

199
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,591
What negative influence?
'Cause I sometimes stay out past curfew?

200
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,160
Among other things.

201
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,480
So, what's it like inside the house?

202
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,836
Is it all creepy music and cobwebs?

203
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,277
No. No, it's boring suburbia.
The inside of your locker is scarier.

204
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,317
Wait. Whose party,
and why wasn't I invited?

205
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,354
Judy's birthday is coming up,
so we're gonna celebrate early.

206
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,711
You really are the best babysitter,
you know that?

207
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,959
Compliments will get you nowhere.

208
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,715
What about threats?

209
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,634
Did you happen to notice
who's working checkout?

210
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,638
- [Bob] Have a good one.
- [woman] Will do.

211
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,296
- Thank you so much.
- [Bob] See you soon.

212
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
You wouldn't.

213
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,880
You know what they call him, right?

214
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
What?

215
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,078
[Daniela sighs]

216
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,114
Bob's-Got-Balls.

217
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,350
How you doing?

218
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Hi, Daniela.

219
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,869
[inhales]

220
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
[exhales]

221
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,950
[chuckles] Uh...

222
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,678
Hi, Mary Ellen.
[stammers] Is this everything?

223
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,718
- I think so.
- Oh, cool.

224
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,759
You live near the Warrens,
don't you, Bob?

225
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,496
- [Bob] Uh...
- Yeah, Mary Ellen's babysitting

226
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,749
for them tonight.

227
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,597
Yeah.
Yeah, I live right across the street.

228
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,111
Do you ever see
anything scary over there?

229
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,800
Like a ghost, maybe?

230
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,230
Bob...

231
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,677
Mrs. Faley went ahead and dropped
a can of tomato sauce in aisle five

232
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,480
and it looks like a crime scene,
so get the mop.

233
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,350
- Ladies. Did you find everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

234
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,477
Bob here is not giving you
any trouble, is he?

235
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
- [chuckles] No.
- No.

236
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,816
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks, Dad.
- All right.

237
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,399
I'll do it right after.

238
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,835
So, what'd you see?

239
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,792
At the Warrens'?

240
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,720
- Uh, nothing. Nothing.
- [cash register dings]

241
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,116
Your total is $3.50, so...

242
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Oh.

243
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,112
But you knew what the Warrens did?

244
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,756
There were rumors, I guess, but...

245
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,513
Rumors. Interesting.

246
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,354
Did you know there's a rumor
going around about you, Bob?

247
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,671
Wait, really?
[stammers] What is it about?

248
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,200
Uh, it's about a girl who has a...

249
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,232
[whispers] Fine. You can come. Stop.

250
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,798
- [Bob] Oh. Sorry.
- [Mary Ellen] Sorry.

251
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,236
- That's totally my fault.
- It's okay.

252
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,312
- [cash register dings]
- Um... So, what...

253
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,596
Bye, Bob. Thanks.

254
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
Bye.

255
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,631
Uh, she forgot her eggs, so...

256
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,595
Here.

257
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,154
She likes you.

258
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,996
[chuckles]

259
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,792
There's been an accident.

260
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,830
[school bell rings]

261
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,560
[students chattering]

262
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,355
Don't touch her.

263
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,595
You'll get obsessed.

264
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,656
- It's "possessed."
- [Anthony] That's what I said.

265
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,831
Anyways, if you know so much,

266
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,674
why don't you tell us
if you can catch cooties from a ghost?

267
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,356
You can't.

268
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,000
Well, then how'd you get 'em?

269
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,776
- [kids laugh]
- [Mary Ellen] Anthony Rios!

270
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,359
Don't make me get your sister.

271
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Please don't.

272
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,277
Then go. All of you. Come on.

273
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,280
[boy] Come on. Let's go!

274
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,356
I'm sorry I can't come
to your birthday party, Judy.

275
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,195
You can't either?

276
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,593
My parents said I'm not really prepared
to process death yet.

277
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,034
It's a birthday party.

278
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,236
[girl] I'm sorry.

279
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
[Mary Ellen] Hey, how long
has that been happening?

280
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,680
[Judy] Since everyone heard
about the article this week.

281
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,920
Please don't tell my parents.

282
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,640
I won't. I won't as long as you do.

283
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,712
- I don't want them to worry.
- They're parents.

284
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,360
They're worried about everything
whether they need to be or not.

285
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,720
Are you sure the bullying is
the only thing that's bothering you?

286
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,995
That isn't bothering me.

287
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,560
[Mary Ellen] You know what I mean.

288
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,755
And remember our deal. No secrets.

289
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,516
[Judy] I know.

290
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,275
I don't have any.

291
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,473
What did you get at the store?

292
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,389
A surprise.

293
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,320
- You said no secrets.
- A surprise isn't a secret.

294
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,551
- What is it then?
- It's a surprise. [chuckles]

295
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,790
[Judy giggles]

296
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,992
[pop rock music playing
on record player]

297
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,870
- [indistinct chatter, laughter]
- [knocking on door]

298
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,639
[blender whirring]

299
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,393
[Mary Ellen] You're gonna make a mess.

300
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,720
Hey! Save some for the cake.

301
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,109
No.

302
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,920
[knocking continues]

303
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,276
I think there's someone at the door.

304
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,720
[bell jingles]

305
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,436
I was knocking on the door
for, like, 10 minutes.

306
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,076
[sighs] How did you even get in?

307
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,835
Back door. Is this a spirit bell?

308
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,056
- [bell jingles]
- What's a spirit bell?

309
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,515
It tells you if you're in the presence
of any spirits.

310
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,994
- So, it is one.
- [Judy] No.

311
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,000
It's just a bell. My mom collects them.

312
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,833
- [turns off music]
- Oh.

313
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,115
Who are you?

314
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,193
She's Daniela,
and she leaves after cake.

315
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,629
Oh, good!

316
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,950
I love cake.

317
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,640
So, Judy.

318
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,394
Don't your parents keep
any creepy stuff around?

319
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
[Judy] No.

320
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,990
They keep it all locked away in a room.

321
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,438
Well, can we at least go in and look?

322
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,795
[Mary Ellen] No!

323
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,710
It's not really good for anyone
to go in there.

324
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
How come?

325
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,960
Just isn't.

326
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Wait.

327
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,109
Here.

328
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Birthday present.

329
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,350
What is it?

330
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,715
[Daniela] Look inside.

331
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,000
Mmm? [chuckles]

332
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,839
[pop rock music playing]

333
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,416
[Mary Ellen] How did you
even afford those?

334
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,616
[Daniela] They're my old ones.

335
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,416
But I only ever used them once
'cause I broke my arm

336
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,033
the first time I put them on.

337
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,440
- [thudding]
- You're kidding.

338
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,751
- [rattling]
- She looks way more coordinated.

339
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,879
[sighs] They're gonna ruin the floors.

340
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,759
Can we go around the block, then?

341
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,800
- I don't think...
- [Daniela] Good idea.

342
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,073
You guys go. I'll watch the cake
and make sure it doesn't burn.

343
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,155
Fine. But don't snoop. Don't touch.

344
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,879
Don't do anything. Please?

345
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,197
Stay in the kitchen. Promise me.

346
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,035
I promise.

347
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,831
[pop rock music continues]

348
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,913
[door rattles]

349
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,275
[sighs]

350
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
[scoffs]

351
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Fuck it.

352
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,519
I am calling out to the spirits
on the other side.

353
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,796
Please unlock this door and let me in.

354
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,156
[door rattles]

355
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,269
[sighs]

356
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,555
Shit.

357
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,110
[sighs]

358
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,150
[sighs]

359
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,840
[creaking]

360
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,630
[door creaking]

361
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,356
[sighs]

362
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,434
Please don't judge me.

363
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,836
[scoffs]

364
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,430
Amen.

365
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,759
[door creaking]

366
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,869
Whoa.

367
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,950
[gasping softly]

368
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Whoa.

369
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
[chuckles softly]

370
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,751
What'd you do to get in there?

371
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,236
[tapping]

372
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
[chuckles softly]

373
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,393
[clicking]

374
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,034
[gasps softly]

375
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,277
[plays notes to
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"]

376
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,277
[breathing heavily]

377
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,750
If there is a presence here
in this room...

378
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,639
please give me a sign.

379
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,915
Any sign at all.

380
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,710
Dad?

381
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,110
[scoffs]

382
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
This is stupid.

383
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
[sniffs]

384
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,390
[thud]

385
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,795
[scoffs softly]

386
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,994
[breathes shakily]

387
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,312
[alarm beeping]

388
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Shit.

389
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,039
[muffled beeping]

390
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,116
[thuds]

391
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,152
- [beeping continues]
- [Daniela coughs]

392
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,795
[door closes]

393
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,912
You burnt the cake? Daniela.

394
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,480
[sighs] Only the top.

395
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,472
Just put frosting on it.

396
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,876
She'll never know.

397
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,520
How'd it go with the skates?

398
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,056
She loved them
until she fell on the way back

399
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,080
and skinned her knee.

400
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,960
Better than breaking her arm.

401
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Where is she anyway?

402
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,078
She's out feeding the chickens.

403
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,199
They have chickens?

404
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,634
[chickens clucking]

405
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,474
[Daniela] Hey. How's your knee?

406
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,354
Oh. [groans]

407
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,000
Looks like your jeans
will at least need some stitches.

408
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,400
It's okay.

409
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,835
Accidents happen.

410
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,800
So, are you scared yet?

411
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,314
Scared? What? No.

412
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,433
Who says they're scared?

413
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,159
Kids in my class.

414
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,399
Anthony Rios started it.

415
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
I hate him.

416
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,235
Wait. Tony Rios started it?

417
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,559
Do you know him?

418
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,197
Yeah, he's my brother.

419
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,959
Anthony Rios is your brother?

420
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,271
Yeah, I know. Don't hold it against me.

421
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,272
I don't like him either.

422
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,678
You know, he still wets the bed.

423
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,079
You didn't hear it from me.

424
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,879
Or maybe you did, I don't care.

425
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,000
Still, just...

426
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,799
go a little easy on him.

427
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,796
It's been a tough year.

428
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,640
You lost somebody, didn't you?

429
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,199
My dad. Uh...

430
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,632
Did Mary Ellen tell you?

431
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,156
No.

432
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,275
I just knew.

433
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,720
- Um, for delivery.
- [music playing on record player]

434
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,757
Could I do one large, please?

435
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,911
Um, it's gonna be 3506 Wayman Street.

436
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,873
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

437
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,600
[doorbell rings]

438
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,229
Coming.

439
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,991
[doorbell ringing repeatedly]

440
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,719
[quietly] Hold your horses.

441
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,554
[pounding on door]

442
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,435
Who is it?

443
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,394
[doorbell rings]

444
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,640
Hello?

445
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,640
Daniela?

446
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,719
[girl] Is Annabelle there?

447
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,670
Who?

448
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,316
[girl] Can Annabelle come out to play?

449
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,273
I think you have the wrong house.
There's no Annabelle here.

450
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,234
Yes, she is.

451
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,631
She's right behind you.

452
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,673
- [girl giggling]
- [footsteps run off]

453
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,760
People are just...
They're really weird about death.

454
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,591
That's probably why the kids
pick on you at school.

455
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,114
It scares them.

456
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,880
They treat it like it's some disease
they don't wanna get

457
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,792
even though everyone already has it.

458
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,200
But here's the thing.

459
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,714
I used to think it was fatal and whammo.
It's, like, out.

460
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,712
Like turning off a TV.

461
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,440
Then I learned about your parents

462
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,314
and their whole exploration
into the afterlife and stuff...

463
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,074
and they gave me hope.

464
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,713
That maybe life goes on somehow.

465
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
Maybe...

466
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,071
my darling dad
is still out there somewhere.

467
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,480
"Darling dad"?

468
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,199
It was a thing.

469
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,393
He was darling dad,
and I was darling Daniela...

470
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,590
Stupid. [chuckles]

471
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,873
He's still out there, you know.

472
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,349
You think so?

473
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,752
My parents would say he is, too.

474
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,840
[Mary Ellen] Where are you going?

475
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,480
Be right back.

476
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,795
[voice breaking] Dad?

477
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,315
Daniela?

478
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,240
Daniela!

479
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,514
- Where did she go?
- [footsteps thudding]

480
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,056
[Mary Ellen] What are you doing?

481
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,231
Daniela, you're not supposed
to go down there!

482
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,835
- What are you doing?
- I thought I saw something.

483
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,914
What did you see?

484
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,639
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

485
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,634
[wood creaking]

486
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,792
- [creaking continues]
- [breath trembling]

487
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,119
[door creaking]

488
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,711
[Judy breathing shakily]

489
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,759
[rustling]

490
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,280
[breath trembling]

491
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,032
[door rattling and banging]

492
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,515
- [wind howling]
- [indistinct whispering]

493
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,873
[rumbling]

494
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,999
[mirror rattling]

495
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,310
[bones crack]

496
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,477
[footsteps running]

497
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,040
[Judy screaming]

498
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,120
Judy?

499
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
Judy?

500
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
Judy?

501
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,199
[door creaking]

502
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,316
Judy?

503
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,200
[Judy] In thee, O Lord,
do I put my trust.

504
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,717
Let me never be put to confusion.
Deliver me into thy righteousness

505
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,456
and cause me to escape.
Incline thine ear...

506
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,880
[Mary Ellen] Hey! Hey, Judy! Judy.

507
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,680
- [gasping]
- What's going on? What's wrong?

508
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,234
What's going on?

509
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,989
What happened?

510
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,149
Nothing.

511
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,710
Judy...

512
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,679
I just got scared.

513
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,712
Scared of what?

514
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,793
Sometimes...

515
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,069
I see things.

516
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,516
Like how my mom sees things.

517
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,190
You mean like ghosts?

518
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,753
Where do you see them?

519
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,479
Everywhere I go.

520
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,950
Judy...

521
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,239
Ghosts used to be people.

522
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,555
And not every person you meet is bad...

523
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,352
so maybe not all ghosts are bad, either.

524
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,553
[footsteps approaching]

525
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,640
Daniela.

526
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,553
- You have to see this.
- [Mary Ellen] What?

527
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,880
It's this case the Warrens investigated
about this girl

528
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,040
who was terrorized by something
called the Ferryman.

529
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,719
Here's a picture of the girl he killed.

530
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
Look familiar?

531
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,993
I mean, you two could be sisters.

532
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,113
Here's the rest of the file,
if you want to take a look.

533
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,194
Look at all this stuff.

534
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,476
[gasps]

535
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,034
How cool.

536
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,189
Okay, this is the file
on the Black Shuck.

537
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,914
[Mary Ellen] The Black Shuck?

538
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,776
[Daniela] It was a case
the Warrens investigated

539
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,076
about a hellhound
that possessed a man in England.

540
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,470
He terrorized the shit out of this town.

541
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,317
What's with the coins over their eyes?

542
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
What?

543
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,536
[Daniela] Oh, I don't know.
I didn't get that far.

544
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,597
They used to put them
over the eyes of the dead

545
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,440
to pay the Ferryman, so he could take
their souls to the underworld.

546
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,989
It was his toll.

547
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,754
Okay, we should go.

548
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,596
It's okay.
I sometimes like to snoop, too.

549
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,640
[Daniela] Do you know
what this does, Judy?

550
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,631
I think it's called
a Mourner's Bracelet.

551
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,198
It helps you contact
your lost loved ones.

552
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,960
- What's that?
- Um...

553
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,035
It's a case
my parents investigated recently.

554
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,360
The wedding dress.

555
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,034
It haunts people.

556
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,760
And it makes them violent.

557
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,789
Where is the dress now?

558
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,400
Down the hall in the artifact room.

559
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,512
I mean, that's where all this stuff is.

560
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,760
Right, Judy?

561
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,276
- That's what you said earlier.
- Oh, um...

562
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
Yeah.

563
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,677
My dad says that everything in there

564
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,674
is either haunted, cursed...

565
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,755
or used in some ritualistic practice.

566
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,056
What about the doll that's in there?

567
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,456
Because I read this interview
with your dad...

568
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
No.

569
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,479
Don't talk about her.

570
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
Why not?

571
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,271
She's in a case for a reason.

572
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,193
Okay, we should go.

573
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,034
- I wonder what's on this.
- [Mary Ellen] No, Daniela! Wait!

574
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,793

579
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,876
Okay, show's over.
Let's go do something else.

580
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,439
Do something
that's actually appropriate.

581
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,479
[Daniela] Come on, don't you
at least wanna hear about the samurai?

582
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,355
What about this one?

583
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,193
I don't remember that one.

584
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,470
[Daniela] How do you play?

585
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,992
Let's find out.

586
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,550
[chuckles]

587
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,837
Okay. Okay, so you draw a card,

588
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,480
and whatever picture it has on it
is the object you try to find

589
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,034
by feeling around inside the box.

590
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,273
If the object you pull out matches
the picture, then you get a point.

591
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,196
You go first.

592
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,630
Okay.

593
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,558
[objects rattling]

594
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,320
[doorbell ringing]

595
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,110
You gonna get that?

596
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,720
Yeah.

597
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,837
Sorry, you guys keep playing.

598
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,036
Oh, got a point.

599
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,880
Nice.

600
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,639

601
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,470
Hello?

602
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,110
[sighs]

603
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,596
Hi, Mary Ellen.

604
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,430
Hi.

605
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,357
Remember how, at the store, Daniela said
that you were babysitting here?

606
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,520
Yeah. Yeah.

607
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,676
[Bob] Me, too.

608
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,472
Anyways, that's why I'm here.

609
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,911
Oh.

610
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,432
Bob, they don't really want me
having boys over.

611
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,751
No, that's not what I meant.
I don't wanna come in.

612
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,235
I just, uh...

613
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,400
I mean, I would, but...

614
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,437
[chuckles] well...

615
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,472
I just knew you were gonna be here...

616
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,479
and I just wanted to come by
and talk to you

617
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,496
without my stupid dad
or somebody interrupting.

618
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,352
Bob's-Got-Balls!

619
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,631
[chuckles] Nice.

620
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,994
You two sharing some pizza?

621
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,872
- [Mary Ellen] I should get the money.
- Yeah.

622
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,434
Are you two, like...

623
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,111
I... I wish. [chuckles]

624
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,239
You know you need to, like,
woo her, right?

625
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,719
- Woo her?
- [pizza guy] Yeah.

626
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,790
Guys like Mary Ellen,
they need to be wooed.

627
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,198
You mean girls like Mary Ellen.

628
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,480
What did I say?

629
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Guys.

630
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,200
[guffawing]

631
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,953
So, how do I woo her?

632
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,237
[pizza guy]
There's only one way to woo.

633
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,040
It's obvious.

634
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,199
Rock and roll.

635
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,075
[footsteps approach]

636
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,630
Here. Keep it.

637
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,800
Sweet.

638
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,429
Thanks, and that means
you can keep this.

639
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,716
[chuckles] Minus one slice.

640
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,993
I enjoyed that in the car.

641
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,719
[snaps fingers] See you later, Balls.

642
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,196
I would invite you in,
but like I said...

643
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,714
No, yeah, it's cool.

644
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,520
I thought I'd just stop by
and say hi, I guess, so...

645
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,840
I'm glad you did.

646
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,869
Me, too.

647
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,679
Hey, Bob, um...

648
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,033
how come they call you that?

649
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,760
Um...

650
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,878
Well, you know how I'm the equipments
manager for the basketball team?

651
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,955
- Yeah.
- That's why.

652
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,840
There's not really, like,
a story or anything behind it.

653
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,320
Just like, "Hey, I need balls."

654
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,909
I'm, like, "I got it. Balls. Got 'em."

655

[both chuckle]

656
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,915
I'll see woo later.

657

You. You. I'll see you later.

658
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm gonna go.

659
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,196

the short of it is that he died
in a car accident.

1082
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:50,074

<i>along with all your minions,</i>

1084
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,755
<i>- to obey me to the letter.</i>

1085
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,336
<i>- I, who am a servant of God,</i>
- [Daniela screaming]

1086
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,591

01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:16,790
[screaming]

1091
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,634
[roaring]

1093
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,510
- Judy!

1095
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,552
[woman speaks Japanese, screams]

1096

[screeching]

1099
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,793
Judy! Judy. Judy.

1100
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Get the doll!

1101
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,759

1105
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,394
[Judy] Hurry!

[Mary Ellen straining]

1108
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,235
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1109
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,240
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

1110
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,880
Put her in!

1111
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,839
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us for our trespasses

1112
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,435
as we forgive those
who trespassed against us,

1113
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,720
lead us not into temptation,

1114
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:26,480
but deliver us from evil...

1115
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,279
- [noises stop]
- [all panting]

1116
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,360
Amen.

1117
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,554
[stammers] Is it over?

1118
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,238
The evil has been contained.

1119
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,400
- [thudding]
- [all scream]

1120
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,710
Bob?

1121
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,600
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah. We're okay.

1122
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,475
[all panting]

1123
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,710
- Are you okay?
- [Bob] No!

1124
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,359
There was a werewolf outside!

1125
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,639
You saw the werewolf?

1126
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,510
Yeah.

1127
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,639
He saved me from it.

1128
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,120
You did?

1129
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,999
Yeah. Yeah.

1130
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,480
Kind of.

1131
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,677
Maybe we should talk about this
somewhere else.

1132
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:49,640
[man on TV] <i>Good morning from the staff
of WPKW-PV6 in Hartford, Connecticut.</i>

1133
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,496
- [vehicle approaching]
<i>- This is Hartford, Connecticut,</i>

1134
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,398
<i>the land of steady habits...</i>

1135
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:54,551
My parents.

1136
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,056
Shit!
You're not supposed to have boys over.

1137
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,696
I think that's the least
of our concerns right now, Bob.

1138
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:59,520
Yeah, yeah.
I should probably still get going.

1139
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:01,600
Hey, listen, um,
so, Homecoming is coming up

1140
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:03,440
- and I would really like...
- Yes. I'll go.

1141
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,520
With me?

1142
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,239
Yes, if the Warrens don't kill me first.

1143
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,433
[breathes deeply]

1144
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,840
We tell them everything.

1145
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,149
[door closes]

1146
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:15,511
[Judy] Mom!

1147
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:18,195
[Lorraine] Judy!
What are you doing up so early?

1148
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,834
[Judy] Don't get mad...

1149
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:22,037
[Ed] What happened to your car?

1150
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:28,480
Here we go.

1151
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,359
We'll have our own party, huh?

1152
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,914
- What?
- Can you please take that off?

1153
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,956
It won't always be like this, I promise.

1154
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:53,990
You know, and sooner or later,
you'll find people who understand.

1155
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,391
And as for young Anthony,

1156
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,557
he better hope I don't run into him
anytime soon.

1157
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,070
Ed.

1158
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:01,876
[doorbell ringing]

1159
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:14,916
Happy birthday, Judy.

1160
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,280
[Judy] Thank you.

1161
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:18,836
Happy birthday.

1162
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:25,511
I, uh, had a little talk
with my brother.

1163
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,194
Thanks.

1164
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,360
Come in.

1165
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,436
[Mary Ellen]
Is it okay if my boyfriend joins?

1166
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,315
Sure.

1167
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,117
Um...

1168
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,760
- Hi, uh, thanks for having us.
- [Ed] Hey.

1169
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,829
Bob's-Got-Balls.

1170
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,434
No kidding.

1171
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,592
- [girl 1] Hi, Judy!
- Happy birthday, Judy!

1172
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,319
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

1173
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:49,080
- [girl 2] Hello, Judy, happy birthday.
- [Ed] Hey, guys, welcome.

1174
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,793
- Keep comin'.
- [both chuckle]

1175
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,155
[Anthony] Happy birthday, Judy.

1176
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,880
- Anthony?
- [Anthony] I'm really sorry.

1177
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,677
Am I still invited?

1178
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,356
Sure.

1179
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,196
[Lorraine] Daniela?

1180
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:08,833
I have something for you.

1181
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,229
[Daniela] For me?

1182
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:13,916
[sighs]

1183
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,832
You found out the hard way

1184
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,720
that there is a lot of evil
in this room.

1185
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,751
But you know what
I actually like about it?

1186
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,800
All the evil in here...

1187
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:39,551
reminds me of all the good
that's out there.

1188
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,359
Darling Daniela.

1189
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:04,319
Did Judy tell you that?

1190
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,637
No. Your dad did.

1191
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:14,598
He also tells me that he misses you.

1192
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:19,310
And to stop being so hard on yourself...

1193
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:22,316
'cause it was not your fault.

1194
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:23,754
[sobbing quietly]

1195
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:25,989
[sniffles]

1196
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:31,000
[breathes deeply]

1197
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,033
Thank you.

1198
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,354
Um... [sniffles]

1199
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,440
I'm sorry.

1200
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,670
[Lorraine] Oh.

1201
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:40,955
It's okay.

1202
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:42,440
You're young.

1203
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,157
You know, when I was about your age,

1204
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,398
I once ran off with a boyfriend
for three days

1205
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,358
without telling my parents.

1206
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,470
[chuckles]

1207
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,998
I unleashed a demon.

1208
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,680
So not the same thing.

1209
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:03,632
Well, okay. True.

1210
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,040
[both chuckle]

1211
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,230
Does Mr. Warren know
about this boyfriend?

1212
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:14,674
He was the boyfriend.

1213
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,072
[Ed] Anybody wanna hear a song? Whoa.

1214
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:22,958
- [boy] Yeah!
- [all cheering]

1215
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,918
[Ed] All right, okay.

1216
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,633
[pop rock music playing]
