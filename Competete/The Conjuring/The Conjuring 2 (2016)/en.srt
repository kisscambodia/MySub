<font color="#ffff80"><b>Watch on kisskh.me</b></font>

2
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,318
After everything we've seen,

3
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,796
there isn't much that rattles
either of us anymore.

4
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,151
But this one...

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,470
This one still haunts me.

6
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,151
Two months prior to our involvement,

7
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,517
the Lutz family had fled their home
in the middle of the night,

8
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,393
claiming that the house was haunted.

9
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,153
The Church had reached out to us for help.

10
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,794
They wanted to see

11
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,589
if we could confirm the activity
that had been reported by the Lutzes.

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,511
Mm-hmm.

13
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,311
Okay. We ready?

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,232
Then let's get started.

15
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,079
I'd like you to sit quietly
and close your eyes.

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,200
Envision yourself in a halo
of glowing white light.

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,311
It will protect you.

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,631
The year before
the Lutzes moved in,

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,791
a young man named Ronny DeFeo

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,270
had brutally murdered his
entire family in this house.

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,473
We'd hoped to discover

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,677
if the killings had been
motivated purely by anger

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,239
or if,

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,709
as Ronny DeFeo testified in court,

25
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,032
he had been under the influence
of something demonic.

26
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,875
Stay here. Stay.

27
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,199
Kill her. Kill her.

28
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,878
Shoot them.

29
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,678
Shoot them!

30
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Shoot her!

31
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,630
What did you do?

32
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,256
Shoot her. Kill her.

33
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,474
Shoot her!

34
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,351
Shoot them all.

35
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,155
Shoot!

36
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
Kill!

37
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,276
Kill her. Shoot her.

38
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,149
Kill her. Shoot her.

39
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,235
Honey, you okay? What are you seeing?

40
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,189
Lorraine.

41
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,153
Lorraine, what is happening?

42
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,593
I have to see.

43
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,840
We're through. We're through.
It's time to come back.

44
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,675
What is happening?

45
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,591
It wants to show me.

46
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Lorraine!

47
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,115
Lorraine!

48
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,068
Oh, God! Oh!

49
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Honey.

50
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,839
Honey.

51
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,669
It's okay.

52
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,554
It's okay.

53
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Ed.

54
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,029
This is as close to hell
as I ever wanna get.

55
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,874
- Damn kids!
- Really.

56
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,075
Yeah.

57
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Oh, my gosh.

58
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,816
Keith and I are going to sneak
out tonight with his friend, Michael,

59
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,512
who wants to meet you, by the way.

60
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,229
No way.
If my mum ever found out, I'd be dead.

61
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,953
So don't get caught, you priss.

62
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,269
Here, hold this.

63
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,839
Gotta give you back
the spirit board that we made.

64
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,593
I think I'll let Keith French kiss me.

65
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,637
What? No way!

66
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,000
What you two doing?

67
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,915
Janet, give that to me.

68
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,838
And get inside, both of you.

69
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Go.

70
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,718
M-M-M-M-Margaret.

71
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,472
Margaret! Johnny!

72
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,789
Janet! Billy!

73
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,388
Hello. How was your day?

74
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,715
Not good.

75
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,955
Why? What happened?

76
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,111
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

77
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
All right, then.

78
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,669
W-w-what's up?

79
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,558
B-B-B-B-Billy?

80
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,954
Shut up, Peter.

81
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Lesbo!

82
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,872
What, are you talking about your mum?

83
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,434
Oh.

84
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,948
Thank you, Camilla.

85
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,275
No problem!

86
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,875
He's just a wanker. Ignore him.

87
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
Okay.

88
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,256
- Mum's gonna kill me.
- What did you do now?

89
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,952
It wasn't me,
it was Camilla.

90
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,678
What did you do
with Camilla?

91
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,296
It's a long story.

92
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,038
Boys!
Watch the road!

93
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,671
- Janet!
- Up you go, Billy.

94
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,635
Ow!

95
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Come on.

96
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,456
I'm saying I won't be able
to pay my rent this month.

97
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,439
No. I talked to them,
and they put me through to you.

98
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,400
Please keep calm...

99
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,238
I am being calm.

100
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,234
Well, I don't understand
why you can't help me.

101
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,715
No.

102
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,440
No. He hasn't paid a penny
of child maintenance for three months.

103
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,235
- We're home!
- I see. That's bloody brilliant.

104
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,795
- Hi, Mum!
- You have a good afternoon as well.

105
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Janet.

106
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,696
Are things not bad enough around here,

107
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,680
that I've got to get a call
from your headmistress

108
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,432
who says that you was caught smoking?

109
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,955
I wasn't! I wasn't smoking. I promise.

110
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,216
- Did you get the biscuits?
- Did you just not hear me?

111
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,736
I talked to Mrs. More on the telephone.

112
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,376
How can you stand there
and lie to me like that?

113
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
I'm not lying!

114
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,710
Yes, she is! It's all over the school.

115
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,080
She was smoking with Camilla.

116
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,031
Shut up! You are such a liar, Johnny!

117
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,795
Mum! You said
we would get me some...

118
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
No, Billy. I didn't get
any bloody biscuits

119
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,717
because we don't have any bloody money!

120
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,915
Mum's coming.

121
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,240
You better quit messing with that
and brush your teeth!

122
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,994
All right.

123
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,678
Sounds like the whole city's
burning down in here.

124
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,955
Look what I found!

125
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,394
Biscuits!

126
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,118
But you said we
don't have any money.

127
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,475
Well, I've been meaning
to quit smoking anyway.

128
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,312
- Margaret?
- Yes?

129
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,914
Have you got your
school uniform for tomorrow?

130
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,519
Yes, Mum. I'm getting it.

131
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,312
Johnny, did you
brush your teeth?

132
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,674
I did it already.

133
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,836
Come on, Billy.
Time for bed.

134
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,754
Coming, Mum.

135
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,835
Put that down, Johnny.
Come on. Time for bed.

136
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,912
Oh, where'd that come from?

137
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,390
Camilla and I made it at school.

138
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,830
Ugh. That doesn't look right.

139
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,673
It really works, I swear.

140
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,035
We already asked it all sorts of stuff.

141
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,872
Come on, I'll show you.

142
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,198
All right.

143
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,748
What should I ask?

144
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,157
I don't know. Whatever you want.

145
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Okay.

146
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,516
My sister and I want to know...

147
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,718
Are there any spirits here
that want to communicate with us?

148
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,554
Is Dad ever coming home?

149
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,552
Are there any spirits here
who can answer my question?

150
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,029
Don't worry about it.

151
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,952
It's just a stupid game.

152
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
It isn't real.

153
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,396
Why're you
pounding on the door?

154
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,312
I'm not.

155
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,833
You're barmy.

156
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,551
You know, she's
pushing the boundary, isn't it?

157
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,080
She says
she wasn't smoking.

158
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,435
I don't think you should
agonize over it, Peg.

159
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,478
God knows I had my share
of fags at school, didn't you?

160
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Oh, lots.

161
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,480
But it's not what she did that bothers me.

162
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,319
It's that, she don't listen
to what I say anymore, Pegs.

163
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,596
Just a phase, isn't it?

164
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,796
I mean, I can punish her,
but then I feel guilty

165
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,877
because I know it's not really her fault.

166
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,354
She loves her dad

167
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,398
and she took it very hard
when he left. Poor thing.

168
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,751
But I can't just let it go either, can I?

169
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,193
I'm loath to ask, but have you
told Richard about it?

170
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,913
I would, if I ever saw him.

171
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,469
Sod.

172
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,358
Now, it's like I'm having to do both jobs.

173
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,035
I'm half the mum I was before.
I'm just rubbish, Peggy.

174
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,595
You are not, Peggy.
You're too hard on yourself.

175
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
- Ooh!
- Oh!

176
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,835
- This sodding house!
- Oh!

177
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,514
We are back with real life ghost hunters,

178
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,153
Ed and Lorraine Warren,

179
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,670
talking about their experiences
at the Amityville house.

180
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,115
And now we're gonna talk to my next guest,

181
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,912
Dr. Steven Kaplan,

182
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,834
who says that
the investigations the Warrens conducted

183
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,390
into the Amityville haunting
is a load of hogwash.

184
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,999
Why is that?

185
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,034
Well, it's been well established
that Amityville was a blatant hoax.

186
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,776
- But that hasn't stopped...
- That's never been proven.

187
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,835
Yes, it has.

188
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,399
The Lutz family made everything up

189
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,516
so they could profit off
of all the publicity.

190
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,113
That's just not true.

191
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,952
Look, we see this all the time.

192
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,357
It's very easy to sit on the outside
and pick apart their story.

193
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,919
But it's something very different

194
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,156
to have been there and
experienced it for yourself.

195
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,696
I don't need to go to the moon

196
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,109
to know that it's not
made out of green cheese.

197
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,149
Listen, Ed Warren's never seen a house
that he didn't think was haunted.

198
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,790
And by the time his wife is done
blowing smoke and ringing bells

199
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,520
they've got everybody else
believing in ghosts, too.

200
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,352
What exactly are you a doctor of, anyway?

201
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,936
Come on, Warren.
Try and show a little class, will you?

202
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,296
I'm not gonna show class to somebody

203
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,816
who's sitting here telling
lies about my wife and me.

204
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,480
- Be careful who you call a liar.
- What are you gonna do about it?

205
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,672
We go on these shows to inform people.

206
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,354
But every time I open my mouth,
another one of these little...

207
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,033
- Ed.
- Ass...

208
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,628
Academics...

209
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,509
Pops up.

210
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,318
Tries to undo everything we've done.

211
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,776
- Could you please take a breath?
- I know. I know. I know.

212
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,916
I'm counting to 10. I'm counting to 10!

213
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
All right, Billy.

214
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,872
You ready to do a speech?

215
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,635
It's all right. We'll just try again.

216
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
You ready?

217
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,829
Good boy!

218
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,639
You're getting so good.
Now you may have a biscuit.

219
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,028
Biscuit!

220
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,395
All right. Come on. Off to bed with you.

221
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,600
- Night, Mom.
- Good night, darling.

222
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,311
Now, don't eat too many of those

223
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,776
or you'll wake up thirsty
in the middle of the night. All right?

224
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,153
I won't.

225
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,389
You promise?

226
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,637
- Night, boys.
- Night, Mom.

227
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,110
No.

228
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,874
Help.

229
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,639
Stop it.

230
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,229
No.

231
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Janet?

232
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,472
- Please.
- Janet?

233
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,118
Janet, wake up! You're dreaming.

234
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,190
This is my house.

235
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,436
No. No, it's not.

236
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,028
Go away.

237
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,949
Who are you? What are you doing here?

238
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,511
Playing a game with Billy.

239
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,159
Leave Billy alone.

240
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,878
Janet, who are you talking to?

241
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,599
You have to go away.

242
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,120
You're the one trespassing.

243
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,309
Janet, wake up.

244
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,676
I'll tell
my mum if you don't stop.

245
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
I'll break her neck.

246
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,112
No, please.

247
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,316
Dying with Billy.

248
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,520
No.

249
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Janet.

250
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,376
Janet, it's all right.

251
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,118
It's all right, come on.

252
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,879
Go back to sleep.

253
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,718
Stay away from Billy!

254
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,233
Leave us alone. You hear me?

255
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,834
Janet, what are you doing?
There's no one here.

256
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,277
This is my house.

257
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,956
Mum! Mum!

258
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,755
Mum! Mum!

259
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,393
Billy? What's wrong?

260
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,591
There's someone in my tent!

261
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
What?

262
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,514
There's someone in my tent!

263
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,235
Mummy.

264
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,559
See? Nothing.

265
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,995
You just had a bad dream. That's all.

266
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,588
Go to your room.

267
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,754
Oh, my God.

268
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,989
Janet!

269
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,038
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
What're you doing down here?

270
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,597
I think I've been sleepwalking again.

271
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,672
What do you mean "again"?

272
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,435
You all right?

273
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,359
You're burning up. Come on.

274
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,715
Come on, let's get you back upstairs, eh?

275
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,754
Think you better stay home
from school tomorrow.

276
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,880
Come on. Let's get you back into bed, eh?

277
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,070
You know I want to be a hair
artiste and become a credible painter.

278
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,279
Don't give me any
of your brute hype and airy-fairy hair...

279
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,478
back 30 years.

280
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,155
Now, I've gone back to the age of 10.

281
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,993
Everything is shot in soft focus.

282
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,296
Some bogus excuses.

283
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,056
When're you gonna leave
that posh school, eh?

284
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,991
And get yourself a proper
man's job down...

285
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,839
Yes, a Christmas carol.

286
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,336
- Which one?
- All of them.

287
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,280
And within minutes...

288
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,270
Mr. Chairman, Mr. President,
ladies and gentlemen.

289
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,115
I stand before you tonight,

290
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,270
in my Red Star chiffon evening gown.

291
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,077
Hodgson residence.

292
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,517
Oh. Hi, Mum.

293
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,918
Yeah, a little.

294
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,872
I just ate, so I'm not really that hungry.

295
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,353
Yeah. I'm here.

296
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,236
Do you know when you'll be home?

297
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
All right.

298
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,948
Bye, Mum.

299
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,519
Yes, I am an iron lady.

300
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,392
The Iron Lady of the Western world.

301
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,471
No, no. You are a bad one, you know, you.

302
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,915
Mother dearest, I'm sorry I am late.

303
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,878
But I had to stop off
to get you a health-giving brown loaf.

304
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,680
I do not wish to hear
about that sort of thing.

305
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,960
I want you to come over here,

306
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,230
if you don't mind me, and let your old mum

307
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,197
scrape the fluff out of your belly button.

308
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,188
Nice and clean for the big parade
and very good on Sunday.

309
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,436
I shall be there, you know, watching you.

310
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,197
My house!

311
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,473
You're up early.

312
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,715
Hey. Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

313
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,359
You get inspired?

314
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,431
I don't know if I'd
call it that.

315
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,598
I had this crazy dream.

316
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,314
Saw this thing.

317
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,953
When I woke up...

318
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,670
Couldn't get it out of my head.

319
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,032
So, thought maybe this might help.

320
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,471
Hey, I know I'm no Picasso,
but I didn't think it was that bad.

321
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,719
We need to stop.

322
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,750
We could still do the lectures,
but no new cases.

323
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,797
At least not for a little while.

324
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,398
All right. Uh...

325
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,954
Could I ask why?

326
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,511
Because if it's the TV shows and publicity
then we won't do that.

327
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,191
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

328
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,715
Morning.

329
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,998
Do you trust me?

330
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,553
You know I do.

331
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,557
Then please trust me now.

332
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,319
Okay.

333
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,670
Oh. What are you doing that for?

334
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,435
In case I go sleep walking again.

335
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Mum?

336
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,233
Johnny?

337
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,194
Janet! What's wrong? What is it?

338
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,237
There's someone in the room!

339
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,437
There's no one! What you talking about?

340
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,832
- There's someone in our room!
- What!

341
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,393
Our beds are shaking up and down!

342
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,776
Janet, I swear to God
if you're making it up...

343
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,756
I got bit. I'm not lying! He bit me! Look!

344
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,194
Oh, my God.

345
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,192
Have you two been playing with this?

346
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,595
Taking turns scaring the wits
out of each other?

347
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,440
No wonder I can't get
a good night's sleep!

348
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,790
- But, Mum...
- No! I don't wanna hear another word.

349
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,757
Now get back to bed, the lot of you!

350
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,749
Help us!

351
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,951
- Please help!
- Help!

352
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,594
Peggy! Vic, open the door!

353
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,915
Open the door!

354
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,992
I've seen it with my own eyes.

355
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,116
The bloody thing
went clear across the room.

356
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
But...

357
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,431
- Well, then...
- What? Well?

358
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,600
It's cold.
Well, I've been through the house.

359
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,951
Top to bottom. There's no one there.

360
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,016
What about Margaret
and Janet's room? Did you...

361
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,600
No, no. I looked there,
every room.

362
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,536
Even went down the basement.
There's no one there.

363
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,920
What's he doing?

364
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,352
We've taught him to ring the bell
when he wants to go.

365
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,360
Do you wanna let him out, Billy?

366
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,272
Look!
The police are at our house!

367
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,272
Now, what they doing here?

368
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,277
- Oh, I called them.
- What?

369
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,160
Well, I mean, it's got to be somebody
playing a joke on you, right?

370
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,833
It's got to be. Yeah.

371
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,914
So, ma'am. You didn't actually
see the man yourself?

372
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,354
No.

373
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,677
But I don't think she's making it up.
Not anymore.

374
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,072
Well, look.
There has to be some sort of explanation.

375
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,595
Sir, that's why we're here, okay?

376
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,476
Bring me a chair from the kitchen.

377
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,437
It's coming from inside the wall.

378
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,954
Then what? Mice, maybe?

379
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,878
Big bloody mouse.

380
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,760
Well, there's nothing
we can do about that.

381
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,753
We can file an incident report
and we'll stand by it if anyone asks.

382
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,960
But that's about all.

383
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,076
A report? Oh. That's brilliant.

384
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,708
Every problem I have,
there's another bloody form to fill out!

385
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,239
Oh, for God's sake.

386
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,995
Listen.

387
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,873
I think this is a bit beyond us.

388
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,477
The priest at our church
is a family friend.

389
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,159
I'll ask him to call on you.

390
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,314
To us and tell us that...

391
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,957
There are still some honest
people left in the world.

392
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,398
And she said, what happened was,
that she was at the grocery store.

393
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,994
She left her wallet there,
at the grocery store.

394
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,833
It had money in it, a lot of money.

395
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,190
And she thought, "Well,
that's that. It's gone."

396
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,096
She thought someone
was just gonna pick it up.

397
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,439
That's it, that's that.

398
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,950
But just to see what she could do,

399
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,509
she went back to the
grocery store and sure enough.

400
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,318
Some honest woman had picked up the wallet
and returned it to the manager there.

401
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,436
She got everything back.
She got her money.

402
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,029
She got everything that was in the purse.

403
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Judy?

404
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,680
Honey...

405
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,028
What's wrong?

406
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,715
Mom.

407
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,359
Who's that?

408
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,709
Go back.

409
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,229
Who are you?

410
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,719
Tell me who you are!

411
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,791
- Mom! Mom. Mom! Wake up!
- No!

412
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,029
What do you want?

413
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,155
I'm sorry, Lorraine.

414
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,474
Are you okay?

415
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,673
I'm okay.

416
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,515
Mrs. Hodgson.

417
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,040
Yes?

418
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,280
My name's Kent Allen.

419
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,908
We're with the television
news program Wide Angle.

420
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,678
I was hoping to have a word with you

421
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,434
about the disturbance
at your home last week.

422
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,519
How'd you find out about that?

423
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,399
The police constables filed
an incident report. It's...

424
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,673
Well, it's raised a few eyebrows.

425
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,508
I'd rather not have my business
spread all over the telly,

426
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,039
if you don't mind. Good day!

427
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,351
Is it still happening? Because if it is
getting your side of the story out

428
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,516
might be your best chance of finding help.

429
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,597
This thing on? Okay.

430
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,631
Behind the doors of this
seemingly normal house

431
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,199
in Ponders End, North London,

432
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,470
is a family living in a nightmare.

433
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,713
I look up, and through the window,
plain as day, I see the younger girl,

434
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,077
Janet, being thrown around in the air
like she was floating.

435
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,955
So we run back inside and sure enough

436
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,096
there's little toy LEGO bricks
flying all around the room.

437
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,588
One of them hit me right in the face
so hard it drew blood.

438
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,399
I saw the chair slide by itself,

439
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,233
across the floor,
a distance of several feet.

440
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,790
I checked the chair for wires,
but could find nothing to explain it.

441
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,230
Maurice Grosse is an
engineering consultant

442
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,376
and has been investigating these claims
for the Society of Psychical Research.

443
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,073
Well, I don't think there's
any doubt about it at all.

444
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,118
The sheer number of documented
incidents in this case

445
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,032
is absolutely staggering.

446
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,913
But, Anita Gregory,

447
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,736
a parapsychologist and lecturer
at the Polytechnic of North London,

448
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,909
is not convinced.

449
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,754
Our principal characters here
are all children.

450
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,751
And children can be
very ingenious pranksters.

451
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,736
At the center of these
frightening activities

452
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,352
is 11 -year-old Janet Hodgson.

453
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,593
I recently interviewed Janet
and her 14-year-old sister, Margaret.

454
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,509
What happened next will astonish you.

455
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,112
How does it feel
living in a haunted house?

456
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,793
I don't know.

457
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,791
You don't get used to it.

458
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,270
You see, we was just a normal family
before all this.

459
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,280
It's been getting worse
since Mr. Grosse started talking to it.

460
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,789
How do you mean?

461
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,396
Like, asking it questions.

462
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,790
Saying knock twice for "yes"
and one for "no."

463
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,359
That sort of thing.

464
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,159
I wonder what would happen
if we tried talking to it now?

465
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,159
Is anybody there?

466
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,678
Is anybody there
who wishes to communicate?

467
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,951
I say again, is anybody there?

468
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,840
Nothing.

469
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,752
Well, it isn't a jukebox, is it?

470
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,909
Janet, are you all right?

471
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,313
Janet?

472
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,040
Mmm.

473
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,714
Janet.

474
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,476
Janet, are you feeling all right?

475
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,030
Stop calling me Janet!

476
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,872
Isn't that your name?

477
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,110
Janet's asleep...

478
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,077
And I'm talking.

479
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,431
Well, what should I call you?

480
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,118
What is your name?

481
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,835
You don't belong here.

482
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,118
My name is Maurice Grosse.

483
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,600
Who are you?

484
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,317
This is my home.

485
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,438
Get out now!

486
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,839
No. This is not your house.
Now, what's your name?

487
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,118
Knock, knock.

488
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,955
Very well.

489
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,639
Who's there?

490
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,796
Bill. Bill.

491
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,793
Bill. Bill.

492
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,189
Bill who?

493
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:35,118
My name is Bill Wilkins
and I'm 72 years old.

494
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,558
Where do you come from?

495
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,158
I come from the grave.

496
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,958
How did you die?

497
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,871
I went blind and had a hemorrhage.

498
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,471
And I fell asleep
and I died in the chair in the corner.

499
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,475
Why have you come here?

500
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,235
I like to hear them scream.

501
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,511
Why don't you just leave us alone?

502
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,033
Shut up, you old cow!

503
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,989
Janet, darling.

504
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,748
Darling, are you all right?

505
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,555
Janet.

507
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,360
Peggy, what am I gonna do?

508
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,560
Oh...

509
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,115
You don't need to think about it tonight.

510
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,714
And you and the kids can stay here
as long as you like.

511
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,279
Mum.

512
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,634
Billy, aren't you supposed
to be getting ready for bed?

513
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,875
I thought you might like some biscuits.

514
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,400
Oh...

515
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,879
Oh, thank you!

516
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,791
Baron?

517
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,719
Baron?

518
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,598
Mum! Mum!

519
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,558
Mum! Mum!

520
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,234
- What happened? What is it?
- The Crooked Man!

521
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,376
What? Crooked what?
What are you talking about, darling?

522
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,856
- The Crooked Man!
- Calm down!

523
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,240
Just tell me what happened.

524
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,549
- What?
- What is it?

525
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,640
I don't know.
I think he's been walking around...

526
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,954
Janet!

527
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,114
Janet?

528
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,118
Oh, my God! No!

529
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,829
Someone get an ambulance!

530
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,671
This is my home.

531
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,637
Get out now.

532
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,918
No. This is not your house.
Now, what's your name?

533
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,119
Knock, knock.

534
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,119
Very well. Who's there?

535
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,350
Bill. Bill.

536
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,437
Bill. Bill.

537
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,959
Bill who?

538
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:11,432
My name is Bill Wilkins
and I'm 72 years old.

539
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,473
What do you make of that voice?

540
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,194
He sounds confused.

541
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,273
Is he senile?

542
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,556
The voice on this tape

543
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,993
is coming from an 11 -year-old girl.

544
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,989
The family's reached out
to the Church for help?

545
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,200
Yes.

546
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,750
But truthfully, we've been
reluctant to get involved.

547
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,150
The case has turned into
a media circus over there.

548
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,157
They're calling it "England's Amityville."

549
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,520
Great.

550
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,999
You're afraid it's a hoax.

551
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,434
The Church's ability to help people
depends on its reputation.

552
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,158
So, what do you want us to do?

553
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,112
We'd like you to fly to London

554
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,599
for three days to act
as our unofficial eyes and ears.

555
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,990
Now, you don't have to do anything.

556
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,033
If it is a hoax, you just
turn around and leave.

557
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,599
But if it's not...

558
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,439
Then there is a family in London
that desperately needs our help.

559
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,080
Thank you for your faith in us.

560
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,960
- All right. Well, just let me know.
- Okay.

561
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,713
I told him we'd talk about it.

562
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,798
There's nothing to talk about.

563
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,075
Honey, you heard him.

564
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,640
They don't want us to get involved.

565
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,193
Just observe and report back.

566
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,120
There have always been cases
we've turned down.

567
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,595
There has never been a family
that we've refused to help.

568
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,556
I had a vision in Amityville.

569
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,076
It was the same one I had seven years ago.

570
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,070
I had a premonition of your death.

571
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,949
Wait. That's why you locked
yourself away for eight days?

572
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,229
You saw my death?

573
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,998
You've seen it, too.

574
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,160
The demon in your painting is real.

575
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,153
We have both seen the same inhuman spirit.

576
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,914
It's a warning. If we keep doing this,

577
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,672
you are going to die.

578
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,749
Your visions are a gift from God.

579
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,436
And if God is showing you my death,
then he's doing it for a reason.

580
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,748
Maybe you're meant
to prevent it from happening.

581
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,273
Come on.

582
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,756
We don't run from fights.

583
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,268
If we go...

584
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,078
If we do this...

585
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,677
You have to promise me
that we're just there to observe.

586
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,834
If anything turns out
dangerous in any way,

587
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,117
we're gonna tell the Church,
and we're gonna get out.

588
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,508
Promise me.

589
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,472
Promise me, Ed.

590
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,313
I promise.

591
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,199
Mr. and Mrs. Warren, I'm Maurice Grosse.

592
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,191
Thank you so much for coming.

593
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,035
I believe you're gonna be staying
at the Hodgsons' house. Is that right?

594
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,679
Always better to be in the mix.

595
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,313
Oh, yeah. I agree.

596
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,040
You didn't have to do this.

597
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,997
- So kind of you.
- It was a complimentary...

598
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,714
This is it.

599
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,000
Thank you very much.

600
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,880
- How you doing? You all right?
- I'm all right. How are the kids?

601
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:39,955
Yeah. They're fine.

602
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,519
Here we are.

603
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,720
There we go.

604
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,754
Ed, we've managed to capture
some amazing things.

605
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,911
I think you'll be very
impressed when you see.

606
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,078
Great. I'd like to listen
to those tapes again, too.

607
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,200
You've got some really
interesting stuff in there.

608
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,033
Vic Nottingham.
Hi, Vic.

609
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,275
How are you? Ed Warren.

610
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,919
Hello, Ed.

611
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,355
How are you?
And this is Peggy, Peggy Hodgson.

612
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,216
- Nice to meet you. Ed Warren.
- How do you do?

613
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,736
- This is my wife, Lorraine.
- How do you do?

614
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,113
- Hello.
- Hello.

615
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,400
Well, I'll be off then, Peg.

616
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,896
Will you tell the kids I said hello?

617
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,536
Yeah. Of course, I will. Nice to meet you.

618
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,696
- Nice meeting you.
- You too, hon.

619
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,188
- So, here we are, Peggy.
- All right. Do come in.

620
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,431
It's just me
and Janet here now.

621
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,272
My other kids are staying with them.

622
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,597
This is where the girls used to sleep,
but we don't use it anymore.

623
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,760
Why not?

624
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,030
Well, most of the activity
centered in this room.

625
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,390
We were quite afraid
that someone might get hurt,

626
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,039
which is why we keep it locked.

627
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,071
I understand that Janet has levitated.

628
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,416
Did that happen in here as well?

629
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,640
- Yeah, more than once.
- Yeah.

630
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,400
We've got photographs of that as well.

631
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,477
I'd like to hear Mrs. Hodgson's story
from her, if you don't mind.

632
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,632
The neighbors donated them
and I hung them up,

633
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,075
hoping they'd keep things
from moving around.

634
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,593
Has it worked?

635
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,354
No. We can hear it all night.

636
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,876
Hi, there. I'm Lorraine.

637
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,792
Mind if I have a seat?

638
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,949
Do you know why I'm here?

639
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,434
Well, your mom has told me
about what's been going on

640
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,790
and I'm here to help, if I can.

641
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,433
Would you like to talk about it?

642
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,557
You know, when I was about your age,
um, I was visiting my mom at a hospital

643
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,070
and I saw an angel.

644
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,389
Yeah.

645
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:11,194
It was standing next to
a little boy's bed.

646
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,353
It was just gently touching his cheek
and then it stopped.

647
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,158
And it looked right at me.

648
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,312
Of course, my mom and the nurses
did not believe me,

649
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,078
but I knew it was real.

650
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,832
Look, I know how it is.

651
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,990
I know what it's like to lose your friends
because you're different.

652
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:39,755
But I also know that
one person can change everything.

653
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,673
And you just have to open up to them.

654
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,710
How did you know you could trust
the people you opened up to?

655
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,474
I didn't.

656
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,472
Sometimes I got hurt.

657
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,878
And it took a long time,

658
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,358
but I finally found someone
who believed me.

659
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,876
What did you do then?

660
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,473
I married him.

661
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,711
I'm just so tired.

662
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,392
I can't sleep here.

663
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:41,910
I used to go to the medical room at school
and they let me sleep there

664
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,591
because I was so worn out.

665
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,630
But now I can't even do that.

666
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,308
Everyone's afraid of me.

667
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,478
I got no friends.

668
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,676
No place I can go to.

669
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,599
It makes me feel like I'm not normal.

670
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:16,956
You know, whatever is doing this to you
wants you to feel this way.

671
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,113
But why?

672
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,317
Because that's what makes it stronger.

673
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,400
Around the time this all started,

674
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,472
Janet started waking up here
in the middle of the night.

675
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,119
This is the spot that Janet said
Bill Wilkins died, right here.

676
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,471
Where'd you get it from?

677
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
Uh...

678
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,950
My ex-husband bought all the furniture
with the house when we moved in.

679
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,999
If you don't mind me asking...

680
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,197
Uh, is your ex-husband
still in the picture?

681
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,360
Nope.

682
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,879
I'm sorry to hear that.

683
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,916
Any chance of reconciliation?

684
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,992
He had twins with a woman
from round the corner.

685
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,310
So I'm gonna take that as a "no."

686
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,035
- Yeah, it's been a lot to deal with.
- Hmm.

687
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,160
He took all the music the day he left.

688
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,976
I know it must feel like that sometimes...

689
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,150
No. I mean, literally.
He took all the records.

690
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,437
My kids used to love listening
to his Elvis collection.

691
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,830
- They've been through so much.
- Hmm.

692
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,158
And now, all this is happening on top.

693
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,840
Yeah. The timing isn't a coincidence.

694
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,355
Negative entities often
feed off emotional distress.

695
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,990
They like to kick you when you're down.

696
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,670
That hardly seems fair.

697
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,872
No, it really isn't.

698
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,510
Do you know when
the voice is gonna speak?

699
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,119
Sometimes.

700
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,679
And when it does,

701
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,189
does it feel like
it's coming from inside you?

702
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,960
No.

703
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,555
More like it's coming from behind me.

704
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,477
Like I'm being used.

705
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:57,116
Does it ever say things just to you?

706
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,311
That only you can hear?

707
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,038
What does it say?

708
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,869
It said it wants to hurt you.

709
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,233
When did it say that?

710
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,399
Right now.

711
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,278
Do we really need that?

712
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,477
We'd like to be
able to prove to the Church

713
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,240
that she's not making the voice herself.

714
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,736
So, by holding the water in her mouth,

715
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,797
we'll be able to show
that it's not some form of ventriloquism.

716
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,158
Does she have to be in the chair?

717
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,400
Just...

718
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,640
It makes me sick to see her
sitting there like that.

719
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,593
We know it's hard, but the spirit
has shown an attachment to this spot.

720
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,752
It'll be easier for Ed to contact it
if she's sitting there.

721
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,272
You'll be all right.

722
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,189
You ready for this?

723
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,119
I guess so.

724
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,033
It's December the 21 st, 1977.

725
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,636
This is Ed and Lorraine Warren,
sitting with Peggy and Janet Hodgson.

726
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,995
Also present is Maurice Grosse.

727
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,351
All right. Let's get started.

728
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,400
If there's something here that would
like to communicate with us,

729
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,630
we're all ears. Speak up.

730
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,834
What do you want
with this girl and her family?

731
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,397
It says it won't talk with you
all looking at me like this.

732
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,238
Strange! I wonder why not?

733
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,994
It's not been shy about
talking up until now.

734
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,712
How about if we all turn our backs?

735
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,360
Think it'll speak if we do that?

736
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,600
Maybe.

737
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,875
Well...

738
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,910
Let's try this again.

739
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,952
So what do you think, Bill?

740
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,678
We've given you your privacy.

741
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,598
Now come on out and talk to us.

742
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,233
Here I come.

743
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,916
Am I talking to the spirit
that's oppressing this family?

744
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,597
Is that what I am?

745
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,797
Is that what I'm doing?

746
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,520
Yes.

747
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,910
And I have come to put a stop to it.

748
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,598
Do you know who I am?

749
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,280
Ed.

750
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,909
Eddie.

751
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,514
Edward.

752
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,350
Ed is fine.

753
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,958
Your father called you Edward.

754
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,509
Not true.

755
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,950
My father called me Ed,
just like everybody else.

756
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,936
Come on, Bill.
You're not a psychiatrist

757
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,600
and I'm not here to talk about my father.

758
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,870
Let's get down to business,
what do you say?

759
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,040
Hmm?

760
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,518
Why don't you
just leave these people alone?

761
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,788
Because this is my house!

762
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,991
It's not your house.

763
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,878
Yes, it is.

764
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,995
I come here to see my family,

765
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,835
but they're not here now.

766
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,831
That's because you're dead.

767
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,833
If your family did live here,
they're long gone now.

768
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,872
Where are they?

769
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,832
I don't know.
If I did, maybe I could help you.

770
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,837
I don't need your help.

771
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,990
Then why don't you just move on?

772
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,110
I don't believe in that.

773
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,076
Why not, hmm?

774
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,188
What would be so wrong
with going to heaven?

775
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,713
I

776
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,074
Am not

777
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,753
a heaven man!

778
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,271
Well, I got news for you, Bill.

779
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,800
You see, I don't care what you believe in.

780
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,560
You see this?

781
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,310
Help... it... let... go.

782
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,715
Help... It... Let... Go!

783
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,473
Are you sensing a presence?

784
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,920
No, just the opposite.

785
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,155
I'm not sensing anything.

786
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,110
We could be looking
at hysterical neurosis.

787
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,875
That would explain
the multiple personalities

788
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,473
and hallucinations.

789
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,431
That doesn't feel right, either.

790
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,795
Well...

791
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,111
I can't explain it.
My heart is telling me to believe them.

792
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,714
I heard that voice with my own ears,

793
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,713
but all I can sense is their own fear.

794
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,110
I can't seem to see beyond that.

795
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,479
I don't think I can sleep
this far away from you.

796
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,388
Well, you're gonna.

797
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,996
It'll give you something
to look forward to when we get home.

798
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,989
Oh, love. I wish you wouldn't do that.

799
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,912
It helps me sleep.

800
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,991
At least I know I'm not going anywhere.

801
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,032
I didn't smoke, Mum.

802
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,240
Eh?

803
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,395
That day with Camilla at school.

804
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,278
I was holding the cigarette,

805
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,635
but I wasn't going to take
a puff. I swear.

806
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,473
I just wanted to look cool
in front of her.

807
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,073
It was stupid.

808
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,794
Oh, love.

809
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,914
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

810
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,632
Oh, darling.

811
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,200
Help!

812
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,635
Help!

813
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,240
Hmm.

814
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,115
Janet!

815
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,835
Ah!

816
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,709
Janet?

817
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,029
Oh, my God.

818
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,519
Janet?

819
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,829
Janet?

820
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,069
- Help!
- Janet?

821
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,600
Janet!

822
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,080
Please help me!

823
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,434
Mum!

824
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,433
Please! Mum!

825
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,637
- Janet!
- Help! Get me out!

826
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,869
There's somebody in here!

827
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,234
I can't open it!

828
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,635
Mum!

829
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,871
Help me!

830
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,080
Janet!

831
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:01,960
Janet!

832
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,680
- What's going on?
- There's someone in there with Janet!

833
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,872
I can't get it open!

834
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,758
Get the key. Go get the key now!

835
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,954
Janet! Hold on! We're coming!

836
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,871
I got the key! I got the key!

837
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,109
Okay. Okay.

838
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,800
Come on.

839
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:27,795
Janet, we're coming!

840
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,440
Janet.

841
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,870
Get it off her! Please get it off her!

842
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,959
What was that?

843
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:39,799
There was someone in here!

844
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,312
I saw him with me own eyes.

845
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,040
He did this to my girl.

846
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,834
This is the bite wound
Janet received the first night.

847
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,515
It's faded a bit here,
but you can still make it out.

848
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,111
Wow. That's pretty distinctive.

849
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,475
Two missing teeth.

850
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,816
That's right. And it's too big
for one of the children.

851
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,274
You think this was the spirit?
This Bill Wilkins?

852
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,879
I tracked down the home owner.

853
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,435
And it turns out,
the owner's father lived there.

854
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,794
His name was William Wilkins

855
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,912
and he died of a hemorrhage
in the brain in that chair.

856
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,839
Everything she said is true.

857
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,473
All public information, by the way.

858
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,760
She could have heard
the whole story from a neighbor.

859
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,720
And what about the claims

860
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,256
that Janet has been
teleporting around the house

861
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,349
in her sleep?

862
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,478
About as valid as their claims
of her levitating off the bed.

863
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,836
Were any of you there when it happened?

864
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,070
No. But I have pictures of that too.

865
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,753
Yeah. There you go.

866
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,031
I set my camera up in the girls' room

867
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,316
and then waited downstairs
with the remote control.

868
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,715
And fired it off whenever
I heard any commotion.

869
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,478
I have to admit.

870
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,791
The way her knees are bent,
the upright position of her body.

871
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,280
It looks like she's just jumping.

872
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,376
What are you saying?
I mean, you were there last night.

873
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,600
You saw it with your own eyes.

874
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,190
Well, Peggy was the one who
saw someone attacking Janet.

875
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,669
But she teleported herself into a room

876
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,035
locked from the outside,
for goodness' sake.

877
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,832
And what about her voice?

878
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,353
How do we explain that?

879
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,193
I think the first time
she was making that voice

880
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,277
it was in front of television cameras.

881
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,240
And she couldn't do it
with water in her mouth

882
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,469
until you looked away.

883
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,358
So she could have spit it out,

884
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,352
taken another sip before you turned back.

885
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,835
Last year, I was conned by a Welsh family
pretending to be possessed by demons.

886
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,036
Honestly,
I don't know what was worse,

887
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:36,557
the demons or the people who prey
on our willingness to believe in them.

888
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,798
The demons are worse.

889
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,431
But you must admit, it is suspicious.

890
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,036
You sincerely believe
that she's faking everything?

891
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,235
And what about Peggy?

892
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,431
She's just using the whole
thing as an excuse

893
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,352
to get better housing from the council.

894
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,078
She's already applied!

895
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,196
Look, I'm not saying it's a hoax.

896
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,113
Sometimes, what we do
requires a leap of faith.

897
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,952
To believe when nobody else will.

898
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,596
So you really do believe them?

899
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,510
Yes. We do.

900
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,637
But the Church can't do
anything without proof.

901
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,800
That's what we need.

902
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,880
Right, listen. I'll make
some telephone calls,

903
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,554
see if I can get hold of some
video recording equipment.

904
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,520
In the meantime,
Ed and I can be spending time

905
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,635
with Peggy and the kids,

906
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,916
because they need to be a family again.

907
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,279
Hi, Mom! We're back!

908
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,680
What are you doing back?

909
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:26,948
What's all this, then?

910
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,496
Mr. and Mrs. Warren bought us some vinyls.

911
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,640
They got us an Elvis record!

912
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,073
Oh, Blue Hawaii.

913
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,390
Hope you don't mind.
A little American culture.

914
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:34,560
Not at all!

915
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,278
- Janet!
- Billy.

916
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,479
I missed you.

917
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,109
Hey, guys, I missed you.

918
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,188
So, have any of you ever been
bothered by a bully?

919
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,509
Pete, at school.

920
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,511
He's always picking on Billy.

921
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,160
And, dear, tell me, what do
you do when that happens?

922
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,190
They stick up for me.

923
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,960
Good, because the spirit in this house

924
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,832
- is a lot like that bully.
- Yes.

925
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,439
And he's got it in for Janet.

926
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,831
So you guys gotta stick up for her,
the same way they stick up for you.

927
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,394
Family sticks together.

928
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,029
This, on the other hand, is a lost cause.

929
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,429
Oh, bloody hell.

930
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,280
We've had all sorts of things stop working

931
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,753
- for no reason at all.
- Mmm.

932
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,032
We're gonna have music in here
one way or another.

933
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,359
Whose guitar is that?

934
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,155
Oh, it was Dad's,
but he said I could have it.

935
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,320
Yeah, do you mind?

936
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,189
No.

937
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:32,874
I'm a little rusty,
so you gotta promise not to laugh.

938
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,394
Especially you.

939
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,078
Thank you.

940
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,549
Hey, don't laugh now.

941
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,236
Everybody now.

942
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,114
Thank you very much.

943
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,678
It's so small and light.

944
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,759
Why do you do this?

945
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,192
Help people like us?

946
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:55,352
When you were little, did you ever
worry that there might be something

947
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,760
hiding under your bed at night?

948
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,271
Yeah? Well...

949
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:04,038
My bed actually had something under it.

950
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,315
Yeah.

951
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,153
Something grabbed my hand
and yanked me right to the floor.

952
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,193
It was too dark to see under there,

953
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,476
but let me tell you,
I ran out of there so fast.

954
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:14,874
You know what my dad did?

955
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:19,193
He dragged me right back into the room
and told me I had to face my fears.

956
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,155
And I was scared to death.

957
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:26,719
But then I remembered
what this nun had told me in catechism.

958
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,079
"God will be there for all who need."

959
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:36,550
So, I grabbed this crucifix
out from my nightstand, right?

960
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,231
And I tell whatever's under there

961
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:42,631
that it better leave,
or God was gonna kick its butt.

962
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,558
Best thing my dad ever did for me.

963
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,720
Of course he only did it
because he really didn't believe me.

964
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,075
It took me years
to finally find someone who did.

965
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,878
And you know what I did then?

966
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,594
You married her?

967
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,752
So you've heard this story before?

968
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,268
All right.

969
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,712
How you getting on in here?

970
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,911
Hey. We're done here.

971
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,071
Fixed the closet door, too.

972
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,576
And if you'd like, I could take a look
at the washing machine.

973
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,431
No, I couldn't ask you to do that.

974
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,113
It's a disaster down there.

975
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,952
Come on. How bad can it be?

976
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:28,720
Oh.

977
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,429
Bloody hell.

978
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,238
Everything still quiet in there?

979
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,630
Yes. Thank goodness. Yes.

980
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,191
It would be something though, wouldn't it?

981
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:41,113
If we were able to prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt

982
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,352
that there is a life beyond this?

983
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,634
It would be historic.

984
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,719
Is that why you're doing this?

985
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,920
Because you want to be a part
of something historic?

986
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,870
This isn't a laboratory,
this is someone's house.

987
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,077
And I think helping that family
is the only thing that matters.

988
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:02,117
No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

989
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,598
My daughter died in a car
crash several years ago.

990
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,589
Afterwards, I started
to experience things.

991
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,758
I think she wanted to communicate with me.

992
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,913
And, yes, it would help
if I knew that she was...

993
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,114
I don't know.

994
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,999
Somewhere.

995
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,513
That's not it.

996
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,314
Oh, great.

997
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,228
Think I found it.

998
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,153
All right.

999
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,794
It's right here.

1000
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,752
Come and get it. Margaret!

1001
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,473
Johnny, come and get it.

1002
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,556
Okay.

1003
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,229
Think I got it.

1004
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,520
All right.

1005
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,314
There we go.

1006
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,194
What's that?

1007
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,152
Ed? There's...
There's something behind you.

1008
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:06,355
What is it?

1009
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:08,832
Oh, Jesus!

1010
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,600
Whoa!

1011
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:11,840
Peggy!

1012
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,235
Peggy!

1013
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,353
He grabbed me.

1014
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,988
It was him. He tried to pull me under.

1015
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,351
Oh, my God! Look!

1016
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,200
Oh God, you're scratched.

1017
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,816
That's not a scratch, that's a bite mark.

1018
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:29,035
He bit me. Just like he did Janet.

1019
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,039
Aw.

1020
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,391
Hey, Janet, can you get me another one?

1021
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,600
Yeah.

1022
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:49,998
Janet?

1023
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:51,593
What's wrong?

1024
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,112
Don't you see it?

1025
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,314
See what?

1026
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,273
In the kitchen.

1027
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,958
Tell me what you see.

1028
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,680
It's playing with the knives,

1029
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,108
hiding in the dark.

1030
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,958
Johnny! Johnny, what you doing?

1031
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:35,596
Johnny, no! Johnny, don't go!

1032
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,353
Remember what Mr. Warren said?

1033
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,238
We can't let it bully us.

1034
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,117
This is our house.

1035
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:46,153
Johnny. Johnny, please come back.

1036
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,319
What's the matter? What's happened?

1037
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,358
Janet's gone! She was just right here!

1038
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,560
Come on.

1039
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,080
No!

1040
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,191
- Mum!
- Johnny!

1041
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,198
Ed? What's going on?

1042
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,480
Mum.

1043
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,194
Mum, Johnny's in there!

1044
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:33,839
No!

1045
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,200
Johnny!

1046
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,199
Johnny!

1047
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:39,880
Step back.

1048
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,560
Come on.

1049
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:55,399
Where are they?
Where are they? Johnny?

1050
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,520
Johnny?

1051
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,394
Darling!

1052
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:05,198
Oh, darling, come here.

1053
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,719
Are you all right?

1054
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,959
It's all right, darling.

1055
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,508
It's all right.

1056
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:17,989
Where's Janet?

1057
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,154
Where's Janet?

1058
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,548
Janet!

1059
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,272
Guys, I'm picking up something in here.

1060
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,560
Ed, watch the...

1061
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,871
Me... Won't...

1062
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,236
Me... Won't...

1063
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,680
Me...

1064
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:26,200
Janet.

1065
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:30,315
It's okay. It's okay.
Come on. Come on.

1066
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,639
Come on, now.

1067
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,797
It's okay. Watch out. Look out.

1068
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,672
- Slowly!
- Okay.

1069
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,416
Darling, it's all right.

1070
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:41,477
It's all right, Mum's here.
Mum's here, darling.

1071
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,512
How did she get in there?

1072
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,197
It's all right, darling. What's that?

1073
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:02,869
It's fine.

1074
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:08,908
Can I, uh...

1075
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,389
What is it?

1076
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,878
She's faking it.

1077
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,839
What?

1078
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:20,872
I have proof.

1079
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:05,832
So much for your leap of faith.

1080
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:12,355
What?

1081
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,753
My girl didn't make this up.
I've seen things.

1082
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:17,792
She was caught red-handed faking an event.

1083
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:20,554
No, it's not possible.
Have you seen it in there?

1084
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,354
How could a 12-year-old girl
throw a table across the room?

1085
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,352
It's over. Do you understand?

1086
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,997
For the sake of your daughter,
don't make this harder than it already is.

1087
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,596
She couldn't have pulled this off alone.

1088
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:34,959
Oh, how dare you.

1089
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,953
What, you think I put her up to this?

1090
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,396
What about the police?
Are they in on this, too?

1091
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:40,755
No, it's all right.

1092
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,393
What about you two?

1093
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,438
You believe us, don't you?

1094
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,833
We wanna help.

1095
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:55,200
But the Church will take one look at
that video and that'll be the end of it.

1096
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:59,990
They'll wanna distance themselves from
anything that remotely resembles a hoax.

1097
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,676
I'd like you to leave, please.

1098
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:09,872
Now, go on, get out.

1099
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:12,312
Get out, the lot of you!

1100
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,429
Get out!

1101
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:29,832
Perhaps, you could somehow
reach out to the spirit.

1102
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,270
You know, make contact with it yourself.

1103
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,516
I can't. Believe me, I've tried.

1104
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:37,196
I'm sorry, I'm just not
sensing anything here.

1105
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,635
So, that's it, then?

1106
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,400
You hold out a lifeline to them
and then you just throw it away?

1107
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,471
We don't like this any more than you do.

1108
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,751
We'll tell the Church
about everything we've seen.

1109
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,355
But, the only piece
of concrete evidence we've got,

1110
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:50,200
is a video of Janet faking an incident.

1111
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:54,035
Yeah, but there have been literally
dozens of genuine incidents.

1112
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,400
You might want this.

1113
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:58,717
And, just because she faked it this once,
doesn't change the fact that...

1114
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,080
No, it changes everything.

1115
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,759
We're agents of the Church here.

1116
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:06,675
They'd be calling us home
even if Peggy hadn't asked us to leave.

1117
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:10,915
You've done really
good work here, Maurice.

1118
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,191
You were here for them
when no one else was.

1119
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,517
Uh, thank you.

1120
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,872
But, sometimes you need to
make a leap of faith.

1121
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:29,240
Believe when nobody else will.

1122
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,392
This doesn't feel right.

1123
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:10,800
I know.

1124
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:14,600
Have a safe trip.

1125
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,472
Did you really do it?

1126
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,757
Wreck the kitchen and all that?

1127
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,878
But, why?

1128
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,628
It said it would kill you,

1129
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:09,433
if I didn't make them leave.

1130
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,376
Don't you think
it's a little convenient

1131
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,080
that she just happened to fake an incident

1132
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:18,238
in the one room of the house
that had a video camera pointing at it?

1133
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:19,480
Yeah.

1134
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,549
No.

1135
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:24,949
Oh, damn it.

1136
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:40,669
Lorraine.

1137
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:43,000
Help me set up these tape recorders.

1138
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:57,880
Thread it through
and start it from the top.

1139
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:04,760
All right.

1140
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,320
Remember those strange,
garbled messages we got from Janet?

1141
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,439
- You know, from Bill?
- Yes.

1142
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:11,954
There were two of them, right?

1143
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:13,429
Here's the first one.

1144
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:17,550
Help! It...

1145
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,869
Let go!

1146
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:24,198
Help! It... Let...

1147
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,475
Go!

1148
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,016
We thought
he was referring to himself, right?

1149
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,395
- Yes.
- Listen to the second one.

1150
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,993
Me... Won't...

1151
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,431
Me... Won't...

1152
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,995
Me...

1153
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,432
If I'm right about this...

1154
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:05,796
Help me! It won't let me go!

1155
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:10,278
Help me! It won't let me go!

1156
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:52,996
I come here to see my family.

1157
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:55,830
But they're not here now.

1158
01:46:58,480 --> 01:46:59,993
I think,

1159
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:03,232
I'd like to go now.

1160
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:07,075
- But I can't.
- Why not?

1161
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:11,077
It wants her. So badly.

1162
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:13,677
It almost has her.

1163
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:15,753
T ell me how to stop it.

1164
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,308
I'm given and I'm taken.

1165
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:26,154
I was there at your first breath.

1166
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,113
You didn't ask for me.

1167
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:33,079
But I'll follow you till death.

1168
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:36,110
Wait. I don't understand.

1169
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:37,440
Please...

1170
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,360
Oh, God!

1171
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,755
You're bleeding!

1172
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:46,719
What is happening?

1173
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:55,909
The old man's spirit is just a pawn.

1174
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:59,238
He's been enslaved
to where he's to weaken Janet's will.

1175
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:00,708
Enslaved? Enslaved by who?

1176
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,194
Something inhuman.

1177
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:05,398
Something that's taken
a blasphemous form to attack my faith.

1178
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,990
There is a demonic presence in that house.

1179
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:11,549
You need to get Vic before he leaves.
We need to go back.

1180
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:12,920
Okay.

1181
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,875
Mom, help me, please! Mom!

1182
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,674
Please, Mom, help me! Help!

1183
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,279
For God's sake, leave us alone!

1184
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,469
Margaret!

1185
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,512
Margaret, no!

1186
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:58,474
Come on, let's get out of here!

1187
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,308
Come on, let's get out!

1188
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:07,110
- Go to Peggy's house!
- What, you're not coming?

1189
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,509
I can't leave Janet!

1190
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,036
- No! Janet!
- Mum!

1191
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,080
Janet!

1192
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:15,696
Well, I don't understand it.

1193
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,631
I mean, first you say it's not real,
now it is.

1194
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:20,110
Her sight was being blocked
by the inhuman spirit.

1195
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:21,594
The old man's spirit

1196
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:24,189
couldn't break through
until we left that house.

1197
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:27,280
Everything they've experienced
has been a manifestation of the demonic.

1198
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,600
The Old Man, the Crooked Man,
they're just a facade,

1199
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:31,536
trying to keep us from seeing
the real evil in that house.

1200
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,841
In my vision, he wanted to help me,
but he was too afraid.

1201
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,070
And he kept speaking in a kind of riddle.

1202
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:43,480
Something like, uh,
"I am given and I am taken.

1203
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:45,478
"I was there at your first breath.

1204
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,113
"You didn't ask for me.

1205
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:51,194
"But I will follow you until your death."

1206
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:59,040
Your name. You didn't ask for it.
It was given, when you were born.

1207
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,600
That's it! Knowing the demon's name

1208
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:02,480
gives us power over it
and we can cast it out.

1209
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,671
Yeah, sure, but we don't know its name.

1210
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:05,955
But, maybe we do.

1211
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,200
Huh?

1212
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,112
Why else would he give us that clue?

1213
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,237
He must think that we know it somehow.

1214
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:13,073
So, what do you do now?

1215
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:15,640
An inhuman spirit powerful enough
to cloud Lorraine's sight

1216
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:16,840
is more than a match for me.

1217
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:19,280
We need to get Janet to the Church
before it kills her.

1218
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,914
Janet!

1219
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,709
What happened?

1220
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:32,200
Janet!

1221
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,835
Janet!

1222
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:38,195
Thank God you're here.

1223
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:39,919
- Janet's in there!
- Come on!

1224
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:43,760
Damn it.

1225
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:06,036
Huh?

1226
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,836
- Ed! Are you okay?
- Yeah!

1227
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,429
I'm gonna go around back!

1228
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:14,392
No! Ed! No!

1229
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:16,309
Ed, no, no, no.

1230
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,233
I'm gonna come with you!

1231
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:21,954
- Peggy, stay here.
- Janet!

1232
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:24,470
- Wait in the car with the kids! Wait!
- Janet!

1233
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:25,680
Janet!

1234
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:29,560
Get in the car.

1235
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:32,314
Go in, go on. You, too, Peggy. Come on!

1236
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:39,920
Ed?

1237
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:44,480
Ed?

1238
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:53,473
Ed?

1239
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,351
No! Come on!

1240
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,195
Ed!

1241
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:01,959
It won't open!

1242
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:04,714
Let me try.

1243
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,536
- We need to break it down!
- All right.

1244
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:09,788
- Wait here.
- Break it!

1245
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,678
Ed, hon, wait right there.

1246
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:14,354
Wait. Vic'll be right back.

1247
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,630
I can't wait. I'm going on ahead.

1248
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,757
No, Ed, don't! Stop!

1249
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:20,513
You can't fight this alone.

1250
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:24,913
She needs our help!

1251
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:28,836
Ed, please. Please, just wait for me.

1252
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,953
Please wait for me.

1253
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:43,117
I can't lose you. I am so scared.

1254
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,115
I know.

1255
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,949
Me, too.

1256
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:52,312
But I have to help her.

1257
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,752
But, what about my vision?

1258
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,429
I know I made a promise to you, hon,

1259
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:04,032
but I have to do this.

1260
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:08,039
I love you, Lorraine.

1261
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:10,874
Ed, no! No!

1262
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:13,039
Stop! Don't!

1263
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:16,318
Ed!

1264
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:18,793
No!

1265
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:23,034
No. Stop.

1266
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:27,920
Ed! Someone! Help!

1267
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:38,920
Move.

1268
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:00,155
Oh, God.

1269
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:06,758
Janet, where are you?

1270
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,389
Come on!

1271
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:23,595
Help!

1272
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:25,349
Janet!

1273
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:26,760
Janet!

1274
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:28,115
Help me!

1275
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:29,549
Janet!

1276
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:39,357
In the name of the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

1277
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:03,355
What's your name?

1278
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:05,280
What's your...

1279
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:08,270
What's your name?

1280
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:20,479
I do know your name.

1281
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,115
I asked you.

1282
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:23,759
Tell me who you are!

1283
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:25,114
And you told me.

1284
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,558
You told me your name.

1285
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,629
And I wrote it down.

1286
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:38,880
I need my Bible!

1287
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:40,348
Why? What's happening?

1288
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:41,840
What...

1289
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,640
The demon's name gives us power over it.

1290
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:01,120
V.

1291
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:03,276
A. L.

1292
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:05,278
A. K.

1293
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:09,229
Valak.

1294
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:37,114
Janet!

1295
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:49,748
Janet?

1296
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:00,671
There was a crooked man

1297
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:03,559
And he walked a crooked mile

1298
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:09,234
He found a crooked sixpence
upon a crooked stile

1299
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:14,708
He bought a crooked cat
which caught a crooked mouse

1300
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:19,233
And they all lived together in a little...

1301
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,514
Vic! Vic! Let me through.

1302
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,760
- No, wait, Lorraine, let me try.
- I'm going! No!

1303
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,319
Let me go in. Lorraine!

1304
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:53,600
Ed!

1305
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:55,480
Lorraine!

1306
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:58,588
Lorraine!

1307
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:05,120
Ed!

1308
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,120
Janet?

1309
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:43,632
Janet! No! No!

1310
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,200
I got you.

1311
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:52,396
Come on.

1312
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:53,755
No!

1313
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,433
Janet.

1314
02:00:55,680 --> 02:00:57,671
Ed! Ed!

1315
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,797
Ah!

1316
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:06,195
Ed!

1317
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:14,269
Lorraine!

1318
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:32,195
Ed!

1319
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:39,194
Your name gives me dominion
over you, demon.

1320
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:41,352
And I do know your name!

1321
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,592
You are Valak!

1322
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:47,553
The defiler.

1323
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:51,350
The profane, the marquis of snakes!

1324
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:56,199
In the name of the Father
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

1325
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:59,393
I condemn you back to hell!

1326
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:13,160
No!

1327
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Ed!

1328
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:18,960
Come on!

1329
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:20,560
Ed!

1330
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:25,479
Okay. We're good. Okay.

1331
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:28,994
- Ed, are you okay?
- No, check on her.

1332
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:30,435
Janet?

1333
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,877
Oh, my God! Is she all right?

1334
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,599
I'll call an ambulance.

1335
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:37,320
Janet, sit up, darling. Sit up.

1336
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,909
Here you go now.

1337
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:40,919
Take a big, deep breath.

1338
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:43,435
Big, deep breath. There you go.

1339
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,798
You all right?

1340
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,233
He'll be fine.

1341
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:37,991
- Does she look all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

1342
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:40,358
You saved her.

1343
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:42,480
No.

1344
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:44,988
You saved us.

1345
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:49,310
Didn't I tell you it was meant to be?

1346
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:53,757
But you believed in me.

1347
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,389
I couldn't have done it without you.

1348
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:12,590
Thanks for coming back for us.

1349
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:14,472
Oh.

1350
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,680
Aw.

1351
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:19,470
Here, sit down. Sit down.

1352
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:26,429
You know...

1353
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:33,031
This has kept me safe
since I was a kid.

1354
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:36,193
I want you to have it.

1355
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:43,199
And, when you grow up,

1356
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:47,192
you find someone who needs it,
you give it to them.

1357
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:49,708
Deal?

1358
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,992
I'm so lucky.

1359
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:02,871
You said one person
could change everything.

1360
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:04,960
But...

1361
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,592
I've got two.

1362
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:08,308
Oh.

1363
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:19,275
Okay.

1364
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:52,316
Tell me about the beginning,
the first night of your happening.

1365
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:54,896
- What was your brother doing?
- Brothers playing

1366
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:55,920
and fooling about.

1367
02:07:56,240 --> 02:07:57,468
I wasn't quite sure, no.

1368
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:00,228
- They were scared?
- Yeah, petrified.

1369
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:01,600
Janet? What about Janet?

1370
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:06,596
When it comes from your area, Janet,
do you feel anything in your throat?

1371
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:08,757
- No.
- You just don't feel anything?

1372
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:10,559
Now, I'm looking at Janet.

1373
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:12,160
Don't fight in here.

1374
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:13,680
And the voice comes from her,

1375
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:15,536
but her mouth doesn't move
and nothing moves.

1376
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:16,560
Turn it off!

1377
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:17,989
I know...

1378
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:20,999
Janet, can you tell when
the voice is gonna come through you?

1379
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:23,191
No. No, I don't ever.

1380
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:25,296
You know who I am?
Do you know what my name is?

1381
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:27,356
Yeah. Ed. Ed!

1382
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:33,871
Were you a Christian?

1383
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:36,356
No! You know it!

1384
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:38,400
What year did you die?
Do you remember?

1385
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:41,791
Yeah. I'm dead. Sixty-one.

1386
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:44,113
Nineteen sixty-one.
