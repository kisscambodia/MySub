Sister Oana, can you tell me about
the history of this Abbey?

543
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,755
It was built by a duke in the Dark Ages.

544
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,434
<i>The Duke of St. Carta.</i>

545
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,832
<i>He wrote countless texts
on witchcraft and rituals,</i>

546
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,231
in which to call upon
the forces of hell.

547
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,592
Hell used him to open a gateway
so that an unspeakable evil

548
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,830
<i>would walk amongst us.</i>

549
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,629
(RUMBLING)

550
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,753
<i>But the Church stormed the castle.</i>

551
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,916
They sealed the gateway
using an ancient relic

552
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,116
<i>containing the blood of Jesus Christ.</i>

553
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,111
<i>The Church claimed the castle
for their own</i>

554
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,873
<i>and our perpetual praying began</i>

555
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,714
<i>to secure the Abbey
and contain the evil.</i>

556
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,795
<i>For centuries it worked
and evil was kept at bay</i>

557

558
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,400
and evil found another way
to open the gateway.

559
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,549
Sister Oana, last night in the chapel,

560
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,640
I saw a nun.

561
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:02,396
She was... She felt anything but holy.

562
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,840
Do you see her, too?

563
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,631
I've seen her stalking
the hallways at night.

564
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,476
<i>We all have.</i>

565
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,472
<i>She looks like us,
but she's not one of us.</i>

566
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,470
It's something unholy.

567
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,636
It takes on different forms to
deceive us and prey on our weaknesses.

568
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,951
It appears as a nun
so it can hide among our cloister

569
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,554
<i>until it can corrupt us all.</i>

570
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,999
I fear her presence
means the portal has opened again.

571
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,271
It made Sister Victoria
commit the ultimate sin.

572

(GROANS)

909
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:22,072
I hope you don't mind.
It's called "the kiss of life."

910
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,016
It's just called that way.
(STAMMERS) It's just, it's not really...

911
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,760
Frenchie, what's your real name?

912
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,480
Maurice.

913
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,637
Thank you for saving my life, Maurice.

914
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,680
You're welcome. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

915
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,990
We should get going.

916
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,758
Into your hands, Oh, Lord,
we humbly deliver your servants.

917
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,800
The nuns of St. Carta.

918
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,159
They served you in this life
with strength and faith.

919
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,637
Deliver them now from every evil.

920
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:31,192
And let them live with you
in perfect grace, forever.

921
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,400
Amen.

922
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,872
Thought this ground wasn't holy anymore.

923
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,600
It is now.

924
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,834
Will you stay on in Biertan?

925
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,880
FRENCHIE: Oh, I think I've had
my fill of Romania.

926
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,350
(GRUNTS) My father was a tomato farmer.

927
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,073
Maybe I'll try that for a while.

928
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,670
Sounds a little boring
for a world traveler like you.

929
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,956
(CHUCKLES) Certainly hope so.

930
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,198
ED: An exorcism can be very dangerous.

931
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:25,591
Not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

932
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:28,832
Take Maurice Theriault,
his friends called him Frenchie.

933
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,639
He was a French-Canadian farmer.

934
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,757
Nothing more than
a third-grade education.

935
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,040
Yet, after he was possessed...

- (SNARLS)
- (CHOKING)

937
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,318
...spoke some of
the best Latin I'd ever heard.

938
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:44,680
And like that, an upside-down cross
started to appear from within his body.

939
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,719
ED: Which brings me to the three stages
of demonic activity.

940
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,032
Infestation, oppression, and possession.
