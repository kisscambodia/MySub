Okay, well,
why is Donna going over there?

52
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:51,952
I transferred
some of your cases.

53
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,121
Now, Donna has more energy.

54
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:54,723
- More energy?
- And more time.

55
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:57,058
She doesn't have the outside
responsibilities you have.

56
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,260

- She has support at home.

we all understand.

more time at home

63
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:16,844

talk to someone like Donna.

00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:22,217
I just mean that she knows me.

67
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:24,019
I've been with that family
for four years.

68
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:26,154
I've seen those kids grow up.
Patricia trusts me.

69

She knows that I'm a mom, too.

70
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,293
The job is to do
what's best for the kids.

71
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:31,825
Okay, okay, look.
Just keep the case.

72
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:33,861
Once you get done here,
check in with patrol.

73
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:36,296
- I don't need patrol.
- Take an officer.

74
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:38,168
That's not a request.

75
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:40,935
[officer] I'm sorry.

76
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:43,371

handle this myself, okay?

00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,239

How are you?

82
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,354
Are the boys home?

83
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:02,823
- Ma'am, open the door.
- No, that's okay.

84
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:04,758
Just give us a second.

85
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,195
Patricia, where are the boys?

86
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:09,029
They're somewhere safe, Anna.

[Anna] Oh.

88
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,433
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

89
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:14,301
but I might be your best bet
at clearing things up.

90
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:16,003
So why don't you let me in

91
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:19,275
and you can show me that
they're safe, like you said?

92
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:24,746
No, he doesn't even
have to come inside.

just let me in?

go in there alone?

How did that happen?

151
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,689
She did it.

152
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,423
Your mother did that to you?

153
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:04,491
[Tomas] No.

154
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:06,095
It wasn't her.

155
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:16,371
Your mother loves you.
You know that, right?

156

He's a <i>curandero.</i>

that may have
attached itself to it

303
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:22,221

What does it matter
what I believe?

307
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:30,799
It's what they believe.

308
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:33,033
And if they believe in that,

309
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:36,439
then surely
they believe in this.

310
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:40,509
Did you know the boys?

311
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:44,980
Yeah. I was their case worker.

312
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:52,285
Can I ask you
a question, Father?

00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:53,887
Yes.

314
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:56,523

[gasps softly]

316
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:02,966
I haven't heard that name
since I was a child.

The Weeping Woman.

318
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:10,105
She was known for her beauty.

319
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:15,876
The most beautiful woman
in that part of Mexico.

320
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:18,978
Then one day,
a rich and handsome <i>ranchero</i>

321
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
rode into her village.
[chuckles]

322
00:24:20,982 --> 00:24:23,851
<i>She set her sights on him.</i>

323
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:26,018

<i>They had two beautiful
children whom they treasured.</i>

325
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:33,427
But then, after a time,

326
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,533
she discovered him in the arms
of a younger woman.

327
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:40,434
What'd she do?

328
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:43,540
She took from him
what was most priceless.

329
00:24:45,274 --> 00:24:47,043
She murdered their children.

330
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:53,346
In a fit of jealous rage,
she drowned them in the river.

331
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:55,983
<i>After she realized
what she had done,</i>

332
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:58,651
- <i>she was consumed by guilt.</i>
- [sobbing]

333
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:01,420
She threw herself
into those same waters.

334
00:25:01,422 --> 00:25:04,056
Then is cursed
to roam the earth,

335
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:06,595
searching for children
to take their place.

336
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:10,300
Children are told to behave,

337
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:14,034
listen to their elders,

338
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:17,974
or <i>La Llorona</i> will come
and steal them away.

339
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:21,877
So it's a folktale?

340
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:26,916
To some.

341
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:32,554
Here.

342
00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:37,024
It has seen me through
many dark nights.

343
00:25:37,026 --> 00:25:38,492
May it do the same for you.

344
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:43,199
Oh, thank you but my husband
was the religious one, not me.

345
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:46,368
You don't
have to be religious

346
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:48,971
to have faith.

369
00:29:25,453 --> 00:29:27,089
Honey, what happened
to your arm?

370
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,725
I fell.

371
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:32,862
That's quite a fall.

372
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:36,465
Hey.

373
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:41,234
I know things are a little bit
hard right now.

374
00:29:41,236 --> 00:29:43,706
And I know that the world
sometimes seems scary.

375
00:29:45,873 --> 00:29:47,707
But I was thinking,

376
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:50,744
remember what
Daddy used to say?

377
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:53,583
About if you were scared
and he wasn't there?

378
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:56,649
He'd tell you
to hold onto to Misty

379
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:58,621
and you squeeze her
really tight.

380
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:01,755
Does it feel any better?

381
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:03,758
That feels
a little bit better, right?

382
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:09,398
What are you looking at?

383
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,667
[knock on door]

384
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:15,204
Coop's here.

385
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:25,648
Come on.

386
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:29,651
Come on, sweetie.

387
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:36,858
[thunder rumbling]

388
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:47,737
Rough day, guys?

389
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:51,673
Can we go watch TV?

390
00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:54,410
Sure.

391
00:30:59,648 --> 00:31:00,950
[sighs heavily]

392
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:06,189
[TV playing]

393
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,653
Um...

394
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:08,823
Cheers?

395
00:31:11,293 --> 00:31:12,792
It's been that kinda day, huh?

396
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,761
- Week.
- Month?

397
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:17,697
- Year.
- [chuckles]

398
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:19,466
I don't know.
They're hanging in.

399
00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:21,737
I think we need...

400
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:24,603
Time.

401
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:25,807
Yeah.

402
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:27,976
And the occasional takeout,

403
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:30,276
so thank you.

404
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:32,445
You're welcome.

405
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:33,513
Well, if you're not
in the mood

406
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:34,581
to talk personal problems,

407
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,518
how about professional ones?

408
00:31:36,951 --> 00:31:38,517
Oh, no. What?

409
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,690
It's about Patricia Alvarez.

410
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:43,990
We know that she had
some involvement

411
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:46,793
in her sons' deaths,
but she has a solid alibi.

412
00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:48,328
Several parishioners
at her church say

413
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,063
they saw her at the time
that her kids were taken.

414
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:51,163
Really?

415
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:54,668
You know her story.
Just take a look at the file.

416
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,471
Maybe you'll see
something I missed.

417
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,572
I would love to help you

418
00:31:59,574 --> 00:32:02,508
but she does not
want to see me.

419
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,476
Well, that's just it.

420
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:05,480
She's angry at you.

421
00:32:06,948 --> 00:32:07,813
And one of the first things

422
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:09,448
your husband
ever taught me is that...

423
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,386
Angry people love to talk.

424
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:26,796
[sighs]

425
00:33:58,759 --> 00:33:59,929

437
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:07,850
Chris.

438
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:12,787
What are you doing?

439
00:37:15,122 --> 00:37:16,124
Chris.

440
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:18,861
Hey.

441
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,895
You okay, honey?

442
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,332
Chris?

443
00:37:24,064 --> 00:37:25,833
Honey?

444
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:28,070
You all right?

445
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:30,902
You okay, honey?

446
00:37:30,904 --> 00:37:32,274

Honey. Hey.

452
00:37:55,397 --> 00:37:57,096
Come on.

453
00:37:57,098 --> 00:37:58,431
Hey, wake up.

454
00:37:58,433 --> 00:37:59,931
What happened?

455
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:01,234
You were sleepwalking, baby.

456
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:02,902
Oh, sweetie.

457
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:05,038
You were just sleepwalking.

458
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,406
It's okay.

459
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:07,873
Come on. Come on, baby.

460
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,178
Let's get you upstairs.
Let's go to sleep.

461

Come on.

462
00:38:11,413 --> 00:38:13,082

Is there someone in here?

466
00:39:14,274 --> 00:39:15,908
Because my husband is a cop

467
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,413
and he's gonna be home
any minute now.

468
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:32,093

Sam! Chris!

Kids, wake up!
Open the door!

Get out of my house!

- Mom?

480
00:40:25,846 --> 00:40:27,045
[Samantha] What happened?

[continues gasping]

482
00:40:32,152 --> 00:40:34,020
Nothing. Nothing.

Nothing, honey. Nothing.

484
00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:38,026
I'm sorry.
Come on in, honey.

Go on, go on.

[Samantha] Chris,
get your foot off of me.

I'm very sorry
about your loss.

I can't even imagine
how you must feel.

[scoffs]

498
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:02,310
I feel nothing.

499
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:05,413
Because I have felt the worst.

500
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:09,147
I am done.

501
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:11,252
I don't care
what they do to me.

502
00:42:13,553 --> 00:42:15,623
You should be sitting here
instead of me.

503
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:19,458
You killed my boys, not me.

00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,960
[speaks Spanish]

505
00:42:21,962 --> 00:42:23,596
Patricia,
you had them locked up.

506
00:42:23,598 --> 00:42:25,163
I had them hidden.

[speaks Spanish]

508
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:29,567

And now she has them!

[whispers] <i>Mis hijos.</i>

511
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:42,714
What happened to your arm?

00:42:42,716 --> 00:42:44,585
What happened to you,
Patricia?

Your children,

515
00:42:55,562 --> 00:42:57,131
have they heard her crying?

516
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:01,670
Have they felt
the sting of her tears?

517
00:43:03,538 --> 00:43:05,607
They will. Soon.

518

And she will come for them.

You know why?

520
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:14,348

No, Patricia...

522
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:19,217
You know, when my boys died,

523
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:22,754
I didn't pray to God
for their salvation.

524
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:26,294
Instead, I prayed to her.

526
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:30,228
I prayed,

527
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,665
and I prayed,
and I prayed to her

528
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,266
to give my children
back to me

529
00:43:34,268 --> 00:43:36,238

00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:11,283
What?

557
00:47:11,285 --> 00:47:12,717
The hospital called?

558
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:13,886
Yeah.

559
00:47:13,888 --> 00:47:15,556
Welfare check.

560
00:47:28,301 --> 00:47:31,338
[Donna] <i>Samantha,
how did you get those burns?</i>

561
00:47:39,647 --> 00:47:41,480
How about you, Chris?

562
00:47:41,482 --> 00:47:43,652
I told you, I fell.

563
00:47:44,518 --> 00:47:46,351
Is that true?

564
00:47:46,353 --> 00:47:47,689
Where was your mom?

565
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:54,692
Anna, you know
you can't be here.

566
00:47:54,694 --> 00:47:56,328
Oh, come on, Donna.
I wouldn't...

567
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,395
They're trying to protect you.

568
00:47:57,397 --> 00:47:58,931
They're telling you the truth.

569
00:47:58,933 --> 00:48:01,533
I would never hurt my kids.

570
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,335
She's right.

571
00:48:03,337 --> 00:48:04,739
You can't be here.

572
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,219
[Donna sighs]

573
00:48:20,453 --> 00:48:24,426
You may not believe this,
but I hate having to be here.

574
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,531
I promised your dad
I'd watch out for you guys.

575
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:33,598
So if you ever need anything,

576
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,936
just call me. Got it?

577
00:48:39,372 --> 00:48:42,007
We had to release
Patricia Alvarez.

578
00:48:42,009 --> 00:48:43,445
Didn't have enough
to charge her.

579
00:48:46,346 --> 00:48:48,249
Maybe she didn't do it.

580
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:50,452
What do you mean?

581
00:48:55,056 --> 00:48:57,459
I don't know. Never mind.

582
00:48:58,359 --> 00:48:59,725
Anna,

583
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:01,462
whatever's going on here,

584
00:49:01,995 --> 00:49:03,430
fix it.

585
00:49:13,741 --> 00:49:17,810
<i>Dad, for the first time
in my life, I'm in love.</i>

586
00:49:17,812 --> 00:49:18,976
<i>That's very serious.</i>

587
00:49:18,978 --> 00:49:20,112
[Anna] Hey.

588
00:49:20,114 --> 00:49:21,349
<i>And she loves me, Dad.</i>

589
00:49:25,986 --> 00:49:27,355
Chris...

590
00:49:30,056 --> 00:49:31,593
Can we talk?

591
00:49:35,895 --> 00:49:37,832
Honey, I need to know
what really happened.

592
00:49:44,904 --> 00:49:46,473
[water splashing]

593
00:50:11,899 --> 00:50:13,498
[Chris] <i>I saw a woman.</i>

594
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,703
In the house?

595
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:18,906
In Samantha's room.

596
00:50:20,174 --> 00:50:22,911
I thought it was Sam but...

597
00:50:25,946 --> 00:50:28,083
A woman in a white dress.

598
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:30,685
She was crying.

599
00:50:31,585 --> 00:50:33,455
She wants us.

600
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:37,558
She wants us to be hers.

601
00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:43,531
Ow. Mom, that hurts.

602
00:50:46,901 --> 00:50:48,103
Rinsing.

603
00:50:54,507 --> 00:50:55,944
You believe me?

604
00:50:57,944 --> 00:50:59,046
Yes.

605
00:50:59,647 --> 00:51:00,882
I do.

606
00:51:05,152 --> 00:51:06,888
[grunting]

607
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:08,956
[gasping heavily]

608
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,609
[muffled screaming]

609
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:32,813
[faint thudding]

610
00:51:36,517 --> 00:51:37,652
Sam?

611
00:51:43,056 --> 00:51:44,058
Sam?

612
00:51:49,529 --> 00:51:51,865
Sam! Sam!

613
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:54,067
Sam! Open the door! Sam!

614
00:51:55,102 --> 00:51:56,103
Sam!

615
00:51:56,837 --> 00:51:58,039
[grunts]

616
00:52:01,007 --> 00:52:02,743
[Samantha coughing]

617
00:52:03,611 --> 00:52:05,145
[gasping deeply]

618
00:52:09,817 --> 00:52:12,120
What happened?
What happened to you?

619
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:13,851
Honey.

620
00:52:13,853 --> 00:52:15,622
You okay?
What happened?

621
00:52:18,158 --> 00:52:19,160
Sam?

622
00:52:22,897 --> 00:52:24,165
[whimpering]

623
00:52:26,232 --> 00:52:27,533
Sam?

624
00:52:27,535 --> 00:52:28,569
[Chris] Mom.

625
00:52:29,136 --> 00:52:30,705
[stammers] Mom. Mom!

626
00:52:31,171 --> 00:52:32,703
Mom!

627
00:52:32,705 --> 00:52:33,839
- [screeching]
- [screaming]

628
00:52:33,841 --> 00:52:35,109
- [sizzling]
- [screaming]

629
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,243
[groans] Go!

630
00:52:38,245 --> 00:52:40,011
[Samantha continues screaming]

631
00:52:40,013 --> 00:52:41,915
Go! Run!

632
00:52:42,815 --> 00:52:43,982
Go!

633
00:52:43,984 --> 00:52:45,049
Run!

634
00:52:45,051 --> 00:52:46,754
[whimpers]

635
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:50,257
- [rumbling]
- [yelling]

636
00:52:53,192 --> 00:52:54,495
[door rattling]

637
00:52:55,895 --> 00:52:57,129
Run!

638
00:52:57,131 --> 00:52:58,266
Go!

639
00:52:58,799 --> 00:52:59,801
Run!

640
00:53:01,835 --> 00:53:03,705
- [whimpers]
- [rumbling stops]

641
00:53:22,723 --> 00:53:25,058
[Anna] I know it sounds
hard to believe.

642
00:53:29,129 --> 00:53:30,629
[Father Perez]
A few years ago,

643
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:34,766
I placed little stock
in legends, myths,

644
00:53:34,768 --> 00:53:36,971
things that go
bump in the night.

645
00:53:38,004 --> 00:53:39,172
But then

646
00:53:40,006 --> 00:53:41,842
there was an incident

647
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:44,946
with a doll.

648
00:53:50,984 --> 00:53:52,317
It opened my mind

649
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,589
to possibilities
out of the ordinary.

650
00:53:55,788 --> 00:53:57,057
Can you help us?

651
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:01,792
The Church works with people

652
00:54:01,794 --> 00:54:04,629
who specialize
in situations like this.

653
00:54:04,631 --> 00:54:05,897
Okay.

654
00:54:05,899 --> 00:54:09,836
But to get to them, we'd have
to go through the archdiocese.

655
00:54:11,337 --> 00:54:13,638
How long does that take?

656
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,344
At its best, several weeks
for a case to be approved.

657
00:54:22,315 --> 00:54:23,317
[Anna] No.

658
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:27,419
There may be another way.

659
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:30,792
It's unorthodox,
but he's local.

660
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:34,094
However,
if you choose this route,

661
00:54:35,428 --> 00:54:37,362
I must obey
the laws of the Church,

662
00:54:37,364 --> 00:54:40,431
and remove myself
from this process.

663
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:44,069
As I said,
his methods are unorthodox.

664
00:54:44,071 --> 00:54:46,237
And the Church, well,

665
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:49,373
the Church has their ways,
and he has his.

666
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:52,714
It's why he abandoned
the collar years ago.

667
00:54:53,446 --> 00:54:54,913
He used to be a priest.

668
00:54:54,915 --> 00:54:55,917
Yes.

669
00:54:58,252 --> 00:55:00,951
But now, he's a faith healer.

670
00:55:00,953 --> 00:55:02,853
A shaman who operates

671
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:05,727
on the fringes
of religion and science.

672
00:55:07,995 --> 00:55:10,395
A <i>curandero.</i>

673
00:55:10,397 --> 00:55:12,400
- [music playing on radio]
- [door bells jingling]

674
00:55:19,172 --> 00:55:21,042
Don't touch anything, okay?

675
00:55:23,176 --> 00:55:24,875
<i>Hola.</i> Excuse me.

676
00:55:24,877 --> 00:55:26,713
- Um...
- I've seen you before.

677
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:30,449
The Alvarez memorial.

678
00:55:30,451 --> 00:55:31,719
Yes?

679
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:34,819
Yes. I was her case worker.

680
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:37,321
Well, if you've come just to
gawk at my shop,

681
00:55:37,323 --> 00:55:40,127
I have more
important things to do.

682
00:55:41,261 --> 00:55:42,426
You know what,
I don't think that

683
00:55:42,428 --> 00:55:43,795
we're in the right spot.
I'm sorry.

684
00:55:43,797 --> 00:55:45,132
Come on, guys.

685
00:55:51,437 --> 00:55:52,439
Have you seen this before?

686
00:55:53,439 --> 00:55:54,505
Yes.

687
00:55:54,507 --> 00:55:55,743
What is it?

688
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,942
The Church can help you.

689
00:55:57,944 --> 00:56:00,981
No, no, no, please. The Church
sent us here, to you.

690
00:56:01,848 --> 00:56:05,385
This is Church business.

691
00:56:07,386 --> 00:56:08,922
Please.

692
00:56:19,265 --> 00:56:23,335
[Rafael] These are the marks
of <i>La Llorona.</i>

693
00:56:23,337 --> 00:56:25,273
You have seen her then?

694
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:30,942
[Anna] You ever seen her?

695
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:31,946
No.

696
00:56:33,446 --> 00:56:34,981
Not directly.

697
00:56:35,982 --> 00:56:37,984
But I have seen what she does.

698
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,486
What do we do?

699
00:56:41,488 --> 00:56:45,192
We are facing an evil
that has no bounds.

700
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:51,429
But she's not human. Right?

701
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:54,435
No. But she was,

702
00:56:56,169 --> 00:57:00,340
until her murderous vanity
consumed her.

703
00:57:01,308 --> 00:57:04,241
She's just a dark spirit.

704
00:57:04,243 --> 00:57:06,310
Unholy. Forsaken by God.

705
00:57:06,312 --> 00:57:08,279
Okay, that's it. I'm gonna
take them to a motel.

706
00:57:08,281 --> 00:57:09,415
Why?

707
00:57:09,417 --> 00:57:14,252
She's attached herself to
your family, not your house.

708
00:57:14,254 --> 00:57:17,225
If you move,
she will follow you.

709
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:20,928
What are we supposed
to do then?

710
00:57:28,835 --> 00:57:31,169
I don't think
that's gonna help.

711
00:57:31,171 --> 00:57:34,174
No. Not just this.

712
00:57:38,245 --> 00:57:39,046
At the memorial,

713
00:57:41,147 --> 00:57:44,415
I saw you speaking
with Father Perez.

714
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:46,419
He said that
you used to be a priest.

715
00:57:49,288 --> 00:57:51,424
My journey
began in the Church.

716
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:54,461
Yes.

717
00:57:57,263 --> 00:57:58,999
That was a long time ago.

718
00:58:03,437 --> 00:58:06,274
Take me to your home.
We must begin immediately.

719
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:14,712
We're done.

720
00:58:14,714 --> 00:58:18,016
I'm sorry, are you just gonna
rub eggs all over everything?

721
00:58:18,018 --> 00:58:20,221
You think it's silly,
don't you?

722
00:58:20,953 --> 00:58:22,355
Pretty much.

723
00:58:25,091 --> 00:58:26,259
Come with me.

724
00:58:28,261 --> 00:58:31,228
This ritual, <i>la limpia,</i>

725
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,567
is used to detect
the presence of evil.

726
00:58:38,205 --> 00:58:40,004
The bloodier the content,

727
00:58:40,006 --> 00:58:42,108
the greater the evil.

728
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,882
[chanting in Spanish]

729
00:59:14,341 --> 00:59:17,344
Oh, that's a trick.
I saw it on <i>Johnny Carson.</i>

730
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:21,982
Mom.

731
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,194
[all gasp]

732
00:59:36,228 --> 00:59:37,265
Ta-da.

733
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:40,300
Did you see that on <i>Carson?</i>

734
00:59:41,701 --> 00:59:42,904
No.

735
00:59:44,504 --> 00:59:46,107
[praying in Spanish]

736
00:59:50,176 --> 00:59:51,178
<i>Amen.</i>

737
00:59:56,015 --> 00:59:58,984
[Rafael in English]
<i>We all need to work together.</i>

738
00:59:58,986 --> 01:00:01,522
La Llorona
<i>thrives in darkness.</i>

739
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:03,524

741
01:00:25,712 --> 01:00:30,181
That cross was carved
from a tree in Mexico.

742
01:00:30,183 --> 01:00:32,116
It blooms with red blossoms

743
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:34,719
that make it look like
it's on fire.

[speaks Spanish]

745
01:00:39,058 --> 01:00:40,424
The fire tree.

746
01:00:40,426 --> 01:00:41,962
[in English] They say

747
01:00:42,495 --> 01:00:44,029
the fire trees wept

748
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:46,730
as <i>La Llorona</i>
drowned her children.

749
01:00:46,732 --> 01:00:49,567
As the only witness
to her sins,

750
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:52,373
they hold a special power
over her.

751
01:00:55,709 --> 01:00:57,178

What is that?

755
01:01:29,843 --> 01:01:32,076
[Rafael]
The tears of <i>La Llorona.</i>

756
01:01:32,078 --> 01:01:33,279
I've sanctified them.

757
01:01:33,647 --> 01:01:34,648
Why?

758
01:01:35,815 --> 01:01:37,417

760
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:03,440
Is that another ritual?

761
01:02:03,442 --> 01:02:06,147
Yes. Breakfast for dinner.

762
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,547
That was David's thing.

763
01:02:09,549 --> 01:02:12,350
Breakfast for dinner.
I used to always tease him

764
01:02:12,352 --> 01:02:13,585
it was 'cause cereal
was the only thing

765
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:14,520

that you've been through,

and what's to come.

769
01:02:22,696 --> 01:02:24,895
You don't seem very confident.

770
01:02:24,897 --> 01:02:27,732
I'm confident in God.

771
01:02:27,734 --> 01:02:30,435
Father Perez said you turned
your back on the Church.

772
01:02:30,437 --> 01:02:33,074
The Church? Yes.

773
01:02:33,772 --> 01:02:36,176
God? Never.

Watch the flames.

778
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,359
A steady flame tells us

779
01:02:55,361 --> 01:02:57,230
that our protective charms
are working.

780
01:02:58,431 --> 01:03:00,201
Is she coming?

781

She's searching.

789

For what?

790
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:39,239
