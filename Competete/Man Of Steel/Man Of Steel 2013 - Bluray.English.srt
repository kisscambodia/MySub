1
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,152
<i>Hurry!</i>

2
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:15,104
<i>Do you not understand?
Krypton's core is collapsing.</i>

3
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:18,672
We may only have a matter of weeks.
I warned you.

4
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,434
Harvesting the core was suicide.
It has accelerated...

5
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:25,409
- ...the process of implosion.
- Our energy reserves...

6
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,215
...were exhausted.
What would you have us do, El?

7
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,686
Look to the stars, like our ancestors did.

8
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,823
There are habitable worlds within reach.
We can begin by using the old outposts.

9
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:39,390
Are you seriously suggesting
that we evacuate the entire planet?

10
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:40,792
No.

11
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:42,690
Everybody here is already dead.

12
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,327
Give me control of the Codex.
I will ensure the survival of our race.

13
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:49,864
There is still hope.

14
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,631
I have held that hope in my hands.

15
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:09,785
This council has been disbanded.

16
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:12,025
On whose authority?

17
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:13,522
Mine.

18
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,867
The rest of you will be tried
and punished accordingly.

19
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:23,974
What are you doing, Zod?

20
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,160
- This is madness.
- What I should have done years ago.

21
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,847
These lawmakers, with their
endless debates...

22
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:31,461
...have lead Krypton to ruin.

23
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,079
And if your forces prevail...

24
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,981
- ...you'll be the leader of nothing.
- Then join me.

25
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:42,317
Help me save our race.
We'll start anew.

26
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:43,582
We'll sever...

27
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,591
...the degenerative bloodlines
that led us to this state.

28
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,095
And who will decide
which bloodlines survive, Zod?

29
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:52,798
You?

30
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,733
Don't do this, El.

31
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:59,441
The last thing I want
is for us to be enemies.

32
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,338
You have abandoned the principles
that bound us together.

33
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:03,688
You've taken up the sword...

34
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:06,042
...against your own people.

35
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,218
I will honor the man you once were, Zod...

36
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:12,021
...not this monster you've become.

37
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,556
Take him away.

38
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,464
<i>Sir? Is everything all right?</i>

39
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:25,797
Out of the way.

40
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,461
I said...

41
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:44,977
Get me Lara.

42
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:48,484
<i>Jor, behind you.</i>

43
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:54,386
Lara, you have to ready the launch.

44
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:56,292
I'll be with you as soon as I can.

45
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,474
H'Raka!

46
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,452
- Can you see the Codex?
<i>- It's just beneath the central hub, sir.</i>

47
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,779
<i>But I'm compelled to warn you.</i>

48
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:58,057
<i>Breaching the genesis chamber
is a Class-B crime...</i>

49
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:02,289
Nobody cares anymore, Kelex.
The world is about to come to an end.

50
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,226
<i>Jor-El, by the authority of General Zod...</i>

51
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,632
<i>...surrender the Codex.</i>

52
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:28,340
Ahhh!

53
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:51,465
Ahhh!

54
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:01,674
Easy, H'Raka.

55
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:23,667
Did you find a world?

56
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,372
- We have.
<i>- Orbiting a main sequence yellow star...</i>

57
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:28,706
<i>...just as you said it would.</i>

58
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,605
A young star.

59
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,643
His cells will drink its radiation.

60
00:08:36,774 --> 00:08:39,015
It's a seemingly intelligent population.

61
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:41,214
He'll be an outcast.

62
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:43,458
A freak.

63
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:45,690
They'll kill him.

64
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:47,162
How?

65
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,625
He'll be a god to them.

66
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:53,695
What if the ship doesn't make it?

67
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,960
He'll die out there...

68
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:58,404
...alone.

69
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:01,973
I can't do it.

70
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,577
I thought I could, but...

71
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,876
- Lara.
- ...now that he's here...

72
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:07,744
Krypton is doomed.

73
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:10,816
It's his only chance now.

74
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,079
It's our people's only hope.

75
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:15,752
What is it, Kelex?

76
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,794
<i>There five attack ships
converging from the east.</i>

77
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:20,760
<i>Citadel's defenses
are being scanned and evaluated.</i>

78
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:22,228
I'll upload the Codex.

79
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:23,898
No, wait.

80
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,364
Lara.

81
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,503
Just let me look at him.

82
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:34,399
We'll never get to see him walk.

83
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,145
Never hear him say our names.

84
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:45,586
But out there...

85
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:47,754
...amongst the stars...

86
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:50,615
...he will live.

87
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:49,981
Goodbye, my son.

88
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,946
Our hopes and dreams travel with you.

89
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,360
Concentrate fire on the main doors.

90
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:51,880
<i>Lady Lara.</i>

91
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:54,975
<i>- The phantom drives are coming online.</i>
- Proceed to ignition.

92
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,741
General.

93
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:00,387
We have identified an engine ignition
within the citadel.

94
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,757
A launch.

95
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:06,327
Hold this platform, commander.

96
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,276
I know you stole the Codex, Jor-El.

97
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,834
Surrender it...

98
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,069
...and I'll let you live.

99
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,240
This is a second chance
for all of Krypton...

100
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:30,850
...not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.

101
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,549
What have you done?

102
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:36,288
We've had a child, Zod.

103
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:38,458
A boy child.

104
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,720
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

105
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,394
And he will be free.

106
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,369
Free to forge his own destiny.

107
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,705
Heresy.

108
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:52,267
Destroy it.

109
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:02,307
Ah!

110
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,551
Lara...

111
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,995
...listen to me.

112
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,160
The Codex is Krypton's future.

113
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:54,869
Abort the launch.

114
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,820
No!

115
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:47,317
Your son, Lara...

116
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:50,223
...where have you sent him?

117
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:55,493
His name...

118
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,824
...is Kal...

119
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:59,331
...son of El.

120
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:04,770
And he's beyond your reach.

121
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:16,908
Bring that ship down.

122
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:26,726
Target locked.

123
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:39,963
<i>Lay down your weapons.</i>

124
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,135
<i>Your forces are surrounded.</i>

125
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,722
<i>General Zod...</i>

126
00:15:53,945 --> 00:15:56,721
<i>...for the crimes
of murder and high treason...</i>

127
00:15:56,948 --> 00:16:01,257
<i>...the Council has sentenced you
and your fellow</i> insurgents...

128
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,789
...to three hundred cycles
of somatic reconditioning.

129
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,399
Do you have any last words?

130
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,576
You won't kill us yourself!

131
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:15,770
You wouldn't sully your hands!
But you'll damn us...

132
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,006
...to a black hole for eternity!

133
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:21,506
Jor-El was right.

134
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,447
You're a pack of fools,
every last one of you.

135
00:16:26,344 --> 00:16:27,516
And you.

136
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:31,692
You believe your son is safe?

137
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,123
I will find him.

138
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:37,663
I will reclaim
what you have taken from us.

139
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:41,661
I will find him.

140
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,965
I will find him, Lara.

141
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:50,603
I will find him!

142
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:02,185
Argh!

143
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:35,342
<i>Lady Lara,
shouldn't you find refuge?</i>

144
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,721
There is no refuge, Kelor.

145
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:41,623
Jor-El was right.

146
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:45,559
This is the end.

147
00:18:57,495 --> 00:19:00,408
Make a better world than ours, Kal.

148
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:34,058
Watch it, dumb-ass!

149
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,628
Keep your eyes open
or you're gonna get squashed.

150
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:41,275
Where the hell did they find you,
greenhorn?

151
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,211
Let's get this trap in the air.

152
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:44,770
<i>Gentlemen, secure the deck.</i>

153
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,039
We just got a distress call
from a rig due west of us.

154
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:49,580
Secure the deck.

155
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,048
<i>All civilian boats, stand clear.</i>

156
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,754
<i>The sub-sea valves failed
and the rig is about to explode.</i>

157
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:01,556
Roger, Coast Guard.
What about the men left inside? Over.

158
00:21:01,585 --> 00:21:03,929
<i>- Forget them. They're dead.</i>
- Greenhorn...

159
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:06,225
...fetch me my binoculars.

160
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:09,001
Greenhorn.

161
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:21,172
This is the last of the oxygen. I don't
know how much longer we can hold out.

162
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:32,177
<i>This is Coast Guard 6510.</i>

163
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:34,640
<i>We're gonna make one more
pass then we get out of here.</i>

164
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:38,992
Wait, wait, wait.
I got some guys on the helipad.

165
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:39,856
<i>Right here!</i>

166
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:47,273
Come on, come on! Let's go! Let's go!

167
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:49,273
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

168
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,450
<i>Get that last guy loaded.</i>

169
00:22:01,545 --> 00:22:02,822
<i>We have got to go.</i>

170
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:04,519
Hey, let's go. What are you doing?

171
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:11,758
Go! Go!

172
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:14,959
Argh!

173
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,135
Argh!

174
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,897
<i>...when Kansas became a territory?</i>

175
00:22:54,097 --> 00:22:55,375
Clark.

176
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:58,267
Are you listening, Clark?

177
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,444
I asked if you could tell me who
first settled Kansas.

178
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,962
Are you all right, Clark?

179
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:30,510
Clark.

180
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:33,043
Clark.

181
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:37,210
Clark!

182
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,747
Clark, come out of there.

183
00:23:43,013 --> 00:23:44,356
Leave me alone.

184
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,952
Clark, I have called your mother.

185
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:49,355
Clark?

186
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:52,292
Ah!

187
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:53,457
I'm here.

188
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,704
Clark, honey, it's Mom.

189
00:23:58,095 --> 00:23:59,130
Will you open the door?

190
00:23:59,296 --> 00:24:01,457
<i>- What's wrong with him anyway?
- He's such a freak.</i>

191
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:02,340
<i>Crybaby.</i>

192
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,845
<i>His parents won't even let him play
with other kids.</i>

193
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:06,403
<i>I know.
What a weirdo.</i>

194
00:24:06,637 --> 00:24:07,479
Sweetie.

195
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:10,778
How can I help you if you won't let me in?

196
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,385
The world's too big, Mom.

197
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,248
Then make it small.

198
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:18,888
Just, um...

199
00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:23,222
...focus on my voice.

200
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:27,535
Pretend it's an island...

201
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:29,802
...out in the ocean.

202
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,236
Can you see it?

203
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:36,968
I see it.

204
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:40,304
Then swim towards it, honey.

205
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:55,427
What's wrong with me, Mom?

206
00:24:58,021 --> 00:24:59,523
Clark.

207
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,292
<i>Clark.</i>

208
00:25:29,953 --> 00:25:31,830
- Did you get everything I need?
- Yep.

209
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:33,728
Hold it, hold it.

210
00:26:23,574 --> 00:26:25,110
Hey, ass-wipe.

211
00:26:25,676 --> 00:26:27,349
What do you think? You see the game?

212
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:30,081
- Leave him alone, Pete.
- What are you, his girlfriend?

213
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:32,020
I wanna hear what he has to say.

214
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,055
Come on...

215
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:35,956
...dick-splash.

216
00:28:16,953 --> 00:28:18,154
<i>My son was there.</i>

217
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:20,195
<i>He was in the bus.</i>

218
00:28:20,257 --> 00:28:22,029
<i>He saw what Clark did.</i>

219
00:28:22,555 --> 00:28:23,892
<i>I know he did.</i>

220
00:28:24,394 --> 00:28:26,563
I'm sure what he
thought he saw was...

221
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:28,424
Was an act of God, Jonathan.

222
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:31,844
This was providence.

223
00:28:35,772 --> 00:28:38,043
Well, I think you're blowing
it little out of proportion.

224
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:39,430
No, I'm not.

225
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:41,351
Lana saw it too.

226
00:28:41,378 --> 00:28:42,379
And the Fordham boy.

227
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:44,052
And this isn't the first time...

228
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:46,027
...Clark's done something like this.

229
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,208
I just wanted to help.

230
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:06,409
I know you did, but we talked about this.

231
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,944
Right?

232
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:11,113
Right? We talked about this. You have...

233
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:15,055
Clark, you have to keep this side
of yourself a secret.

234
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:17,505
What was I supposed to do?

235
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:19,217
Just let them die?

236
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:25,598
Maybe.

237
00:29:27,524 --> 00:29:31,529
There's more at stake here than just our
lives, Clark, or the lives of those around us.

238
00:29:34,464 --> 00:29:35,875
When the world...

239
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,805
When the world finds out what you can do
it's gonna change everything. Our...

240
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,642
Our beliefs, our notions of...

241
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,615
...what it means to be human.
Everything.

242
00:29:46,877 --> 00:29:49,653
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?

243
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,120
She was scared, Clark.

244
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,692
Why?

245
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:58,796
People are afraid
of what they don't understand.

246
00:29:59,055 --> 00:29:59,965
Is she right?

247
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,935
Did God do this to me?

248
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:06,997
Tell me.

249
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,451
We found you in this.

250
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:28,662
We were sure the government
was gonna show up on our doorstep, but...

251
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:30,798
...no one ever came.

252
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:47,174
This was in that chamber with you.

253
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,284
I took it to a metallurgist
at Kansas State.

254
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:55,115
He said whatever it was made from
didn't even...

255
00:30:56,046 --> 00:30:58,822
Didn't even exist on the periodic table.

256
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:02,024
That's another way of saying...

257
00:31:02,085 --> 00:31:04,361
...that it's not from this world, Clark.

258
00:31:06,556 --> 00:31:08,130
And neither are you.

259
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:12,363
You're the answer, son.

260
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:14,907
You're the answer to
"Are we alone in the universe?"

261
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:18,312
I don't wanna be.

262
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:20,412
And I don't blame you, son.

263
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,212
It'd be a huge burden for anyone to bear.

264
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:26,687
But you're not just anyone, Clark,
and I have to believe that you were...

265
00:31:28,545 --> 00:31:30,388
That you were sent here for a reason.

266
00:31:31,648 --> 00:31:34,219
All these changes that you're
going through, one day...

267
00:31:34,484 --> 00:31:37,629
One day you're gonna think of them
as a blessing. When that day comes...

268
00:31:37,654 --> 00:31:39,399
...you have to make a choice.

269
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:43,728
A choice of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race or not.

270
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:48,169
Can't I just keep pretending I'm your son?

271
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,776
You are my son.

272
00:31:55,238 --> 00:31:57,240
But somewhere out there you've...

273
00:31:57,941 --> 00:32:01,184
You have another father too,
who gave you another name.

274
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:07,123
And he sent you here
for a reason, Clark.

275
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,360
And even if it takes you the rest of
your life, you owe it to yourself...

276
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,828
...to find out what that reason is.

277
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:27,079
<i>Bound by wild desire</i>

278
00:32:27,203 --> 00:32:30,241
<i>I fell into a ring of fire</i>

279
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,580
Wait a second.
Aren't you here fer the exercise?

280
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:34,389
No, there's a change in the plans.

281
00:32:34,444 --> 00:32:37,315
I guess somebody found something
strange on Ellesmere.

282
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,254
Aircom's making runs out there all week.

283
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:40,663
That rat hole?
You gotta be kidding me.

284
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:42,113
I know. It's crazy, right?

285
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,426
There'll be Americans are there too,
lots of them.

286
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,949
- Anything else?
- They're calling it an anomalous object.

287
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:49,465
- Whatever that means.
- Back off, Ludlow. I'm serious.

288
00:32:49,526 --> 00:32:51,735
- Oh, come on, Chrissy.
- Knock it off.

289
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,407
- Sit down.
- Let me go.

290
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,503
Hey.
Leave her alone, man.

291
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:01,343
Or what, tough guy?

292
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:03,472
Or...

293
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:05,743
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

294
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:10,081
I think I'll probably just leave
when I'm good and ready.

295
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:12,856
Ooh.

296
00:33:19,522 --> 00:33:21,195
Oh, there he is.

297
00:33:28,498 --> 00:33:30,500
It's not worth it, sweetie.

298
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,020
Hey, asshole,
don't forget your tip.

299
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:44,988
Strike.

300
00:34:35,432 --> 00:34:36,843
Thanks.

301
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:39,007
Hi.

302
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:40,942
Miss Lane.
How you doing?

303
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,411
- Good.
- Jed Eubanks, Arctic Cargo.

304
00:34:43,673 --> 00:34:45,914
How far to the station?

305
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:49,448
- Camp's just over the rise. I'll walk you over.
- Great.

306
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,920
Joe can take your bags. Joe.

307
00:34:52,182 --> 00:34:53,422
Help her out.

308
00:34:53,683 --> 00:34:56,186
Careful with those. They're heavy.

309
00:34:58,621 --> 00:35:00,259
I gotta confess, Miss Lane...

310
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:03,367
...I'm not a fan of the Daily Planet.

311
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,731
But those pieces you wrote when you were
embedded with the 1st Division were...

312
00:35:07,964 --> 00:35:09,807
Well, they were pretty impressive.

313
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:14,037
Well, what can I say? I get writer's block
if I'm not wearing a flak jacket.

314
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:20,744
<i>Miss Lane.</i>

315
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:23,817
I'm Colonel Hardy, U.S. Northcom.
Dr. Emil Hamilton...

316
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,984
...from DARPA.

317
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,420
- You're early.
- Hi.

318
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:28,128
We were expecting you tomorrow.

319
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,830
Which is why I showed up today.

320
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:33,861
Look, let's get one thing straight,
guys, okay?

321
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,667
The only reason I'm here
is because we're on Canadian soil...

322
00:35:36,693 --> 00:35:40,140
...and the appellate court overruled
your injunction to keep me away.

323
00:35:40,663 --> 00:35:43,002
So if we're done measuring dicks...

324
00:35:43,066 --> 00:35:45,410
...can you have your people
show me what you found?

325
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,191
<i>NASA's EOS satellites...</i>

326
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:51,213
...pinged the anomaly first.

327
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,120
The ice shelf plays hell
on the echo soundings.

328
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:55,250
But there's definitely
something down there.

329
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:57,154
A submarine, maybe?
Soviet-era?

330
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,784
Doubtful. That's 300 meters.

331
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:01,996
Considerably larger than anything
we know they built back then.

332
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:03,692
But here's the spooky part.

333
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:07,167
The ice surrounding the object...

334
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:10,495
...it's nearly twenty thousand years old.

335
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:13,203
<i>Miss Lane?</i>

336
00:36:14,164 --> 00:36:15,438
Try not to wander.

337
00:36:15,665 --> 00:36:18,771
Temperatures drop to minus 40
at night around here.

338
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,778
We couldn't find your body
till after spring.

339
00:36:24,274 --> 00:36:25,776
And there you go.

340
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:30,524
What if I need to tinkle?

341
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:33,152
There's a bucket in the corner.

342
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,523
Where the hell are you going?

343
00:39:18,848 --> 00:39:20,225
Hello?

344
00:40:55,711 --> 00:40:58,817
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right. It's all right.

345
00:41:13,129 --> 00:41:15,006
You're hemorrhaging internally...

346
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,642
...and if I don't cauterize this bleed...

347
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:19,472
How can...?

348
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:22,272
I can do things that other people can't.

349
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,410
Now hold my hand.

350
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:26,811
This is gonna hurt.

351
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,443
<i>What Colonel Hardy
and his team surmised...</i>

352
00:42:30,473 --> 00:42:31,975
<i>...was a Soviet-era submarine...</i>

353
00:42:32,642 --> 00:42:35,088
<i>...was actually something
much more exotic.</i>

354
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:39,190
<i>An isotope analysis of the surrounding
ice bores suggests that an object...</i>

355
00:42:39,415 --> 00:42:43,261
<i>...had been trapped in the glacier
for over 18, 000 years.</i>

356
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,055
<i>As fur my rescuer?</i>

357
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:47,699
<i>He disappeared during
the object's departure.</i>

358
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,502
<i>A background check revealed
that his work history...</i>

359
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,631
<i>...and identity had been falsified.</i>

360
00:42:53,062 --> 00:42:55,139
<i>The questions raised by my rescuer's...</i>

361
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,641
<i>existence are frightening
to contemplate...</i>

362
00:42:57,666 --> 00:42:59,804
<i>...but I also know what I saw.</i>

363
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:03,607
"And I have arrived
at the inescapable conclusion...

364
00:43:03,673 --> 00:43:05,675
...that the object and its occupant...

365
00:43:05,908 --> 00:43:07,854
...did not originate on Earth."

366
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:12,690
I can't print this, Lois.
You might have hallucinated half of it.

367
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,220
What about the contractors
who corroborated...

368
00:43:15,251 --> 00:43:18,425
- ...my story?
- The Pentagon is denying that there was a ship.

369
00:43:18,488 --> 00:43:20,831
Of course they are.
They're supposed to do it.

370
00:43:20,857 --> 00:43:22,359
It's the Pentagon.

371
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,598
Perry, come on,
it's me we're talking about.

372
00:43:24,627 --> 00:43:27,301
- I'm a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter.
- Then act like it.

373
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,702
- Print it or I walk.
- You can't.

374
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,967
You're under contract.

375
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:37,241
I'm not running a story
about aliens walking among us.

376
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,316
Never gonna happen.

377
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:50,562
That's a Scotch, straight-up, for the lady.

378
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,341
I'm sending you
the original article.

379
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,635
My editor won't print it,
but if it happen leaked online...

380
00:43:55,858 --> 00:43:56,966
Got it.

381
00:43:56,993 --> 00:43:59,639
But didn't you once describe my site...

382
00:43:59,662 --> 00:44:02,872
...as a creeping cancer of falsehoods?

383
00:44:03,065 --> 00:44:06,236
I stand by my words, Woodburn,
but I want this story out there.

384
00:44:06,301 --> 00:44:07,473
Why?

385
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:11,449
Because I want my mystery man
to know I know the truth.

386
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,768
<i>Recursive diagnostics complete.</i>

387
00:44:28,591 --> 00:44:30,798
<i>Guiding presence authenticated.</i>

388
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:33,598
<i>All systems operational.</i>

389
00:44:45,675 --> 00:44:49,623
To see you standing there
having grown into an adult...

390
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:53,990
If only Lara could have witnessed this.

391
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,023
Who are you?

392
00:44:57,019 --> 00:44:58,999
I am your father, Kal.

393
00:45:00,356 --> 00:45:02,233
Or at least a shadow of him.

394
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:04,466
His consciousness.

395
00:45:06,228 --> 00:45:09,334
My name was Jor-El.

396
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,639
And Kal?

397
00:45:16,872 --> 00:45:18,078
That's my name.

398
00:45:18,974 --> 00:45:20,741
Kal-El.

399
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,008
It is.

400
00:45:22,878 --> 00:45:24,915
I have so many questions.

401
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,254
Where do I come from?

402
00:45:30,986 --> 00:45:32,863
Why did you send me here?

403
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,566
You came from Krypton.

404
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,265
A world with a much harsher environment
than Earths.

405
00:45:46,068 --> 00:45:47,706
Long ago...

406
00:45:47,937 --> 00:45:50,178
...in an era of expansion...

407
00:45:50,406 --> 00:45:53,615
...our race spread out through the stars...

408
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,584
...seeking new worlds to settle upon.

409
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:01,217
This scout ship was
one of thousands launched into the void.

410
00:46:03,786 --> 00:46:06,392
We built outposts on other planets...

411
00:46:06,622 --> 00:46:10,365
Musing great machines to reshape
environments to our needs.

412
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:16,566
For 100,000 years,
our civilization ﬂourished...

413
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,102
...accomplishing wonders.

414
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,908
What happened?

415
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,979
Artificial population control
was established.

416
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:32,318
The outposts on space exploration
were abandoned.

417
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,486
We exhausted our natural resources.

418
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:39,956
As a result,
our planet's core became unstable.

419
00:46:42,224 --> 00:46:44,761
Eventually, our military leader...

420
00:46:44,994 --> 00:46:46,673
...General Zod,

421
00:46:46,699 --> 00:46:48,833
...attempted a coup.

422
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:53,006
But by then it was too late.

423
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,910
Your mother and I foresaw
the coming calamity...

424
00:46:57,139 --> 00:46:59,949
...and we took certain steps
to ensure your survival.

425
00:47:02,011 --> 00:47:03,649
This is a genesis chamber,...

426
00:47:04,513 --> 00:47:07,653
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this.

427
00:47:07,917 --> 00:47:11,626
Every child was designed to fulfill
a pre-determined role in our society...

428
00:47:11,854 --> 00:47:12,896
...as a worker...

429
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:16,095
...a warrior, a leader and so on.

430
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:19,602
Your mother and I believed Krypton
lost something precious.

431
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:22,036
The element of choice, of chance.

432
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:24,604
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something...

433
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:27,170
...other than what society
had intended for him or her?

434
00:47:29,004 --> 00:47:31,610
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

435
00:47:32,374 --> 00:47:34,376
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

436
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,123
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

437
00:47:38,214 --> 00:47:40,888
That's why we risked so much to save you.

438
00:47:42,017 --> 00:47:43,462
Why didn't you come with me?

439
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,730
We couldn't, Kal.

440
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:52,232
No matter how much
we wanted to.

441
00:47:52,728 --> 00:47:54,730
No matter how much we loved you.

442
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,075
Your mother, Lara, and I...

443
00:47:57,132 --> 00:48:00,238
...were a product of the failures
of our world as much as Zod was...

444
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,176
...tied to its fate.

445
00:48:02,404 --> 00:48:04,475
- So I'm alone.
- No.

446
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:09,883
You're as much a child of Earth now
as you are of Krypton.

447
00:48:10,145 --> 00:48:13,319
You can embody the best of both worlds.

448
00:48:13,549 --> 00:48:17,190
The dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

449
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:24,705
The people of Earth
are different from us, it's true.

450
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:27,674
But, ultimately,
I believe that's a good thing.

451
00:48:27,797 --> 00:48:30,243
They won't necessarily
make the same mistakes we did.

452
00:48:30,766 --> 00:48:32,746
Not if you guide them, Kal.

453
00:48:34,236 --> 00:48:36,273
Not if you give them hope.

454
00:48:39,775 --> 00:48:41,948
That's what this symbol means.

455
00:48:42,678 --> 00:48:45,022
The symbol of the house of El
means hope.

456
00:48:45,247 --> 00:48:47,750
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief...

457
00:48:47,817 --> 00:48:51,731
...in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

458
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,092
That's what you can bring them.

459
00:49:15,277 --> 00:49:17,120
<i>Why am I so different from them?</i>

460
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,083
<i>Earth's sun is younger and brighter
than Krypton's was.</i>

461
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:25,163
<i>Your cells have drunken its radiation...</i>

462
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:29,426
<i>...strengthening your muscles,
your skin, your senses.</i>

463
00:49:29,959 --> 00:49:34,164
<i>Earth's gravity is weaker,
yet its atmosphere is more nourishing.</i>

464
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:38,268
<i>You've grown stronger here
than I ever could have imagined.</i>

465
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,304
<i>The only way to know how strong...</i>

466
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:44,310
<i>...is to keep testing your limits.</i>

467
00:50:03,092 --> 00:50:04,163
Uhh!

468
00:50:05,888 --> 00:50:07,888
Ha... ha.

469
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,310
Uh... Oh.

470
00:50:14,537 --> 00:50:15,811
Whoa!

471
00:50:36,558 --> 00:50:40,563
<i>You will give the people of Earth
an ideal to strive towards.</i>

472
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:44,040
<i>They'll race behind you.</i>

473
00:50:44,299 --> 00:50:45,676
<i>They will stumble.</i>

474
00:50:45,901 --> 00:50:47,039
<i>They will fall.</i>

475
00:50:47,302 --> 00:50:49,009
<i>But in time...</i>

476
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:53,179
<i>...they will join you in the sun, Kal.</i>

477
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,384
<i>In time...</i>

478
00:50:56,712 --> 00:50:59,618
<i>you will help them
accomplish wonders.</i>

479
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:25,678
<i>How do you find someone who has
spent</i> a <i>lifetime covering his tracks?</i>

480
00:52:26,368 --> 00:52:27,872
<i>You start with the urban legends...</i>

481
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,980
<i>- ...that have sprung up in his wake.</i>
- Hey, that's Joe.

482
00:52:30,006 --> 00:52:31,417
<i>All of the friends of a friend...</i>

483
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:33,843
<i>- ...who claimed to have seen him.</i>
- He worked here for few minutes.

484
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:36,376
<i>For some
he was a guardian angel.</i>

485
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:38,278
<i>For others, a cipher,...</i>

486
00:52:38,279 --> 00:52:40,054
<i>...a ghost who never quite fit in.</i>

487
00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:43,090
Well, I was saying we were
coming towards the oil rig.

488
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:47,258
<i>As you work your way back in time,
the stories begins to form pattern.</i>

489
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,260
I'm looking for a Pete Ross.
Do you know him?

490
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,535
Yeah, he works at the IHOP.
If you go down the road...

491
00:52:54,263 --> 00:52:55,468
Pete Ross?

492
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,508
I'd like to talk to you about an accident
that occured when you were younger.

493
00:53:00,769 --> 00:53:03,272
A school bus that went into the river.

494
00:53:08,677 --> 00:53:10,782
Dusty.
Shh-shh-shh.

495
00:53:11,046 --> 00:53:12,116
Mrs. Kent?

496
00:53:13,048 --> 00:53:15,194
<i>I'm Lois Lane.
I'm from the Daily Planet.</i>

497
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:16,050
I'm...

498
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:16,791
Quiet.

499
00:53:18,387 --> 00:53:21,857
I'm from the Daily Planet
and I'd like to talk to you about your son.

500
00:53:39,975 --> 00:53:43,980
I figured if I turned over enough stones
you'd eventually find me.

501
00:53:49,551 --> 00:53:51,034
Where are you from?

502
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,398
What are you doing here?
Let me tell your story.

503
00:53:54,423 --> 00:53:57,363
What if I don't want my story told?

504
00:53:57,426 --> 00:53:59,201
It's going to come out eventually.

505
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:03,100
Somebody's going to get a photograph
or figure out where you live.

506
00:54:03,165 --> 00:54:04,729
Then I'll just disappear again.

507
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:06,337
The only way you could
disappear for good...

508
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:10,373
...is to stop helping people altogether,
and I sense that's not an option for you.

509
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:18,548
My father believed that if the world
found out who I really was...

510
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:21,850
...they'd reject me...

511
00:54:22,284 --> 00:54:23,922
...out of fear.

512
00:54:25,954 --> 00:54:28,025
<i>I'm tired of safe.</i>

513
00:54:28,257 --> 00:54:30,362
I just wanna do something useful
with my life.

514
00:54:30,592 --> 00:54:33,398
So farming, feeding people.
That's not useful?

515
00:54:33,428 --> 00:54:34,388
I didn't say that.

516
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:36,870
Our family's been farming
for five generations.

517
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,810
Your family, not mine.

518
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:42,048
I don't even know why I'm listening to you.
You're not my dad.

519
00:54:42,271 --> 00:54:43,848
You're just some guy
who found me in a field.

520
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,078
Clark.

521
00:54:47,442 --> 00:54:49,115
It's all right, Martha.

522
00:54:50,946 --> 00:54:53,051
He's right. Clark has a point.

523
00:54:53,615 --> 00:54:54,650
We're not your parents.

524
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,259
But we've been doing the best we can.

525
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,899
And we've been making this up
as we go along, so maybe...

526
00:55:02,324 --> 00:55:04,736
Maybe our best
isn't good enough anymore.

527
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:12,002
Look, Dad...

528
00:55:12,067 --> 00:55:13,512
Hold on.

529
00:55:33,255 --> 00:55:34,962
Go for the overpass.

530
00:55:36,758 --> 00:55:37,862
Go for the overpass!

531
00:55:40,195 --> 00:55:41,833
Take cover! Take cover!

532
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:44,475
- Over there. Just follow them.
- Take cover.

533
00:55:48,203 --> 00:55:49,675
- Hey.
- She's stuck.

534
00:55:53,942 --> 00:55:55,819
Hank's still in the car.

535
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:57,680
Hank's in the car.

536
00:55:58,547 --> 00:56:00,686
- I'll get him, I'll get him.
- No, no.

537
00:56:01,216 --> 00:56:03,457
Get your mom to the overpass.

538
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,846
Hank! Hank! Come!

539
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:34,153
- Jonathan!
- It's okay, it's okay.

540
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:56,215
- Jonathan!
- Mom, stay here.

541
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:24,733
Dad!

542
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:30,141
<i>I let my father die because I trusted him.</i>

543
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,953
Because he was convinced
that I had to wait.

544
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,883
That the world was not ready.

545
00:57:39,614 --> 00:57:41,252
What do you think?

546
00:57:46,154 --> 00:57:47,792
You better watch out, Lois.

547
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,600
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.

548
00:57:50,826 --> 00:57:52,553
He knows you're Woodburn's
anonymous source...

549
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:54,928
...and he cannot wait to rip you
a new one.

550
00:57:56,965 --> 00:57:58,410
Oh, look at her. Ha, ha, ha.

551
00:58:00,402 --> 00:58:02,939
I told you not to run with this,
and what do you do?

552
00:58:02,971 --> 00:58:05,774
You let Woodburn just shotgun it
all over the Internet.

553
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:09,020
Now the publishers want me
to sue you.

554
00:58:09,077 --> 00:58:12,120
Well, if it makes a difference,
I'm dropping it.

555
00:58:12,181 --> 00:58:13,682
Whoa, just like that?

556
00:58:13,815 --> 00:58:14,816
Yep.

557
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:16,891
What happened to your leads?

558
00:58:17,152 --> 00:58:19,792
They didn't pan out.
The story is smoke.

559
00:58:19,821 --> 00:58:22,467
Or perhaps it just didn't get
the traction you hoped it would?

560
00:58:24,326 --> 00:58:25,168
Two weeks leave...

561
00:58:25,227 --> 00:58:27,231
...no pay, that's your penance.

562
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,968
You try something like this again...

563
00:58:29,197 --> 00:58:30,870
- ...you're done here.
- Fine.

564
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,841
No, let's make it three weeks
since you're so willing to agree with me.

565
00:58:33,902 --> 00:58:35,804
- Perry.
- No, no. Don't. Don't.

566
00:58:37,272 --> 00:58:38,945
I believe you saw something, Lois.

567
00:58:39,441 --> 00:58:42,745
But not for a moment do I believe
that your leads just went cold.

568
00:58:42,777 --> 00:58:46,281
So whatever your reasons are
for dropping it...

569
00:58:47,215 --> 00:58:49,258
...I think you're doing the right thing.

570
00:58:49,618 --> 00:58:50,858
Why?

571
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:55,861
Can you imagine how people
on this planet would react...

572
00:58:56,486 --> 00:58:58,086
if...

573
00:58:58,126 --> 00:59:01,573
...they knew there was
someone like this out there?

574
00:59:19,614 --> 00:59:20,615
Go get him.

575
00:59:27,456 --> 00:59:29,294
Well, look at you.

576
00:59:46,241 --> 00:59:48,050
A reporter came by here.

577
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,851
She's a friend. Don't worry.

578
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,923
Oh.

579
00:59:53,848 --> 00:59:54,724
Mom.

580
00:59:55,483 --> 00:59:57,224
What'?

581
00:59:58,086 --> 01:00:00,623
- I found them.
- Who?

582
01:00:01,456 --> 01:00:02,958
My parents.

583
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,468
My People.

584
01:00:06,361 --> 01:00:09,570
I know where I come from now.

585
01:00:10,966 --> 01:00:12,240
Wow.

586
01:00:13,301 --> 01:00:15,076
That's wonderful.

587
01:00:16,938 --> 01:00:19,384
I'm so happy for you, Clark.

588
01:00:28,216 --> 01:00:30,753
- What?
- It's nothing.

589
01:00:33,455 --> 01:00:36,602
When you were a baby I used to lay
by your crib at night...

590
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:39,003
...listening to you breathe.

591
01:00:40,061 --> 01:00:41,665
It was hard for you.

592
01:00:42,897 --> 01:00:44,274
You struggled.

593
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:46,342
And I worried all the time.

594
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,444
You worried the truth would come out.

595
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:51,177
No.

596
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,746
The truth about you
is beautiful.

597
01:00:55,176 --> 01:00:58,623
We saw that the moment
we laid eyes on you.

598
01:01:00,915 --> 01:01:04,920
We knew that one day,
the whole world would see that.

599
01:01:07,355 --> 01:01:08,993
I'm just...

600
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,995
I'm worried they'll take you away from me.

601
01:01:13,928 --> 01:01:16,306
I'm not going anywhere, Mom.

602
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:19,635
I promise.

603
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,013
General Swanwick, sir.

604
01:01:28,276 --> 01:01:32,019
What am I looking at, doc?
Comet? Asteroid?

605
01:01:33,181 --> 01:01:37,186
Comets don't make
course corrections, general.

606
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:43,993
Wanted you to see this before some amateur
with a telescope creates a worldwide panic.

607
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,037
The ship appears to have...

608
01:01:47,095 --> 01:01:49,837
...inserted itself into
a lunar synchronous orbit...

609
01:01:50,298 --> 01:01:52,471
...though I have no idea why.

610
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:55,745
Have you tried...
communicating with it?

611
01:01:56,004 --> 01:02:00,009
Well, they haven't responded as of yet.

612
01:02:01,076 --> 01:02:03,319
I'm just speculating,

613
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:05,306
but I think whoever
saw at the helm of that thing...

614
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,850
...is looking to make a dramatic entrance.

615
01:02:14,323 --> 01:02:16,803
Does anybody know
where we keep the toner catridges?

616
01:02:17,158 --> 01:02:19,069
- What's going on?
- It's all over the news.

617
01:02:19,727 --> 01:02:21,673
You gotta see this.

618
01:02:48,256 --> 01:02:49,758
Clark.

619
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:51,263
Yeah?

620
01:02:51,526 --> 01:02:52,869
I'm coming.

621
01:02:53,194 --> 01:02:55,395
<i>This is a breaking news.
An unidentified...</i>

622
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:39,176
<i>You are not alone.</i>

623
01:03:40,842 --> 01:03:43,186
<i>You are not alone.</i>

624
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,354
<i>You are not alone.</i>

625
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:50,979
<i>You are not alone.</i>

626
01:03:53,021 --> 01:03:55,627
<i>You are not alone.</i>

627
01:04:21,049 --> 01:04:22,569
It's coming in on the RSS feeds.

628
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,694
<i>You are not alone.</i>

629
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,357
It's on my phone too.

630
01:04:29,524 --> 01:04:31,970
<i>My name is General Zod.</i>

631
01:04:33,795 --> 01:04:36,571
<i>I come from a world far from yours.</i>

632
01:04:37,966 --> 01:04:42,371
<i>I have journeyed across
an ocean of stars to reach you.</i>

633
01:04:44,072 --> 01:04:48,077
<i>For some time, your world
has sheltered one of my citizens.</i>

634
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:51,919
<i>I request that you return
this individual...</i>

635
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,319
<i>...to my custody.</i>

636
01:04:54,549 --> 01:04:58,554
<i>For reasons unknown,
he has chosen to keep his existence...</i>

637
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,663
<i>...a secret from you.</i>

638
01:05:01,723 --> 01:05:04,897
<i>He will have made efforts to blend in.</i>

639
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:07,266
<i>He will look like you.</i>

640
01:05:07,896 --> 01:05:10,502
<i>But he is not one of you.</i>

641
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,542
<i>To those of you who may know...</i>

642
01:05:13,568 --> 01:05:15,570
<i>...of his current location.</i>

643
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,574
<i>Fate of your planet...</i>

644
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,514
<i>...rests in your hands.</i>

645
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:25,139
<i>To Kal-El, I say this.</i>

646
01:05:27,682 --> 01:05:30,356
<i>Surrender within 24 hours...</i>

647
01:05:34,022 --> 01:05:37,503
<i>...or watch this world
suffer the consequences.</i>

648
01:05:41,529 --> 01:05:42,200
Ah!

649
01:05:52,374 --> 01:05:54,817
<i>We hardly know anything
about him, isn't that right?</i>

650
01:05:54,976 --> 01:05:57,178
<i>If he truly means us no harm...</i>

651
01:05:57,212 --> 01:06:00,152
<i>...then he'll tum himself into his people
and face the consequences.</i>

652
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:03,618
<i>And if he won't do that
then maybe we should.</i>

653
01:06:03,852 --> 01:06:06,433
<i>The Daily Planet's Lois Lane
knows who this guy is.</i>

654
01:06:06,455 --> 01:06:08,565
<i>And I think she's the one we should
be questioning.</i>

655
01:06:08,657 --> 01:06:11,399
<i>- Hold on. You're saying Lois Lane...</i>
- Hello?

656
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:14,563
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.

657
01:06:14,796 --> 01:06:17,306
For once I actually agree with Woodburn.
Have you seen him?

658
01:06:17,332 --> 01:06:20,443
<i>- Do you know where he is?</i>
- No. Even if I did, I wouldn't say.

659
01:06:20,502 --> 01:06:24,376
The entire world
is being threatened here.

660
01:06:24,505 --> 01:06:26,143
<i>This is not time for you to fall...</i>

661
01:06:26,174 --> 01:06:28,518
<i>...back on journalistic integrity.</i>

662
01:06:28,976 --> 01:06:30,455
<i>This is serious, Lois.</i>

663
01:06:30,678 --> 01:06:33,659
<i>The FBI is here. They're throwing around
words like "treason."</i>

664
01:06:33,681 --> 01:06:35,354
I gotta go.

665
01:06:51,499 --> 01:06:52,842
FBI! Hands up!

666
01:06:53,101 --> 01:06:54,876
Drop the bag. Now!

667
01:07:01,776 --> 01:07:05,036
<i>Regarding the visitors themselves
we know very little at this point.</i>

668
01:07:05,078 --> 01:07:07,524
<i>According to government official's
time spoken to.</i>

669
01:07:07,581 --> 01:07:09,861
<i>The visitors do not
represent a threat...</i>

670
01:07:09,884 --> 01:07:12,057
<i>...despite the ominous tone
of their message.</i>

671
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,623
<i>Then of course there's the question
on everyone's mind:</i>

672
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:18,668
<i>Who is this Kal-El person?
Does he actually exist?</i>

673
01:07:18,893 --> 01:07:21,567
<i>How could he have remained
hidden from us for so long?</i>

674
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,508
Come on, Kent.

675
01:07:33,975 --> 01:07:35,579
Come on. Fight back.

676
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:37,414
Get up, Kent.

677
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,892
So is that it?

678
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:44,152
Is that all you've got?

679
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,322
Come on, Kent.

680
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:49,733
Come on!

681
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:19,691
Did they hurt you?

682
01:08:20,955 --> 01:08:22,366
You know they can't.

683
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:25,603
That's not what I meant.
I meant, are you all right?

684
01:08:26,995 --> 01:08:29,705
I wanted to hit that kid.
I really wanted to hit him so bad.

685
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:31,610
I know you did. I mean...

686
01:08:31,866 --> 01:08:34,574
...part of me even wanted you to,
but then what?

687
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:36,941
Make you feel any better?

688
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:44,012
You just have to decide what kind of man
you want to grow up to be, Clark. Because...

689
01:08:44,278 --> 01:08:48,387
...whoever that man is,
good character or bad, he's...

690
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:51,556
He's gonna change the world.

691
01:08:56,891 --> 01:08:58,512
<i>What's on your mind?</i>

692
01:09:03,898 --> 01:09:05,172
I don't know where to start.

693
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,404
Wherever you want.

694
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:11,675
That ship that appeared last night.

695
01:09:13,007 --> 01:09:14,816
I'm the one they're looking for.

696
01:09:19,313 --> 01:09:20,815
Do you know...

697
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:22,754
...why they want you?

698
01:09:22,984 --> 01:09:25,590
No.
But this General Zod...

699
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:29,825
...even if I surrender, there's no
guarantee he'll keep his word, but...

700
01:09:30,091 --> 01:09:34,096
...if there's a chance I can save Earth
by turning myself in...

701
01:09:35,696 --> 01:09:36,834
...shouldn't I take it?

702
01:09:38,332 --> 01:09:40,209
What does your gut tell you?

703
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:42,642
Zod can't be trusted.

704
01:09:45,273 --> 01:09:46,843
The problem is...

705
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:50,481
...I'm not sure the people of Earth
can be either.

706
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:01,467
Sometimes you have to take
a leap of faith first.

707
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:05,094
The trust part comes later.

708
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:31,958
All right.
You've got our attention.

709
01:10:32,253 --> 01:10:33,254
What is it you want?

710
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:35,330
I would like to speak to Lois Lane.

711
01:10:35,556 --> 01:10:37,196
What makes you think she's here?

712
01:10:37,758 --> 01:10:39,829
Don't play games with me, general.

713
01:10:40,061 --> 01:10:44,066
I'll surrender, but only if you
guarantee Lois's freedom.

714
01:10:54,175 --> 01:10:56,121
<i>Why are you surrendering to Zod?</i>

715
01:10:57,345 --> 01:11:00,952
I'm surrendering to mankind.
There's a difference.

716
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:04,029
You let them handcuff you?

717
01:11:04,752 --> 01:11:07,198
Wouldn't be much of a surrender
if I resisted.

718
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:11,326
And if it makes them feel
more secure, then...

719
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:13,635
...then all the better for it.

720
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,837
What's the S stand for?

721
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:24,440
It's not an S.

722
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,977
On my world it means hope.

723
01:11:29,443 --> 01:11:32,947
Well, here, it's an S.

724
01:11:34,982 --> 01:11:36,552
How about...

725
01:11:40,888 --> 01:11:41,889
...Super...

726
01:11:42,123 --> 01:11:43,158
<i>Sir?</i>

727
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:46,769
- Hi, my name is Dr. E...
<i>- Emil Hamilton.</i>

728
01:11:46,794 --> 01:11:49,975
<i>I know, I can see your ID tag
in your breast pocket.</i>

729
01:11:50,231 --> 01:11:52,768
Along with a half-eaten roll of
wint o green Life-savers.

730
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,778
<i>I can also see the soldiers
in the next room...</i>

731
01:11:56,003 --> 01:11:58,313
<i>...preparing that tranquilizing agent
of yours.</i>

732
01:11:58,572 --> 01:11:59,817
You won't need it.

733
01:11:59,874 --> 01:12:03,512
Sir, you can't expect us
to not take precautions.

734
01:12:03,577 --> 01:12:06,189
You could be carrying
some kind of alien pathogen.

735
01:12:06,247 --> 01:12:07,892
<i>Been here for 33 years, doctor.</i>

736
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:12,063
<i>- Haven't infected anyone yet.</i>
- That you know of. We have legitimate...

737
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:13,717
...security concerns.

738
01:12:13,743 --> 01:12:16,223
Now you revealed your identity
to Miss Lane over there.

739
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:18,697
<i>Why won't you do the same with us?</i>

740
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:22,004
Let's put our cards on the table here,
general.

741
01:12:23,264 --> 01:12:25,284
<i>You scared of me because
you can't control me.</i>

742
01:12:25,766 --> 01:12:28,303
<i>You don't, and you never will.</i>

743
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,116
<i>But that doesn't mean I'm your enemy.</i>

744
01:12:31,339 --> 01:12:32,841
Then who is?

745
01:12:33,107 --> 01:12:34,518
Zod?

746
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,753
<i>That's what I'm worried about.</i>

747
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,851
Be that as it may...

748
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:42,089
...I've been given orders
to hand you over to him.

749
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:44,994
Do what you have to do, general.

750
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:50,564
Thank you.

751
01:12:51,692 --> 01:12:52,670
For what?

752
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:55,398
For believing in me.

753
01:12:58,466 --> 01:13:00,503
Didn't make much difference in the end.

754
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:02,871
It did to me.

755
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:25,027
They're coming.

756
01:13:25,726 --> 01:13:27,228
You should leave now.

757
01:13:29,931 --> 01:13:32,001
Go, Lois.

758
01:14:42,903 --> 01:14:44,280
Kal-El.

759
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:46,642
I'm sub-commander Faora-Ul.

760
01:14:47,508 --> 01:14:51,285
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.

761
01:14:56,217 --> 01:14:59,323
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.

762
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:02,334
General Zod would like this woman...

763
01:15:02,356 --> 01:15:03,994
...to accompany me.

764
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:06,959
You asked for the alien.

765
01:15:07,428 --> 01:15:10,175
You didn't say anything
about one of our own.

766
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:14,038
Shall I tell the general
you're unwilling to comply?

767
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:15,978
I don't care what you tell him.

768
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:20,384
It's all right.

769
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:22,681
I'll go.

770
01:16:05,419 --> 01:16:09,265
The atmospheric composition on our ship
is not compatible with humans.

771
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,401
You will need to wear a breather...

772
01:16:11,425 --> 01:16:13,098
...beyond this point.

773
01:16:38,252 --> 01:16:39,562
Kal-El.

774
01:16:40,921 --> 01:16:42,759
You have no idea how long...

775
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:44,861
...we've been searching for you.

776
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:46,493
I take it you're Zod?

777
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,898
General Zod.

778
01:16:47,928 --> 01:16:49,737
- Our commander.
- It's all right, Faora.

779
01:16:49,964 --> 01:16:52,638
We can forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.

780
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,811
He's a stranger to our ways.

781
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:59,408
This should be cause for
celebration, not conflict.

782
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,813
- Uhh.
- Not conflict.

783
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,280
I...

784
01:17:05,546 --> 01:17:06,752
...feel strange.

785
01:17:09,483 --> 01:17:10,791
Weak.

786
01:17:13,287 --> 01:17:14,247
What's happening to him?

787
01:17:14,288 --> 01:17:16,825
He's rejecting our ship's atmospherics.

788
01:17:16,957 --> 01:17:17,760
Clark.

789
01:17:17,792 --> 01:17:20,266
You've spent a lifetime
adapting to Earth's ecology...

790
01:17:20,328 --> 01:17:21,772
...but never adapted to ours.

791
01:17:22,129 --> 01:17:23,164
Help him.

792
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:24,866
I can't.
Whatever's happening to him...

793
01:17:24,899 --> 01:17:27,340
- ...has to run its course.
- Clark.

794
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:29,910
Help him.

795
01:17:31,872 --> 01:17:33,044
Help him.

796
01:17:44,485 --> 01:17:46,021
Hello, Kal.

797
01:17:47,688 --> 01:17:49,458
Or do you prefer Clark?

798
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:51,868
That's the name they gave you.

799
01:17:51,926 --> 01:17:53,434
Isn't it?

800
01:17:54,695 --> 01:17:56,636
I was Krypton's military leader...

801
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:59,210
...your father our foremost scientist.

802
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:00,978
The only thing we agreed on...

803
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:04,377
...was that Krypton was dying.
In return for my efforts...

804
01:18:04,404 --> 01:18:06,741
...to protect our civilization...

805
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,878
...and save our planet...

806
01:18:09,143 --> 01:18:13,148
...I and my fellow officers
were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

807
01:18:16,116 --> 01:18:19,359
<i>And then the destruction of our world...</i>

808
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,122
<i>...freed us.</i>

809
01:18:26,293 --> 01:18:29,797
<i>We were adrift, destined to float...</i>

810
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,176
<i>...amongst the ruins of our planet...</i>

811
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:34,076
<i>...until we starved.</i>

812
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:36,808
<i>How did you find your way to Earth?</i>

813
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:41,343
<i>We managed to retrofit
the phantom projector into a hyperdrive.</i>

814
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:45,416
<i>Your father made a similar modification
to the craft that brought you here.</i>

815
01:18:47,047 --> 01:18:50,153
<i>And so the instrument of our damnation...</i>

816
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:53,995
<i>...became our salvation.</i>

817
01:18:58,926 --> 01:19:01,429
<i>We sought out the old colonial outposts...</i>

818
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:04,202
<i>...looking for signs of life.</i>

819
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:09,177
<i>But all we found was death.</i>

820
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:12,541
<i>Cut off from Krypton, these outposts...</i>

821
01:19:12,606 --> 01:19:14,813
<i>...withered and died long ago.</i>

822
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,689
<i>We salvaged what we could...</i>

823
01:19:17,911 --> 01:19:19,618
<i>...armor, weapons...</i>

824
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,791
<i>...even a world engine.</i>

825
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,027
<i>For 33 years we prepared...</i>

826
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:29,696
<i>...until finally we detected
a distress beacon...</i>

827
01:19:29,923 --> 01:19:31,732
<i>...which you triggered...</i>

828
01:19:31,759 --> 01:19:34,000
<i>...when you accessed
the ancient scout ship.</i>

829
01:19:35,596 --> 01:19:38,133
You led us here, Kal.

830
01:19:39,466 --> 01:19:41,309
And now it's within your power...

831
01:19:41,368 --> 01:19:44,975
...to save what remains of your race.

832
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:50,483
On Krypton...

833
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:53,084
...the genetic template
for every being yet to be born...

834
01:19:53,114 --> 01:19:55,751
...is encoded in the registry of citizens.

835
01:19:56,817 --> 01:19:59,156
Your father stole the registry's Codex...

836
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:02,063
...and stored it in the capsule
that brought you here.

837
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:03,898
For what purpose?

838
01:20:04,658 --> 01:20:07,400
So that Krypton can live again...

839
01:20:08,162 --> 01:20:09,798
...on Earth.

840
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:31,755
Where is the Codex, Kal?

841
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:35,263
If Krypton lives again...

842
01:20:36,423 --> 01:20:37,800
...what happens to Earth?

843
01:20:38,826 --> 01:20:42,330
The foundation has to be
built on something.

844
01:20:42,596 --> 01:20:45,372
Even your father recognized that.

845
01:20:51,839 --> 01:20:54,149
No, Zod.

846
01:20:55,609 --> 01:20:57,115
I can't be a part of this.

847
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:59,051
Then what can you be a part of?

848
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:00,852
No!

849
01:21:02,349 --> 01:21:03,252
Zod!

850
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:05,056
No!

851
01:21:06,019 --> 01:21:07,657
No!

852
01:21:13,894 --> 01:21:17,264
Your father acquitted
himself with honor, Kal.

853
01:21:19,967 --> 01:21:21,913
You killed him?

854
01:21:22,302 --> 01:21:23,645
I did.

855
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:27,651
And not a day goes by
where it doesn't haunt me.

856
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:31,353
But if I had to do it again, I would.

857
01:21:31,578 --> 01:21:35,048
I have a duty to my people...

858
01:21:35,315 --> 01:21:39,320
...and I will not allow anyone
to prevent me from carrying it out.

859
01:21:55,769 --> 01:21:57,407
What's the sit-rep, major?

860
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,416
DSP pinged two bogeys
launching from the alien ship.

861
01:22:00,674 --> 01:22:02,779
- Put it up.
- Yes, sir.

862
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,280
There it is.

863
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:05,553
Re-task lkon-4...

864
01:22:05,579 --> 01:22:08,025
- ...and get me a closer look.
- Yes, sir.

865
01:22:08,348 --> 01:22:10,688
Command,
the word of the day is trident.

866
01:22:10,918 --> 01:22:13,023
We have two alien craft
on aggressive approach.

867
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:14,891
Ikon-4 coming online.

868
01:22:15,122 --> 01:22:15,930
Air speed?

869
01:22:16,189 --> 01:22:18,169
380 knots,
entering Kansas airspace.

870
01:22:18,258 --> 01:22:20,060
Their not responding to our hails.

871
01:22:20,293 --> 01:22:22,500
You're wasting your efforts.

872
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:25,974
The strength you derived
from exposure to the Earth's sun...

873
01:22:25,999 --> 01:22:28,104
...has been neutralized aboard our ship.

874
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:29,707
Here...

875
01:22:29,937 --> 01:22:31,541
...in this environment...

876
01:22:32,306 --> 01:22:33,785
...you are as weak as a human.

877
01:22:36,376 --> 01:22:37,386
Uhh!

878
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:42,386
Uhh!

879
01:23:32,332 --> 01:23:34,175
Where did you come from?

880
01:23:34,701 --> 01:23:36,146
The command key, Miss Lane.

881
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:38,816
Thanks to you, I'm uploading
to the ship's mainframe.

882
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,018
Who are you?

883
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,283
I am Kal's father.

884
01:23:44,945 --> 01:23:46,085
Can you help us?

885
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,491
I designed this ship.

886
01:23:49,716 --> 01:23:51,889
I can modify its atmospheric composition...

887
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,893
...to human compatibility.

888
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:54,996
We can stop them.

889
01:23:55,222 --> 01:23:57,702
We can send them back
to the Phantom Zone.

890
01:23:58,659 --> 01:23:59,296
How?

891
01:23:59,726 --> 01:24:01,262
I can teach you.

892
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,137
And in turn, you can teach Kal.

893
01:24:03,363 --> 01:24:05,070
Will you help me?

894
01:24:19,112 --> 01:24:20,412
The ship's crew are alerted.

895
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,515
We need to move quickly.

896
01:24:21,748 --> 01:24:23,421
Retrieve the command key.

897
01:24:31,058 --> 01:24:34,096
- Did you do that?
- Yes. Pick up her sidearm.

898
01:24:43,503 --> 01:24:44,880
What's happening?

899
01:25:05,859 --> 01:25:06,530
To your right.

900
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:07,397
Fire.

901
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,102
Behind you.

902
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:25,247
Secure yourself inside the open pod.

903
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:28,055
Safe travels, Miss Lane.

904
01:25:28,282 --> 01:25:30,586
It's high unlikely
we'll see each other again.

905
01:25:31,952 --> 01:25:35,058
Remember, the phantom drives
are essential in stopping them.

906
01:25:36,022 --> 01:25:37,462
Move your head to the left.

907
01:26:04,751 --> 01:26:07,062
Is it true what Zod said
about the Codex?

908
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:09,165
Strike that panel.

909
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:14,198
We wanted you to learn...

910
01:26:14,261 --> 01:26:16,366
...what it meant to be human first...

911
01:26:16,997 --> 01:26:20,638
...so that one day, when the time was
right, you could be the bridge...

912
01:26:20,867 --> 01:26:22,642
...between two peoples.

913
01:26:25,372 --> 01:26:26,546
Look.

914
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:30,549
Lois.

915
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:32,479
You can save her, Kal.

916
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:37,192
You can save all of them.

917
01:27:56,096 --> 01:27:57,632
You'll be safe here.

918
01:27:59,966 --> 01:28:02,537
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

919
01:28:05,772 --> 01:28:07,251
I'm sorry.

920
01:28:07,974 --> 01:28:10,755
I didn't wanna tell them anything
about you, but they did something to me.

921
01:28:10,811 --> 01:28:13,584
- They looked inside my mind...
- It's okay, Lois.

922
01:28:13,613 --> 01:28:15,388
They did the same thing to me.

923
01:28:28,461 --> 01:28:29,804
Clark!

924
01:28:38,905 --> 01:28:40,680
The craft he arrived in...

925
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:42,279
...where is it?

926
01:28:44,177 --> 01:28:45,349
Go to hell.

927
01:28:56,756 --> 01:28:57,834
There.

928
01:28:59,025 --> 01:28:59,696
Uhh!

929
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:22,786
The Codex is not here.

930
01:29:24,283 --> 01:29:25,557
Argh!

931
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:27,721
Ah!

932
01:29:29,522 --> 01:29:30,803
Where has he hidden it?

933
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:31,661
I don't know.

934
01:29:31,691 --> 01:29:33,295
Where is the Codex?!

935
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:38,173
Ahh!

936
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,754
You think you can threaten my mother?!

937
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:57,350
Ah!

938
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:34,031
What have you done to me?

939
01:30:34,254 --> 01:30:36,600
My parents taught me to hone...

940
01:30:36,623 --> 01:30:38,102
...my senses, Zod.

941
01:30:40,093 --> 01:30:41,697
Focus...

942
01:30:42,262 --> 01:30:43,969
...on just what I wanted to see.

943
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,265
Without your helmet...

944
01:30:45,532 --> 01:30:47,102
...you're getting everything.

945
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:48,210
Uhh!

946
01:30:48,368 --> 01:30:49,779
And it hurts...

947
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:51,747
...doesn't it?

948
01:31:02,615 --> 01:31:04,117
Argh!

949
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:37,857
Get away from the window.

950
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:42,829
Get inside. It's not safe.

951
01:31:47,561 --> 01:31:50,440
<i>All players, this is Guardian.
I am airborne mission commander.</i>

952
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:53,334
I have previously encountered
and observed...

953
01:31:53,366 --> 01:31:55,705
...the beings we're about to engage
and close proximity.

954
01:31:55,768 --> 01:31:58,176
<i>They are extremely dangerous
and we have been authorized...</i>

955
01:31:58,205 --> 01:32:00,007
<i>...to use deadly force.</i>

956
01:32:02,175 --> 01:32:04,375
<i>Roger, Guardian, we are inbound to target.</i>

957
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:11,177
<i>Cleared hot. Weapons free.</i>

958
01:32:11,284 --> 01:32:12,888
<i>Copy, 11. Weapons free.</i>

959
01:32:15,888 --> 01:32:16,828
<i>Thunder 11...</i>

960
01:32:16,989 --> 01:32:18,024
<i>...tally three targets.</i>

961
01:32:29,202 --> 01:32:30,237
Uhh!

962
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:36,149
<i>Thunder 11...</i>

963
01:32:36,276 --> 01:32:38,722
...good hit.
Request immediate re-attack.

964
01:32:38,945 --> 01:32:40,746
<i>Roger, Guardian.
We'll make a second gun run...</i>

965
01:32:40,814 --> 01:32:42,919
<i>...on a heading of 212 degrees.</i>

966
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:51,663
<i>Thunder 11, eject!</i>

967
01:32:51,724 --> 01:32:53,401
<i>Eject!</i>

968
01:32:53,426 --> 01:32:55,064
<i>Thunder 11, eject!</i>

969
01:33:05,505 --> 01:33:07,075
<i>I have a bogey incoming!</i>

970
01:33:07,607 --> 01:33:09,052
Oh, shit.

971
01:33:24,257 --> 01:33:24,997
Ragh!

972
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:28,103
You are weak...

973
01:33:28,161 --> 01:33:29,265
...son of El.

974
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:30,867
Unsure of yourself.

975
01:33:36,102 --> 01:33:39,083
The fact that you possess
a sense of morality...

976
01:33:39,305 --> 01:33:41,080
...and we do not...

977
01:33:41,307 --> 01:33:43,878
...gives us an evolutionary advantage.

978
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:49,883
And if history has proven anything...

979
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:03,332
...it is that evolution always wins.

980
01:34:04,998 --> 01:34:06,069
Ragh!

981
01:34:10,436 --> 01:34:11,608
Uhh!

982
01:34:24,651 --> 01:34:25,953
<i>CCT, we're approaching...</i>

983
01:34:26,019 --> 01:34:28,162
<i>...LZ Jayhawk. Get down in five.</i>

984
01:34:28,488 --> 01:34:30,331
Let's go. Go to the LZ.

985
01:34:30,924 --> 01:34:32,404
Roger, sarge. let's go!

986
01:35:09,696 --> 01:35:11,304
<i>All rangers, I need you...</i>

987
01:35:11,464 --> 01:35:12,836
...to engage the targets.

988
01:35:13,132 --> 01:35:14,402
Guardian, this is Badger 01.

989
01:35:14,467 --> 01:35:15,741
What about the guy in blue?

990
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:16,937
<i>I said engage...</i>

991
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:18,475
<i>...all targets.</i>

992
01:35:29,749 --> 01:35:30,789
<i>Contact. Contact.</i>

993
01:35:35,054 --> 01:35:35,930
Ah!

994
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:41,702
You okay?

995
01:35:47,433 --> 01:35:49,538
We're auto-rotating, going in hard.

996
01:35:50,269 --> 01:35:51,441
<i>Brace for impact.</i>

997
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:53,176
<i>Brace for impact.</i>

998
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:54,484
<i>We're going in hard!</i>

999
01:35:59,479 --> 01:36:03,784
<i>Fallen angel. Fallen angel. Guardian is down.
I repeat, Guardian is down.</i>

1000
01:36:25,605 --> 01:36:26,907
<i>Guardian, do you read?</i>

1001
01:36:26,973 --> 01:36:28,316
<i>Thunder 12, calling Guardian.</i>

1002
01:36:28,341 --> 01:36:30,184
<i>- Guardian, do you read?</i>
- Thunder 12...

1003
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:31,253
...this is Guardian.

1004
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:32,825
I was...
put down everything you've got.

1005
01:36:32,851 --> 01:36:33,914
<i>They north of my position.</i>

1006
01:36:34,013 --> 01:36:36,186
<i>- This will be danger-close.</i>
- Copy, danger-close.

1007
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:37,989
<i>Good luck, sir.</i>

1008
01:37:17,857 --> 01:37:20,701
A good death is its own reward.

1009
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:35,684
You will not win.

1010
01:37:37,109 --> 01:37:38,645
For every human you save...

1011
01:37:38,878 --> 01:37:41,552
...we will kill a million more.

1012
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:36,039
<i>Do we have an all dear?
Do we have an all clear'?</i>

1013
01:38:36,269 --> 01:38:38,545
<i>Alpha team, sit-rep.
Alpha team.</i>

1014
01:38:38,571 --> 01:38:40,275
<i>Do you copy? Alpha team.</i>

1015
01:39:29,889 --> 01:39:32,096
This man is not our enemy.

1016
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,096
Thank you, colonel.

1017
01:39:54,046 --> 01:39:55,088
Mom?

1018
01:39:56,082 --> 01:39:57,755
I'm all right.

1019
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:11,775
Nice suit, son.

1020
01:40:12,832 --> 01:40:14,140
I'm so sorry.

1021
01:40:15,167 --> 01:40:17,477
It's only stuff, Clark.

1022
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:21,050
It can always be replaced.

1023
01:40:23,509 --> 01:40:24,783
But you can't be.

1024
01:40:26,112 --> 01:40:28,324
Mom, Zod said this Codex...

1025
01:40:28,381 --> 01:40:30,657
...he's looking for can actually
bring my people back.

1026
01:40:31,384 --> 01:40:33,057
Isn't that a good thing?

1027
01:40:37,289 --> 01:40:39,792
I don't think they're interested
in sharing this world.

1028
01:40:40,393 --> 01:40:41,633
Clark.

1029
01:40:42,361 --> 01:40:43,237
Clark.

1030
01:40:45,131 --> 01:40:47,008
I know how to stop them.

1031
01:40:49,068 --> 01:40:50,513
What happened down there?

1032
01:40:50,736 --> 01:40:53,580
He exposed a temporary weakness.

1033
01:40:54,473 --> 01:40:56,316
It is of little consequence...

1034
01:40:57,677 --> 01:41:00,590
...because I have located the Codex.

1035
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:03,656
It was never in the capsule.

1036
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,923
<i>Jor-el took the Codex.</i>

1037
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:08,065
<i>...the DNA of a billion people,</i>

1038
01:41:08,288 --> 01:41:11,867
<i>...then he bonded it within his
son's individual cells.</i>

1039
01:41:12,091 --> 01:41:13,695
<i>All of Krypton's heirs...</i>

1040
01:41:13,926 --> 01:41:17,373
<i>...living hidden in one refugee's body.</i>

1041
01:41:21,634 --> 01:41:23,514
Does Kal-El need to be alive...

1042
01:41:23,569 --> 01:41:26,743
...for us to extract the
Codex from his cells?

1043
01:41:28,207 --> 01:41:29,379
No.

1044
01:41:35,281 --> 01:41:37,557
Release the world engine.

1045
01:42:09,782 --> 01:42:10,726
What just happened?

1046
01:42:10,883 --> 01:42:12,055
The ship just split in two.

1047
01:42:12,284 --> 01:42:15,590
Track one is heading east,
track two is point to the southern hemisphere.

1048
01:42:15,621 --> 01:42:17,421
How fast is that bogey moving?

1049
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:19,735
Approaching Mach 24 and accelerating.

1050
01:42:19,959 --> 01:42:22,833
It looks like gonna impact somewhere
in the south of Indian Ocean.

1051
01:42:41,647 --> 01:42:43,285
The rest of the ship is descending.

1052
01:42:43,983 --> 01:42:45,304
Put it on the board now.

1053
01:42:45,351 --> 01:42:46,421
Yes, sir.

1054
01:42:47,153 --> 01:42:48,625
Oh, my God.

1055
01:43:29,128 --> 01:43:31,904
Bring the phantom drive online.

1056
01:43:53,619 --> 01:43:55,662
We are now slave to the world engine.

1057
01:43:57,089 --> 01:43:58,500
Initiate.

1058
01:44:31,858 --> 01:44:33,535
What have they hit us with?

1059
01:44:34,461 --> 01:44:36,996
Looks like some kind of
gravity weapon.

1060
01:44:37,028 --> 01:44:39,565
It's working in tandem with their ship.

1061
01:44:40,199 --> 01:44:42,971
Somehow they're increasing
the Earth's mass...

1062
01:44:43,135 --> 01:44:45,440
...clouding the atmosphere
with particulates.

1063
01:44:47,373 --> 01:44:48,977
Oh, my God.

1064
01:44:50,309 --> 01:44:51,610
They're terraforming.

1065
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:53,085
What's that?

1066
01:44:53,712 --> 01:44:54,816
Planetary engineering...

1067
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:58,089
...modifying the Earth's atmosphere
and topography.

1068
01:44:58,150 --> 01:44:59,690
Turning Earth into Krypton.

1069
01:45:00,486 --> 01:45:03,626
- But what happens to us?
- Based on these readings...

1070
01:45:03,889 --> 01:45:07,093
- ...there won't be an "us".
- General Swanwick, sir.

1071
01:45:07,293 --> 01:45:08,670
I'm on with the control tower.

1072
01:45:08,728 --> 01:45:11,169
Colonel Hardy's on his way
and he's got Superman in tow.

1073
01:45:11,897 --> 01:45:12,967
Superman?

1074
01:45:13,499 --> 01:45:14,771
The alien, sir.

1075
01:45:14,934 --> 01:45:17,312
That's what they're calling him.
Superman.

1076
01:45:22,808 --> 01:45:24,014
We have a plan, general.

1077
01:45:24,576 --> 01:45:26,055
Is that what I think it is?

1078
01:45:26,912 --> 01:45:28,687
It's the ship he arrived in.

1079
01:45:30,349 --> 01:45:32,989
This ship is powered by something
called a phantom drive.

1080
01:45:33,252 --> 01:45:34,697
It bends space.

1081
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,740
Zod's ship uses the
same technology,

1082
01:45:36,766 --> 01:45:39,150
and if we can make the two
drives collide with one another.

1083
01:45:39,158 --> 01:45:41,001
A singularity can be created.

1084
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:42,621
- Like a black hole.
- Yes.

1085
01:45:42,828 --> 01:45:44,330
So if we open up this doorway...

1086
01:45:44,596 --> 01:45:46,700
...then theoretically
they should be pulled back in.

1087
01:45:46,765 --> 01:45:49,168
So you want us to bomb them with that?

1088
01:45:49,201 --> 01:45:51,181
General, that craft maxes out...

1089
01:45:51,437 --> 01:45:54,816
...17,000 pounds,
we can drop it from a C-17.

1090
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,178
It's a viable plan.

1091
01:45:56,442 --> 01:45:58,547
If I don't stop that machine
over the Indian Ocean...

1092
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:00,518
...the gravity field will continue...

1093
01:46:00,779 --> 01:46:02,122
...to expand.

1094
01:46:07,886 --> 01:46:10,662
If that thing is making Earth
more like Krypton...

1095
01:46:11,223 --> 01:46:13,259
...won't you be weaker around it?

1096
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:15,668
Maybe.

1097
01:46:16,528 --> 01:46:19,008
But I'm not to let that
stop me from trying.

1098
01:46:19,965 --> 01:46:22,172
You might want to step back a little bit.

1099
01:46:24,236 --> 01:46:25,374
Maybe a little bit more.

1100
01:46:57,836 --> 01:46:58,639
Faora.

1101
01:46:59,438 --> 01:47:00,542
Take command.

1102
01:47:00,773 --> 01:47:03,913
- Yes, sir.
- I need to secure the genesis chamber...

1103
01:47:04,343 --> 01:47:07,085
...and pay my respects to an old friend.

1104
01:47:14,853 --> 01:47:16,958
<i>Guardian en route to Metropolis...</i>

1105
01:47:17,756 --> 01:47:18,962
...package in tow.

1106
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:27,142
<i>Be advised,
F-35s inbound to rendezvous point.</i>

1107
01:47:27,399 --> 01:47:29,572
<i>You should have visual contact now.</i>

1108
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:17,755
<i>Command key accepted,
Genesis chamber coming online, sir.</i>

1109
01:48:18,650 --> 01:48:19,610
Stop this, Zod...

1110
01:48:20,018 --> 01:48:22,157
...while there's still time.

1111
01:48:23,188 --> 01:48:26,499
Haven't given up lecturing me,
have you, even in death?

1112
01:48:26,859 --> 01:48:28,861
I will not let you use the Codex like this.

1113
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:30,835
You don't have the power to stop me.

1114
01:48:31,096 --> 01:48:34,134
The command key I have entered
is revoking your authority.

1115
01:48:34,366 --> 01:48:37,279
This ship is now under my control.

1116
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,440
<i>Northcom, Lightning 1, request...</i>

1117
01:49:10,536 --> 01:49:11,961
<i>...permission to
unleash the hounds.</i>

1118
01:49:11,987 --> 01:49:13,073
Northcom, Lightning 1...

1119
01:49:13,105 --> 01:49:14,568
...you are clear to engage.

1120
01:49:14,594 --> 01:49:16,677
Send battle damage assessment 
when able. Out.

1121
01:49:30,322 --> 01:49:32,900
<i>Avionics are going haywire.
The gravity field...</i>

1122
01:49:32,925 --> 01:49:35,269
<i>...is pulling our missiles down.
We gotta get closer.</i>

1123
01:49:40,665 --> 01:49:41,625
All right, everybody...

1124
01:49:41,667 --> 01:49:44,546
...we're leaving.
We're leaving the building now.

1125
01:50:07,693 --> 01:50:09,570
<i>I just lost my wingman.</i>

1126
01:50:11,630 --> 01:50:12,968
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

1127
01:50:24,543 --> 01:50:26,523
Everybody, this way! Come on!

1128
01:50:26,878 --> 01:50:29,950
Everybody, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving.

1129
01:50:36,788 --> 01:50:37,823
Jenny!

1130
01:50:41,693 --> 01:50:42,535
Oh, my God.

1131
01:50:42,894 --> 01:50:43,895
Perry!

1132
01:50:48,333 --> 01:50:50,279
Go! There! Go!

1133
01:50:56,141 --> 01:50:57,643
Our people can co-exist.

1134
01:50:58,277 --> 01:51:02,282
So we can suffer through years of pain
trying to adapt like your son has?

1135
01:51:02,315 --> 01:51:04,788
- You're talking about genocide.
- Yes.

1136
01:51:05,017 --> 01:51:07,623
And I'm arguing its merits with a ghost.

1137
01:51:08,987 --> 01:51:10,796
We're both ghosts, Zod.

1138
01:51:10,923 --> 01:51:11,997
Can't you see that?

1139
01:51:12,923 --> 01:51:14,552
The Krypton you're
clinging onto is gone.

1140
01:51:14,593 --> 01:51:17,564
Ship, have you managed to quarantine
this invasive intelligence?

1141
01:51:17,629 --> 01:51:18,705
- You'll fail.
<i>- I have.</i>

1142
01:51:18,764 --> 01:51:20,175
Then prepare to terminate it.

1143
01:51:20,432 --> 01:51:21,607
I'm tired of this debate.

1144
01:51:21,767 --> 01:51:23,178
Silencing me won't change anything.

1145
01:51:26,138 --> 01:51:27,446
My son...

1146
01:51:28,373 --> 01:51:29,916
...is twice the man you were.

1147
01:51:32,211 --> 01:51:33,984
And he will finish what we started.

1148
01:51:35,213 --> 01:51:36,453
I can promise you that.

1149
01:51:41,653 --> 01:51:43,030
Tell me...

1150
01:51:43,288 --> 01:51:46,861
...you have Jor-El's memories,
his conscience.

1151
01:51:47,559 --> 01:51:49,965
Can you experience
his pain?

1152
01:51:51,397 --> 01:51:55,170
I will harvest the Codex
from your son's corpse...

1153
01:51:56,034 --> 01:51:58,344
...and I will rebuild Krypton...

1154
01:51:58,570 --> 01:52:01,073
...atop his bones.

1155
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:30,509
Argh!

1156
01:52:58,764 --> 01:52:59,469
Jenny.

1157
01:52:59,731 --> 01:53:02,473
- Jenny. Jenny, where are you?
- I'm here!

1158
01:53:02,734 --> 01:53:03,934
- I'm here. Here.
- Jenny.

1159
01:53:04,035 --> 01:53:05,537
Hold on, hold on.

1160
01:53:05,771 --> 01:53:06,749
I'm stuck.

1161
01:53:06,972 --> 01:53:08,645
- I can't get free. I'm stuck.
- Okay.

1162
01:53:08,807 --> 01:53:11,344
We'll get you out of there, all right?
Just sit tight.

1163
01:53:11,710 --> 01:53:12,279
No, no, no!

1164
01:53:12,344 --> 01:53:14,445
- Please, don't leave me.
- We're not gonna leave you.

1165
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:16,151
- Okay.
- Lombard!

1166
01:53:16,214 --> 01:53:19,559
- Get your ass over here and help me.
- Damn it.

1167
01:53:21,253 --> 01:53:23,233
- We just gotta move this.
- Here.

1168
01:53:23,455 --> 01:53:25,692
Slide that in. 
You push, I'll pull, okay?

1169
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:26,792
Go.

1170
01:53:31,296 --> 01:53:32,604
Oh, my God.

1171
01:53:32,764 --> 01:53:34,484
It's getting closer! Come on, push!

1172
01:53:36,234 --> 01:53:38,841
Northcom, this is Guardian.
Are we cleared to make the drop?

1173
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:39,971
Negative, Guardian.

1174
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:04,670
Argh!

1175
01:54:04,696 --> 01:54:07,142
Come on! Push!

1176
01:54:07,332 --> 01:54:08,333
Ahh!

1177
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:35,305
Argh!

1178
01:54:59,150 --> 01:55:00,493
He did it.

1179
01:55:02,887 --> 01:55:04,027
<i>Northcom, this is Guardian.</i>

1180
01:55:04,089 --> 01:55:06,330
We're passing through phase line red.
<i>We're good to go.</i>

1181
01:55:06,691 --> 01:55:07,712
Godspeed, Guardian.

1182
01:55:07,759 --> 01:55:10,171
Arm the package. 
You are cleared hot.

1183
01:55:10,529 --> 01:55:12,600
We're lining up for the final run.

1184
01:55:13,398 --> 01:55:15,400
It's up to you and Hamilton now.

1185
01:55:55,174 --> 01:55:56,134
You gotta be kidding me.

1186
01:55:56,575 --> 01:55:58,086
Loadmaster, is the package on...

1187
01:55:58,143 --> 01:55:59,344
...and we're ready to drop?

1188
01:55:59,477 --> 01:56:00,751
Negative, Guardian.

1189
01:56:00,779 --> 01:56:02,949
There's something wrong.
It's not supposed to do this.

1190
01:56:02,981 --> 01:56:04,356
What's it supposed to do?

1191
01:56:04,383 --> 01:56:06,307
It's supposed to go 
in all the way.

1192
01:56:06,433 --> 01:56:07,746
<i>Let me take a look.</i>

1193
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:09,656
Co-pilot's aircraft.

1194
01:56:10,388 --> 01:56:11,890
Co-pilot's aircraft.

1195
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:21,104
We are lined up for the drop.
What's the hold up?

1196
01:56:21,266 --> 01:56:22,267
Out of slide setback.

1197
01:56:38,316 --> 01:56:39,818
Target that aircraft.

1198
01:56:43,688 --> 01:56:45,133
<i>Target locked.</i>

1199
01:56:55,033 --> 01:56:56,009
Stop!

1200
01:56:56,034 --> 01:56:58,139
If you destroy this ship...

1201
01:56:58,370 --> 01:57:01,044
...you destroy Krypton!

1202
01:57:03,842 --> 01:57:06,015
Krypton had its chance.

1203
01:57:07,545 --> 01:57:09,320
Argh!

1204
01:57:59,998 --> 01:58:01,075
Miss Lane!

1205
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:03,210
It's not safe for you
over there!

1206
01:58:03,234 --> 01:58:03,837
Miss Lane!

1207
01:58:05,437 --> 01:58:06,677
Ah!

1208
01:58:33,732 --> 01:58:35,473
Move now! Go!

1209
01:58:56,321 --> 01:58:57,322
A good death...

1210
01:58:57,589 --> 01:58:59,159
...is its own reward.

1211
01:59:06,765 --> 01:59:08,142
Ah!

1212
01:59:29,687 --> 01:59:30,757
Ah!

1213
01:59:47,539 --> 01:59:48,950
Argh!

1214
02:00:01,519 --> 02:00:02,964
Are they gone?

1215
02:00:04,222 --> 02:00:05,633
I think so.

1216
02:00:07,525 --> 02:00:08,868
He saved us.

1217
02:00:34,352 --> 02:00:37,761
You know, they say it's all downhill
after the first kiss.

1218
02:00:41,025 --> 02:00:44,063
I'm pretty sure that only counts
when you're kissing a human.

1219
02:01:13,424 --> 02:01:14,903
Look at this.

1220
02:01:17,195 --> 02:01:19,306
We could have built a new Krypton...

1221
02:01:19,364 --> 02:01:21,105
...in this squalor.

1222
02:01:21,366 --> 02:01:24,472
But you chose the humans over us.

1223
02:01:25,904 --> 02:01:27,440
I exist...

1224
02:01:27,705 --> 02:01:30,117
...only to protect Krypton.

1225
02:01:31,876 --> 02:01:35,881
That is the sole purpose
for which I was born.

1226
02:01:37,115 --> 02:01:39,254
And every action I take...

1227
02:01:39,484 --> 02:01:41,486
...no matter how violent...

1228
02:01:41,753 --> 02:01:43,460
...or how cruel...

1229
02:01:44,656 --> 02:01:47,068
...is for the greater good...

1230
02:01:47,292 --> 02:01:49,238
...of my people.

1231
02:01:53,564 --> 02:01:54,975
And now...

1232
02:01:55,233 --> 02:01:57,509
...I have no people.

1233
02:02:00,939 --> 02:02:02,509
My soul...

1234
02:02:04,609 --> 02:02:08,147
...that is what you have taken...

1235
02:02:08,413 --> 02:02:10,017
...from me.

1236
02:02:16,821 --> 02:02:19,324
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal.

1237
02:02:19,657 --> 02:02:23,104
These humans you've adopted,
I will take them all from you...

1238
02:02:23,128 --> 02:02:26,309
- ...one by one.
- You're a monster, Zod...

1239
02:02:28,933 --> 02:02:30,239
...and I'm gonna stop you.

1240
02:02:42,613 --> 02:02:43,819
Argh!

1241
02:02:52,123 --> 02:02:52,794
Argh!

1242
02:04:11,736 --> 02:04:14,046
There's only one way 
this ends, Kal.

1243
02:04:14,272 --> 02:04:16,015
Either you die...

1244
02:04:16,074 --> 02:04:17,148
...or I do.

1245
02:04:38,329 --> 02:04:39,239
Uhh!

1246
02:04:48,206 --> 02:04:50,745
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.

1247
02:04:51,809 --> 02:04:53,447
Trained my entire life...

1248
02:04:53,678 --> 02:04:55,521
...to master my senses.

1249
02:04:56,013 --> 02:04:59,620
Where did you train? 
On a farm?

1250
02:06:51,395 --> 02:06:53,033
Argh!

1251
02:07:08,446 --> 02:07:09,791
If you love...

1252
02:07:09,948 --> 02:07:12,292
...these people so much...

1253
02:07:13,317 --> 02:07:15,593
...you can mourn for them.

1254
02:07:20,057 --> 02:07:21,127
Don't do this!

1255
02:07:24,328 --> 02:07:25,436
Stop!

1256
02:07:31,502 --> 02:07:32,980
Stop!

1257
02:07:34,939 --> 02:07:36,177
Never.

1258
02:08:05,970 --> 02:08:08,072
Ahh!

1259
02:09:10,568 --> 02:09:11,945
Are you effing stupid?

1260
02:09:12,269 --> 02:09:14,110
It's one of your surveillance drones.

1261
02:09:14,238 --> 02:09:16,741
That's a $12,000,000 piece of hardware.

1262
02:09:16,907 --> 02:09:17,942
It was.

1263
02:09:18,743 --> 02:09:21,280
I know you're trying to find out
where I hang my cape.

1264
02:09:21,879 --> 02:09:22,758
You won't.

1265
02:09:22,881 --> 02:09:24,589
Then I'll ask the obvious question:

1266
02:09:25,349 --> 02:09:28,553
How do we know you won't one day
act against America's interests?

1267
02:09:29,053 --> 02:09:30,896
I grew up in Kansas, general.

1268
02:09:31,355 --> 02:09:33,528
I'm about as American as it gets.

1269
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:34,701
Look...

1270
02:09:34,925 --> 02:09:36,404
...I'm here to help...

1271
02:09:36,627 --> 02:09:38,868
...but it has to be on my own terms.

1272
02:09:39,296 --> 02:09:41,139
And you have to convince 
Washington of that.

1273
02:09:41,198 --> 02:09:45,403
Even if I were willing to try,
what makes you think they'd listen?

1274
02:09:46,270 --> 02:09:47,874
I don't know, general.

1275
02:09:49,273 --> 02:09:51,280
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

1276
02:10:00,551 --> 02:10:02,628
What are you smiling about, captain?

1277
02:10:02,753 --> 02:10:04,096
Nothing, sir.

1278
02:10:07,258 --> 02:10:09,238
I just think he's kind of hot.

1279
02:10:11,195 --> 02:10:13,700
- Get in the car, captain.
- Mm-hm. Yes, sir.

1280
02:10:23,374 --> 02:10:26,583
<i>He always believed
you were meant for greater things.</i>

1281
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:28,446
And that when the day came...

1282
02:10:28,679 --> 02:10:31,489
...your shoulders would be able
to bear the weight.

1283
02:10:31,749 --> 02:10:35,595
Yeah, I just wish he could have
been here to see it finally happen.

1284
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:38,100
He saw it, Clark, believe me.

1285
02:11:25,503 --> 02:11:28,347
<i>What are you going to do
when you're not saving the world?</i>

1286
02:11:28,572 --> 02:11:32,315
- Have you given any thought to that?
- I have, actually.

1287
02:11:33,911 --> 02:11:37,916
I gotta find a job
where I can keep my ear to the ground.

1288
02:11:43,153 --> 02:11:45,224
<i>Where people won't look twice...</i>

1289
02:11:45,489 --> 02:11:49,866
<i>...when I want to go somewhere dangerous
and start asking questions.</i>

1290
02:12:03,274 --> 02:12:06,312
Come on, Lois.
When are you gonna throw me a bone?

1291
02:12:07,678 --> 02:12:09,351
Courtside seats to the game tonight.

1292
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:11,350
- What do you say?
- I say...

1293
02:12:11,582 --> 02:12:14,119
...you should go back
to trolling the intern pool.

1294
02:12:14,385 --> 02:12:16,488
You'll probably have more luck.

1295
02:12:16,514 --> 02:12:17,189
Sorry.

1296
02:12:19,557 --> 02:12:20,228
Courtside?

1297
02:12:20,457 --> 02:12:22,198
- Don't. 
- No.

1298
02:12:22,726 --> 02:12:25,436
Lombard, Lane,
I want you to meet our new stringer.

1299
02:12:25,462 --> 02:12:28,705
I want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent.

1300
02:12:28,833 --> 02:12:30,241
Good luck, kid.

1301
02:12:31,769 --> 02:12:33,043
Hey. Steve.

1302
02:12:33,270 --> 02:12:34,710
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1303
02:12:34,772 --> 02:12:35,614
Hi.

1304
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:37,883
Lois Lane.

1305
02:12:38,709 --> 02:12:40,245
Welcome to the Planet.

1306
02:12:43,981 --> 02:12:45,961
Glad to be here, Lois.
