1
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:20,950
That's the cleanup crew

2
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,995
up on the track,
and that's a lot of racers

3
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:25,737
involved there, folks.-

4
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:42,450
Jack, you realize
you got this in the bag, right?

5
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:44,689
Season's wrapped up, man.
Doesn't matter where you place.

6
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:46,169
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

7
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,150
- Last two laps.
- On it!

8
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:48,456
Get those plug wires!

9
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:50,153
Jakob! Now.

10
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:52,895
Hey, Pop.

11
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,331
Tell me what you see, Dom.

12
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,743
Got an oil spill
going into turn two.

13
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,465
Bell's driving safe.

14
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:59,269
Corbin's got a sponsor in
the stands, so he's pushing it.

15
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,598
Talking about me?

16
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:02,209
You got a real problem
with car 23.

17
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:04,820
- Linder. -MAN: About to
whip your ass, Toretto!

18
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:06,624
Settle down,
pretty boy! -That's right.

19
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:08,539
- Shut up! -Yeah, you.
You want to tell your driver

20
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:10,062
- he's gonna get somebody hurt?
- What'd you say?

21
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:11,237
- Hey! Leave it!
- Go home! You suck!

22
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:12,741
He's just pissed I got that spot

23
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,371
in the Busch Series
next season, not him.

24
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:17,049
Life's got no shortage of guys
like Kenny Linder.

25
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:18,268
You're good!

26
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,795
It's not about being
the stronger man, Dom.

27
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,884
It's about being the bigger one.

28
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,480
I swear to God, this guy.

29
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,750
Pop, turn two, turn two!

30
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:12,235
-Got it. I'm walking him in.

31
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,546
Shit!

32
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:29,948
Tell me what you see, Dom.

33
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,695
He's gonna come at you for that.

34
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:45,921
Get ready on your left.

35
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,596
Three-eighths ratchet.

36
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:59,081
Three-eighths driver.

37
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:01,910
Six-inch extension.

38
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:07,089
Are you sure?

39
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:21,190
Remember what your daddy
told you.

40
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,671
Be precise in life.

41
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:25,194
It can make all the difference.

42
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:26,935
Now, watch this.

43
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,306
- See how it's working now?
- Mm-hmm.

44
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,375
And you see what's happening?

45
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,899
It's turning the screw.

46
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:37,249
You're right.

47
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:39,077
Water heater's out again.

48
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:41,863
It's the price we pay
for peace and quiet.

49
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,214
Want to come and give us a hand?

50
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:51,481
Are you expecting someone?

51
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:55,659
Brian, remember
what we practiced.

52
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:23,034
Yo, yo!

53
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:26,908
We come in peace.
We come in peace!

54
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:32,130
It's me!

55
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,437
Roman?
Maybe you don't recognize me

56
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:36,439
'cause I've been tanning
all week, bro.

57
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:42,402
B, come out, son.

58
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:52,455
What you gonna do
with that thing, man?

59
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,520
What, you out here trying
to kill elephants or something?

60
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:56,416
We would've called first.

61
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,201
Except you actually need phones
in order to get phone calls.

62
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:00,681
You know that, right?

63
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,524
- Little B!
- Wow, you're so big.

64
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:03,921
Hi. -TEJ: Wow.
Hi. -

65
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:06,904
Now, I know you don't carpool.

66
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:09,603
So what's up?

67
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,213
Mayday! Mayday!

68
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:14,390
My plane is under attack
by a rogue agent!

69
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,613
We're being boarded. I've got
dangerous cargo on board.

70
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,397
I need you to assemble the team.

71
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,268
still alive. I'll explain...

72
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,622
It's an SOS transmission
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

73
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:30,711
It came through with
a mess of encrypted data,

74
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:32,539
most of which
I'm still trying to crack.

75
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,212
- Did anybody else get this?
- Well, that's the thing.

76
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:36,630
He sent it only to us.

77
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,806
Why just us?

78
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,598
He caught Cipher.

79
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:50,382
But there was a midair attack,

80
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:52,123
and she was extracted.

81
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:55,083
It seems his plane crashed
somewhere here,

82
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,477
over the northwest region
of Montequinto.

83
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,001
If Mr. Nobody survived,
we need to find him.

84
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:01,698
But the whole area's sealed off.

85
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,395
Isolationist, run by military.

86
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,310
We're not on call anymore.

87
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,055
Wait, wait.

88
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,797
Dom, this is Cipher.

89
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:17,105
The woman who killed
the mother of your child.

90
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:22,371
Things change.

91
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,858
Listen, we're wheels up
at 8:00 a.m.,

92
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:33,338
if you change your mind.

93
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,905
Thank you.

94
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:40,345
Daddy,
do you know where God is?

95
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,434
- Where is God?
- In your heart.

96
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:44,959
He's in your heart, too.

97
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,569
And you know something?

98
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:49,311
I'll always be in your heart.

99
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:50,573
Hey, little guy.

100
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,836
I have a gift for you.

101
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,839
Your father gave this to me.

102
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,713
And now I'm gonna
give it to you.

103
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,630
It's very special.

104
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:05,196
Take care of it.

105
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,171
Good night.

106
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:36,097
This isn't who we are.

107
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:42,712
Brian and Mia got out of the
game when they became parents.

108
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,237
We're not them.

109
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,846
: under
attack by a rogue agent!

110
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,197
We're being boarded. I've got
dangerous cargo on board.

111
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,546
assemble the team.

112
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,461
still alive. I'll explain...

113
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,682
alive. I'll explain...

114
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,028
y quiero velocidad...

115
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,909
Coming up on the signal,
two miles.

116
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:35,651
It's deep in the militarized
zone of Montequinto.

117
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,827
- I hope everyone's ready.
- Ready?

118
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,481
Y'all want to make jokes
about me

119
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,309
not making practical decisions?

120
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:43,267
This is as prepared as it gets.

121
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:45,095
We all see you, man.

122
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,794
Nobody thinks you're
compensating for anything.

123
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:59,283
- I'll take point.
- Careful.

124
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:01,590
Careful's when you get hurt.

125
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:16,431
Right now, we have

126
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:18,128
a ten-minute window
between patrols.

127
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,043
Mr. Nobody's signal is close,

128
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,437
but we've got
to move quickly, guys.

129
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,613
We do not want to cross paths
with the military here.

130
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:52,772
- It's inside.
- Cover us.

131
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:14,402
The source of the SOS signal is
coming from inside this thing.

132
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,711
Somebody wanted in.

133
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:22,802
Plane must have gone down
before they could cut through.

134
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,674
Or it was sent down
on purpose to stop 'em.

135
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:27,807
Yeah, well, their mistake
was trying to cut into it.

136
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,287
But just give me a minute.
I can get in.

137
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,030
Dom.

138
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:35,989
There's not a soul in sight.

139
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,252
No sign of Mr. Nobody.

140
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:39,993
Got it.

141
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,653
What the hell is this?

142
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:51,569
Whatever it is, Mr. Nobody
wanted us to find it.

143
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:53,702
How's that work...-

144
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:55,486
Go!

145
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:35,787
What?!
You don't know who I am?!

146
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,267
You think I'm scared?!

147
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,354
Roman, where the hell are you?!

148
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:13,973
Who's compensating now, Tej?!

149
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:39,999
"Peligro minas."
What does that mean?

150
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,454
Tej, how fast we got to go
to clear 'em?

151
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:42,958
Please don't tell me
you're thinking

152
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,240
- what I think you're thinking.
- Why?

153
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,005
What does "peligro minas" mean?

154
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,181
- Tej, how fast?
- I don't know, man.

155
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,486
Somebody answer me!

156
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,966
What does "peligro minas" mean?

157
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,272
"Peligro minas" means

158
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:54,230
- "danger, land mines"!
- What?!

159
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:58,930
How fast, Tej?

160
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:00,584
Assuming a 50-foot blast radius

161
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:03,413
and a-a half a second trigger
delay, I'd say about 80.

162
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:04,762
I can't!

163
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,982
My speedometer
only goes up to 70.

164
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,202
- What do I do?! -You put
your foot to that floor,

165
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:10,245
and you pray!

166
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:59,643
Get to that palm plantation,
and then we're clear.

167
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:40,945
Whoa!

168
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:54,045
Whoa!

169
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,137
Roman, you good?

170
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,578
My ass is en fuego!

171
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,676
Tej! Wait! Land mine!

172
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:33,014
How in the hell
are you not dead?

173
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,853
Wait, okay, I think
I found us another way out.

174
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:48,595
Two miles to what looks like
a bridge across the border.

175
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:51,467
Good. The sooner we get
out of here, the better.

176
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:56,211
Letty, on the right.

177
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,990
The device.

178
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:58,142
Get in.

179
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:21,340
That was Jakob back there,
wasn't it?

180
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:54,068
Always check your mirrors,
bitches!

181
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:56,375
Oh, hell no.

182
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,656
Are we supposed to drive
across that?

183
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,074
Well, I said
it looked like a bridge.

184
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:15,655
Oh, my God!

185
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:36,980
The military's not giving up.

186
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:38,417
We got to get past the border.

187
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:36,779
Where's the bridge?

188
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:43,133
No. No, no.

189
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:44,483
Dom.

190
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:21,694
Well, that was new.

191
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:43,193
Look, we're in the clear.

192
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:46,109
But this thing is a mess.

193
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:48,329
The headlines out there?

194
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:51,724
Secret spy plane crashes
in a hostile country?

195
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:55,423
Followed by some kind of
covert ops firefight?

196
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:58,034
I'll get you where you need...

197
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:00,123
and then I'm gonna need
to back off.

198
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,174
I appreciate the favor.

199
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,267
I got to stop doing
so many favors.

200
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:18,794
What we doing, Ramsey?

201
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:20,187
Like, where are we going?

202
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,059
I-I was able to decrypt the data

203
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,931
that came through
with Mr. Nobody's SOS,

204
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:28,587
and I found GPS coordinates,
definitely included on purpose.

205
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:32,982
You knew about Jakob?

206
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,856
Question: Who is Jakob?

207
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,641
Jakob is...

208
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,382
Or was Dom's brother.

209
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,692
Oh, my-my bad.

210
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:49,651
I'm sorry. I'm just processing.

211
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,871
Brother?

212
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:53,742
You got a brother?

213
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:57,398
Who also happens to be
some kind of super spy

214
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,748
with his own private army,

215
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:02,316
who drives literally like
a bat out of hell,

216
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,710
who preplanned an aerial jump

217
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:07,016
and landed at the bottom
of an airplane?

218
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,149
Who does that?

219
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:12,543
Who does that? A Toretto.

220
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:17,287
That's my dad! That's my dad!

221
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:19,681
-He's gone! He's gone!

222
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,291
We got to get him out of there.

223
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:23,642
We got to get him out of there!
That's my dad!

224
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:28,995
That's my dad! That's my dad!

225
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,649
That's my dad!

226
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,086
Get him out of there!

227
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:34,565
That's my dad!

228
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:44,184
There's a couple of release
forms we've got to sign.

229
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:46,273
Few clearances.

230
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:52,888
Everything else is down there
around the corner.

231
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,176
Hey.

232
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,266
Nobody's supposed to be
around here.

233
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,791
You Toretto's other son?

234
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,793
You're the useless one, right?

235
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,626
What is that?

236
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,978
Get out of here. Go.

237
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:41,328
So a man can't pay
his last respects?

238
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:42,808
That's what that is?

239
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:43,983
No.

240
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:45,375
No, not you.

241
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,725
You're the one that killed him.

242
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,639
No, racing killed him.

243
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:50,313
Look, he knew that I was gonna
pit him into the wall.

244
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:51,947
He knew that.

245
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:53,533
Now, I don't know if
he dropped gear. I don't know.

246
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:55,777
I swear... I swear to God,

247
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,866
- if you don't get out
of here... -What? What?

248
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,085
Go find Buddy.

249
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:00,869
Now!

250
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:09,312
All right, well,
now we got the golden boy.

251
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:14,491
Leave.

252
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,233
You here to make threats, too?

253
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:19,932
"Leave" is a simple word.

254
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,543
Man, what is it
with you Torettos

255
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:24,806
where you're all the heroes
in your own stories?

256
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,548
Look, I'm gonna
tell you a secret.

257
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:31,030
You, your dad, me...
We're all stuck,

258
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:34,294
going round and round
in the same shitty circle.

259
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:36,383
And we ain't never getting out.

260
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:40,779
You ain't half the man
my dad was.

261
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,695
- At least I'm alive, asshole.
- What did you say?

262
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,610
Get off me!

263
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,090
Dom! Dom!

264
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:50,266
Dom!-

265
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,225
Dom, no! Dom!-

266
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:53,835
No, man!-

267
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,811
In here.

268
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:38,532
Jakob.

269
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,727
I simply cannot believe that
magnet trick actually worked.

270
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:43,537
It looked so damn cool.
Look at this here.

271
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,017
I got this off the cockpit feed.

272
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,193
Oh, I love being rich.

273
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:49,282
It was sloppy. He almost had me.

274
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:52,502
- She say anything?
- Nope. Nada.

275
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:55,418
You know, I look at her
and I feel creeped out.

276
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:58,073
And sort of turned on
at the same time.

277
00:30:58,117 --> 00:31:00,162
Is that weird?

278
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:04,819
Nice operation.

279
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,474
You snatched me off
Mr. Nobody's plane midair

280
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:09,606
without a scratch,
and you took him down.

281
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,044
Money well spent.

282
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,570
- Do you know who I am?
- I know who you are.

283
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:17,745
Do you?

284
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,924
East L.A. is a tough enough
place to grow up.

285
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,539
But it was your brother's shadow
that turned you into this.

286
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:30,627
Isn't it?

287
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:37,939
So your whole life, you pushed
yourself to be faster than Dom.

288
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,854
Smarter than Dom.

289
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:42,988
Stronger than Dom.

290
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:50,169
Tell me, do you hate him enough
that it keeps you up at night?

291
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:53,781
Still?

292
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,394
All these years later?

293
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,834
I should've just hired you

294
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:06,576
instead of coercing your
brother a couple of years back.

295
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,100
I don't work
for the competition.

296
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:09,797
That's cute.

297
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,320
You thinking
you're the competition.

298
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:13,540
Says the woman in the box.

299
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:18,327
Look familiar?

300
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,981
The other half's hidden

301
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:23,071
in one of the agency's
thousands of vaults.

302
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:25,856
I need you to find out
which one.

303
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,469
We secured the master drive here
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

304
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:31,210
The rest of the hardware
is a bit dated.

305
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:33,038
Pre-Internet.

306
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:34,517
To make sure you don't go

307
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:36,563
hack into anything
we don't want you to.

308
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:41,394
Say you get what you're after.

309
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,526
A weapon so dangerous
it shouldn't exist

310
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,614
for another half century.

311
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:45,964
What would you do with it?

312
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,227
Launch some global attack?

313
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,533
Sell it to the highest bidder?

314
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:53,928
Or maybe you see yourself

315
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,670
as a necessary shock
to the system.

316
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:59,803
I bet all you ever wanted
was a hug.

317
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:03,024
You read my psych eval.
Good for you.

318
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:06,245
I read your second-grade
report card.

319
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:08,334
That's what I do.

320
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:20,172
Your chin... it's distinctive.

321
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:25,003
I know the Torettos have
quite the mixed bloodlines,

322
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:28,006
but I never detected
a Nordic strain.

323
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:41,584
Finding the two halves of
Project Aries is the easy part.

324
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:43,673
Add in your brother Dom
to the mix?

325
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:45,980
You don't have a chance.

326
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:49,114
Plans are in motion.

327
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:54,902
Qasar Khan.

328
00:33:56,643 --> 00:33:57,687
What?

329
00:33:58,688 --> 00:34:00,342
Genghis Khan's little brother.

330
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,782
Nobody's heard of him either.

331
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,462
Talk about off the grid.

332
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:35,725
I don't think they had grids

333
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:37,423
when this place was built.

334
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:40,730
If a Ninja Turtle pop out on me,

335
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:42,732
tell you right now, I'm out.

336
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:45,605
No way this place was
sanctioned by the agency.

337
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:48,695
This was definitely
Mr. Nobody's secret hideout.

338
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,270
What now, Dom?

339
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:02,535
Whoever Jakob has become...

340
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:07,061
and whatever he's up to...

341
00:35:11,544 --> 00:35:14,024
it's on me.

342
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:15,156
And me alone.

343
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,636
Nah.

344
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,814
Whatever's on you, it's on us.

345
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,511
Let's get to work.

346
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:43,141
Y'all ever thought about how
many wild missions we been on?

347
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,360
How we somehow...

348
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:47,710
- always survive?
- Yeah.

349
00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:50,148
- So far, so good, I guess.
- It's just luck.

350
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,106
No, no, no, see,
y'all not listening.

351
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,239
Think about this.

352
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:57,416
We've now been
on insane missions

353
00:35:57,459 --> 00:36:01,246
around the world,
doing what most would say is

354
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:02,899
damn near impossible.

355
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:05,772
And I ain't got one single scar
to show for it?

356
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:08,035
I mean, look at my jacket.

357
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:13,649
Those are bullet holes from
14 dudes trying to take my head

358
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:15,216
clean off its shoulders.

359
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,306
We've taken out
cars, trains, tanks.

360
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,265
I'm not gonna even
mention the submarine.

361
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:23,224
And yet we're still here.

362
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:24,747
Exactly.

363
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,575
Ramsey, what happens
when you test a theory

364
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:29,665
over and over again only
to come to the same result?

365
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,189
A hypothesis becomes fact.

366
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,775
But you're not actually
suggesting that...

367
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:34,714
I don't know,
but when the improbable happens

368
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:37,630
again and again,
that's more than luck.

369
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:40,807
Maybe we're not so normal.

370
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,765
That's what I'm saying.

371
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,332
We are not normal.

372
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:46,813
Okay, um...

373
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:48,815
just to clarify,

374
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:51,687
are you two maybe suggesting
that we're what,

375
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:53,341
invincible?

376
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,779
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

377
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:01,001
Or maybe...

378
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:02,481
you're just a dumbass.

379
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:10,097
Take your dumbass jacket
with you, man.

380
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,585
Pretty impressive driving
out there.

381
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:23,023
You miss the old life.

382
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,330
Do you?

383
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:30,073
Every day.

384
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:33,338
Guys.

385
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:37,255
We got a little company.

386
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:39,648
Think you know this person.

387
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:44,523
- It's so good to see you.
- I missed you.

388
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,481
Thank you.

389
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,222
Of course.

390
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:53,532
You should've told me.

391
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:57,231
She deserved to know.

392
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,540
Jakob's my brother, too.
I need to be here.

393
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:05,370
You get involved here, you put
everything you have at risk.

394
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:09,678
Your kids and the whole world
that you built.

395
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:12,551
We're all risking something.

396
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,816
Dom, listen to me.

397
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:21,037
My kids and yours are
in the safest hands possible.

398
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:22,125
With Brian.

399
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:25,738
Our world's grown, Dom.

400
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:28,871
I got this one.

401
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:38,011
The firewall on this old thing

402
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:39,360
is actually pretty good.

403
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:42,102
But, you know, port scan,
UDP message peek,

404
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:44,104
pop to root shell, and...

405
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:48,456
say hello to Project Aries.

406
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,979
What is it?

407
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:51,677
It's what we got from
Mr. Nobody's plane.

408
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,983
Or at least part of it.

409
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,942
Aries was designed
to override and assimilate

410
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:57,683
anything that runs on code.

411
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,380
Any computer anywhere.

412
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:01,556
If it operates on zeros
and ones, it's vulnerable.

413
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,516
If you take Aries
and upload it to a satellite,

414
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,866
it'll spread like a virus.

415
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:09,303
Then it'll be a matter of time
before someone can control

416
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,175
any weapon system...
Traditional, nuclear,

417
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,568
stuff we haven't even seen yet...

418
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:16,179
And just point it
wherever they want.

419
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:21,750
Jakob reboots the world order
within minutes.

420
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:24,492
Ares is the god of war, right?

421
00:39:24,536 --> 00:39:26,538
If Jakob gets his hands on this,

422
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:29,758
he'll be the god
of damn near everything.

423
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,717
Because of how dangerous it was,

424
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,196
the Aries prototype
was recovered

425
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,285
and split into two halves
by Mr. Nobody.

426
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:38,767
Both of which are worthless
without the activation key.

427
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,204
Jakob now has one of the pieces.

428
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:43,424
He'll be going after
the other half next.

429
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:46,862
As for the key, it's...
it's vanished.

430
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:48,081
So we find it.

431
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:49,865
If we're gonna beat Jakob to it,

432
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:51,432
we're gonna have to split up.

433
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,608
Roman, Tej,
I know a couple of guys

434
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:56,394
operating out of Germany that
could get us anything we need.

435
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:57,917
I'm on it.

436
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,179
Wait, there's one more thing.

437
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:00,833
Mr. Nobody's transmission

438
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:03,139
had one name
connected to the key.

439
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:06,534
You guys are gonna want
to brace yourselves for this.

440
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:14,281
No way.

441
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:16,109
That's exactly what I said.

442
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:18,720
So you're saying
Han's death is connected

443
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:20,069
to all of this?

444
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:22,245
He has to have
something to do with it.

445
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:23,464
I'll look into it.

446
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:25,074
Tej, can you send me

447
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:27,207
- all the files you have on Han?
- Yeah.

448
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,470
I'll go with you.

449
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:30,558
Letty.

450
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:35,520
I got this the day Han died.

451
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:38,261
Mexico.

452
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:39,828
Check the postmark.

453
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:44,093
Whatever he was up to,
it ended here.

454
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:45,530
Tokyo.

455
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:48,663
What are you gonna do
about Jakob?

456
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:51,144
I'm gonna find him.

457
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:54,713
How?

458
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:57,237
An old friend.

459
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,527
Yo, what do you think?

460
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:29,835
¿Es una ilusión o es real?

461
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:31,924
It doesn't matter.

462
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:33,534
It's all about
how you choose to see it.

463
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:35,928
Shit. I told you I was right.

464
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:39,279
- I'm Leo.
- Santos.

465
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:41,237
Dom. What are you guys in for?

466
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:42,935
Driving while brown.

467
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:56,165
You see that?

468
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:57,950
Hairline crack in the fuel line.

469
00:41:57,993 --> 00:42:00,039
Air gets in there,
you got a lean condition.

470
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:01,997
Lean condition?

471
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,406
And tasting the blood

472
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,234
when she screamed and dropped

473
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:22,888
caught the slug

474
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:24,454
Relate this to no choice-

475
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:25,804
this straight-up man

476
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,372
to the rhythm of a pop

477
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,418
run is the first to get shot

478
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,463
Whoever said that what I say

479
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:37,163
in the city with me

480
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:39,426
in fact, they take that back

481
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:40,949
deal with that...

482
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:51,656
Yeah! Yeah, Jakob!

483
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:54,006
That's what I'm talking about!

484
00:42:58,488 --> 00:43:00,142
Who wants next?

485
00:43:00,186 --> 00:43:01,927
I said, who wants next?!

486
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,319
I got next.

487
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:07,672
Dom.

488
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:10,370
Well, when'd you get out, man?

489
00:43:10,413 --> 00:43:12,459
I said I got next.

490
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,505
Come on, Dom.

491
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:19,553
You don't want to race me
in Buddy's old Charger.

492
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,599
Car don't make the driver.

493
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,912
Here's how this goes.

494
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:33,001
You win...

495
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:35,613
you can come back home.

496
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:37,745
You lose...

497
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:40,400
you keep driving,
you don't stop,

498
00:43:40,443 --> 00:43:43,185
you don't ever come back.

499
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,797
Ever.

500
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,189
What do you mean, Dom?

501
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:48,800
I know what you did.

502
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:54,806
The day we lost him, Dad kept
talking about a misfire.

503
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,285
Remember?

504
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,898
You were the last one
under his hood that day.

505
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:04,598
A minute later, he was gone.

506
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,906
Tell me why you killed Dad.

507
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,002
Now let's race.

508
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:24,096
Armed robbery in Echo Park.-

509
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:26,620
- Fourth Street Bridge is open.
- Clear, clear, clear!

510
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,729
Ready?-

511
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:49,817
Set.

512
00:44:51,297 --> 00:44:53,516
Go.-

513
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,823
for the battleground

514
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:57,085
will hunt you down

515
00:44:58,783 --> 00:45:00,523
you're not safe underground

516
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,657
has been polarized

517
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,746
to reveal the zeal

518
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,400
get mobilized

519
00:45:07,443 --> 00:45:09,097
the American dream

520
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,361
for the fighter jets

521
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:13,928
to the Middle East

522
00:45:13,972 --> 00:45:16,061
ten billion more dollars

523
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:17,453
to feel safe to breathe

524
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:24,417
What, what-

525
00:45:26,027 --> 00:45:29,074
and breathe

526
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:04,413
and breathe.

527
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:18,776
Too soon.

528
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,524
No!

529
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,030
We gon' ride the night

530
00:46:56,074 --> 00:46:57,858
ride the night

531
00:46:57,902 --> 00:46:59,599
out the parking lot

532
00:47:01,731 --> 00:47:03,342
we gon' drag and drift

533
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:05,257
and we pack the clip

534
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,650
sound mad as hell

535
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:11,176
Whoa, whoa-

536
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:14,962
Na-na-na, whoa-

537
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:17,399
and beating the shortstop.

538
00:47:17,443 --> 00:47:20,489
- Line drive
over the head of Gonzalez

539
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:22,535
on the field for a base hit.

540
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:25,843
Up next...

541
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,848
Place still looks the same.

542
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,895
Just like your dad left it.

543
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:37,506
I'm looking for Jakob.

544
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:42,903
Can't help you, man.

545
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:47,777
I know you took Jakob in
after my father died.

546
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:50,693
The worst thing
you can do to a Toretto

547
00:47:50,737 --> 00:47:52,782
is take away their family.

548
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,352
That's what you did to Jakob.

549
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:01,879
You've got people who love you,
count on you, care for you.

550
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:04,055
He ain't got no one.

551
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:05,795
You get in his way,
this ain't gonna end

552
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,667
until one of you guys
are in the ground.

553
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,191
I know you did
the best you could, Buddy.

554
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:15,370
But we both know he's about
to cause a lot of hurt.

555
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:30,255
I did my best
to take care of Jakob.

556
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:34,172
But I'm no Jack Toretto.

557
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:54,322
You've got to make peace
with the past if you...

558
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,674
if you want hope
for the future.

559
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,380
He's in London.

560
00:49:08,423 --> 00:49:10,469
That's all I know.

561
00:49:21,132 --> 00:49:22,916
Dom.

562
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:28,313
I hope you find your peace.

563
00:49:31,403 --> 00:49:34,449
The chance for peace died
that day on the track.

564
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:00,301
Arigato.

565
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,263
This place is a dead end.

566
00:50:05,306 --> 00:50:08,135
Do you think Jakob could be
onto the Han connection?

567
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:12,531
If he has all the information
we do, probably.

568
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,971
I never told Dom...

569
00:50:19,712 --> 00:50:22,758
I stayed in touch with him for
a while after what happened.

570
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,111
He was over at Buddy's
for about a year, and then...

571
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:29,374
he was gone with
a message not to follow.

572
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:32,788
But after he disappeared,
I was so desperate to find him

573
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:35,728
that I would've...
would've done anything.

574
00:50:35,771 --> 00:50:37,730
I even broke into
a police archive,

575
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:39,123
but I didn't find anything.

576
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:40,689
You what?

577
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:42,169
You were like 16.

578
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:45,346
I did what I had to do.

579
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:48,349
Yeah.

580
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,093
How about you?

581
00:50:53,137 --> 00:50:54,964
How are you doing?

582
00:50:55,008 --> 00:50:56,792
lt's a change of pace, huh?

583
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:00,883
Just as I was remembering...

584
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:04,844
who I was,

585
00:51:04,887 --> 00:51:06,933
everything changed.

586
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,805
It slowed down.

587
00:51:10,806 --> 00:51:13,244
There's peace for me
in the chaos.

588
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:16,986
It's like I... I need to face
the world head-on or something

589
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,423
to feel alive.

590
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:22,253
Seeing Little Brian

591
00:51:22,296 --> 00:51:25,430
hiding in a hole because
we had unexpected company...

592
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,737
that got to me.

593
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:32,698
We never used to hide.

594
00:51:34,482 --> 00:51:37,920
Hey, Dom's my brother, but you
will always be my sister.

595
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:41,968
Funny how we all have secrets.

596
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,889
What?

597
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:52,239
You got to be kidding me.

598
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:53,980
What is it?

599
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:56,374
Remember what Han used to say
about Tokyo?

600
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,379
You mean how
in all the old Westerns,

601
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:03,357
cowboys would make a run
for the border to get away

602
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:05,426
from the law,
how Tokyo was his...

603
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,645
Mexico.

604
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:12,651
No way.

605
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,792
Die for my gang member

606
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:26,665
dope man dope dealer

607
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:30,669
She's ready to roll.

608
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:32,845
No. No!

609
00:52:32,888 --> 00:52:34,238
No, Sean!

610
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:35,891
Tell me you are not modding

611
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:37,391
the quick disconnect valve
on the LOX line.

612
00:52:37,415 --> 00:52:38,372
Hey, man, chill out.

613
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:40,026
All right? It's all good.

614
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:42,507
- That tweak just saved us
0.4 seconds. - "All good"?

615
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:45,074
This isn't Top Gun, Maverick.

616
00:52:45,118 --> 00:52:46,400
You don't follow
the rules here, you die.

617
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:48,600
Hey, come on.
That's a bit much.

618
00:52:48,643 --> 00:52:50,819
When you know what too much
pressure in the LOX line

619
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:52,081
can do, come talk to me.

620
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,387
Till then, stay in your lane.

621
00:52:53,431 --> 00:52:55,215
Yo, you're lucky
to even be in my lane.

622
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:57,261
In case you forgot,
I'm the one that figured out

623
00:52:57,304 --> 00:53:00,133
how to let us build
rocket engines and get paid.

624
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,440
This whole thing was my idea.

625
00:53:02,483 --> 00:53:05,007
So who are you gonna trust
with your brilliant idea,

626
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:07,358
this glorified mechanic...

627
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:08,881
or a rocket scientist?

628
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:10,709
Without me, you'd be
working at Jiffy Lube.

629
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:11,971
Guys, guys.

630
00:53:12,014 --> 00:53:13,059
Look, it's all good.

631
00:53:13,102 --> 00:53:14,365
Who cares about who did what?

632
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:16,105
Kind of hard for you
to do anything

633
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:17,822
when you pee your pants
every time you fly, Twinkie.

634
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:19,718
Did I hear that right?

635
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:22,068
You a runner
and you afraid of flying?

636
00:53:23,548 --> 00:53:25,463
"Twinkie"?

637
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:29,162
So you must be
Ding Dong and Snoball.

638
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,382
- Right?
- Yo, uh...

639
00:53:31,425 --> 00:53:33,035
I don't go by that name anymore.

640
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:35,560
You went by that name ever?

641
00:53:35,603 --> 00:53:36,909
Like, ever?

642
00:53:36,952 --> 00:53:38,389
I... That's-that's-that's...

643
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:42,306
- Hey! We're up.
- Oh, good.

644
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:45,265
Hey, fellas.

645
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:47,224
Y'all seen ten-second cars?

646
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,880
Well, say hello
to the two-second car.

647
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:02,151
Is that a Pontiac Fiero

648
00:54:02,195 --> 00:54:03,892
strapped to a rocket engine?

649
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:05,894
Impressive, I know.

650
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:06,982
No.

651
00:54:07,026 --> 00:54:08,854
No, that's not impressive.

652
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,901
Eyes up! Here it comes!
Let the race begin!

653
00:54:30,136 --> 00:54:31,180
Plane's taking off!

654
00:54:31,224 --> 00:54:32,747
Go, go, go, go!

655
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:50,852
Yes!

656
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:53,246
We did it!

657
00:54:59,905 --> 00:55:03,778
Uh... I'm confused.

658
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:05,519
Y'all didn't actually
beat the jet.

659
00:55:05,563 --> 00:55:07,434
It didn't explode.

660
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:09,218
- Yeah, or melt.
- Yeah.

661
00:55:09,262 --> 00:55:11,003
She's still in one piece.

662
00:55:17,009 --> 00:55:18,619
You mean "pieces"?

663
00:55:18,663 --> 00:55:22,667
Hey, Jiffy Lube, next time,
will you listen to me?

664
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:26,801
Look, we heard y'all could
get us some wheels.

665
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:29,151
Preferably the kind
that don't explode.

666
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:30,936
Is that possible?

667
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:33,895
Well, the Honda dealership's
about 3,000 miles that way.

668
00:55:33,939 --> 00:55:36,071
Dominic Toretto sent us.

669
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:45,733
Who's Dominic Toretto?

670
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:36,871
Hmm.

671
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,572
Nice necklace, Queenie.

672
00:56:42,877 --> 00:56:46,315
Diamonds and emeralds
never looked so good.

673
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:48,405
Dominic Toretto.

674
00:56:50,276 --> 00:56:53,061
The word on the street is
you got locked up.

675
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:56,151
Yeah, well, in and out,
you know.

676
00:56:56,195 --> 00:56:58,327
When are they gonna learn?

677
00:56:58,371 --> 00:57:00,286
Some birds can't be caged.

678
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:02,462
Are you looking for
one of me sons?

679
00:57:03,681 --> 00:57:06,118
Not tonight.

680
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:08,642
You do the driving,
I'll cut you in for 15%.

681
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:15,257
My thieving days are over.-

682
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:17,651
Mine ain't.

683
00:57:19,044 --> 00:57:20,872
You coming?

684
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:53,992
I'm looking for someone.

685
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:56,864
Would've shown up in town
a little while ago.

686
00:57:56,908 --> 00:57:59,824
A lot of guys,
a lot of resources.

687
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:01,956
Oh, yeah, yeah,
word did go round

688
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,742
on a crew that just turned up,
led by an American.

689
00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:13,011
Yeah, he bought some arms
off a local seller.

690
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:15,927
Rumor had it he was into
something big up in Edinburgh.

691
00:58:21,062 --> 00:58:23,325
Local seller, huh?

692
00:58:23,369 --> 00:58:25,806
She wouldn't happen to be
wearing a stolen necklace,

693
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:27,112
- would she?
- He paid well.

694
00:58:27,155 --> 00:58:28,940
What was I supposed to do?

695
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,599
This geezer was about
your height, actually.

696
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:38,123
Similar features.

697
00:58:39,124 --> 00:58:41,866
Oh, bloody hell, he's not your
cousin or something, is he?

698
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:43,955
He's my brother.

699
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:49,541
Get the hand brake for me,
would you, darling?

700
00:58:58,883 --> 00:59:01,668
Glad I'm not the only one with
a family full of eccentrics.

701
00:59:03,714 --> 00:59:05,542
He offered payment
for something else.

702
00:59:08,109 --> 00:59:09,546
You.

703
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:33,178
In your mouth

704
00:59:37,138 --> 00:59:38,923
You know,
nothing's more powerful

705
00:59:38,966 --> 00:59:40,751
than the love of family.

706
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:44,276
But you turn that
into anger and resentment,

707
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,931
nothing's more dangerous.

708
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:53,851
Dom?

709
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:56,549
Don't get yourself killed, okay?

710
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,290
You're my favorite American.

711
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:12,696
Rio cuando lloras

712
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:14,393
La-la-la-la-la-

713
01:00:23,097 --> 01:00:25,926
This is your kind of party,
isn't it, Dom?

714
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,929
Beautiful women, best cars,
best everything.

715
01:00:28,973 --> 01:00:30,888
You know, best security, too.

716
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:33,673
I'm Otto.
I'm your brother's partner.

717
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:40,245
Well, fi-financier.

718
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:42,073
But, you know, my dad,
he's a dictator,

719
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:44,031
so we're not talking
regular people rich here.

720
01:00:44,075 --> 01:00:45,163
No, no, no, no, no.

721
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:46,643
Everything you see here, I own.

722
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:48,470
These girls, if you want
to meet one of them,

723
01:00:48,514 --> 01:00:49,863
maybe two, maybe three,

724
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:51,691
just let me know.
They're on the payroll.

725
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:54,302
I offer a bomb-ass dental plan,
too. Huh?

726
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:55,782
Where is Jakob?

727
01:00:55,826 --> 01:00:57,654
He's inside.

728
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:40,435
The brother
you're looking for...

729
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,133
he's from an old life.

730
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:46,050
- He's long gone.
- All I see is the same

731
01:01:46,093 --> 01:01:48,400
scared little kid
that killed our father.

732
01:01:50,663 --> 01:01:52,534
That's your mistake.

733
01:01:54,493 --> 01:01:56,800
The spy game...

734
01:01:56,843 --> 01:01:58,540
this is my world.

735
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:05,069
So here's my offer.

736
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,985
It's the same one you gave me.

737
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:12,554
You leave.

738
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:14,556
Now.

739
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:19,431
You drive away,
and you never come back.

740
01:02:19,474 --> 01:02:20,519
Ever.

741
01:02:20,562 --> 01:02:22,390
A deal?

742
01:02:23,652 --> 01:02:25,437
I showed you mercy!

743
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:29,658
And I won't show it
to you again.

744
01:02:39,668 --> 01:02:40,757
Toretto.

745
01:02:42,454 --> 01:02:45,196
Since my dad is head of state,

746
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:47,459
it makes me a foreign dignitary

747
01:02:47,502 --> 01:02:50,244
and this place an embassy.

748
01:02:50,288 --> 01:02:52,594
Which means you just trespassed

749
01:02:52,638 --> 01:02:54,379
into my country
and attempted murder.

750
01:02:54,422 --> 01:02:56,511
So, naturally, I called in
a little favor

751
01:02:56,555 --> 01:02:58,687
with all my good friends
from Interpol.

752
01:02:58,731 --> 01:03:02,082
You keep digging around
in the past, Dom,

753
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:04,215
you're not gonna like
what you find.

754
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,226
And here I thought my dad
was a pain in the ass.

755
01:03:15,269 --> 01:03:19,099
But your family is
a train wreck.

756
01:03:19,143 --> 01:03:22,363
Well, now that your brother's
finally out of the game,

757
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:24,409
it's time we go to Edinburgh.

758
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:28,674
Get the second piece, maybe
do a little sightseeing, huh?

759
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:31,459
Any news on the key?

760
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:33,548
Don't worry about it.
Our men are closing in.

761
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,598
One week from now, there won't
be a superpower in the world

762
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:41,339
can take a piss
without our permission.

763
01:03:41,382 --> 01:03:43,341
One week from now,
your dad will be asking you

764
01:03:43,384 --> 01:03:45,430
for an allowance.-

765
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:46,561
I'd like that.

766
01:03:48,259 --> 01:03:49,782
I'd like that.

767
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:04,057
Whew.

768
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:06,364
What's up?

769
01:04:08,322 --> 01:04:10,977
- Well done, Leysa.
- Please.

770
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:14,024
If it wasn't for you, I'd still
be stealing gas in the D.R.

771
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:16,069
So Queenie treating you right?

772
01:04:16,113 --> 01:04:17,244
Like a princesa.

773
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:18,637
I'm her number-one pick,
you know.

774
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,552
Cara's little sister done good.

775
01:04:20,595 --> 01:04:21,988
Good?

776
01:04:22,032 --> 01:04:23,990
You saw my fine ass
in that white dress.

777
01:04:24,034 --> 01:04:25,774
You see how I been rocking shit?

778
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:28,473
All this crew,
this is mine. Huh?

779
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:30,083
I been around the world.

780
01:04:30,127 --> 01:04:31,389
Oh, I almost forgot.

781
01:04:31,432 --> 01:04:33,304
You might need this.

782
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:36,307
Your boy Jakob biometrics
are encoded to this gun.

783
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:39,179
You'll have no trouble
tracking him now.

784
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:18,305
Hey, Letty.

785
01:05:19,524 --> 01:05:20,655
Yeah.

786
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:22,919
Come look at this.

787
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:24,224
What the hell?

788
01:05:24,268 --> 01:05:27,053
Han never mentioned
a girl, not ever.

789
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,014
Letty, Mia!-

790
01:05:31,057 --> 01:05:32,102
Down, now!

791
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:29,784
You okay?

792
01:08:31,063 --> 01:08:34,849
Welcome to Saint Giles'
Cathedral of Edinburgh.

793
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:39,550
The High Kirk has a history
stretching back over 900 years.

794
01:08:39,593 --> 01:08:41,987
Renowned for
its stained glass windows,

795
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,946
you can see
the intricate craftsmanship...

796
01:08:47,993 --> 01:08:49,821
-We're a go.

797
01:08:57,002 --> 01:08:58,743
Ramsey, talk to me.
What do we got?

798
01:08:58,786 --> 01:09:00,745
I pulled Jakob's biometric
signature off the gun,

799
01:09:00,788 --> 01:09:02,225
and the algorithm I've run says

800
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:04,357
Jakob's team is
right on top of us.

801
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:06,751
Anywhere between
80 and 100 meters.

802
01:09:06,794 --> 01:09:09,449
80 meters?
That's a lot around here.

803
01:09:09,493 --> 01:09:12,235
This whole area
seems pretty packed in.

804
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:14,237
So, we don't know

805
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,240
where the secret vault facility
Jakob is looking to hit is,

806
01:09:17,283 --> 01:09:18,502
now, do we?

807
01:09:18,545 --> 01:09:20,765
Wouldn't be a secret if we did.

808
01:09:20,808 --> 01:09:22,375
You know what?

809
01:09:22,419 --> 01:09:24,638
I'm starting to think
your little English accent

810
01:09:24,682 --> 01:09:26,727
makes you sound smarter
than you are.

811
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:34,082
Man, can I point out
that a good old-fashioned

812
01:09:34,126 --> 01:09:35,562
tracking chip would've put us

813
01:09:35,606 --> 01:09:37,173
within like
six feet of this dude?

814
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:39,392
But, nah, instead,
we out here with biometrics

815
01:09:39,436 --> 01:09:41,394
and facial recognition imaging.

816
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:43,396
Feels like we looking
for Where's Waldo

817
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,225
- in Harry Potter world.
- Yeah, uh,

818
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:49,010
strong argument there, Tej, but
tracking chips follow the chip.

819
01:09:49,054 --> 01:09:51,099
Before we know it,
we'd be chasing some expensive

820
01:09:51,143 --> 01:09:53,493
yet tacky jacket
to the dry cleaner's.

821
01:09:53,537 --> 01:09:56,017
Biometrics, on the other hand,
are impossible to...

822
01:09:57,628 --> 01:09:59,020
Wait.

823
01:09:59,064 --> 01:10:01,022
Guys, okay, we have a problem.

824
01:10:01,066 --> 01:10:02,478
Cameras are going down
all around us,

825
01:10:02,502 --> 01:10:05,157
and my equipment is
freaking out.

826
01:10:07,072 --> 01:10:09,161
What the hell, Jimmy?-

827
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,207
Security alert.
Cameras are down.

828
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,080
Damn.

829
01:10:15,123 --> 01:10:16,734
You see anything suspicious?

830
01:10:16,777 --> 01:10:18,518
Uh, where do I start?

831
01:10:18,562 --> 01:10:22,043
First of all, all of this
looks a little spooky.

832
01:10:22,087 --> 01:10:24,263
I even seen
these two ladies walking

833
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:27,527
with George Washington wigs
on their head from the 1700s.

834
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:30,574
I feel like I'm in Transylvania
or some damn where.

835
01:10:43,064 --> 01:10:45,197
Ramsey,
we're looking everywhere.

836
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,590
I just grew a new bunion.

837
01:10:46,633 --> 01:10:48,374
This is hopeless.

838
01:10:50,115 --> 01:10:51,290
What?

839
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:53,466
- You see that?
- See what?

840
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:55,120
The ears.

841
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:57,078
They got cauliflower ears.

842
01:10:57,122 --> 01:10:58,993
They fight for a living.

843
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,867
- Don't worry about it.
- Roman.

844
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:05,304
Hey, man, I ordered
a pair of Crocs

845
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:08,786
three weeks ago,
and I'm still waiting!

846
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:14,400
Where are my shoes, man?!

847
01:11:16,794 --> 01:11:19,449
Man, we really need
to work on your planning.

848
01:11:21,102 --> 01:11:23,975
Hey, Dom, you should
get down to the cathedral.

849
01:11:24,018 --> 01:11:25,818
Dumbass here just attacked
some delivery dudes

850
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:27,326
'cause he didn't like
their ears.

851
01:11:29,676 --> 01:11:31,156
Wait, wait, wait.

852
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,550
H-How much did you say
you paid for that again?

853
01:11:34,507 --> 01:11:36,901
You know silver
ain't magnetic, right?

854
01:11:36,944 --> 01:11:39,251
You know what?
Sh... Just shut up.

855
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,644
Just shut up.

856
01:11:40,687 --> 01:11:42,907
Ramsey, say we had
a big electromagnet

857
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:45,605
turned up right around here.

858
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:48,391
Wouldn't that disrupt
all electronic signals?

859
01:11:48,434 --> 01:11:50,349
Including security systems.
That's it.

860
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:52,395
That's how Jakob's
getting into the vault.

861
01:11:56,877 --> 01:11:58,009
Guys?

862
01:11:58,966 --> 01:12:00,054
Guys?

863
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:05,408
Okay, we've got police
coming from all sides.

864
01:12:05,451 --> 01:12:08,193
- The area's locking down.
- He ain't using roads.

865
01:12:22,163 --> 01:12:24,601
I got eyes on Jakob.

866
01:12:33,087 --> 01:12:34,350
I see Otto.

867
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:37,962
I'm gonna tail him.

868
01:12:46,536 --> 01:12:48,973
He's heading towards
a blue Jaguar.

869
01:12:49,016 --> 01:12:50,148
Okay, follow him.

870
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:52,411
Me? I can't.

871
01:12:52,455 --> 01:12:53,717
Why not?

872
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,347
Okay, this is a bad time
to tell you this,

873
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,111
but I don't drive.

874
01:12:57,155 --> 01:12:59,220
Okay? I never got my license.
I don't know how to drive.

875
01:12:59,244 --> 01:13:01,464
And, you know, no one
really drives in London.

876
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:04,075
Okay? And that is not
my contribution to this group.

877
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:05,163
It's you or no one.

878
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:19,743
Shit.

879
01:13:19,786 --> 01:13:21,614
Guys, come on, man.

880
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:23,050
I feel like,
between the six of us,

881
01:13:23,094 --> 01:13:25,183
we can work this out, right?

882
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,541
Okay. I've got...

883
01:13:42,809 --> 01:13:44,376
Ramsey, shut it off!

884
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,682
Shut it off!

885
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:48,206
Go, go, go!

886
01:13:48,249 --> 01:13:50,295
Okay. Uh...

887
01:13:50,338 --> 01:13:52,558
Brake is on the left,
accelerator right.

888
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:56,823
Oh.

889
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:49,833
-Shit.

890
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:54,881
Hey!

891
01:15:07,894 --> 01:15:09,722
Oh! Sorry!

892
01:15:27,697 --> 01:15:29,481
Whoa!-

893
01:15:53,766 --> 01:15:55,812
Oh, no!-

894
01:15:57,683 --> 01:15:59,119
Move!

895
01:15:59,163 --> 01:16:00,947
Hey, that was not my fault!

896
01:16:09,782 --> 01:16:11,697
Okay, that one was my fault.

897
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:47,646
See?

898
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,692
What'd I tell you?

899
01:16:49,735 --> 01:16:51,084
Not even a scratch.

900
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,101
Otto, sending you
new pickup location.

901
01:17:15,369 --> 01:17:17,284
I've got it.
I'm headed to you now.

902
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,325
Otto, where are you?

903
01:17:58,369 --> 01:18:01,024
Jakob, I'm there.
I don't see anybody.

904
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:04,070
It's because you're
on the wrong street.

905
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:39,758
That's my car, pal!

906
01:18:39,802 --> 01:18:41,412
Dom!

907
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:47,853
Go!

908
01:18:49,942 --> 01:18:52,423
Damn it.-

909
01:19:23,846 --> 01:19:25,064
You're a natural.

910
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:27,763
Of course I am.

911
01:19:41,341 --> 01:19:42,734
Okay, listen up!

912
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,519
I want 50 of the best men!
I want guns!

913
01:19:45,563 --> 01:19:48,653
I want wheels, freaking
X-wing fighters... I don't care!

914
01:19:48,696 --> 01:19:49,959
The Millennium Falcon,

915
01:19:50,002 --> 01:19:51,699
Chewbacca if you can
get ahold of him.

916
01:19:51,743 --> 01:19:54,050
Money's no object. Go.-

917
01:19:54,093 --> 01:19:56,139
Go!-

918
01:20:05,626 --> 01:20:07,193
What?

919
01:20:08,716 --> 01:20:10,544
What's so funny?

920
01:20:11,545 --> 01:20:13,765
I...

921
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,855
I was thinking,
if this was a movie,

922
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:18,378
this would be the moment

923
01:20:18,422 --> 01:20:21,947
where the villain has
an unexpected setback,

924
01:20:21,991 --> 01:20:24,645
overcompensates without
thinking it through

925
01:20:24,689 --> 01:20:26,822
and gets crushed
by the good guys.

926
01:20:28,562 --> 01:20:32,958
No offense, but you have
no idea what we're about to do.

927
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:36,005
And for the record,
we're the good guys.

928
01:20:36,048 --> 01:20:38,529
Me?
I'm Luke freaking Skywalker.

929
01:20:38,572 --> 01:20:40,052
Are you sure about that?

930
01:20:40,096 --> 01:20:43,273
I mean, I get
the daddy issues, but...

931
01:20:45,144 --> 01:20:47,146
Look at what you've built.

932
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:50,497
Really? Luke?

933
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:53,109
You're right.

934
01:20:53,152 --> 01:20:55,415
No, I'm more of a Han Solo.

935
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,853
No.

936
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,334
You're Yoda.

937
01:21:01,378 --> 01:21:03,249
- Yoda?
- Mm-hmm.

938
01:21:03,293 --> 01:21:04,685
No. The little green guy?

939
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:06,426
- Yeah.
- No.

940
01:21:07,688 --> 01:21:10,256
Ah, shit, I'll take it.

941
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:12,171
Because he's
a powerful Jedi, right?

942
01:21:12,215 --> 01:21:14,391
No.

943
01:21:14,434 --> 01:21:15,914
Yoda's a puppet.

944
01:21:18,438 --> 01:21:21,137
With someone's hand up his ass.

945
01:21:44,377 --> 01:21:46,336
So what now, Dom?

946
01:21:46,379 --> 01:21:49,774
No one outruns their past.

947
01:21:49,817 --> 01:21:51,645
And yours just caught up to you.

948
01:22:00,741 --> 01:22:02,308
Man.

949
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:04,180
There is
literally zero industrial

950
01:22:04,223 --> 01:22:06,269
or weapons-grade electromagnets
I can find

951
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:07,835
that are this powerful.

952
01:22:07,879 --> 01:22:09,291
Look at the pull strength
level here.

953
01:22:09,315 --> 01:22:11,404
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.

954
01:22:11,448 --> 01:22:13,450
Wait, watch this.

955
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,121
Every time. I can't believe it.

956
01:22:32,164 --> 01:22:33,992
What are you doing, bruh?

957
01:22:34,036 --> 01:22:35,385
I'm hungry.

958
01:22:35,428 --> 01:22:37,343
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, damn.

959
01:22:37,387 --> 01:22:38,866
Surprise.

960
01:22:42,435 --> 01:22:44,655
Nice clubhouse.

961
01:22:55,057 --> 01:22:56,710
'Sup, man?

962
01:23:01,237 --> 01:23:02,586
Nice to meet you.

963
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:21,518
So you got my postcard, huh?

964
01:23:38,361 --> 01:23:41,842
I'm just still
trying to figure out...

965
01:23:41,886 --> 01:23:43,931
How are you still alive?

966
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:49,589
Well, after Gisele died...

967
01:23:49,633 --> 01:23:51,678
I didn't know what to do.

968
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:54,029
I was aimless.

969
01:23:55,639 --> 01:23:57,336
- Lost.
- Absolutely.

970
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,860
But can you get
to the part where

971
01:23:59,904 --> 01:24:02,385
the car exploded
and you're still alive?

972
01:24:02,428 --> 01:24:04,300
- Like, I'm trying to...
- Roman, can you...

973
01:24:04,343 --> 01:24:06,258
can you just be quiet
for one minute?

974
01:24:06,302 --> 01:24:08,347
We made plans.

975
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,133
We had dreams.

976
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:13,874
So what's our next adventure
after this?

977
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:19,576
How about...
we stay in one place?

978
01:24:20,968 --> 01:24:23,232
- Where you thinking?
- Tokyo.

979
01:24:23,275 --> 01:24:26,017
We always talk about Tokyo.

980
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,627
Tokyo it is.

981
01:24:28,889 --> 01:24:31,718
You know, it's funny,
Gisele led me there,

982
01:24:31,762 --> 01:24:34,678
and I wasn't even
looking for it.

983
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:38,638
But it became home.

984
01:24:40,162 --> 01:24:42,729
Then one day,
Mr. Nobody came calling.

985
01:24:42,773 --> 01:24:44,731
I worked with Gisele.

986
01:24:44,775 --> 01:24:46,733
Back when I was a CIA operative

987
01:24:46,777 --> 01:24:49,867
running the drug trade
in Central America.

988
01:24:51,434 --> 01:24:52,783
The good old days.

989
01:24:52,826 --> 01:24:55,307
Gisele was my best.

990
01:24:55,351 --> 01:24:57,396
You can lose an asset
at any time.

991
01:24:59,355 --> 01:25:02,880
Bullet, knife, wire.

992
01:25:02,923 --> 01:25:05,883
But I never thought
I'd lose her...

993
01:25:05,926 --> 01:25:07,363
to love.

994
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:11,845
What do you want?

995
01:25:11,889 --> 01:25:15,153
I'm offering you a job, Han.

996
01:25:15,197 --> 01:25:17,286
Here, in Tokyo.

997
01:25:17,329 --> 01:25:18,852
Why me?

998
01:25:18,896 --> 01:25:21,072
'Cause I saw your work
with Gisele.

999
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,553
I saw that she trusted you.

1000
01:25:25,076 --> 01:25:27,948
And that means I can trust you.

1001
01:25:27,992 --> 01:25:32,866
And that is very rare
in this line of work.

1002
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:40,396
And all I knew
was that I had to steal

1003
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:43,181
some tech from the home
of a scientist couple.

1004
01:25:47,098 --> 01:25:49,579
But as usual...

1005
01:25:49,622 --> 01:25:51,885
Mr. Nobody didn't
tell me everything.

1006
01:25:53,452 --> 01:25:55,889
In fact, he left out
the most important part.

1007
01:26:00,807 --> 01:26:02,635
I was 11.

1008
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:05,595
My parents would take me
to the movies on Saturdays

1009
01:26:05,638 --> 01:26:07,988
if I tried hard in school
during the week.

1010
01:26:09,251 --> 01:26:11,644
I was so excited to go

1011
01:26:11,688 --> 01:26:15,344
I forgot my raincoat,
so I went back in.

1012
01:26:22,046 --> 01:26:24,091
At first, I didn't see it.

1013
01:26:26,268 --> 01:26:28,313
By the time
I looked out the window...

1014
01:26:31,534 --> 01:26:33,492
Mom and Dad were gone.

1015
01:26:33,536 --> 01:26:35,364
Turns out
I wasn't the only one

1016
01:26:35,407 --> 01:26:36,887
looking for this thing.-

1017
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:05,263
Get down!

1018
01:27:14,707 --> 01:27:16,143
Han saved me.

1019
01:27:16,187 --> 01:27:18,755
Wouldn't leave me behind.

1020
01:27:18,798 --> 01:27:23,238
He knew I'd always be a target,
so he taught me how to survive.

1021
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:27,851
We became a family.

1022
01:27:30,027 --> 01:27:32,247
"Always be a target"?

1023
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:35,641
Why?

1024
01:27:35,685 --> 01:27:37,513
'Cause she is the key.

1025
01:27:42,039 --> 01:27:45,260
Everybody's been looking
for a thing.

1026
01:27:45,303 --> 01:27:47,566
It was a person all along.

1027
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:49,351
My parents didn't want

1028
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:52,049
Project Aries to fall
into the wrong hands,

1029
01:27:52,092 --> 01:27:55,487
so they locked it with their
own DNA, something we share.

1030
01:27:56,706 --> 01:27:59,099
And then, one day,
Mr. Nobody gave me the heads-up

1031
01:27:59,143 --> 01:28:02,668
that one of his best agents
went rogue.

1032
01:28:02,712 --> 01:28:04,583
So when Deckard Shaw
came calling,

1033
01:28:04,627 --> 01:28:06,063
we used it as cover.

1034
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:15,115
But you got killed
in a car crash, Han.

1035
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:19,294
Mr. Nobody had a way
of making things look real.

1036
01:28:27,214 --> 01:28:29,869
Pretty nifty magic trick.

1037
01:28:29,913 --> 01:28:31,958
Yeah, I've done better.

1038
01:28:33,873 --> 01:28:35,919
Now for the hard part.

1039
01:28:38,008 --> 01:28:39,662
Keeping you dead.

1040
01:28:42,055 --> 01:28:43,666
My death...

1041
01:28:43,709 --> 01:28:45,450
Became the best way
to stay alive.

1042
01:28:51,282 --> 01:28:52,564
- What's happening?
- It's some kind of

1043
01:28:52,588 --> 01:28:54,285
hidden subroutine
the system follows.

1044
01:29:18,004 --> 01:29:20,267
That's it, right there.

1045
01:29:20,311 --> 01:29:22,922
Yeah, nobody moves...

1046
01:29:22,966 --> 01:29:24,924
everybody lives.

1047
01:29:29,799 --> 01:29:31,061
Jakob.

1048
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:34,456
I'm sorry, Mia.

1049
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:40,418
I was the rogue agent.

1050
01:29:40,462 --> 01:29:41,506
Me.

1051
01:29:42,986 --> 01:29:45,380
Dom, you ever think about
how Mr. Nobody found you?

1052
01:29:45,423 --> 01:29:47,947
Think he just dropped
out of the sky and chose you?

1053
01:29:47,991 --> 01:29:52,082
I ran missions with Mr. Nobody
out of this place for years.

1054
01:29:54,954 --> 01:29:57,522
I've been looking for that key
for a long time, Dom.

1055
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,395
And you just handed her over.

1056
01:30:01,744 --> 01:30:03,180
I told you.

1057
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:05,878
This is my world.

1058
01:30:06,879 --> 01:30:09,229
Got it.-

1059
01:30:09,273 --> 01:30:11,014
Got a lot of guys here.

1060
01:30:11,057 --> 01:30:13,190
You trust 'em?

1061
01:30:13,233 --> 01:30:14,321
Trust this.

1062
01:30:19,936 --> 01:30:22,199
You know the only good thing
to come from Dad dying?

1063
01:30:25,855 --> 01:30:28,727
If he hadn't, I'd have spent
my entire life in your shadow.

1064
01:30:31,817 --> 01:30:35,865
And now you're gonna spend the
rest of yours living in mine.

1065
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:43,089
Only good thing
about Dad dying...

1066
01:30:43,133 --> 01:30:45,483
was he didn't have to watch
what you became.

1067
01:30:46,528 --> 01:30:48,834
You never deserved
the Toretto name.

1068
01:30:51,228 --> 01:30:52,882
You think you knew Dad, huh?

1069
01:30:52,925 --> 01:30:55,125
What, 'cause you were his
favorite? You don't know shit!

1070
01:30:55,885 --> 01:30:57,495
Okay?

1071
01:30:57,539 --> 01:30:59,454
You want the truth?

1072
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:05,198
Dad died 'cause he was trying
to throw that race.

1073
01:31:06,199 --> 01:31:08,288
We were in deep debt.

1074
01:31:08,332 --> 01:31:11,074
'Cause of how he felt about you,

1075
01:31:11,117 --> 01:31:13,076
he had to ask me for help.

1076
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:15,774
How was I supposed to know
that car was gonna blow?

1077
01:31:16,906 --> 01:31:18,951
A good son would've said no.

1078
01:31:19,996 --> 01:31:22,564
And a real brother
would've come to me.

1079
01:31:22,607 --> 01:31:24,304
Come to you?

1080
01:31:29,179 --> 01:31:31,660
He made me promise
you would never find out.

1081
01:31:32,878 --> 01:31:35,402
And through all of it...

1082
01:31:36,403 --> 01:31:37,883
I kept that promise.

1083
01:31:45,282 --> 01:31:46,979
The girl comes with me.

1084
01:31:47,023 --> 01:31:48,067
Jakob!

1085
01:31:51,331 --> 01:31:53,812
I will stop you.

1086
01:31:53,856 --> 01:31:55,510
And that's my promise.

1087
01:31:59,688 --> 01:32:01,254
Hey!

1088
01:32:06,042 --> 01:32:08,435
Sue. Sue. Ah.-

1089
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:09,741
Come on. Come on.

1090
01:32:38,204 --> 01:32:39,379
-Down!

1091
01:32:49,302 --> 01:32:50,434
Go! Go!

1092
01:32:50,477 --> 01:32:51,653
Come on!

1093
01:33:02,402 --> 01:33:03,578
This way!

1094
01:33:24,033 --> 01:33:26,078
I'm always here.

1095
01:33:26,122 --> 01:33:27,253
Tell him.

1096
01:33:29,168 --> 01:33:32,476
No...!

1097
01:33:32,519 --> 01:33:34,391
No!

1098
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,075
No!

1099
01:35:09,181 --> 01:35:10,922
Dom.

1100
01:35:10,966 --> 01:35:13,011
Tell me what you see, son.

1101
01:35:20,497 --> 01:35:23,152
See, cars like this
are immortal.

1102
01:35:28,766 --> 01:35:31,595
'70 Chargers are
designed so well

1103
01:35:31,638 --> 01:35:36,034
that if you take care of 'em,
they'll run for 100 years.

1104
01:35:36,078 --> 01:35:37,557
Immortal?

1105
01:35:40,082 --> 01:35:41,736
Just like a family, Dom.

1106
01:35:43,259 --> 01:35:45,914
Build it right,
you take care of it...

1107
01:35:47,393 --> 01:35:48,786
it'll live beyond you.

1108
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:50,832
Daddy.

1109
01:35:58,883 --> 01:36:00,276
Little B.

1110
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:02,539
When are you coming home?

1111
01:36:02,582 --> 01:36:04,410
Com...

1112
01:36:22,428 --> 01:36:25,605
No. You know I'm good for it.
I promise I'll deliver.

1113
01:37:08,866 --> 01:37:10,104
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

1114
01:37:10,128 --> 01:37:11,651
- Last two laps.
- On it!

1115
01:37:11,695 --> 01:37:13,740
Get those plug wires!

1116
01:37:14,916 --> 01:37:17,832
Jakob! Now.

1117
01:37:41,986 --> 01:37:43,945
-You're good!

1118
01:38:00,962 --> 01:38:04,052
No!

1119
01:38:49,314 --> 01:38:51,490
You came to me, Letty.

1120
01:38:51,534 --> 01:38:56,539
None of it is worth a thing
if I lose you.

1121
01:38:56,582 --> 01:38:58,933
Do you hear me?

1122
01:39:00,717 --> 01:39:02,937
Is this who we are?

1123
01:39:08,072 --> 01:39:09,856
Yeah.

1124
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:16,254
From here, things move quickly.

1125
01:39:16,298 --> 01:39:17,864
Jakob has all the pieces
he needs.

1126
01:39:17,908 --> 01:39:19,431
Once he activates Aries,

1127
01:39:19,475 --> 01:39:21,148
all he needs to do is
send the signal global.

1128
01:39:21,172 --> 01:39:23,000
And then there's
no stopping him, ever.

1129
01:39:23,044 --> 01:39:25,437
He'll have to launch
some kind of pirate satellite,

1130
01:39:25,481 --> 01:39:27,570
something that'll act
as an amplifier,

1131
01:39:27,613 --> 01:39:30,007
infecting other satellites
in orbit one by one.

1132
01:39:30,051 --> 01:39:32,749
So we find him, stop him,
and then we get Elle back.

1133
01:39:32,792 --> 01:39:34,446
Our odds are zero here, Han.

1134
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:36,405
Satellite equipment is
easy enough to track,

1135
01:39:36,448 --> 01:39:38,122
but we're not gonna
beat Jakob to a launch.

1136
01:39:38,146 --> 01:39:39,862
Which gives us
a two-target problem:

1137
01:39:39,886 --> 01:39:41,714
Jakob on the ground...

1138
01:39:41,758 --> 01:39:43,412
With his own private army.

1139
01:39:43,455 --> 01:39:45,457
- And the satellite.
- Which can't be hacked.

1140
01:39:45,501 --> 01:39:47,218
Not remotely.
We'd have to do it physically,

1141
01:39:47,242 --> 01:39:50,636
50 miles above ground while
the satellite is in orbit.

1142
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,508
Orbit?

1143
01:39:52,551 --> 01:39:53,988
We need help.

1144
01:39:54,031 --> 01:39:55,815
Otherwise, we have no chance.

1145
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:58,122
We do it ourselves.

1146
01:39:59,123 --> 01:40:02,170
It's where we've been
that got us this far.

1147
01:40:02,213 --> 01:40:04,215
No. No, no, no, no, no.

1148
01:40:04,259 --> 01:40:06,652
Do y'all not understand?

1149
01:40:06,696 --> 01:40:08,350
Clearly, y'all don't.

1150
01:40:08,393 --> 01:40:11,440
Because if you did,
you'd be pissing your pants

1151
01:40:11,483 --> 01:40:12,615
like a normal person.

1152
01:40:12,658 --> 01:40:13,920
Orbit.

1153
01:40:13,964 --> 01:40:15,748
That's outer space.

1154
01:40:15,792 --> 01:40:18,142
That's another level.

1155
01:40:18,186 --> 01:40:21,232
What we gonna do?
Hijack a space shuttle?

1156
01:40:21,276 --> 01:40:22,625
Put rockets on our backs?

1157
01:40:24,409 --> 01:40:26,411
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

1158
01:40:26,455 --> 01:40:28,022
What?

1159
01:40:42,514 --> 01:40:44,473
There goes my father's
diplomatic ties

1160
01:40:44,516 --> 01:40:45,822
with Eastern Europe.

1161
01:40:45,865 --> 01:40:47,104
This place is
going to be crawling

1162
01:40:47,128 --> 01:40:49,086
with every cop in the city.

1163
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:51,175
Time to get the hell
out of here.

1164
01:41:11,543 --> 01:41:12,805
Keep her close.

1165
01:41:23,555 --> 01:41:25,731
It's activated.

1166
01:41:28,908 --> 01:41:30,475
As soon as the satellite
reaches orbit,

1167
01:41:30,519 --> 01:41:32,695
we start the uplink.

1168
01:41:35,524 --> 01:41:38,092
Ah, damn.

1169
01:41:38,135 --> 01:41:40,268
What?

1170
01:41:40,311 --> 01:41:42,052
You see that?

1171
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:44,576
We can't have an air leak, man.

1172
01:41:47,275 --> 01:41:49,973
Are you really patching
yourself up with duct tape?

1173
01:41:50,016 --> 01:41:51,279
Yes.

1174
01:41:51,322 --> 01:41:52,932
I don't know
if you noticed or not,

1175
01:41:52,976 --> 01:41:55,326
but this whole operation is
Band-Aids and duct tape.

1176
01:41:55,370 --> 01:41:57,372
Man, this is insane.

1177
01:41:57,415 --> 01:41:59,852
We are headed to outer space.-

1178
01:41:59,896 --> 01:42:02,507
You acting like
we on our way to Home Depot.

1179
01:42:02,551 --> 01:42:03,900
This is ridiculous, man.

1180
01:42:03,943 --> 01:42:05,554
I'm about to abort
this whole mission

1181
01:42:05,597 --> 01:42:07,860
and take my Black ass home.

1182
01:42:07,904 --> 01:42:10,428
We're literally gonna be
in a perpetual freefall.

1183
01:42:10,472 --> 01:42:11,429
Freefall?

1184
01:42:11,473 --> 01:42:12,996
What does that even mean?

1185
01:42:13,039 --> 01:42:15,825
Roman, it means
numbers don't lie.

1186
01:42:15,868 --> 01:42:17,783
As long as we obey
the laws of physics,

1187
01:42:17,827 --> 01:42:20,438
then we'll be fine, okay?

1188
01:42:20,482 --> 01:42:22,440
It's just all math and science.

1189
01:42:22,484 --> 01:42:24,486
I knew I should've listened
to my teachers.

1190
01:42:24,529 --> 01:42:25,922
Four minutes to launch.

1191
01:42:25,965 --> 01:42:27,576
You fellas good to go?

1192
01:42:28,794 --> 01:42:31,536
Yeah, we just up here putting
a bunch of duct tape on shit.

1193
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:33,886
You know, that's what Tej do.

1194
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:36,759
Man, please hurry up so I can
stop hearing his damn mouth.

1195
01:42:36,802 --> 01:42:39,370
- Yes, we're good to go.
- We're not good.

1196
01:42:39,414 --> 01:42:42,025
This is the same car
that we watched

1197
01:42:42,068 --> 01:42:43,679
do a test run and explode.

1198
01:42:43,722 --> 01:42:46,160
- This is not smart, Tej.
- Don't worry, man.

1199
01:42:46,203 --> 01:42:48,814
With my ceramic polymer coating,
you're gonna be just fine.

1200
01:42:48,858 --> 01:42:51,295
You're 100% fireproof.

1201
01:42:52,122 --> 01:42:53,210
Exactly.

1202
01:42:53,254 --> 01:42:54,951
All eight thrusters

1203
01:42:54,994 --> 01:42:56,344
fully functional.

1204
01:42:59,390 --> 01:43:00,913
Hey, please don't tell me

1205
01:43:00,957 --> 01:43:02,915
you're still running
launch simulations.

1206
01:43:02,959 --> 01:43:05,135
Virgin Galactic launched
at 36,000 feet.

1207
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,920
The space shuttle tests
around 50,000 feet.

1208
01:43:07,964 --> 01:43:09,487
Our last test run
with this load means

1209
01:43:09,531 --> 01:43:10,856
we'll have to go higher...
Way higher!

1210
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,403
If we don't get them
high enough,

1211
01:43:12,447 --> 01:43:14,318
these guys are gonna be
pancakes at IHOP

1212
01:43:14,362 --> 01:43:15,774
before the coffee
even gets to the table.

1213
01:43:15,798 --> 01:43:16,973
Hey!

1214
01:43:17,016 --> 01:43:18,279
We can still hear you!

1215
01:43:18,322 --> 01:43:20,672
Don't worry, guys. We got this.

1216
01:43:20,716 --> 01:43:22,457
We do got this, right?

1217
01:43:52,443 --> 01:43:54,793
I've run thermal imaging.
Elle's in the armory truck.

1218
01:43:54,837 --> 01:43:56,404
And I've got a lock
on the Aries signal.

1219
01:43:56,447 --> 01:43:57,847
It's coming from
the beast up ahead.

1220
01:43:57,883 --> 01:43:59,339
We need to get in there
to deactivate it

1221
01:43:59,363 --> 01:44:00,862
by the time Roman and Tej
are in position.

1222
01:44:00,886 --> 01:44:03,324
Ramsey, power us up.

1223
01:44:06,675 --> 01:44:09,155
Satellite is in low orbit.

1224
01:44:10,766 --> 01:44:11,941
Begin.

1225
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:30,176
All right,
we're passing 50,000 feet!

1226
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:32,222
Time to get ready, boys.

1227
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:33,876
What we supposed to be doing

1228
01:44:33,919 --> 01:44:36,400
with these old-ass suits

1229
01:44:36,444 --> 01:44:38,141
that ain't been used
since World War I?

1230
01:44:38,184 --> 01:44:39,751
Oh, I'm sorry.

1231
01:44:39,795 --> 01:44:42,798
Astronauts "R" Us was closed
for shopping today.

1232
01:44:42,841 --> 01:44:45,583
Listen, these suits are
just like space suits.

1233
01:44:45,627 --> 01:44:47,498
They both account
for pressure differential.

1234
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:49,108
Only thing is we may

1235
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:51,197
blow up like balloons
just a little bit.

1236
01:44:51,241 --> 01:44:52,523
- That's the only difference.
- What?

1237
01:44:52,547 --> 01:44:54,200
We just hit
the launch altitude.

1238
01:44:54,244 --> 01:44:56,377
- You guys ready for
a five count? - No, man!

1239
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:59,858
I'm barely ready to go scuba
diving in this old-ass thing.

1240
01:44:59,902 --> 01:45:01,382
Don't listen to him. We ready!

1241
01:45:01,425 --> 01:45:02,818
- "We"?
- Yes, I said "we"!

1242
01:45:02,861 --> 01:45:04,472
I thought you was invincible.

1243
01:45:04,515 --> 01:45:06,952
Let's see how invincible
your Black ass is after this.

1244
01:45:06,996 --> 01:45:08,650
- Punch it!
- No! Tej!

1245
01:45:12,088 --> 01:45:14,656
Oh, my God!
I don't want to die!

1246
01:45:14,699 --> 01:45:16,353
Ignition!

1247
01:46:00,528 --> 01:46:03,879
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1248
01:46:07,578 --> 01:46:09,363
We're in outer space!

1249
01:46:10,451 --> 01:46:13,584
Told you numbers don't lie.

1250
01:46:13,628 --> 01:46:15,673
This is crazy, bro!

1251
01:46:26,771 --> 01:46:28,947
Man, how much candy did you eat?

1252
01:46:28,991 --> 01:46:31,733
Well, I-I... I eat candy
when I get nervous.

1253
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:43,397
I thought you said
you took care of this.

1254
01:46:44,963 --> 01:46:46,965
Yeah. Hey.

1255
01:46:47,009 --> 01:46:50,186
You take them back to the
freaking junkyard right now!

1256
01:48:25,586 --> 01:48:27,196
All right, Han, Mia, you're up!

1257
01:48:40,644 --> 01:48:42,080
Now.

1258
01:48:47,738 --> 01:48:49,523
Letty.

1259
01:49:09,194 --> 01:49:10,544
Han!

1260
01:50:08,689 --> 01:50:10,342
Not all of us.

1261
01:50:24,052 --> 01:50:27,185
Now, the satellite we looking
for should be somewhere...

1262
01:50:27,229 --> 01:50:29,013
There.

1263
01:50:29,057 --> 01:50:30,362
Right there. You see it?

1264
01:50:30,406 --> 01:50:31,842
Got it.

1265
01:50:31,886 --> 01:50:34,192
Tell me you know
how to work the thrusters.

1266
01:50:34,236 --> 01:50:37,631
Tej, numbers is
what you do, right?

1267
01:50:38,675 --> 01:50:40,677
Driving is what I do.

1268
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:50,818
Two dudes from the ghetto...
Outer space.

1269
01:50:52,863 --> 01:50:54,822
You know ain't nobody
gonna believe us, right?

1270
01:50:54,865 --> 01:50:57,172
You're right.

1271
01:51:05,354 --> 01:51:07,269
Something's wrong with
the satellite array.

1272
01:51:07,312 --> 01:51:09,750
It's, uh, interfering
with the uplink.

1273
01:51:12,230 --> 01:51:14,102
I'll handle it.

1274
01:51:32,033 --> 01:51:33,077
Han?

1275
01:51:34,339 --> 01:51:36,298
Grab the wheel.

1276
01:51:36,341 --> 01:51:37,691
Something's up.

1277
01:51:39,388 --> 01:51:41,607
I think I can link
into their feed.

1278
01:51:53,794 --> 01:51:56,231
- Something you want to
tell me, Otto? - My bad.

1279
01:51:56,274 --> 01:51:59,234
Satellite uplink is
actually going splendid.

1280
01:51:59,277 --> 01:52:01,932
Oh, and by the way,
I have a new business partner.

1281
01:52:01,976 --> 01:52:03,978
Maybe you know her.

1282
01:52:04,021 --> 01:52:06,850
Guess who's
out of the box, Jakob.

1283
01:52:06,894 --> 01:52:08,939
But I did try to warn you.

1284
01:52:11,463 --> 01:52:13,639
You were never my competition.

1285
01:52:13,683 --> 01:52:16,512
- Otto, there's something
you should know. -Yeah, go on.

1286
01:52:16,555 --> 01:52:18,688
- Lay it on me, dude.
- You're a spoiled rich prick,

1287
01:52:18,732 --> 01:52:21,343
- and I'm gonna kill you.
- Oh, man, I am so sorry.

1288
01:52:21,386 --> 01:52:23,127
No one told you, huh?

1289
01:52:23,171 --> 01:52:27,175
Spoiled rich pricks
run the world.

1290
01:53:50,345 --> 01:53:53,348
Come on. Come on!

1291
01:54:11,932 --> 01:54:13,150
Go.

1292
01:54:52,886 --> 01:54:54,931
- What's happening?
- Uh, well,

1293
01:54:54,975 --> 01:54:58,369
we appear to have lost
our escort and Jakob.

1294
01:54:58,413 --> 01:55:00,023
And, well, Dom is making things

1295
01:55:00,067 --> 01:55:01,807
a little bit difficult here,
but it's fine.

1296
01:55:01,851 --> 01:55:03,809
Really, it's peachy.
Don't worry, don't worry.

1297
01:55:03,853 --> 01:55:05,376
I'll finish this myself.

1298
01:55:09,598 --> 01:55:12,470
All right, let's see
what that beast is made of.

1299
01:55:12,514 --> 01:55:13,776
You ready, Elle?

1300
01:55:27,007 --> 01:55:28,834
Crank it.

1301
01:55:28,878 --> 01:55:30,924
If we can't break through,
we stop it.

1302
01:56:01,911 --> 01:56:04,174
Guys, that thing is
not slowing down

1303
01:56:04,218 --> 01:56:05,871
and the download's almost done.

1304
01:56:05,915 --> 01:56:09,049
Dom, we don't get
out of here now, we're dead.

1305
01:56:18,319 --> 01:56:20,408
Letty, drop back and line up
with the front tires.

1306
01:56:20,451 --> 01:56:22,018
What?

1307
01:56:22,062 --> 01:56:23,735
If we can't slow it
and we can't punch through,

1308
01:56:23,759 --> 01:56:25,979
we flip it
and we hit the underside.

1309
01:56:26,022 --> 01:56:28,720
Goddamn it!
Why do I have to say this?

1310
01:56:28,764 --> 01:56:30,374
Flatten these clowns!

1311
01:56:48,914 --> 01:56:50,699
- Letty, the wires.
- You read my mind.

1312
01:56:50,742 --> 01:56:52,396
Han, get in front of me.

1313
01:56:54,398 --> 01:56:56,531
Dom, I can't get to you.

1314
01:56:57,532 --> 01:56:59,012
But I can.

1315
01:58:14,348 --> 01:58:16,654
All right,
the satellite is in range.

1316
01:58:16,698 --> 01:58:18,439
Let's power up these magnets
and fry it.

1317
01:58:18,482 --> 01:58:20,005
All right, take our time.

1318
01:58:30,407 --> 01:58:31,974
Okay. All right.

1319
01:58:33,584 --> 01:58:36,326
- Tej!
- Hold on. Come on, baby.

1320
01:58:36,370 --> 01:58:38,067
Power up. Power up.

1321
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:42,027
Shit.-

1322
01:58:42,071 --> 01:58:44,465
- Shit, shit, shit.
- What?

1323
01:58:44,508 --> 01:58:46,293
Talk to me. What's going on?

1324
01:58:46,336 --> 01:58:48,358
The pressure of the launch...
It must have jammed the cables

1325
01:58:48,382 --> 01:58:50,079
to the power source.

1326
01:58:50,123 --> 01:58:53,169
Damn it, how did I
not think of that?

1327
01:58:53,213 --> 01:58:55,171
Guys, where are you?

1328
01:58:55,215 --> 01:58:58,566
The upload is almost complete.

1329
01:58:58,609 --> 01:59:01,395
Why don't you just kill it?

1330
01:59:01,438 --> 01:59:03,527
Let's smash it.
Let's run it over, right?

1331
01:59:03,571 --> 01:59:07,575
No. If we crash into that
satellite, we'll probably die.

1332
01:59:07,618 --> 01:59:09,098
And even if we don't,

1333
01:59:09,142 --> 01:59:11,100
the fuel that it would take
to smash it...

1334
01:59:11,144 --> 01:59:13,407
We'd be stuck out here forever.

1335
01:59:13,450 --> 01:59:15,017
You got to have faith, bro.

1336
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:17,759
Faith? Faith is not numbers.

1337
01:59:17,802 --> 01:59:19,500
You know what, Tej?

1338
01:59:20,805 --> 01:59:22,416
You're probably right.

1339
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:26,507
We're not invincible.

1340
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:32,600
We probably just been lucky
this whole time.

1341
01:59:38,388 --> 01:59:40,303
This might be it.

1342
01:59:42,958 --> 01:59:45,613
But you know what?

1343
01:59:45,656 --> 01:59:47,180
If we're gonna go out...

1344
01:59:49,138 --> 01:59:51,271
let's go out
on top of the world.

1345
01:59:52,315 --> 01:59:54,535
Guys,
what's happening up there?

1346
01:59:54,578 --> 01:59:56,624
We've got seconds left.

1347
01:59:58,452 --> 02:00:00,323
Let's do it.

1348
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:01,411
Let's go.

1349
02:00:06,286 --> 02:00:09,289
Five, four, three,

1350
02:00:09,332 --> 02:00:11,421
two, one.

1351
02:00:29,657 --> 02:00:31,528
We did it.

1352
02:00:31,572 --> 02:00:33,226
-We did it!

1353
02:00:33,269 --> 02:00:35,010
Let's go.

1354
02:00:36,533 --> 02:00:38,535
-Shit.

1355
02:00:38,579 --> 02:00:40,015
Not bad, man.

1356
02:00:40,058 --> 02:00:41,538
Not bad at all.

1357
02:00:53,333 --> 02:00:55,770
Hold on!-

1358
02:01:03,256 --> 02:01:04,257
Dom!

1359
02:02:04,795 --> 02:02:06,536
Got to be kidding me.

1360
02:02:41,397 --> 02:02:43,094
-Shit!

1361
02:03:35,495 --> 02:03:37,497
Think these belong to you.

1362
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:50,031
There's gonna be a lot of
people coming after you, Jake.

1363
02:03:50,074 --> 02:03:52,294
Yeah.

1364
02:03:52,337 --> 02:03:54,035
This is the world I chose, Dom.

1365
02:03:55,906 --> 02:03:59,040
You know, Dad wasn't perfect.

1366
02:03:59,083 --> 02:04:01,521
And he loved us all the same.

1367
02:04:04,915 --> 02:04:08,658
Someone once gave me
a ten-second car...

1368
02:04:08,702 --> 02:04:10,660
as a second chance.

1369
02:04:12,401 --> 02:04:14,621
I owe you that, little brother.

1370
02:04:27,938 --> 02:04:30,506
I lost you once.

1371
02:04:30,550 --> 02:04:32,421
Don't let that
happen again, okay?

1372
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:16,030
-We come in peace!

1373
02:05:16,073 --> 02:05:17,814
Hey!

1374
02:05:46,103 --> 02:05:48,758
This was the last place
I saw your grandfather.

1375
02:05:50,891 --> 02:05:52,414
This is where he raced.

1376
02:05:52,457 --> 02:05:54,895
Did you race here, too, Daddy?

1377
02:05:54,938 --> 02:05:56,113
No.

1378
02:05:56,157 --> 02:05:58,202
But I'll tell you something.

1379
02:06:00,378 --> 02:06:02,380
Everything I needed
to know about life,

1380
02:06:02,424 --> 02:06:03,904
I learned on this track.

1381
02:06:03,947 --> 02:06:05,296
You did?

1382
02:06:06,297 --> 02:06:07,908
I did.

1383
02:06:50,428 --> 02:06:53,388
It's all gonna be okay, Jakob.

1384
02:06:57,087 --> 02:06:59,133
We got some rough times ahead...

1385
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:03,485
but it's gonna be okay.

1386
02:07:05,574 --> 02:07:07,358
'Cause we're family.

1387
02:07:28,641 --> 02:07:32,732
Y haz lo rápido...

1388
02:07:32,775 --> 02:07:34,951
- Fellas.
- Hey.

1389
02:07:36,736 --> 02:07:39,869
Pero rápido...

1390
02:07:39,913 --> 02:07:41,828
What?

1391
02:07:41,871 --> 02:07:44,395
No way.

1392
02:07:55,145 --> 02:07:57,191
What's going on?

1393
02:07:58,496 --> 02:08:01,543
I couldn't believe it
when I heard you were alive.

1394
02:08:05,982 --> 02:08:07,810
It's a long story.

1395
02:08:09,159 --> 02:08:11,684
But for now, let's just
enjoy the moment, huh?

1396
02:08:11,727 --> 02:08:13,381
Guys, this is Elle.

1397
02:08:13,424 --> 02:08:15,600
-Hey, Elle. I'm Sean.

1398
02:08:15,644 --> 02:08:17,428
Just call me T.

1399
02:08:17,472 --> 02:08:19,169
- I'm Earl.
- Nice to meet you.

1400
02:08:20,170 --> 02:08:21,868
Mia.

1401
02:08:25,785 --> 02:08:27,787
Hi. Nice to finally meet you.

1402
02:08:36,926 --> 02:08:39,450
-Mm. -Hey.

1403
02:08:39,494 --> 02:08:41,583
How much longer on this food?

1404
02:08:41,626 --> 02:08:44,238
Like, I'm-I'm...
I'm ready to eat now.

1405
02:08:44,281 --> 02:08:46,762
I've been eating space food
for weeks.

1406
02:08:46,806 --> 02:08:50,113
Oh. So Tootsie Rolls
are space food?

1407
02:08:50,157 --> 02:08:51,375
'Cause that's all you ate.

1408
02:08:51,419 --> 02:08:53,073
It was fat free, bruh.

1409
02:08:53,116 --> 02:08:54,639
Snickers and Twix
fat free, too?

1410
02:08:54,683 --> 02:08:56,424
- My forehead hungry.
- Yeah, okay.

1411
02:08:56,467 --> 02:08:58,707
- I'll see you later. -TEJY-Your forehead is overweight.

1412
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:00,689
Oh!

1413
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:04,519
You drive just like your dad.

1414
02:09:04,562 --> 02:09:07,565
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

1415
02:09:07,609 --> 02:09:09,698
Do you know, this is...

1416
02:09:09,742 --> 02:09:12,092
this is where I met your mom
for the first time.

1417
02:09:12,135 --> 02:09:13,833
Right there.

1418
02:09:13,876 --> 02:09:16,139
She's watching over you
from heaven.

1419
02:09:16,183 --> 02:09:18,228
- She is?
- Mm-hmm.

1420
02:09:21,144 --> 02:09:23,538
I think Daddy has
a question for you.

1421
02:09:27,934 --> 02:09:30,023
You ready to say grace, kid?

1422
02:09:30,066 --> 02:09:31,981
But I don't know what to say.

1423
02:09:32,982 --> 02:09:34,375
Oh, it's easy.

1424
02:09:35,724 --> 02:09:37,813
Just say whatever's
in your heart.

1425
02:09:37,857 --> 02:09:38,858
You ready?

1426
02:09:38,901 --> 02:09:39,989
- Mm-hmm.

1427
02:09:47,127 --> 02:09:48,476
Hey, guys.

1428
02:09:48,519 --> 02:09:50,826
Hey.

1429
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:52,828
Little Brian's ready
to say grace with us.

1430
02:09:52,872 --> 02:09:55,178
Uh-huh. -Nice.-

1431
02:09:55,222 --> 02:09:57,441
Now, hold on.

1432
02:09:57,485 --> 02:09:59,139
There's still an empty chair.

1433
02:10:00,140 --> 02:10:01,402
He's on the way.

1434
02:10:33,913 --> 02:10:36,785
Through the fast lane

1435
02:10:36,829 --> 02:10:39,744
how my whips change

1436
02:10:42,095 --> 02:10:44,749

1437
02:10:44,793 --> 02:10:47,317

1443
02:11:01,027 --> 02:11:03,681

02:11:03,725 --> 02:11:06,554

a hundred in two seconds

1446
02:11:09,122 --> 02:11:12,038
and a Lambo on two necklaces

1447
02:11:12,081 --> 02:11:14,518
I'm too reckless

1448
02:11:14,562 --> 02:11:17,086
Demon, they can't catch it

1449
02:11:17,130 --> 02:11:19,567

1450
02:11:19,610 --> 02:11:22,570

1451
02:11:22,613 --> 02:11:25,399
Better hope you don't choke

02:11:25,442 --> 02:11:28,010

1453
02:11:28,054 --> 02:11:30,839

1455
02:11:33,363 --> 02:11:35,975
through the fast lane

1456
02:11:36,018 --> 02:11:39,065
how my whips change

1457
02:11:41,067 --> 02:11:44,113
you know it's pass me

1458
02:11:44,157 --> 02:11:46,899

1466
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:08,224
and make the wheels go up

1467
02:12:09,704 --> 02:12:11,184
the wrong-wrong choice

1468
02:12:11,227 --> 02:12:13,795

1469
02:12:13,838 --> 02:12:16,537

1479
02:13:25,258 --> 02:13:26,999
Don't go anywhere.

1480
