There is no plausible alternative.

of the word "zombie"

529
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,410
was in a memo from Camp

530

We haven't had contact
with them since.

531
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,685
But this could lead
us to the origin.

532
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,524
If we knew where
this thing started,

533
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,683
then we'd have a chance
of developing a vaccine to stop it.

534
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,604
So we send in Dr.
Fassbach there to look for the source.

If the other guy was a virologist,
what do you do?

709
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,762
There was a memo sent from this
installation 11 days ago.

710
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,320
It had the word "zombie" in it.

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,521
Yeah.

713
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,321
It was an email, not a memo.

714
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,286
Pretty obvious nobody back
home bothered to read it.

715
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,449
Now, there's 15, 16
guys in this room.

716
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,764
Most of them guards.
But all of them were bitten

handcuffed to the cot.

718
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,489
Now, our colonel said
he was the first one.

00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,846

721
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,085

do you know

722
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,004

Then he tried to bite

950

In the month before October 1973,
we saw Arab troop movements,

951

they didn't pose a threat.

00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,205
it's the duty of the tenth

No matter how improbable
it may seem,

960
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,208

to start digging

961

1299
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,848
I'm afraid it boils
down to one simple fact...

You can't make

1309
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,207
I think, because those
people were sick.

1310
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,091
I think they were terminal.

1311

And these things could sense it.

1312
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,002
I think they're
spreading a pathogen,

1313
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,809
and they need a healthy host.

1314
01:31:45,014 --> 01:31:47,215
But even if you're right,
I mean, infecting the populace

1315

with a lethal illness
is not exactly a cure.

1316
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,400
It's not a cure.
It's camouflage.

1317
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,365
It's camouflage.

1318
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,769
There's a natural precedent.
