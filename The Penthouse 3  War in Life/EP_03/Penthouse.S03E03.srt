1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,679
Ro Na will get disqualified
along with Eun Byeol.

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,540
I knew it was you.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,409
Eun Byeol is so dumb.
She's nothing without her mom.

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,479
By the way, whom did you ask
to do this for you?

5
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:22,190
That's a secret.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,359
Jenny seems to have
failed the exam too.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,459
That means I might be
the only one who gets in.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,560
Not everyone gets into SNU.

9
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,629
But you'll get accepted
because you're my daughter.

10
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:45,209
Do you know why
your mother's so nice to you guys?

11
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,640
Why?

12
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:50,049
She wants to become
your sole guardian...

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,120
so she can take the inheritance
of your biological mother.

14
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:58,320
She's not that kind of person.

15
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:04,190
I'm sorry. But it's true.

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,029
She's related to
the death of your biological mother.

17
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,129
Really?

18
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:14,369
Did Logan really kill
our biological mom?

19
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,470
Because of Mom?

20
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,788
- Excuse the mess, everyone.
- Sorry for the mess.

21
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:35,889
We're sorry.

22
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,060
Su Ryeon?

23
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,300
You're Baek Jun Ki, aren't you?

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,470
Let me go. I'm going to kill him.

25
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,269
Baek Jun Ki, who are you really?

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,009
My daughter's there.

27
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:52,310
I can't let her watch her own father
die right before her eyes.

28
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,350
Maybe it was not her.

29
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:31,320
Dad. What's wrong?

30
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,050
Nothing. Let's eat.

31
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,390
Why are you stopping me?

32
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,790
Who are you to interfere in my life?

33
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,489
I'm Shim Su Ryeon.

34
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,860
Shim Su Ryeon?

35
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,468
Where have you been?
Why did you only show up now?

36
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,429
Do you know how much
I was looking for you?

37
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,200
What were you doing when Logan died?

38
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,540
Answer me!

39
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,309
Logan's brother came over.

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,920
- When?
- A while ago.

41
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,588
Why is Logan's family
coming into our home?

42
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:13,420
What was Mom's relationship
with him?

43
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,929
It bothers me
the more I think about it.

44
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,899
Would you do something for me?

45
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:29,410
Drink. It'll calm you down.

46
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:31,910
I was scared.

47
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,610
I came to Korea because of Logan.

48
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,649
But he died before my very eyes.

49
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,619
I was afraid
I'd be framed for his murder.

50
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,760
That's why I ran away.

51
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:48,160
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:50,790
I have so many questions.

53
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,260
Why did Logan bring you to me?

54
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,099
What was Mr. Baek like?

55
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,999
My real name is Joo Dan Tae,

56
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:01,540
not Baek Jun Ki.

57
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,010
Joo Dan Tae?

58
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,010
You're Joo Dan Tae?

59
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,579
Mr. Baek worked for our family
ever since my father...

60
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,380
started a business in Korea.

61
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,219
I looked up to him
like a big brother.

62
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,959
Not long after my family
moved to Japan,

63
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:24,230
Mr. Baek showed up
in the middle of the night.

64
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,829
Why...

65
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,030
How could you...

66
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,040
This isn't you.

67
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,498
You're a good kid.

68
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,169
I don't care about being good!

69
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,809
Just give me my money!

70
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,850
Open the safe now!

71
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,020
You scumbag.

72
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,030
Honey!

73
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,610
Mom...

74
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,249
There was another rat in the house.

75
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
There you are.

76
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,110
Jun Ki!

77
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:24,809
Tell me the code to the safe. Now.

78
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,579
Then I'll let you live.

79
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,590
- You...
- 1-9!

80
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
1-9...

81
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,059
7-1...

82
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,299
0-5-1-9.

83
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,170
1-9-7-1-0-5-1-9.

84
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,470
You loser.

85
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:51,329
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

86
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,439
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

87
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,939
How could he do something
so heinous?

88
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:03,710
When I came to,

89
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,420
I was in a lockdown ward
of a mental hospital.

90
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,850
The police thought he was dead...

91
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,259
since he was never found...

92
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,389
although they had an APB out on him.

93
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:18,290
But he had changed his name.

94
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,230
He took my name, Joo Dan Tae.

95
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,270
His identity was perfect
when I married him.

96
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,698
He said he graduated
from Tokyo University,

97
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,638
and that his parents
who ran a resort in Osaka...

98
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,270
passed away tragically.

99
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:36,779
He even had many guests come
from Japan to our wedding.

100
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,279
Was all of that a lie?

101
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,178
I'm sure he hired them.

102
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,990
Since Jun Ki was an orphan.

103
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,260
He used my identity to marry you.

104
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,490
We could've given him
as much money as he wanted.

105
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:56,270
Why did he kill my parents?
They did nothing wrong!

106
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm going to kill him.

107
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
Is that why...

108
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:08,208
Logan brought you here?

109
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:10,179
He said he'd expose Jun Ki
and his real past...

110
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,579
to make sure
he can never make a comeback.

111
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,650
But...

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,900
I saw Jun Ki here that day.

113
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,500
It was definitely him.

114
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,938
He was disguised as an old man,

115
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:37,370
but those devilish eyes...

116
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,280
were the same from 27 years ago.

117
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:43,609
Old man?

118
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,650
I never forgot it even for a moment.

119
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:49,949
That rat killed Logan. I saw it.

120
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,490
He escaped from prison.
I'm sure of it.

121
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,059
Then that creepy metallic sound...

122
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,260
was Dan Tae?

123
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,300
I couldn't do anything.

124
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,500
I thought he'd try to kill me again.

125
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,270
I should've come to you sooner.

126
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,380
I found this at the scene.

127
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,349
It's the ring
Logan planned to give you.

128
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,530
It seemed like...

129
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,199
he cared for you a lot.

130
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:45,280
He was excited the entire time
about proposing to you.

131
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,959
Are you steadfast...

132
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:06,099
about what you said?

133
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:10,030
That you'll kill Dan Tae.

134
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,270
Of course.

135
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,099
I'll make him pay for what he did.

136
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,670
Now that I'm back as Baek Jun Ki,

137
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,939
I will make him remember...

138
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:24,179
everything he did to me one by one.

139
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,189
Can you sing for your exam tomorrow
after crying all day?

140
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,790
Your voice is all over the place.

141
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,759
Why does everyone suspect me?

142
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,799
What kind of idiot
would put her phone there...

143
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,198
knowing she'd get found out?

144
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:47,568
Someone did it on purpose
to make sure you failed.

145
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:49,010
It was Joo Seok Kyung.

146
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,808
Didn't she act weirdly in the hall?

147
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:54,939
Seok Kyung sang before you,
so she left ahead of time.

148
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,020
The only people left behind
were Eun Byeol and Ms. Jin.

149
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:00,219
Ms. Jin?

150
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,349
Everyone, attention.

151
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,189
You are not allowed to bring in
cell phones or voice recorders.

152
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:08,958
Please take off your headbands...

153
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,859
or any other accessories
that could make you stand out.

154
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:14,500
What is it?

155
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:16,928
It's nothing.

156
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,999
Seoul National University
isn't the only university out there.

157
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,870
Focus on the rest of
your performance exam.

158
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,439
I will not let this incident drop.

159
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,179
Drink up.

160
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,619
(Playing recording)

161
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,529
Jenny doesn't know that...

162
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,500
you went to jail for murder, right?

163
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,370
Of course not.

164
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,800
I'll keep my lips sealed forever.

165
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:55,339
No. No.

166
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,669
My dad's not that kind of man.

167
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,740
No! He's not!

168
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:03,709
No, my dad's not like that.

169
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,219
He's not!

(Opyeong District Development Site)

171
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,209
Did you check the security cameras?

172
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,819
Don't worry. I dealt with them.

173
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,189
The pottery.

174
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,019
I'm carrying them. Let's get to it.

175
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,760
- Let's go.
- It's this way.

(Opyeong District Development Site)

177
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:58,740
So... This is it?

178
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Come along.

179
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,839
It's deeper than it looks.
Watch your footing.

180
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,309
Watch the pottery!

181
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,679
Kyu Jin!

182
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,909
Who made those lousy stairs?

183
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,219
What a dreadful mess they are.

184
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,420
Put them down.

185
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,098
Toady, toady

186
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:39,040
I'll give you Opyeong
if you give me Cheonsoo

187
00:14:44,849 --> 00:14:46,750
(Opyeong District Development Site)

188
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,390
Nice going, Dong Pil!

189
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,769
Sirs, I brought you cold sikhye.

190
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,929
Have a glass.

191
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:05,439
Thank you.

192
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,740
Yoon Chul.

193
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,709
- Show your behind.
- Okay.

194
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,409
I like how you act, little brother.

195
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,649
Thank you, sir.

196
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,719
So, did Eun Byeol do okay
at her performance exam?

197
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:22,188
She had an exam?

198
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:25,219
Oh, dear. Now that
you don't live at Hera Palace,

199
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,219
the ordinary man knows nothing.

200
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,688
I haven't talked to her in a while.

201
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:32,359
Aren't you being too harsh
on your only daughter?

202
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,300
Wouldn't Eun Byeol be upset?

203
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
She would be.

204
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,569
Your twins will both
get into Seoul National University.

205
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,669
Congratulations in advance, sir.

206
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,208
- Thanks.
- SNU, my foot.

207
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,209
That's out the window.

208
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,709
Oh, gosh.

209
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:50,349
You don't know, do you?

210
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,380
Seok Hoon skipped
his performance exam.

211
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,588
What did you say?

212
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,519
Min Hyuk's just like me
and is always in the know,

213
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,389
and your son Seok Hoon...

214
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,760
ran off somewhere
without taking the exam.

215
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:06,729
Why would the studious boy do that?

216
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,800
You're in no position
to worry about someone else's kid.

217
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:12,639
Your daughter Jenny...

218
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,299
failed her exam
because she didn't even sing.

219
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,439
Why wouldn't Jenny sing?

220
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,280
Why wouldn't she?

221
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,539
Why?

222
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,009
How would I know that?

223
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,479
Be quiet!

224
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:34,318
Jenny, you can't go on your own.
I need to come with you.

225
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,728
You'll be busy
with two exams to take today.

226
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,729
We'll be rushed.

227
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,499
How will we get
from Seocho to Sinchon in time?

228
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,199
Should we hire a motorcycle?

229
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:43,799
I'm going alone. Don't tag along.

230
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,799
Wait, Jenny.
What's wrong with your voice?

231
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,709
Did you cry? Do you have a cold?

232
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,178
Jenny, you're still here. I made it.

233
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,639
I'll drive you. Let's go.

234
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,309
Honey, bad news.

235
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,348
Jenny's gone hoarse.
What should we do?

236
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:01,149
You were on a high for a while.

237
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,719
What happened to you?

238
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,689
Jenny.

239
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,160
Is something wrong?

240
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,559
What is it? Yesterday...

241
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
What?

242
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:15,300
I heard you didn't sing
at the SNU exam.

243
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,128
Is that true?

244
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:20,269
You didn't sing? What's that about?

245
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,800
Are you crazy?

246
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:24,669
You'd been waiting for that day
for 11 years.

247
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,319
Jenny. It's okay,
you can talk to Daddy.

248
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,349
- My goodness.
- Jenny.

249
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,019
You brat. How dare you
do that to your dad?

250
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,260
How long were you
going to make a fool of me for?

251
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,520
Did you think it would be a secret
if you didn't tell me forever?

252
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,359
Your passport.

253
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,230
There were no stamps in it
for the past six years.

254
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:53,240
Dubai?

255
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,540
How can you fly to Dubai
with an expired passport?

256
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,180
Which old passport did you look at?

257
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,479
Dad sent your presents...

258
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,979
from his construction site in Dubai.

259
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,450
Stop it already!

260
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,419
Are you really a murderer?

261
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,030
Did you kill someone?

262
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,500
Jenny, there was this situation.

263
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:23,800
What situation justifies murder?

264
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,800
How many things
are you hiding from me?

265
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,168
Mom works at a bathhouse
and Dad's a murder.

266
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:33,079
How many more things are there
that I can be bullied for?

267
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:41,149
I thought our family
could live happily now.

268
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:42,889
What is this?

269
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,220
You ruined everything!

270
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,459
Who told you? Who was it?

271
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,158
Why does that matter? It's all true.

272
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:56,500
It matters. Who told you?

273
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,108
Jenny doesn't know...

274
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:08,479
that you went to jail
for murder, right?

275
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,250
If Joo Seok Kyung knows,

276
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:13,619
the whole school knows.

277
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:27,430
Joo Dan Tae, that scumbag.
I've had enough of it.

278
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:30,230
I will slit his throat...

279
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:32,799
- and go back to prison.
- No!

280
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,469
Don't stop me. I will make him pay.

281
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,710
If you won't do it, I will.

282
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:40,839
Did I say I won't do anything?

283
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:45,680
- I will do it.
- But when?

284
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,550
Give me time.

285
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,149
Until I find proof.

286
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,249
What proof?

287
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,589
Proof that...

288
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,389
Joo Dan Tae killed that woman.

289
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,690
Not me.

290
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,859
Where is that proof?

291
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,030
Under the Hera Palace fountain.

292
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:07,200
The body's still there.

293
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,440
- What?
- So...

294
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,680
wait.

295
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:14,510
I will...

296
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:18,980
dig her back up.

297
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,190
Mr. Baek.

298
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:33,099
Shoot. What do you want?

299
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:34,930
Darn it.

300
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,409
- Logan?
- I'm back.

301
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,879
No!

302
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,409
No!

303
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,490
Logan, that punk.

304
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,589
He's torturing me even in death.

305
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,149
Do you like it?

306
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,930
I thought it would suit you.

307
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,329
Thank you.

308
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,099
I will never forgive him.

309
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,329
I will make him pay...

310
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:21,599
the price of your life.

311
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:35,149
Seok Hoon.

312
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:38,348
Why didn't you take
the exam yesterday?

313
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:39,859
Are you really not going to college?

314
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,118
I want to go to college.

315
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,559
Just not Seoul National University.

316
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,829
I think dad bribed someone.

317
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:48,429
I don't want to get
admitted like that.

318
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,368
Why did he do that?
You would have gotten in anyway.

319
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,270
He probably wanted to make sure.

320
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:56,139
Isn't that what parents are like?

321
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,369
Do anything for their children.

322
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,649
Did you ask him for something?

323
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,579
What are you implying?

324
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:09,349
I can get into SNU by myself, too.

325
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,220
You're not the only smart one here.

326
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,069
I think something's going on between
Seok Kyung and your father.

327
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,510
I heard Ro Na got
disqualified yesterday.

328
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:35,040
I'll keep an eye on Seok Kyung.

329
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,450
I won't tolerate it any longer...

330
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,850
if she keeps on behaving like that.

331
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,629
What are you doing here?

332
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,059
I called him.

333
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,069
I need him to run an errand for me.

334
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:02,399
I already called Assemblyman Bong.

335
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,520
He'll know when you drop it off.

336
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:05,809
Got it.

337
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,919
You wanted me to smile like this
when we're around other people.

338
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:20,169
How do you feel, coming back
for the first time in a while?

339
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,099
It was nice when you lived here, no?

340
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:24,490
When you would bluff and show off...

341
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,260
without ever really fitting in.

342
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,329
My current life suits me better.

343
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,045
I heard you live in
a one-room apartment now?

344
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,098
I told you I could
help you get a studio.

345
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:34,898
I prefer not having anything.

346
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:37,809
No family, no house. You don't
have to worry about me, Chairman.

347
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,680
Don't forget to eat.

348
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:42,649
I hear convenience store meals
are pretty good nowadays.

349
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,899
Thank you, Chairman.
I'll put it to good use.

350
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,839
How was that?

351
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:11,729
Didn't want to be the only one
enjoying that spectacle.

352
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,419
You finally found the right job.

353
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,250
Joo Dan Tae's dog.
It really suits you.

354
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,659
You won't even talk to me?

355
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,118
You'll pay for having betrayed...

356
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,829
Eun Byeol and me.

357
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,559
Curse me all you want.

358
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,300
I'm on the brink now anyway.

359
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:38,929
No one will stay by my side now
other than Chairman Joo.

360
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,299
You better hold on tight
to that string then.

361
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,440
I may cut it off.

362
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:44,639
Or push you off the brink.

363
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:01,119
Was Cheon Seo Jin behind...

364
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,059
what happened
at the examination hall?

365
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,030
I don't think it was her.

366
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,500
Given that Eun Byeol
also didn't do well.

367
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:12,068
Then who was it?

368
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:14,569
There's one person I suspect...

369
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,060
but there's no reason for her
to do that to Eun Byeol.

370
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,480
Could it have been Seok Kyung?

371
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:28,549
She must be very upset...

372
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,649
since her SNU free pass
became invalid.

373
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,290
I want to say no,

374
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:38,690
but I can't.

375
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,260
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

376
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,430
Nothing's for certain as of now.

377
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,839
Ro Na must be dejected.

378
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,020
It was difficult for her
to change her mind.

379
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:51,909
I know.

380
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,450
How's work?

381
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:04,050
I'm trying my best.

382
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,950
We have quite a lot of customers.

383
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,399
Logan's money is gone.

384
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,129
Ten billion dollars.

385
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,540
Do you know anything about that?

386
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:23,669
Me?

387
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,540
How would I know?

388
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,139
That much money.

389
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:32,750
I was never that close with Logan.

390
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:34,819
You know that.

391
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,619
When I go back to America,

392
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,159
I will receive an inheritance
under Seol A's name.

393
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,930
About ten billion dollars.

394
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,199
With that money, I was thinking
I could establish a foundation...

395
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,770
that supports talented
kids like Seol A.

396
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:56,569
Can you...

397
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,540
take on that money for me?

398
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:00,579
What?

399
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:04,180
Why would I?

400
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,720
You can do it yourself.

401
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,749
Su Ryeon is back.

402
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,220
You can ask her, too.

403
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,619
I'm asking because I can't.

404
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,389
Why is that?

405
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,829
No, thanks. Why are you
doing this to me?

406
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,329
How do you trust me?

407
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,470
I might run away with that money.

408
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,010
That would be too bad,
but it would still be my fault...

409
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,740
for having misjudged a character.

410
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,909
But the Yoon Hee I see...

411
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,020
has both good and evil.

412
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,180
That's why I want it to be you.

413
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:44,619
It's something only you can do.

414
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,230
This is the key to my
secret safe in Korea.

415
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
(Seoul Bank VVIP)

416
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:06,040
I won't tell you...

417
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,879
how to use that money. However...

418
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,980
I have one thing to ask for.

419
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,720
What is it?

420
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,859
Don't be alarmed.

421
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:24,430
You can never, ever repeat
what I'm about to say...

422
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,129
to Su Ryeon.

423
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,970
A bloodline of hers...

424
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:33,599
may be alive.

425
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,339
I have to work now, Su Ryeon.
Let's talk later.

426
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:43,409
Yoon Hee.

427
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,250
You don't...

428
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,490
keep any secrets from me, do you?

429
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:57,260
Nothing like that.

430
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,800
What do I have to hide from you?

431
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,770
You still don't trust me?

432
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,010
I do.

433
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,780
I trust you, Yoon Hee.

434
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,690
Ten billion dollars?

435
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,659
How much is that?
Thousand, million...

436
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:34,329
Ten trillion won?

437
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,399
Ten trillion?

438
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:41,970
After Logan died,

439
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:44,270
ten trillion won just disappeared?

440
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,809
Exactly.

441
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,540
No doubt.

442
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:51,509
Whoever killed Logan
also took that money.

443
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,280
That's why they killed Logan.

444
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:57,148
There must be a reason why...

445
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,389
they killed a rich American heir.

446
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,919
Wait a minute.

447
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,559
Did Chairman Joo do this?

448
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,190
Why?

449
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,700
Did Chairman Joo kill Logan?

450
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,398
What are you saying?

451
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,770
Don't pick on innocent people.

452
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,240
This is what my gut tells me.

453
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:21,209
Logan was totally
scammed by Yoon Hee.

454
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,149
Yoon Hee took it?

455
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,709
If not,
where did she get the money...

456
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,219
to buy a place and open a shop?

457
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,780
The deposit alone is crazy high.

458
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:32,418
It looked like Su Ryeon
suspected her too earlier.

459
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:34,960
Wow. She has guts.

460
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,389
How did she swipe
10 billion dollars?

461
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:41,460
Anyway,
I wonder if Chairman Joo knows.

462
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,669
We've identified the person
who came to Korea with Logan Lee.

463
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,838
What does he do?

464
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,740
He's a Korean-Japanese
who lives in Japan.

465
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,470
Japan?

466
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,308
His name is Baek Jun Ki, right?

467
00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:57,750
Yes, sir.
I think he's still in Seoul.

468
00:31:57,809 --> 00:31:59,078
Locate him right now.

469
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,750
I want to see his face.

470
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,889
It couldn't be. No... Right?

471
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,730
There's no way.

472
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,268
Share all my performance videos...

473
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:25,098
that have never been disclosed
on web portals.

474
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:26,439
Also, hire some people
who can publish...

475
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,139
favorable articles and comments.

476
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,210
"The Prima Donna who Faced
an Unfortunate End."

477
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:33,950
That would be an appropriate title.

478
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:38,250
Let everyone know
that Cheon Seo Jin is back.

479
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:41,150
Yes, ma'am.

480
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:42,920
By the way,

481
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,788
Eun Byeol got disqualified
at SNU's performance test...

482
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,190
for cheating.

483
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:50,700
Disqualified? Why?

484
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:54,930
Ro Na had put her cell phone
inside Eun Byeol's pocket.

485
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,240
She's been disqualified too.

486
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,809
I doubt Ro Na did
something so cheeky.

487
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:07,480
Someone must have wanted to get
rid of the two at the same time.

488
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,920
It's Joo Dan Tae,
that jerk's doing again.

489
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:55,589
Jenny!

490
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,548
What do you think you're doing?
Are you out of your mind?

491
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:15,750
Let go! Let go of me!

492
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:17,118
Why are you doing this?

493
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,749
Why would you kill yourself
when I haven't?

494
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,919
I got unfairly disqualified,
but I'm staying strong.

495
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,859
So why would you go
and try to kill yourself?

496
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,659
I can't live like you!

497
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,059
I can't stand living
as a murderer's child.

498
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,989
What are you talking about?

499
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,499
Tell me, Jenny.
Did something happen?

500
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,800
My dad killed a person.

501
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,739
And he's been in prison for that.

502
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,010
What if the kids find out?

503
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,509
I'll be bullied again.

504
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,309
I'll be treated like vermin.

505
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,480
I don't want to go back to that.

506
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,650
I already know what it is like.

507
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:55,489
I'd rather die.

508
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:59,929
Don't worry.

509
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,230
There's no way they'll find out.

510
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:05,860
Joo Seok Kyung knows.

511
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:09,900
It's only a matter of time
before everyone at school knows.

512
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,869
Is that why you messed up
the test yesterday?

513
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,139
How did you deal with it?

514
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:20,050
I'm so scared and anxious.
It's driving me crazy.

515
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:23,980
I fear being bullied...

516
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,489
more than failing to go to college.

517
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,860
This is a nightmare.
I'm losing my mind.

518
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:37,300
Don't cry.
You didn't do anything wrong.

519
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:39,869
You have a test tomorrow too.
You'll lose your voice.

520
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:46,309
We can't let them walk
all over us anymore.

521
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:58,848
I'd love to subscribe
to some newspapers,

522
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:00,649
but I don't know how to sign up.

523
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,860
Can you do it for me?
For the next 200 years.

524
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:07,459
Look, the director came himself.

525
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,180
Are you planning to get
into politics later?

526
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:15,369
Let's have a drink together
and work hard.

527
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,969
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

528
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:24,678
You see, I want
provocative headlines.

529
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,678
- Throw in some quotation marks too.
- Quotation marks.

530
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,249
- "Cultural resources."
- "Cultural resources."

531
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,078
- That's the keyword.
- Okay.

532
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,018
Okay. Good.

533
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:33,465
("Discovery of Cultural Assets
Puts Development on Hold")

534
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:34,489
Here you go.

535
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,959
With the Opyeong District
development put on hold,

536
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,659
there's no land left available
in the Seoul Metropolitan Area.

537
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,130
But Cheonsoo District is
up for development at any time.

538
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:51,939
So please show some support
in the Assembly.

539
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,840
- Of course.
- We can do anything for you.

540
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:57,909
- You can rest assured.
- Don't worry about it.

541
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,550
- Let's drink.
- Sure.

542
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,420
Thank you again.

543
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:20,869
That was easy.

544
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,739
So when will it be announced?

545
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:26,269
They're going to bide their time.

546
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:29,509
I've taken care of the reporters,

547
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,010
so don't worry about the press.

548
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,709
If Cheonsoo District is reselected,

549
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,079
Cheong A Constructions
will be the constructor.

550
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:38,178
The stock prices will soar,

551
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:41,849
and we'll be raking in money.

552
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:46,860
But you don't own much land
in Cheonsoo District, do you?

553
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,230
I thought Na Ae Gyo
sold all the land to us.

554
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,359
I'll have to take everything back...

555
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,300
from Shim Su Ryeon, that wench,
one by one.

556
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:58,800
Let's celebrate with a drink.
We should call Ha Yoon Chul too.

557
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,038
I heard something. When Logan died,

558
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:05,909
a huge amount of money
disappeared. Did you know?

559
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:07,549
What are you talking about?

560
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,618
Logan had left his money
with Oh Yoon Hee temporarily.

561
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,448
So when he died unexpectedly,

562
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:16,460
all his money apparently became
Oh Yoon Hee's.

563
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:18,389
Ten billion dollars.

564
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:23,630
Oh Yoon Hee? Ten billion?

565
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:30,900
Ten billion.

566
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,539
Okay, I'll be right there.

567
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,460
(Cheon Seo Jin's
Special Performance in the US)

568
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,570
What are you doing out here?
It's cold.

569
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:03,869
Ms. Jin.

570
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:06,869
What were you doing?

571
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,070
Nothing.

572
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:13,448
Why were you watching this?

573
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:16,980
A video of Mom's performance
popped up.

574
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,948
It's my first time watching it.

575
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:20,488
Give me my phone.

576
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:22,889
I can't even see my mom now.
At least let me...

577
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,230
"Mom"? Who's your mom?

578
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:28,659
This woman left you. Did you forget?

579
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,799
I'm the one with you now.
I'm your real mom.

580
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,369
Me. Jin Bun Hong!

581
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,199
What did I say will happen
if you betray me?

582
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:38,968
You stupid girl.
How many times did I tell you?

583
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:40,609
I said not to mention your mom.

584
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,908
Is that so hard?

585
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:44,780
How will you get into college
with that stupid brain?

586
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:48,409
Don't make me lose my mind again.
Understood?

587
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,420
Answer me!

588
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,420
Understood?

589
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,460
It's cold.

590
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:05,400
What if you catch a cold?

591
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,269
Let's go home.

592
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,300
Mom will make you
a hot bowl of udon.

593
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,909
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

594
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,179
Good work everyone.

595
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,510
Tonight is on me, so let's drink.

596
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:24,518
After being in the slammer
and returning to society,

597
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,789
I realized how sweet liquor tasted.

598
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:30,089
This is honey in there.

599
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,029
If I were still stuck there,
I would've killed you...

600
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,400
- We were there too.
- We were all there with you.

601
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,469
Dan Tae!

602
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,170
How long has it been?

603
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,409
25 years? No, 27 years?

604
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,280
It has been so long.

605
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:54,779
Do I know you?

606
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,880
It's me, Jun Ki. Baek Jun Ki.

607
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:58,880
Did you forget about me?

608
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,089
Baek Jun Ki?

609
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,159
That's right.

610
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,960
Who is he?

611
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:08,559
Who is this new face
who's so close to Chairman Joo?

612
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:09,829
Hello.

613
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,199
I was surprised to see someone
I liked so much.

614
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,099
May I join you for a bit?

615
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,268
Hey. Wait. I don't think...

616
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:20,138
I lived in the same house as Dan Tae
ever since I was a child.

617
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:22,170
We're like brothers.

618
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,710
Isn't that right?

619
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,380
I'm Baek Jun Ki.

620
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:28,909
You can call me "Mr. Baek"
for short.

621
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,219
Mr. Baek.

622
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:32,679
You have a great personality.

623
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,948
It has been a while
since I've been in Korea,

624
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:36,618
so I really wanted to see you.

625
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,099
What are the chances,
seeing you here?

626
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,389
Have a drink.

627
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:40,888
It's the first time...

628
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:41,889
since Japan, right?

629
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,730
It must be fate. Don't you agree?

630
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,069
Anyway, it's nice to meet you, Baek.

631
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,899
He never tells us anything
about his time in Japan.

632
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,538
We were super curious.

633
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:56,809
So? Will you tell us some stories?

634
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,510
Shall I?

635
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,050
Let's drink.

636
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,380
It'll take a while.

637
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:07,989
Let's chat.

638
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,589
When Dan Tae was in Japan...

639
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,158
Wait, let's talk.

640
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,260
Shall we?

641
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,476
He must have a lot to say
since it has been a while.

642
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,500
I'll be right back.

643
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,368
- What's your problem?
- Stop that.

644
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:27,539
You'll wrinkle my suit.

645
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,610
You know I hate wrinkled clothes.

646
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,150
Anyway, you've changed a lot.
You're unrecognizable.

647
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,049
Your shoes are spotless.

648
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,218
How did you get out?
Who let you out?

649
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:39,219
Why?

650
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,649
Did you think I'd rot away
in that dark mental hospital...

651
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,260
for the rest of my life?

652
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,090
Is that why you took my name
so confidently?

653
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,960
After killing my parents too.

654
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:55,669
How could you think of living
as Joo Dan Tae? You're shameless.

655
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,500
I asked how you got out!

656
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,510
A man named Logan came to see me.

657
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,408
He said someone stole my identity...

658
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:06,880
and was living a lavish life.

659
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:08,750
He asked if I was bitter.

660
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:15,849
I never imagined you were living
like this as a chairman.

661
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,760
Talk about a success story.

662
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:25,630
I can't see that beggar from before
anywhere.

663
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,539
You must not like hearing that.

664
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:35,610
But I think those people in there
would really want to know.

665
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,179
Shut it.

666
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:39,949
Thank the stars you're alive
and get lost.

667
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,578
You won't get a second miracle.

668
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:42,949
Come on, now!

669
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,789
I'm big enough to block that much.

670
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:57,099
You seem to be in a bad mood,

671
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:58,530
so I'll leave for now.

672
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:00,570
See you again.

673
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:03,599
There's a lot I want to talk about.

674
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,610
Darn it.

675
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,589
Follow the guy walking out now.

676
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,489
Find out where he lives
and whom he sees.

677
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,030
Darn it.

678
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,400
You lost him?

679
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,598
You idiot. You call that an excuse?

680
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:40,610
I want your resignation tomorrow!

681
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:43,739
You're finally home.

682
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,780
You...

683
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:51,519
Why are you here?

684
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:55,619
Seo Jin, you have a beautiful home.

685
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:58,659
What a phenomenal view.

686
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:01,590
I wanted to live in a place
like this.

687
00:45:01,889 --> 00:45:03,459
Hey. You...

688
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,500
What is wrong with you?

689
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,069
I know we said
we'd stay out of each other's lives,

690
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,038
but you should've given me
a heads up.

691
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:13,099
Seo Jin, are you sure
I can stay here for a few days?

692
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:14,610
I know Dan Tae said yes,

693
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:17,009
but I hate being a burden.

694
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,579
What are you talking about?

695
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,009
When did I say yes?

696
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:23,519
Well... It's only for a few days.
How could we say no?

697
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,020
Did you forget
what it says in our manual?

698
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,749
"We smile kindly to each other
when others are around."

699
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,889
I'm doing my best
to be nice to your guest.

700
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:35,159
Thanks a bunch.

701
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:38,129
Let's discuss the details tomorrow.

702
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,030
I'm very tired.

703
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:46,739
You are the bomb.

704
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,209
Hey, are you insane?

705
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,650
How dare you come here?

706
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,909
Please watch how you speak.

707
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:59,480
My heart still beats like crazy
whenever I see you.

708
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,389
Because I'm reminded of that day.

709
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,320
I want to rest too.

710
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,860
You should rest as well.

711
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:08,889
You don't look well.

712
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:11,429
Should I take that room?

713
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:46,059
You audacious brat.
You have the nerve to threaten me?

714
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,429
How dare you come here?

715
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,070
Do you think you can...

716
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,179
How is it going?

717
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,178
I expected this much...

718
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:06,789
when I came here.

719
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:10,820
Can't you be a little more creative?

720
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,960
You louse.

721
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,329
Use your brain a little, will you?

722
00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:22,469
Okay?

723
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,269
Get lost, will you?

724
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:31,380
I'm tired.

725
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:42,750
Seriously. Take this. Here.

726
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,000
He must have something huge
on Dan Tae.

727
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,579
I know you can do that much for me.

728
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,610
I really want to go to Seoul
National University with my brother.

729
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,150
Make sure he can take
the performance test again.

730
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,920
You said you'd do anything for me.

731
00:48:56,429 --> 00:48:59,499
I'm really grateful
for what you did to Ro Na.

732
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,630
Just use your connections again
for Seok Hoon...

733
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:02,869
Joo Seok Kyung!

734
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:05,769
Seok Hoon.

735
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,869
Have you and Dad been scheming?

736
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:13,380
Did you ask him
to get Ro Na disqualified?

737
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:17,348
Tell me the truth.

738
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:19,210
Just pretend you don't know.

739
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,519
Why do you have to live like this?

740
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,919
When are you going to stop?

741
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,760
Why is going to university
so important to you?

742
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,429
It's not about university.

743
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,030
Then what is it?

744
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,130
I hate Mom.

745
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:36,769
It's driving me crazy.

746
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:39,069
Mom is back,
but I still feel lonely.

747
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:41,399
I want her to only think about me,
but she doesn't.

748
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,739
To her,

749
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:45,268
Ro Na means more than me.

750
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:48,078
She doesn't care a bit
about what I want.

751
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,309
That's because...

752
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,380
what you want is ridiculous.

753
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:55,380
Who gives you the right
to interfere in someone else's life?

754
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,849
For both Ro Na and Eun Byeol,

755
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,659
Seoul National University
was a dream.

756
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,829
Think about your own sister,
who's right next to you.

757
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,260
This isn't the time
for dating around.

758
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,840
I was praying I was wrong.

759
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,210
Was it really your doing?

760
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,979
If you must trample on others
to climb higher,

761
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,280
can you really be proud of yourself?

762
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,519
I don't care.

763
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,989
What's so wrong with getting
what I want while I can?

764
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,549
When Dad was arrested,
no one sympathized with us.

765
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,519
If Dad has the power to do it,
why should I say no?

766
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:40,079
The Seoul National University
interview is today.

767
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,800
You can't go. Give up.

768
00:50:43,699 --> 00:50:46,499
Says who?
Who are you to decide that?

769
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,038
I can't let you go to
Seoul National University.

770
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:50,539
Too bad. I will.

771
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,980
Everything will be okay
as long as you just let it go.

772
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,519
You can do that much for me,
can't you?

773
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,190
If you really love me,
please do that for me.

774
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,360
Don't you even feel sorry for me?

775
00:51:11,889 --> 00:51:15,059
Please. Please let me go.

776
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:18,599
If I miss the interview,
I won't be admitted.

777
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:21,570
You don't have to feel bad.
Just leave.

778
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:24,469
Are you out of your mind?

779
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,980
Mom, I have to go to the interview.

780
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:34,650
Please open the door, Mom.

781
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,190
Open up!

782
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,989
- Don't let her out no matter what.
- I have to go to the interview!

783
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:44,230
Open up!

784
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,630
- Are you okay?
- Mom!

785
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,868
- I'm okay. Don't worry.
- This isn't funny.

786
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:52,630
Open up!

787
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,209
I have to go to the interview.

788
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:57,969
Mom, I have to...

789
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:09,519
Shim Su Ryeon,
what do you think you're doing?

790
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,320
Come any closer,
and I'll slit his throat.

791
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:20,729
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from my daughter?

792
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:23,799
Your daughter? Don't be ridiculous.

793
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,698
You're not even related.
You're just her stepmom.

794
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:28,900
You're right. You should be grateful
that you're related to her.

795
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:31,210
There's only one reason
I'm keeping you alive.

796
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,638
Being your blood...

797
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:36,309
might prove useful
to my kids someday.

798
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:39,949
Don't ruin Seok Kyung any further.

799
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:43,489
If you're really her father,
leave her alone.

800
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,829
Are you okay, sir?

801
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,329
Can't you do a better job?

802
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,869

803
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:07,510
I can't believe him.

804
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:19,860
Get dressed. Let's go.

805
00:53:21,389 --> 00:53:23,030
Are you serious, Mom?

806
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:26,829
Thank you. Thank you so much.

If you have ever been...

817
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,049
bullied by Joo Seok Kyung,

818
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,380
please raise your hand.

819
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:26,590
Oh, dear.

What do you think you're doing?

821
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:36,098
You were all bullies like me.

822
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:38,829
And now you're putting
all the blame on me?

823
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,768
You threatened us
into bullying other kids.

824
00:54:42,769 --> 00:54:43,868
You threatened...

825
00:54:43,869 --> 00:54:46,578
that your dad would
kick us out of SNU Club.

826
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:49,710
Your word is law at school.
What else could we do?

827
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:52,280
Tell us the truth.

828
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:55,549
You framed me
at the performance test, didn't you?

829
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:56,849
Do you have proof?

830
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,389
Can you prove that I did that?

831
00:54:59,489 --> 00:55:00,860
I heard you say it.

832
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:03,589
You asked Dad
to get Ro Na disqualified.

833
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:04,629
Seok Hoon.

834
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:07,630
You shook me up before the test
on purpose.

835
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:10,129
Blame your sensitivity.

836
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:11,429
Joo Seok Kyung!

837
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,539
Apologize.

838
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:17,170
If you sincerely apologize
for what you've done,

839
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:19,739
you'll be able to avoid
the worst punishment.

840
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,010
This is your last chance.

841
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:27,920
Okay.

842
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:30,150
I'll sincerely apologize.

843
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,820
I'm so sorry, guys.

00:55:34,989 --> 00:55:37,530

thinking for yourselves.

that your dad is a murderer.

851
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:01,750
I didn't expect you
to get so shocked.

852
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:03,848
I just thought you should know.

853
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:05,549

why I should be criticized.

Yes.

You're right.

for the past six years.

criticized by you, of all people.

after all.

00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:40,939
You knew all along...

898
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,198
that I told Seok Kyung.

899
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:46,038
And you stuck close,
calling me "sir"...

900
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:48,138
and bowing to me? Is that it?

901
00:59:48,139 --> 00:59:49,380
Tell me!

902
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:51,578
I'm sure you wanted
to get rid of me...

903
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:53,650
because I made
your precious princess cry!

904
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,429
Yes. I wanted to kill you.

905
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,929
I was so resentful,
I wanted to kill you.

906
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:12,829
Much more than
how my daughter's heart broke,

907
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:17,039
mine broke a hundred,
a thousand times more, right here!

908
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:23,309
My heart hurt enough
that I felt it was being torn.

909
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:30,050
Can't I feel that way?

910
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:31,590
I'm a dad too.

911
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:33,219
What did you say, punk?

912
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:40,429
To be honest,
when you told Seok Kyung,

913
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,099
didn't you mean for it to reach me?

914
01:00:44,699 --> 01:00:46,500
Since I'm the murderer.

915
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:49,440
Not you.

916
01:00:51,139 --> 01:00:52,409
But...

917
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,809
I will keep my word.

918
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,880
As long as you don't betray me.

919
01:01:04,949 --> 01:01:06,320
You are...

920
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,030
so very straightforward, Mr. Yoo.

921
01:01:10,489 --> 01:01:13,329
This is why I like you so much.

922
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:19,170
We've known each other
for many years.

923
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:21,369
It's for the better.

924
01:01:21,769 --> 01:01:24,610
I couldn't lie
to my daughter forever.

925
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:28,239
My wife has a fiery temper,

926
01:01:28,909 --> 01:01:32,010
and I barely managed
to stop her from coming after you.

927
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:33,980
I deserve some praise for that.

928
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:41,090
I apologize instead
for what Seok Kyung did.

929
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:44,488
She got her temper from me,

930
01:01:44,489 --> 01:01:46,130
and she's so impatient.

931
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:48,960
Here.

932
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:51,900
Thank you.

933
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,940
Stand up straight now.

934
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,369
Chairman Joo, let's play!

935
01:02:00,909 --> 01:02:03,280
Come on, Mr. Baek.

936
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:06,349
Hi.

937
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,749
We met outside.

938
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,388
He said he's scheduled to see you.

939
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:14,690
I heard that
you two are living together.

940
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:17,289
I'm here to walk you home.

941
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,589
I asked your wife
to cook us something nice.

942
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:22,428
Can Kyu Jin join you, then?

943
01:02:22,429 --> 01:02:25,198
I haven't seen Seo Jin
in a while. Can I come?

944
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,699
- No, you...
- Kyu Jin.

945
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:29,170
You can come. Can't he?

946
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,170
My goodness.

947
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,578
You're like a brother I lost
during the war 70 years ago.

948
01:02:34,579 --> 01:02:36,280
Where were you all this while?

949
01:02:36,579 --> 01:02:38,750
- I was right here.
- Were you?

950
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,249
- Dong Pil, let's go.
- Let's go.

951
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,349
Let's go!

952
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:45,119
(Cheong A Group)

953
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:49,089
Mr. Baek, get close.
Let's do a love shot.

954
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:50,860
Come on, move in close.

955
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:55,359
Check everything.
It's all about the plating.

956
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,429
Pink flowers, purple flowers,
beautifully and harmoniously.

957
01:02:58,869 --> 01:02:59,869
Yes, there.

958
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,070
Seo Jin. When did you
prepare all this?

959
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:05,309
You're the best.

960
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,379
I get upset too easily.

961
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,579
Even more so after being in jail.

962
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,880
It has that effect.

963
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,849
- The effect...
- I heard.

964
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:18,119
Thanks to you,
Eun Byeol was disqualified.

965
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:20,190
You did something gutsy.

966
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:23,960
Was the card I was holding
not much of a threat?

967
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:25,690
That was...

968
01:03:26,059 --> 01:03:29,099
So, is the food to your liking?

969
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,599
Of course, it is.

970
01:03:32,269 --> 01:03:33,670
I love it,

971
01:03:34,469 --> 01:03:37,169
but I'm not sure if
Dan Tae's enjoying himself.

972
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:41,879
Why wouldn't he be?
This is his favorite course meal.

973
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,749
He has such expensive taste,

974
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:48,119
he's known not to eat anything
that wasn't cooked by a hotel chef.

975
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:51,050
What? Haven't you changed
a bit too much?

976
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:53,959
You used to love silkworm larva,
chicken gizzard,

977
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,158
pigskin, stuff like that.

978
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,658
Silkworm larva?

979
01:03:57,659 --> 01:03:59,760
My honey hates things like that.

980
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,230
But then, he has changed a lot.

981
01:04:03,429 --> 01:04:06,570
He used to wear
the same pair of sneakers.

982
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,739
Now he wears nice suits and shoes.

983
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:13,809
I'm surprised by
how much someone can change.

984
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,408
Gosh. I can't imagine any of that.

985
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:18,909
I'm so curious!

986
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:22,018
Jun Ki, do you have any old photos?

987
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:23,379
There's nothing of the sort!

988
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:26,150
Why isn't there? There is.

989
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,419
- Let's see.
- Show us.

990
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:32,230
You in your dark ages.

991
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:34,559
Come on! This is gold!

992
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:42,198
Come on. What is it? Show us...

993
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:43,570
Know when to stop.

994
01:04:43,769 --> 01:04:44,769
My gosh.

995
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:49,239
Will you show us
a photo of your dark ages?

996
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,949
Yes, Chairman Joo. Show us.

997
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,719
Show us!

998
01:04:54,949 --> 01:04:56,780
Show us! Show...

999
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:58,989
- Honey!
- I said stop it!

1000
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:08,400
How could he throw you down?

1001
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:11,300
What was that about? He's so nasty.

1002
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:13,530
Do you think...

1003
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:17,440
he got a whole new face
to look like what he does now?

1004
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,638
My goodness.

1005
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,408
We used to call him
Dan Tae the Small-minded.

1006
01:05:24,409 --> 01:05:27,348
What? He's small-minded and nasty?

1007
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:28,679
He is!

1008
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:33,659
Dan Tae the Small-minded.

1009
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:35,558
Dan Tae the Small-minded.

1010
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:38,059
(Korean Name, Baek Jun Ki)

1011
01:05:38,989 --> 01:05:40,500
That lunatic!

1012
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,500
Did you take a look?

1013
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,138
They're just curious.

1014
01:05:47,139 --> 01:05:49,198
You didn't have to ruin the mood.

1015
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:51,639
What are you up to?
What is it you want?

1016
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:54,780
Stop playing around and speak up.

1017
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:59,349
Why do you feel so wronged
enough to be this angry?

1018
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:03,280
One would think
I took something from you.

1019
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:07,420
You took my family's riches
and lived a nice life with my name.

1020
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,530
You should know to give back now.

1021
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,480
Give your little brother
some pocket money for his struggles.

1022
01:06:29,139 --> 01:06:31,349
Let's have silkworm larva
and soju, your favorite.

1023
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:32,980
On me.

1024
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:36,420
Memories will come flooding back.
Wouldn't that be nice?

1025
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,119
What are you two doing there?

1026
01:06:39,949 --> 01:06:41,920
I don't want to see
the photo anymore.

1027
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:44,260
Let's just have some fun.

1028
01:06:45,929 --> 01:06:48,400
I'm coming. I'll be right there.

1029
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,800
Come along.

1030
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:52,900
Come on.

1031
01:06:57,309 --> 01:07:00,579
I'll make you regret not dying...

1032
01:07:00,909 --> 01:07:02,739
with your parents back then.

1033
01:07:03,809 --> 01:07:05,210
You crazy jerk.

1034
01:08:05,769 --> 01:08:07,110
(Shim Su Ryeon)

1035
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:34,339
(Safety first)

1036
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,539
Coming through.

1037
01:08:43,239 --> 01:08:44,510
(Shim Su Ryeon)

1038
01:08:44,609 --> 01:08:46,079
What are you going to do with this?

1039
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:51,720
I'll put lot 27
in Cheonsoo District...

1040
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:53,649
in your name.

1041
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:57,460
You can trust me.
I'll turn your life around.

1042
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:02,800
Did you eat?

1043
01:09:03,829 --> 01:09:04,930
Let's eat together then.

1044
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:17,009
Following the discovery
of valuable cultural resources,

1045
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:19,579
the Opyeong District development
has been canceled.

1046
01:09:19,649 --> 01:09:21,519
The Ministry of Land
held an emergency briefing...

1047
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,219
to look for alternatives.

1048
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,219
Cheonsoo District is once again
being considered...

1049
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:26,819
as a strong candidate.

1050
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:28,359
Cheonsoo District...

1051
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,028
("Cheonsoo District
Considered for Development")

1052
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:35,059
- Nice.
- Congratulations, Mr. Joo.

1053
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:36,760
Thank you.

1054
01:09:37,159 --> 01:09:38,270
Congratulations, Kyu Jin.

1055
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:42,038
Let's drink.

1056
01:09:42,039 --> 01:09:44,310
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1057
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:46,839
Experts say...

1058
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,438
Cheonsoo District is appropriate
for development...

1059
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,948
Some people are...

1060
01:09:50,949 --> 01:09:53,078
just luckier than others.

1061
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:55,879
Many hope
that the development plan...

1062
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,520
will be implemented soon.

1063
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,090
How are things
between you and Seok Kyung?

1064
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,989
Maybe you should've
at least let her graduate.

1065
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:09,600
If she can't graduate,
she can't go to college this year.

1066
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:15,069
Logan once told me...

1067
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,140
once I decided
to get Seol A's revenge,

1068
01:10:19,869 --> 01:10:23,010
I wouldn't be able to go back to
being Seok Hoon and Seo Kyung's mom.

1069
01:10:25,949 --> 01:10:27,520
But I disagree.

1070
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:32,090
I believe the twins will
understand and forgive me someday.

1071
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,858
Hi, Hye In. It's Mom.

1072
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:43,459
Mom, I'm almost done with my rehab.

1073
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,800
I can go to Korea soon.

1074
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:48,300
Really? Do you have
your doctor's permission?

1075
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:51,569
Yes. I can't wait to see you.

1076
01:10:51,909 --> 01:10:55,079
By the way, why haven't I heard
anything from Logan in a while?

1077
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,140
Please tell him I feel hurt.

1078
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:58,779
Well...

1079
01:10:59,649 --> 01:11:01,319
He's very busy.

1080
01:11:03,949 --> 01:11:06,119
I miss you so much.

1081
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,520
I can't wait until you're here.

1082
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,659
Me neither. I have to go, Mom.

1083
01:11:10,989 --> 01:11:12,590
Talk to you later.

1084
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:16,060
Is Hye In coming back?

1085
01:11:19,569 --> 01:11:21,500
Her treatment is almost over.

1086
01:11:21,699 --> 01:11:23,470
I should look after her.

1087
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:26,470
She doesn't know about
what happened to Logan, right?

1088
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:31,350
He took such good care of her.
She liked him so much.

1089
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,479
I'll tell her once she gets here.

1091
01:11:40,819 --> 01:11:44,460
You said Joo Dan Tae switched
Seol A and Hye In, right?

1092
01:11:45,289 --> 01:11:47,859
Which hospital was it?

1093
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:49,430
Why are you asking?

1094
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:53,529
I'm wondering if I could find
Hye In's biological mom.

1095
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,170
Why would you find her?

1096
01:11:55,739 --> 01:11:58,569
She gave up her baby
after getting paid by Joo Dan Tae.

1097
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:00,609
Who knows if she regrets it?

1098
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:03,979
I'll ask around quietly.

1099

01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,189
Ms. Shim Su Ryeon?

1102
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:13,720
I remember her.

1103
01:12:13,989 --> 01:12:16,858
Her condition was serious when she
was transferred here from the US.

1104
01:12:16,859 --> 01:12:19,260
She was hospitalized here
for quite a while.

1105
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,130
Could I have a look
at her medical records?

1106
01:12:24,029 --> 01:12:25,898
Her baby got switched...

1107
01:12:25,899 --> 01:12:28,140
while she was in the incubator.

1108
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,100
At my clinic?

1109
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,908
That can't be possible.

1110
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:35,039
It's already been confirmed.

1111
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:38,149
I'd like to contact
the other mother.

1112
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:40,949
Even if that really happened,

1113
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:44,219
I can't give you
my patient's personal information.

1114
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:47,619
Your clinic is responsible
for what happened to the babies.

1115
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,390
And you refuse to cooperate?

1116
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,329
Then I'll have to come back
with the police.

1117
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,210
She gave birth around the same time
as Ms. Shim.

1118
01:13:05,409 --> 01:13:07,069

I'll make sure you and your clinic
are not held responsible.

By any chance,

1124
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,229
does the record say
Ms. Shim gave birth to twins?

1125
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:35,670
No. It says she gave birth
to a baby girl.

with Joo Dan Tae...

I'm disappointed.

1144

He's so paranoid that
he changes his phone every week.

1145
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,869

she's scheming behind our back?

and teamed up with Joo Dan Tae?

1154
