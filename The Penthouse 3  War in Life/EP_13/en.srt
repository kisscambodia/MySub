PREVIOUSLY ON PENTHOUSE...

2
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,540
(Episode 13)

3
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:38,190
(Number Withheld)

4
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,030
(Number Withheld)

5
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,769
(Speaker)

6
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:49,299
Shim Su Ryeon.
You look even more beautiful today.

7
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,310
Logan beside you
looks pretty good too.

8
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,710
Come to the penthouse right now.
I'll give you five minutes.

9
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,179
But you have to come alone.

10
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,250
If you don't listen,

11
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,350
I might just blow Hera Palace up.

12
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,899
I set up some bombs here and there.

13
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,570
I miss you, so come quickly.

14
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:29,280
Ring the emergency bell!
It's an emergency.

15
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,950
Evacuate all residents. Now!

16
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,420
Ring the emergency bell. Quickly.

17
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,950
Attention all residents.

18
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,989
There is a bomb in Hera Palace.

19
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,120
Please evacuate promptly.

20
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,170
If the elevator's full,
take the stairs.

21
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,099
Be careful not to get hurt.

22
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,000
Take the emergency stairs!

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,239
This way! Be careful!

24
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,609
Move! A person fell!

25
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,549
Easy. Let's go!

26
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,750
This way!

27
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,159
Are you okay?

28
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,659
- A bomb will set off!
- Run!

29
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,329
- Hurry!
- This way!

30
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:26,300
No! Are you okay?

31
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,400
Wait!

32
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,900
Go now!

33
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,509
Get in the elevator!

34
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,509
Seok Kyung!
Why are you standing there?

35
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,310
Let's go.

36
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,180
Mom, please don't die.

37
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,020
You better make it out alive!

38
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,219
- First floor.
- Get in!

39
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,520
Hurry.

40
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,289
- Go quickly.
- Stop.

41
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,629
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

42
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,530
Someone's still in there.

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,500
Seok Kyung!

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,599
Seok Kyung!

45
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,500
Are you crazy?
It's dangerous! We don't have time!

46
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,409
Let me go. I can't let her die.

47
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,569
- No! Wait!
- Gosh.

48
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,580
Guys, no!

49
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,080
No! Wait!

50
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,210
- Are you okay?
- Thank you.

51
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,650
They'll be back soon.
Just a second.

52
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,879
Jenny!

53
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,120
Jenny!

54
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:20,860
Please wait just a second.

55
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,219
Hurry.

56
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,330
(Max capacity)

57
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,430
- Get in!
- No!

58
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,759
No!

59
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,199
- The emergency stairs!
- Let's run.

60
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,610
Thank you for coming
to my engagement party, Joo Dan Tae.

61
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,550
You finally showed up.

62
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:26,960
At last,

63
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,460
I can kill you with my own hands.

64
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,959
Do you really think that can happen?

65
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,800
Congratulations on your
engagement to Logan.

66
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,800
I prepared a last-minute present.

67
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,569
I wonder if you'll like it.

68
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,269
If I press this button,

69
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,279
it will set off the bombs in
the fountain and the penthouse.

70
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,220
They're much stronger than the ones
I set up in Logan's car last time.

71
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,480
You can look forward to them.

72
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,279
Boom.

73
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Boom.

74
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,350
Boom.

75
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,459
You crazy jerk.

76
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,230
If you want to die, die alone.

77
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,500
Why should I be the only one to die?

78
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,870
What did I do wrong?

79
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,540
Do you know that it was your dad...

80
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,209
who killed my mom and sister?

81
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,439
Your father of Simoon Construction...

82
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,339
took away my house.

83
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,209
What's so wrong with taking back...

84
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:24,550
what was taken from me?

85
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,879
Lot 27 of Cheonsoo District
always belonged to my dad.

86
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,250
It was your parents who lived on
that land without permission.

87
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,759
The demolition accident was all
Baek Joon Ki's father.

88
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,560
My dad knew nothing.

89
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,930
Don't make excuses!

90
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,930
The noble Shim Su Ryeon...

91
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,470
never admits to doing anything wrong
even until the end.

92
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,600
Don't move.

93
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,970
How dare you defile my Hera Palace?

94
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:53,639
Only I can have this place.
Only I can destroy it.

95
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,379
If I can't have it, no one can.
You understand?

96
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,449
Dying alone felt lonely.

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,589
It comforts me to know that
it will be with you.

98
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:08,560
Nice dress.

99
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,459
That's the perfect outfit
for you to wear to the fiery pit.

100
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,509
Drop the remote.

101
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,279
You think you can shoot me?

102
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,279
I will press the button
the moment you pull the trigger.

103
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,180
Then Hera Palace will disappear
in the blink of an eye.

104
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,019
Come on. Shoot me!

105
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,060
I said, drop the remote!

106
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,430
And I said you'll die
if you keep challenging me.

107
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,329
Just like your ex-husband.

108
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:51,000
Just like Min Seol A.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,329
Just like Oh Yoon Hee!

110
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,399
Shoot me!

111
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,779
This is for...

112
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,779
all the innocent lives
you took away!

113
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,079
You're crazy!

114
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,649
How dare you shoot at me,
the mighty Joo Dan Tae?

115
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,560
Are you still obsessed
with that name?

116
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,990
This is you paying...

117
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,730
for all the crimes you've committed.

118
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,799
Drop the remote!

119
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,710
Shim Su Ryeon,

120
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,779
let's go together...

121
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,840
to the fiery pit.

122
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:16,500
Stop it!

123
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:18,740
Stop it, Joo Dan Tae!

124
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:52,139
Seok Kyung, Seok Hoon.

125
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:57,350
I love you so much.

126
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,929
Su Ryeon!

127
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,669
Are you okay?

128
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,570
Why did you come here?

129
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,269
Why did you come here?

130
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,039
We have to get out of here. Hurry.

131
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:32,509
A little more.

132
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,879
I killed Dan Tae.

133
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,389
You did nothing wrong.

134
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,950
It's all good now. It's over.

135
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,419
What about the others?

136
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,429
We evacuated everyone.
They're all safe.

137
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,970
Are you okay?

138
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,730
I'll let you live like
Shim Su Ryeon.

139
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:21,460
I'll make so much money
that you can get buried under it.

140
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,470
We can buy a house in Gangnam
and build a building.

141
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,100
I'll make everyone in the world
kneel at my feet.

142
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,009
And we'll have kids?

143
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:34,539
Of course.

144
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,809
A son and a daughter.

145
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,720
Our kids will live in
the most expensive...

146
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,120
and the highest home in the country.

147
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,990
The closest to paradise.

148
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,460
Wow. I'm so happy just imagining it.

149
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,889
Hera Palace, the most expensive
apartment in Korea...

150
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:09,230
and the symbol of Seoul
has collapsed.

151
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,070
Hera Palace, which had led
the domestic real estate market...

152
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,570
with its property value
that skyrocketed year after year,

153
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,840
was completed demolished yesterday...

154
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,169
after bombs set by
Chairman Joo Dan Tae,

155
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:21,809
who personally designed Hera Palace,
exploded.

156
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,350
The 100-story apartment building
with a shelter...

157
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,080
that could house 200 people
during a nuclear war...

158
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,490
and boasted infrastructure
that could withstand earthquakes...

159
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,419
was destroyed
by a suicide bomber.

160
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:38,230
Chairman Joo Dan Tae obtained
illegal homemade bombs...

161
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,500
through Cho,
who used to be his secretary.

162
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,700
Cho's body was found this morning.

163
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,740
The cause of death
has not been determined.

164
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,139
More than 90 percent
of the residents...

165
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,639
had already moved out of
Hera Palace.

166
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,679
And thanks to the quick response
of the residents,

167
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:57,809
there was not a single casualty.

168
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,720
However, since the residents were
mostly from the upper class,

169
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,990
the damage is expected
to be astronomical.

170
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,820
People who are angry
with Joo Dan Tae's many deeds...

171
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,789
that threatened
innocent people's lives...

172
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:12,129
gathered in front of
the Blue House...

173
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:14,629
to oppose Joo Dan Tae's funeral.

174
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,200
Joo Dan Tae...

175
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:25,039
threatened me and said...

176
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:28,240
he had hidden bombs
all over Hera Palace.

177
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:33,480
He said they were much stronger
than the ones in Logan's car.

178
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:36,120
He confessed all of that to me.

179
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:39,419
In other words,
it was Joo Dan Tae...

180
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,220
who tried to kill Logan.

181
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,330
These are photos from the scene.

182
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,269
He wore an old man's disguise,
but it's definitely Dan Tae.

183
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:55,970
Since the suspect is deceased,

184
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,909
we cannot investigate.

185
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:03,379
Also, we found a laptop
in Mr. Cho's mother's home.

186
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,649
We've obtained a lot of evidence
of the many crimes...

187
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:08,679
Joo Dan Tae had committed.

188
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,250
It's tragic that all of this
finally surfaced...

189
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,220
only after his death.

190
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,830
Dan Tae and I were divorced,

191
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,059
but he's the father of my children.

192
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:28,269
Since this happened
during my engagement ceremony,

193
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:30,539
I feel partly responsible.

(Hera Palace Compensation

195
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,339
We plan to compensate
the residents of Hera Palace...

196
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:37,109
for the damages suffered
due to Joo Dan Tae's bombing...

197
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,049
from our personal funds.

198
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:42,319
Thus, I will donate
ten billion dollars...

199
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,420
to establish a foundation
for the victims.

200
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,359
Moreover, Logan Lee Corporation
will acquire Cheong A Group,

201
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:53,259
which went bankrupt
due to its owner's improper acts...

202
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:56,630
to minimize the loss suffered
by shareholders and employees.

203
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,700
I will also donate
my personal funds...

204
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,339
and do my best to help the victims...

205
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,509
and with the disaster relief efforts.

206
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,609
To the people who suffered...

207
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:10,009
psychologically and financially
in this accident,

208
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:12,309

- Ten billion dollars?

- CEO Logan Lee said...
- That's where the ten billion goes?

217

The death suit you very well.

221
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,069
I brought the medicine
from the hospital.

222
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Good.

Whenever my appointment's set,
get my medicine from the hospital.

226
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,950
I'll do that.

227
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,089
Also, congratulations.

228
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,349
With Joo Dan Tae's death,

229
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:29,160
you no longer have to
repay his debt.

230
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:31,759

are helping me?

00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,180
- Eun Byeol hasn't noticed, right?
- Not at all.

234
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,950
Keep your wits about you
and don't mess up around her.

235
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:53,009
She's a sensitive kid.

236
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,819
If she realizes
I didn't take the medicine,

237
00:20:57,819 --> 00:20:59,990
she might feel betrayed
and who knows what she'll do then?

238
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,599
Mom.

239
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,339
I'll erase all your bad memories...

240
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:23,009
so you can always be happy.

00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:25,809

242
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,720
just for you.

243
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:42,759
My goodness.
You did a beautiful job.

244
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:46,269
- Do you like it?
- Of course, I love it.

245
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,000
I can't believe this.

246
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,109
Mom, shall we drink?

247
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Sounds good.

248

Who's that?

249
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,500
I'll go and see.

250
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:02,779
Mom, it's our photo.

251
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,180
Don't we look lovely?

252
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,690
Eun Byeol, how come
you're so pretty?

253
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,430
Her testimony
is my only way out now.

254
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:27,869
If Su Ryeon releases the evidence
that I killed Yoon Hee,

255
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,109
Eun Byeol has to say I have
drug-induced early onset dementia.

256
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:34,440
Is that possible?

257
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:36,380
The police...

258
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,279
will make you take tests
when you're under their supervision.

259
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,079
Your current diagnosis
won't be enough.

260
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,750
That's why I need Eun Byeol.

261
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,619
I'm unlike
any other dementia patient.

262
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:49,119
My dementia is
a side effect of a medicine.

263
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:52,059
No doctor can be sure
of my condition.

264
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,460
More than the opinion
of ten psychiatrists,

265
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,000
Eun Byeol's statement
will have more weight.

266
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,869
What will you do now?

267
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,599
First, I need
to send Eun Byeol abroad.

268
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,839
I can join her
once my travel ban is lifted.

269
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:09,609
Once I can prove
I'm too mentally unstable...

270
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:12,509
and my mind won't allow
a normal life,

271
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,849
not even the law can tie me down.

272
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:36,669
Sir. Are you awake?

273
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,209
Do you hear my voice?

274
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,480
If you can hear me, nod your head.

275
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,320
Good.

276
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,590
Sir. Can you say your name?

277
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,119
Ha...

278
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,090
Yoon Chul.

279
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,060
It seems like he recovered
his consciousness.

280
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,230
I thought he'd never wake up.

281
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,669
It looks like his determination
created a miracle.

282
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:08,270
Thank you. You did a great job.

283
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:10,639
- Logan.
- Yes.

284
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,469
It's me, Dr. Ha.

285
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,169
Well done.

286
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,909
Good for you. I knew you'd wake up.

287
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,949
Eun Byeol!

288
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:21,550
Come on! Eun Byeol!

289
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:36,260
Ro Na. Was she badly hurt?

290
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:40,369
Thanks to you, she wasn't.
She was treated as an outpatient.

291
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,399
She's just fine now.

292
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,310
That's great.

293
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,010
Thank you.

294
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,939
Thanks so much.

295
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,310
I'll let you talk.

296
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:56,020
Joo Dan Tae. What happened to him?

297
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,260
He died. In Hera Palace.

298
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,490
He got blown up by a bomb
he set himself.

299
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:08,800
Is he really dead? Are you sure?

300
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,699
It'll be hard to find his body.

301
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,070
It was the world's
most dreadful and pathetic death.

302
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,439
Now only Cheon Seo Jin's left.

303
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,209
Cheon Seo Jin.

304
00:26:19,939 --> 00:26:21,980
She put Ro Na in danger.

305
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:24,209
How dare she still...

306
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,080
She wasn't badly hurt,
so she was discharged.

307
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,850
She's staying in a small apartment.

308
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,350
Now that Dan Tae's dead,

309
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,750
the loan sharks
are no longer after her.

310
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,760
Other than her secretary
who gets her dementia medication,

311
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:40,859
she herself doesn't do much.

312
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,830
Dementia medication?

313
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,100
She's showing signs
of acute dementia.

314
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:49,469
She can't recognize people,

315
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:51,669
and she lost whole chunks of memory.

316
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:53,369
Dementia, just like that?

317
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,679
It'll be a lie. It can't be.

318
00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:58,810
I don't believe her.

319
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,280
She knows we have her
killing Yoon Hee on tape,

320
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,320
so she's trying to avoid a trial.

321
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,919
You cannot believe her.

322
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,990
We have our suspicions,
but no proof.

323
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,560

You do it.

335
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,000
Is that all you can do?

336
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,669
Are you trying to ruin my business?

337
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:58,070
I'm sorry. I really am.

338
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,909
I don't care. Just quit.

339
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:01,980
You begged,
so I even paid you in advance.

340
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,780
You're a complete fraud.

341
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,280
Hey. You better pay the money back.

342
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,949
No. I'll work harder from now on.
Please let me work.

343
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:12,419
Please. I really need the money.

344
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,560
Hey. Pay the money back.

345
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,990
Please, sir. I beg you.

00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:21,060

Come inside.

349
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,770
Everything is on sale.

350
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,840
Mr. Ma!

351
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,639
I heard the rumors.

352
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,580
Your family went broke.

353
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,379
Director Cheon Seo Jin...

354
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:40,179
I mean your mom...

355
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:43,320
is being chased by loan sharks
and is suffering from bad credit.

356
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,290
Looking at you, it seems like
you went super broke.

357
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:50,290
I thought rich people could live by
for three years after.

358
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,959
Maybe that doesn't
apply to criminals, though.

359
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:56,300
Then are you a young female
head of the house, now?

360
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:58,030
I'm leaving.

361
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:00,270
Don't you need money?

362
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:05,369
When I think about
how your mom used to be,

363
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,740
I really don't want to help you.

364
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,679
But I feel so bad for you right now.

365
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,280
You know I have a warm heart.

366
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:16,580
No, that's okay.

367
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,219
Your words are enough.
Thank you.

368
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,689
Even if it's 1,000 dollars a day?

369
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,429
What's the job?

370
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:41,010
Are you really going to give me
1,000 dollars?

371
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:45,250
You have to pass the test first.

372
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,280
I know I can do this well.

373
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:50,850
But you have to pay me in cash.

374
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,119
Okay.

375
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:56,020
You should know you're lucky
to have met me today.

376
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,030
If you follow what I say,

377
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,859
you can both make use of your major
and make money.

378
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,100
Here.

379
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:04,869
Sing it from the top.

380
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,830
Trot is all about your delivery.

381
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,070
Can you do it?

384
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,820

388
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:41,770

389
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:46,669
The person who promised to meet

390
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,350
Don't be disappointed

391
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,719
You can't be good at everything

392
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:59,189
As long as tomorrow
is better than today

393
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:03,159
Life is all about the now

394
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:05,830
Mom, shall we drink?

395
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:08,330
This is...

396
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,369
the happiest day of my life.

397
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,580
Who are you?

398
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:24,609
Mom.

399
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:26,750
Yes.

400
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:29,520
Mom became this way because of me.

401
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:33,449
I must earn money and protect her.

402
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,590
Fill me up with love

403
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,919
I am the head of the house now.

404
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,730
The battery of love has run out

405
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,129
Oh my goodness

406
00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:45,070
Don't do this

407
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:49,270
A woman's heart is like a reed

408
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:54,980
One day, you suddenly leave

409
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,780
And only a brown light remains

410
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,750
A lonely teacup

411
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,850
In a cold teacup

412
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:12,429

No wonder you're an SNU student.

415
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:35,020
The high notes are the same pitch,

416
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,719
and you deliver it with such sorrow.

417
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:40,949
Kind of like a maschera-ringing
minari-like voice.

418
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,159
We can start recording tomorrow.

419
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,230
Already? I haven't even rehearsed.

420
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,760
You don't need to rehearse.

421
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:49,429
You're not a real singer.

422
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:52,869
You're just pretending
to be a singer.

423
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:55,869
Our job requires you to record
as many songs as possible.

424
00:32:55,869 --> 00:32:58,909
Prepare songs with quick tempos,
not ones that drag along.

425
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:00,340
The ones that can wake you up...

426
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,540
when you're falling asleep
on the road.

427
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:05,780
I'll pay you well, so work hard.

428
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:08,949
Understood. Thank you, Mr. Ma.

430
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,189
- Yes?
- Life is so funny, don't you think?

431
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,730

00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:41,449
When did you wake up?

436
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:43,449
Why did you wake up only now?

437
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:45,550
Why are you also making it hard?

438
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,850
I thought something was
going to go wrong.

439
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,159
I'm sorry, Eun Byeol.
You must have been so worried.

440
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,260
I'm okay now.

441
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,629
Why haven't you been answering
my calls?

442
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:57,260
Where have you been this late?
How about school?

443

I need to earn money
to feed Mom and myself.

445
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,709
Why are you worrying about money?

446
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:09,609
Then who will?

447
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,909
We don't even have money
for Mom's medications.

448
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,919
Is it true your mom's sick?

449
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,250
What do you mean?

450
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,159
Is it true she has dementia?

451
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:26,689
She's lying so that she doesn't
get punished, isn't she?

452
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,959
Are you playing along although you
know it, or have you been duped too?

453
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:31,399
Dad! You've crossed the line.

454
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,070
Even if you hate Mom,
how can you say that?

455
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,369
Is dementia a joke to you?

456
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:38,510
You think Mom is making a joke
out of being sick?

Mom does have dementia.

458
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,010
She has dementia because of me.

459
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,750

460
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:51,750
Drugs?

461
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,850
The drugs I got from Ms. Jin.

462
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,919
I fed them to Mom.

463
00:34:56,419 --> 00:34:58,830
To help her forget.

464
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,060
What are you saying?

465
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,929
Why did you do such a thing?

466
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:06,770
I thought only then
she would stop doing bad things!

467
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,439
I can't see her commit crimes
for me anymore.

468
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:15,580
So I fed her the drugs so that
she wouldn't remember anything.

469
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,709
But I didn't know she would
even forget about me.

470

I feel so sorry for Mom.

471
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,190
Every day, things are getting
deleted from her brain.

472
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,389
She can't do anything
on her own anymore.

473
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,460
It's all my fault.

474
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,929

So please tell Su Ryeon
to forgive Mom.

Please don't bully Mom anymore.

485

Just let it go. Just this once.

I can't just let it go.

I feel bad for Ro Na's mom.

Do you think it was easy
for me to let you go?

490
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,080
- But I'm giving it up!
- Ha Eun Byeol!

491
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,810

492
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,250
What is a bigger punishment
than not being able to remember me?

493
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,520
Mom is nervous throughout the day
that she can't even sleep.

494
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,690
Isn't that enough?

I won't ask for your help.

and don't come to find me.

Cheon Seo Jin's hospital records.

509
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,480
Based on the brain wrinkles,

510
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,179
it looks like her dementia
has advanced.

511
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:35,179
Not only is there severe
hippocampal atrophy,

512
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:37,380
but there are also multiple infarcts
in the white matter of the brain.

513
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,889
So it's true she has
early onset dementia?

514
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:42,920
Possibility of it being fake?

516
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,400
She really took those drugs.

517
00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:53,429
At this level, she must have had
a hard time in her daily life.

518
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:56,369
The dosage of the drug she is taking
right now is quite high,

519
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:58,710

00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:11,409
If this gets out, my career is over.

538
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,549
I have a lot to lose.

539
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:21,350
Who is he to lecture me?

540
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,690
You must've been shocked.

541
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,330
Why didn't you stay
in the hospital for a few days?

542
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:31,130
I'd rather be home.

543
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,969
I'm worried about the kids too.

544
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:35,170
You don't have to worry about them.

545
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,710
Logan booked the entire hotel
so they could rest.

546
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,670
All Hera Palace residents
are staying there.

547
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,509
Thank you.

548
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:48,350
I guess this is
the end of Joo Dan Tae.

549
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,219
Dr. Ha woke up too. I'm so relieved.

550
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,920
Even the doctors were unsure.
It really is a miracle.

551
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,989
How is he doing?

552
00:39:58,219 --> 00:39:59,960
Will there be
any long-term effects?

553
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,029
When can he leave the hospital?

554
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:03,029
I'm not sure.

555
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:06,529
He needs rest.

556
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:08,639
Let's visit him together soon.

557
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,500
Sure, let's do that.

558
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:15,179
All we have left is Cheon Seo Jin,
the worst of the worst.

559
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,509
Her condition has deteriorated,
so she'll be given stronger drugs.

560
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:21,409
She's getting more
and more desperate.

561
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:23,420
She must feel impatient.

562
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,290
Let's reveal the dashcam footage
and put her behind bars.

563
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,589
She'll be sent
to the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry...

564
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,690
and undergo a psychiatric evaluation.

565
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,429
That's her goal.

566
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:37,759
Getting away with murder
using her mental condition.

567
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,270
At this rate,

568
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,139
even with clear evidence,
her sentence will be reduced...

569
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,900
or the execution will be suspended,
releasing her within three years.

570
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:49,139
We can't let her get away
with killing Yoon Hee.

571
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:50,610
No way.

572
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,909
She killed a person,
and Ro Na lost her mom.

573
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,380
Three years is not enough!

574
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,219
We can't just sit back.

575
00:40:58,449 --> 00:41:00,290
We should find out ourselves.

576
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:32,589
She threw away all her pills.

577
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,960
Cheon Seo Jin
has been putting on an act.

578
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:39,929
Eun Byeol is working until late
to make money.

579
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:43,299
How could she pretend to have
lost her memory in front of her kid?

580
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,569
She has no conscience whatsoever.

581
00:41:46,029 --> 00:41:47,830
She doesn't deserve to be a mom.

582
00:41:48,029 --> 00:41:50,000
We'll have to ask the hospital
to test her again.

583
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,940
If someone tampered with
the test results for money,

584
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,170
they should be punished as well.

585
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:57,940
Let's reveal the dashcam footage
immediately.

586
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:03,480
I wanted to keep it a secret
for Ro Na and Eun Byeol's sake.

587
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:06,389
But there's no reason to anymore.

588
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,360
As soon as Ro Na leaves,

589
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:11,889
I'll send the footage to the press.

590
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,830
Ro Na was very worried about you.

591
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,400
She visited you in the ICU
every day.

592
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,400
She did?

593
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:23,799
Yes.

594
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:26,569
You may not remember it,

595
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:29,210
but you must've heard her voice
while you were unconscious.

596
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,540
I'm sure that's why you woke up.

597
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,009
I didn't know that.

598
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:38,350
I thought she resented me.

599
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,589
Ro Na is leaving for the US
to study.

600
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,989
She got into the Juilliard School.

601
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,790
When is she leaving?

602
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,860
Tomorrow.

603
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,529
Tomorrow?

604
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,330
We wanted to bring her with us,

605
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,670
but she seemed busy
with preparations.

606
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:00,170
Still, she must be relieved
to know that you woke up...

607
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,139
before she leaves.

608
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:06,880
Logan, do me a favor.

609
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,750
Please get me out of here.

610
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:10,750
I want to see Ro Na.

611
00:43:11,279 --> 00:43:14,049
This time, I need your help.

612
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,889
("The Temperature of Language")

613
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,629
Welcome.

614
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,779
It's been a while, Ro Na.

615
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,279
I did hear that you woke up.

616
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,350
Did you already get discharged?

617
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,779
Yes. I recovered fast.

618
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,359
Ro Na, let me pour you one.

619
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:05,040
Is it okay to drink?

620
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:07,910
How's your injury?

621
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,450
It's fine. The surgery went well.

622
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,020
The wound healed completely.

623
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,319
I just have to finish my treatment.

624
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,390
Ro Na, your hair has grown so long.

625
00:44:24,689 --> 00:44:26,489
The dress looks great on you.

626
00:44:27,129 --> 00:44:29,060
You look really good in white.

627
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,299
You...

628
00:44:32,799 --> 00:44:34,770
take after your mom.

629
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,810
Big eyes, a beautiful voice...

630
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,669
You're brave too.

631
00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:46,609
But she said I got
my stubbornness from my dad.

632
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,319
My semi-curly hair too.

633
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,060
I'm moving abroad to study tomorrow.

634
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,859
I got into the Juilliard School.

635
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,359
Good job, Ro Na.
I'm so happy for you.

636
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,469
How long will you be there?

637
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,270
I'm not sure.

638
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,870
It might take a while.

639
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:14,439
I might even settle there.

640
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:20,279
Why are you sweating so much?

641
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,980
I haven't been outside in a while.

642
00:45:23,549 --> 00:45:24,850
It makes me nervous.

643
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,419
You must be busy.
Thanks for your time.

644
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:31,589
I just wanted to make sure
you're doing all right.

645
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,790
Let's say goodbye here.

646
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,600
Take care.

647
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:44,399
Why...

648
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,509
did you do that?

649
00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:50,140
Why did you try to protect me?

650
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,049
Did you think I'd be grateful?

651
00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:59,189
That's not it, Ro Na.

652
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,660
I hate you.

653
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:04,460
I hate you so much.

654
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,089
Do you know how scared I was?

655
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,330
That something would happen to you.

656
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,160
That you'd die because of me.

657
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:14,799
What was I supposed to do?

658
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:16,899
How was I supposed to live?

659
00:46:23,009 --> 00:46:24,439
I'm sorry, Ro Na.

660
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:29,149
I keep doing things
I have to apologize for.

661
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,719
But I didn't mean to upset you.
I just didn't...

662
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,819
want you to get hurt.

663
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,040
I'm really fine.

664
00:46:58,009 --> 00:46:59,279
So...

665
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,419
work hard in the US.

666
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,890
Forget everything...

667
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,129
and live happily, Ro Na.

668
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,649
It seems like he recovered
his consciousness.

669
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:41,750
Logan?

670
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,089
Yes, it's me, Dr. Ha.

671
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:47,529
Why is it so dark?

672
00:47:48,259 --> 00:47:49,899
Please turn on the lights.

673
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:53,830
Can't you...

674
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,169
see anything?

675
00:47:56,169 --> 00:47:59,469
No, I can't.

676
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:01,770
Everything's blurry.

677
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:03,739
I can see outlines, that's all.

678
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,850
Doctor. Please be honest with me.

679
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,819
I can handle it.

680
00:48:13,919 --> 00:48:16,319
Well...
Your optic nerve was damaged,

681
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,660
so you've lost your eyesight.

682
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,460
We did our best,
but it was in a very dangerous spot.

683
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,359
There was just so much we could do
during surgery.

684
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,560
I'm sorry.

685
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:27,129
Then...

686
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,339
will I die?

687
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,540
You'll have extreme migraines.

688
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:35,569
He'll require...

689
00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:38,379
the strongest pain killers
during the time he has left.

690
00:48:46,649 --> 00:48:49,390
I don't want to waste
what precious time I have left...

691
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,660

What is she wearing?

695
00:49:01,029 --> 00:49:02,600
A white dress.

696
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,799
She looks pretty with her hair down.

697
00:49:05,739 --> 00:49:09,339
I want her to remember me
when I was healthy.

698
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,750
You can do this.

699
00:49:12,879 --> 00:49:14,879
I've been here often,

700
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,149
so don't worry.

no longer exists.

00:52:28,369 --> 00:52:31,880
I got back the name Simoon...

This is where Seo Jin is living, right?

735
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,700
Yes, it is.

736
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:56,430
I came for Eun Byeol.

737
00:52:57,439 --> 00:53:00,139
How did you get there by yourself
in your condition?

738
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:02,939
I have a favor to ask.

739
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,439

It's about her mom.

742
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:14,889
It will be too shocking
if she hears about it on the news.

743
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:20,360
I plan to take Eun Byeol far away
for the time being.

I don't have much time left.

745

I want to spend it alone with her.

746
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,599
I'll be right there.

747
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:31,169

748
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,209
Wait. Don't do anything
until I get there.

749
00:53:34,769 --> 00:53:36,110
Okay?

Were you waiting for me?

753
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,050
Eun Byeol, let's go.

754
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,990
You can't stay here.

755
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,820
Your mom's lying to you.

756
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,689
Her MRI scan is a fake.

757
00:54:26,689 --> 00:54:28,130
She didn't take that drug.

758
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:29,689
I already checked.

759
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:31,900
Let's hurry before your mom comes.

760
00:54:35,999 --> 00:54:38,800
Eun Byeol. What's wrong?

761
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,570
Don't you believe me?

762
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:44,780
I never imagined
you'd lose your eyesight.

763
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,550
You really can't see?

764
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,950
Stay away.

765
00:54:56,889 --> 00:54:58,320
Where's my daughter?

Stop it.

769
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,169
Just how low must you stoop?

770
00:55:10,169 --> 00:55:11,769
You're still Eun Byeol's mom.

771
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:14,269
How could you use your own child?

772
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,369
You didn't take that drug.

773
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,809
I have to live
for Eun Byeol to live!

774
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:21,510
Don't use her as an excuse.

775
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,919
It's all for you.
You did it to save yourself.

776
00:55:28,349 --> 00:55:32,220
It doesn't change the fact
that she tried to feed it to me.

777
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,590
I just acted the way
she wanted me to be.

778
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,329
You did it to hide the fact
that you killed Yoon Hee.

779
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:40,470
It was all an act.

780
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,470
You have absolutely no shame.

781
00:55:43,229 --> 00:55:45,039
You used
Eun Byeol's guilty conscience...

782
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:46,939
and you're putting the blame on me.

783
00:55:46,939 --> 00:55:49,209
I'm going to take her.
I'll tell her everything.

784
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:55,809
Who else knows
that I don't have dementia?

785
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,880
Did you tell Su Ryeon?

786
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,220
Does that jerk Logan know too?

787
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:07,160
You're done for now.
Just accept your punishment.

788
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,860
I'm fine
if you keep your mouth shut.

Eun Byeol and I are moving abroad.

790
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,930
We'll never come back to Korea.

791
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,130
That will do.

792
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:22,740
I'm begging you.

793
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:28,349
Please, Seo Jin. Stop.

794
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:32,349
How did this happen to you?

795
00:56:33,019 --> 00:56:34,150
Please.

796
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,389
Please snap out of it. Please.

797
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:41,360
Please let it slide...

798
00:56:42,229 --> 00:56:43,860
for Eun Byeol's sake.

799
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,430
This is my last request.

800
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,639
- Let go.
- Seo Jin.

801
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,410
- Let go!
- Seo Jin!

802
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:18,200
No! No way!

803
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,669
No!

804
00:57:22,169 --> 00:57:25,269
No!

Yoon Chul.

808
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:42,889
No...

809
00:57:53,229 --> 00:57:55,829
You can't die.

810
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:59,269
I won't forgive you if you do.

811
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:08,050
I have to go now.

812
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,180
I never...

813
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,919
forgot about you.

814
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,090
I loved you.

Yoon Hee.

816
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,229
You...

817
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,769
made me the bad one to the end.

818
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:04,240
Even until the moment you died,

819
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,010
you abandoned me.

820
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:49,209
Eun Byeol, why are you here?
Where's your dad?

821
00:59:49,479 --> 00:59:52,220
I bought fruit
because he said he'd visit.

822
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,280
And your mom?

823
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,590
At the hospital.

824
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,329
Ms. Shim!

825
01:00:16,939 --> 01:00:19,380
Eun Byeol, come this way.

826
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,550
What's wrong?

827
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:24,180
Get out of here
and call an ambulance. Now!

828
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:54,650
(Public Toilet)

829
01:01:00,919 --> 01:01:03,889
It's all done.
It can't be turned back.

830
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,389
I have to go forward. Because...

831
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:11,229
I'm Cheon Seo Jin.

832
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:20,039
(Secretary Do)

833
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,180
It's me.

834
01:01:25,209 --> 01:01:26,539
Ha Yoon Chul's dead.

835
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,510
Arrange for me to go abroad.

836
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:31,019
Eun Byeol and I have to go
to whatever country possible.

837
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:32,019
Hurry.

Dad.

841
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:57,280
Why are you lying here?

842
01:01:57,939 --> 01:01:59,010
It's me.

843
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,450
Wake up and look at me.

844
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:09,050
Dad!

845
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:14,260
Dad. I'm sorry.

846
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,860
I won't tell you
not to visit anymore.

847
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:23,130
Dad. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.

848
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,700
I won't tell you
not to visit anymore!

849
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,209
So get up, please!

850
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:33,110
Dad.

851
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:35,079
Get up.

852
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,780
I was so mean to you.

853
01:02:37,979 --> 01:02:41,749
I'm sorry for that, Dad.

854
01:02:43,919 --> 01:02:45,519
Dad.

855
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:48,990
Dad...

856
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,360
- Dad.
- What happened?

857
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,169
- Why is he dead?
- I'm here now.

858
01:02:54,169 --> 01:02:55,570
Seo Jin did it.

859
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,439
Cheon Seo Jin left him to die.

860
01:03:03,309 --> 01:03:04,309
Dad.

861
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,910
Dad.

862
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:18,889
(Neurosurgeon Ha Yoon Chul)

863
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,660
I didn't get to pass the gift
Ro Na got for him.

864
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,030
I'm sorry, Dad.

865
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,630
Seo Jin will try to flee overseas.

866
01:03:29,999 --> 01:03:32,039
I must put a travel ban on her.

867
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:33,139
No.

868
01:03:33,439 --> 01:03:35,610
Let's let her have her way.

869
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:36,910
What do you mean?

870
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,110
What if we lose her forever?

871
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,280
Then we play our final card.

872
01:03:42,349 --> 01:03:44,320
We should deceive her too.

873
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,050
So she confesses her crimes.

874
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,490
Are you all right?

875
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,030
Let go of me.

876
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:58,959
If you want to talk nonsense,
just go.

877
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,829
I won't listen to what you say.

878
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:02,430
Do you still not believe me?

879
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:05,300
Why would someone who can't
remember anything kill Dad?

880
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,139
Mom wasn't even home at the time.

881
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:10,070
She was. She ran away.

882
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:12,740
Your mom remembers everything.
She's lying to you.

883
01:04:13,209 --> 01:04:14,510
That's impossible.

884
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,950
I fed her the drug myself.

885
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:19,119
The drug that erases your memory.

886
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,689
That's why she doesn't
recognize me either.

887
01:04:21,689 --> 01:04:23,550
I don't know what's going on,

888
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:25,419
but your mom
didn't take the drug.

889
01:04:25,419 --> 01:04:27,119
Her MRI was faked.

890
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,660
No!

891
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:33,999
Eun Byeol.

892
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,840
Ro Na's mom is dead
and now so is your dad.

893
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:40,400
Don't you feel bad for them?

894
01:04:40,869 --> 01:04:43,939
How many more must sacrifice
for you to believe me?

895
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,410
Until I see it for myself,

896
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:52,919
I won't believe anything.

897
01:05:03,329 --> 01:05:05,059
Dr. Ha was blind,

898
01:05:05,059 --> 01:05:08,200
so it looks like the police
will conclude he lost his footing.

899
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,099
And Shim Su Ryeon?

900
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:11,840
She isn't doing anything.

901
01:05:12,869 --> 01:05:14,970
Then I'll have no problem
going abroad.

902
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:18,010
Eun Byeol.

903
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,410
Is she still at the funeral?

904
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,180
Yes. I'll bring her
to the airport on time.

905
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,689
You should leave first.

906
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,220
So that no one suspects you,

907
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,689
I think you should
travel on separate flights.

908
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,930
Let's go.

909
01:05:39,329 --> 01:05:41,030
(Eun Byeol)

910
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,300
Hello?

911
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:50,209
Mom!

912
01:05:50,209 --> 01:05:53,340
Mom!

913
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,619
Mom!

914
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:02,650
Hello? What sound is that?

915
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:04,720
Quit the act, Cheon Seo Jin.

916
01:06:05,619 --> 01:06:08,030
If you want to save your daughter,
get over here now.

917
01:06:08,289 --> 01:06:10,030
To where you killed Yoon Hee.

918
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,200
If you're not here within an hour,

919
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,539
you'll never see Eun Byeol again.

920
01:06:25,539 --> 01:06:27,479
Shim Su Ryeon has Eun Byeol.

921
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,849
- What?
- Didn't you hear me?

922
01:06:30,249 --> 01:06:32,479
Shim Su Ryeon took Eun Byeol.

923
01:06:33,749 --> 01:06:34,749
I have to go.

924
01:06:35,189 --> 01:06:36,919
You can't. It'll be a trap.

925
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,019
Leave this to me
and leave the country.

926
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,959
You must leave now if you're
to make the flight. There's no time.

927
01:06:41,959 --> 01:06:44,030
Su Ryeon killed Dan Tae.

928
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,059
She's capable of anything.

929
01:06:47,229 --> 01:06:48,729
She might kill Eun Byeol too.

930
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,669
I have to go.

931
01:06:50,669 --> 01:06:53,169
You can't.
You need to save yourself first.

932
01:06:53,169 --> 01:06:55,910
If you lose this chance,
you might not get another one.

933
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:58,039
I will save Eun Byeol.

934
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,979
Eun Byeol is my daughter!
I will save her.

935
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:04,720
Shim Su Ryeon.

936
01:07:05,849 --> 01:07:08,650
This will end today.

937
01:07:09,689 --> 01:07:10,889
Give me the car keys!

938
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:13,360
Ms. Cheon!

939
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:18,999
Eun Byeol.

940
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,970
Eun Byeol, I'm coming.

941
01:07:37,309 --> 01:07:39,579
Shim Su Ryeon, you...

942
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,769
Shim Su Ryeon!

943
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:01,610
Eun Byeol!

944
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,869
Don't come close.

945
01:08:03,769 --> 01:08:05,410
Or your daughter dies here.

946
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:09,410
What are you doing?

947
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,320
Eun Byeol did nothing wrong!

948
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,180
I'm the one you want!

949
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,019
No!

950
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,019
No! Eun Byeol!

951
01:08:19,689 --> 01:08:22,630
Eun Byeol! No!

952
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:25,829
Eun Byeol! No!

953
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,260
No!

954
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:29,869
No!

955
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,340
Eun Byeol.

956
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,979
Kudos to your acting...

957
01:08:48,019 --> 01:08:49,919
when you're this clear-minded.

958
01:08:50,519 --> 01:08:52,090
Shim Su Ryeon!

959
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:56,030
Why are you interfering
with my life every step of the way?

960
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:58,499
Did you think killing Yoon Hee
will solve everything?

961
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:00,700
Did you think you could
keep it a secret till the end...

962
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,729
as long as you could
blame Joo Dan Tae for it?

963
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:05,340
Oh Yoon Hee died because of you.

964
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:08,869
I had to cut your right-hand woman
off to deal with you.

965
01:09:10,669 --> 01:09:12,410
So now you're confessing.

966
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:15,610
Don't act all high and mighty,
as if you're better than us.

967
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,849
If only you hadn't acted
like you were on a high horse...

968
01:09:17,849 --> 01:09:19,749
by forgiving the murderer
who killed Min Seol A,

969
01:09:19,749 --> 01:09:22,119
Oh Yoon Hee would have
stayed in prison,

970
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:23,320
and she wouldn't have died.

971
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,990
Did you live all your life...

972
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:27,490
always rationalizing
your sins like this?

973
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:30,130
- Shut up!
- You should pray.

974
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:35,870
I'll make your daughter pay
for all of your sins.

975
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:42,639
Where's Eun Byeol?

976
01:09:43,509 --> 01:09:44,879
Where is she?

977
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:47,179
Eun Byeol!

978
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,410
Eun Byeol!

979
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:52,280
Where is Eun Byeol?

980
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,620
Where is my daughter?

981
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,320
What did you do to her?

982
01:09:57,889 --> 01:09:59,490
Why did you kill Ha Yoon Chul?

983
01:10:00,589 --> 01:10:02,960
Because he found out
you didn't have dementia?

984
01:10:03,759 --> 01:10:05,660
Because you were afraid your lies
were going to get exposed?

985
01:10:06,259 --> 01:10:07,969
So you killed a man?

986
01:10:08,129 --> 01:10:09,570
Bring me Eun Byeol.

987
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,269
I don't hear anything you're saying!

988
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:13,839
Depending on how you behave,

989
01:10:14,139 --> 01:10:15,969
Eun Byeol may die...

990
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,110
or live.

991
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,979
What do you want?

992
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,389
You want me to turn myself in?

993
01:10:29,689 --> 01:10:32,389
No way. That's never happening.

994
01:10:33,519 --> 01:10:36,259
If only you hadn't left me
with no other options,

995
01:10:37,759 --> 01:10:39,559
Ha Yoon Chul wouldn't have died.

996
01:10:39,559 --> 01:10:43,900
He shouldn't have abandoned me
for his daughter's sake!

997
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:56,809
Mom was really the one
who killed Dad?

998
01:10:57,110 --> 01:11:00,120
After all I've done for Mom...

999
01:11:00,219 --> 01:11:03,790
how is she still a monster?

1000
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,689
Now, do you believe?

1001
01:11:10,589 --> 01:11:12,429
I'm sorry...

1002
01:11:13,229 --> 01:11:14,400
you had to see that.

1003
01:11:26,509 --> 01:11:27,849
Is this the police?

1004
01:11:28,309 --> 01:11:30,150
I'm reporting a murderer.

1005
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,549
I know who really
killed Oh Yoon Hee.

1006
01:11:33,019 --> 01:11:34,519
I saw it.

1007
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:41,429
My mom killing Oh Yoon Hee.

1008
01:12:15,889 --> 01:12:17,490
It's over, Cheon Seo Jin.

1009
01:12:19,729 --> 01:12:23,530
You finally made
the foolish choice...

1010
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:25,339
of being abandoned even
by your own daughter.

1011
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,500
What?

1012
01:12:29,809 --> 01:12:31,679
Eun Byeol has been watching.

1013
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:39,320
Your lies.

1014
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:42,320
Your dirty wrongdoings. All of them.

1015
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,990
It was Eun Byeol who reported you
to the police.

1016
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,410
Shim Su Ryeon.

1017
01:13:07,379 --> 01:13:08,879
Without you,

1018
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:11,519
my life would have been perfect.

1019
01:13:12,879 --> 01:13:15,389
If only you hadn't
shown up in my life!

1020
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:19,420
My family would have
remained intact.

1021
01:13:20,019 --> 01:13:22,689
I wouldn't have gotten involved
with someone like Joo Dan Tae.

1022
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:24,929
Eun Byeol and I,

1023
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,200
including Yoon Chul,

1024
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:32,939
my family could have been happy.

1025
01:13:33,139 --> 01:13:34,240
Happy?

1026
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,210
You don't deserve that.

1027
01:13:39,939 --> 01:13:42,910
That will never happen
in your life now.

1028
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,129
I can't die like this.

1029
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:59,360
I can't die alone!

1030
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,700
Cheon Seo Jin. Don't do this.

1031
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:05,500
- Don't move!
- No!

1032
01:14:11,309 --> 01:14:12,809
No!

1033
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,849
No, Mom!

1034
01:14:14,849 --> 01:14:16,710
No!

1035
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:17,910
Su Ryeon!

1036
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:20,650
Shim Su Ryeon!

1037
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:25,290
Shim Su Ryeon!

1038
01:14:26,559 --> 01:14:28,629
No.

1039
01:14:28,629 --> 01:14:31,500
I held on to her.

1040
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,629
I swear.

1041
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,259
Let's go!

1042
01:14:38,969 --> 01:14:40,200
Eun Byeol!

1043
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,839
Someone has gone over Gimpo cliff.

1044
01:14:41,839 --> 01:14:43,639
The suspect has been arrested.

1045
01:14:45,339 --> 01:14:47,540
Stop! You can't go that way.

1046
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:50,250
- Su Ryeon!
- You can't go that way.

1047
01:14:50,309 --> 01:14:51,719
Su Ryeon!

1048
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:53,979
- It's dangerous.
- Su Ryeon!

1049
01:14:53,979 --> 01:14:55,790
Calm down. It's dangerous.

1050
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:57,849
- Calm down.
- Stop this.

1051
01:14:57,849 --> 01:14:59,120
Su Ryeon!

1052
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,660
Eun Byeol!

1053
01:15:52,139 --> 01:15:54,950
(The Penthouse 3)

1054
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:57,379
What do you mean there's no signal?

1055
01:15:57,379 --> 01:15:59,349
- We have to find her.
- I didn't do it!

1056
01:15:59,349 --> 01:16:01,620
The tragedy started with me.

1057
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,650
I don't know who that person is.

1058
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:04,759
Congratulations on your
first performance.

1059
01:16:04,759 --> 01:16:05,960
You said you'd buy me pasta.

1060
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,790
I've missed you, Ro Na.

1061
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:09,889
Don't kill Seo Jin.

1062
01:16:09,889 --> 01:16:12,200
I want to end everything now.

1063
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,729
I have people I have to meet.

1064
01:16:13,729 --> 01:16:15,429
Will you come with me, Logan?
