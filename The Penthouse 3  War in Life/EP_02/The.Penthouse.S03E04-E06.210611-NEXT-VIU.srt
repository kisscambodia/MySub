1
00:00:05,802 --> 00:00:07,302
(The characters, locations, incidents, organizations,)

2
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:08,937
(and background of this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,014
Let me go! Where am I? Let go of me!

4
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:14,455
Oh Yoon Hee? Shim Su Ryeon?

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,654
Get off me!

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,284
Where am I? What's going on?

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,964
Shim Su Ryeon. Oh Yoon Hee. What's going on?

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,640
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,740
How did you manage to get out?

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,549
I guess you did a pretty good job of acting like a psycho.

11
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:42,445
Or did Joo Dan Tae help you?

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,345
Did you help him kill Logan?

13
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:54,198
You killed Logan, didn't you?

14
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:56,625
What are you talking about? It wasn't me!

15
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,265
You killed him.

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,894
Do you think I don't know that?

17
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,004
Why are you doing this?

18
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:12,474
Why are you doing this to me?

19
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:47,774
Thank you.

20
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,855
Wake up. I know you're not dead.

21
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,295
What's going on?

22
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,065
Why are you doing this to me?

23
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,895
Finally, here we all are.

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,664
Good job, everyone.

25
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,680
Shall we start cornering the rat then?

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,175
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,780
Our beginnings may have been different,

28
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,145
but we all want the same ending.

29
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,974
We want Joo Dan Tae gone.

30
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,345
There's nothing I wouldn't do for that happy ending.

31
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:31,085
I'm ready to join hands with anyone.

32
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,330
So? Are you telling me to cooperate with you?

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,965
Joo Dan Tae is in action.

34
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,065
He is now the owner of the 85th floor of Hera Palace.

35
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,470
At today's Cheong A Group shareholders' meeting,

36
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,264
he'll be appointed the only president.

37
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:51,805
Is it okay if you lose the entire Cheong A Group to him?

38
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,675
Bring evidence that he killed Logan.

39
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:59,014
Whatever it takes,

40
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,555
I need you to approach him and find some evidence.

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,729
What should I do that?

42
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,954
That's the only reason we saved you.

43
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,365
Do you want to help us or...

44
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,294
die here?

45
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,435
What?

46
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,065
The choice is yours.

47
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,865
I'm ready to get rid of you anytime.

48
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,875
Just like you tried to kill me two years ago.

49
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,675
Do you think I'm still the weak Shim Su Ryeon you used to know?

50
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,815
Can you do it or not?

51
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,815
Betray us, and I'll kill you with my hands.

52
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,884
Shut it.

53
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:44,324
Do you know what got me through in that cold prison cell?

54
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,069
Gnashing my teeth every day,

55
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:49,034
dreaming of paying Joo Dan Tae back.

56
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,465
Joo Dan Tae.

57
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,175
I'll never let you two kill him.

58
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:01,914
Ms. Cheon!

59
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,085
I'll be the one killing him first.

60
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,555
Ms. Cheon!

61
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,594
Is it really okay to let her go like this?

62
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,935
What if she was involved in Logan's death?

63
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,309
How can you trust her?

64
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,475
I don't.

65
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:33,444
We'll see if we watch what she does from now.

66
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:40,985
Anyway, why did you get me out?

67
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,285
You even changed your witness statement.

68
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,190
The moment Joo Dan Tae was released,

69
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,055
the entire legal system collapsed.

70
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,894
Ro Na may be in danger again.

71
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:52,094
You need to be there to protect her.

72
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,194
Never trust the law again.

73
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,274
- I'll take you to the hospital. - There's no need.

74
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,175
What time is the shareholders' meeting today?

75
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,915
It starts at 2pm.

76
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,249
It seems like Mr. Joo is planning to dismiss...

77
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:12,115
every executive on your side.

78
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,285
Now that I'm out of prison, he can't have his way.

79
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,285
How much money do I have left?

80
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,830
Your buildings in Gangnam have been sold,

81
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,900
but after paying Ms. Shim 50 million dollars in compensation...

82
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,530
and paying a forfeit,

83
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,024
there's not much left.

84
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:26,070
That's impossible.

85
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,429
Do you know how many buildings I own in Myeongdong?

86
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:28,840
They should be worth at least hundreds of million dollars.

87
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,970
All your real estate has been transferred...

88
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,204
to the lady in Seongbuk-dong and Mr. Joo.

89
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,975
Do you mean they took everything away from me?

90
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:43,219
Was there anything strange on the day Logan died?

91
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,045
I told you to put a tail on Logan.

92
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,214
Here are the photos from where the explosion happened.

93
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,154
The old man right next to the car,

94
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:53,024
who sells popcorn, seems fishy.

95
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:58,764
An old man?

96
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:07,134
What about Eun Byeol?

97
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,504
Where's she now?

98
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:10,834
Here.

99
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,615
It's tasty.

100
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,944
"TOEFL Preparation Institute"?

101
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:23,320
You should take the TOEFL test once you enter university,

102
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,530
so I went to ask some questions,

103
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,185
and they keep calling me.

104
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,894
Eat up.

105
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,004
I love the shave ice here too.

106
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:47,344
This is the first time we've been here together, right?

107
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:50,644
When you eat this,

108
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,754
you're supposed to pour this over it.

109
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,964
It's so good.

110
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,900
When did you get released?

111
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,365
Are you released for good?

112
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,970
You look a mess.

113
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,404
I have nothing to say to you.

114
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,280
Eun Byeol, how have you been?

115
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,549
Are you well?

116
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:23,045
How did you get released?

117
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:25,444
I thought you got a seven-year sentence.

118
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,985
It's for you.

119
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,685
I was worried about you and missed you so much.

120
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,084
Look at me.

121
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,925
Eun Byeol.

122
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,365
Why did you show up in front of me?

123
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:42,865
I'd forgotten all about you and I'm doing well.

124
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,369
What are you talking about? I'm here to pick you up.

125
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,175
Who says I'm going back to you?

126
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,809
I'm living happily with Ms. Jin.

127
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:53,450
I get to eat and do whatever I want.

128
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,545
Your mom is here. Why would you live with her?

129
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,119
Do you want her to ruin your life?

130
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,014
You're the one who ruined my life.

131
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,359
- My criminal parents did. - What?

132
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,454
What can you possibly do for me?

133
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,830
Do you have any money?

134
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,154
Do you have the power to get me into Seoul National University?

135
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,725
You even lost our place at Hera Palace to Seok Kyung's dad.

136
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,099
You've been kicked out of...

137
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,999
both the classical singing world and your company.

138
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:17,735
And you even went to prison.

139
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:21,475
You're nothing but humiliation and an obstacle in my life.

140
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,479
You have nothing left. Where can you take me?

141
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,504
I'll get everything back!

142
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,915
I've never been poor in my life.

143
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,359
Money? I can always make more.

144
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:37,389
I can do anything for you.

145
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:40,354
No. Don't do anything.

146
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:42,229
Without Ms. Jin,

147
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,694
I'd be in juvie now.

148
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:46,629
With even Grandma refusing to be my guardian,

149
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,334
who else could I rely on?

150
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,170
What did this woman do to you?

151
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,834
Let go of her!

152
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,349
Lay a finger on her,

153
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:03,175
and I'll kill myself.

154
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,015
Eun Byeol.

155
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,025
I've never been this happy.

156
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,464
Please don't take Ms. Jin away from me.

157
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,135
It's my last request.

158
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,834
Ms. Jin, let's move to another table.

159
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,354
Eun Byeol wants me to be her guardian.

160
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,960
She's the one who asked me to help her escape from Hera Palace.

161
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,099
That's not true. My daughter wouldn't do that.

162
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:50,830
She has her performance test for Seoul University next week.

163
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,494
She's sensitive right now, so don't try to see her again.

164
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,864
What's your relationship with Yoon Hee?

165
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,069
Was she the one who sent you to us?

166
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,580
Did she hire you to ruin Eun Byeol's life?

167
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,944
What if she were? Will you take revenge on her?

168
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,950
Were you really communicating with Yoon Hee?

169
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,614
Logan introduced us.

170
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,944
He's the one who brought me from the US.

171
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,285
Logan?

172
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,124
Then...

173
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,954
Does that mean Su Ryeon was in on it too?

174
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:24,970
I felt bad for never visiting you in prison.

175
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,025
Would you like a shaved ice?

176
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,074
Fine. You should leave me.

177
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,450
If I have you,

178
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,874
I'll have to let Dan Tae attack me again.

179
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:46,285
The more I have to protect, the more vulnerable I am.

180
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,415
I won't come to you...

181
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,655
until I put everything back to the way it was.

182
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:58,494
Open up!

183
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Open up, Dan Tae!

184
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,265
Dan Tae! Open up!

185
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:07,834
This is my home. Dan Tae!

186
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,849
You changed the code?

187
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:17,114
You changed the code? You changed the code?

188
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,220
How could you break someone else's door down?

189
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,815
Get out of here!

190
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,790
We're in trouble if Chairman Joo comes.

191
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,685
I'll get fired!

192
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,399
Darn it. Get over here.

193
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,155
Don't you dare touch me!

194
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,165
This is my home.

195
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:09,694
I'll show you whom you'll bow to. Just wait and see.

196
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,005
(Cheong A Group)

197
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:28,815
We will begin the Cheong A Group shareholders' meeting.

198
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:30,954
What kind of risk management...

199
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,954
have you been doing?

200
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:35,200
There are no bank investments...

201
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,999
and our stock prices have tanked.

202
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:40,565
Cheong A is about to go bust.

203
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,738
Did you decide to give up and watch it sink?

204
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:47,405
I mean... The owner was linked to a murder.

205
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:49,310
How could the company survive?

206
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,979
You're paid a high salary...

207
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,550
to take care of things like that.

208
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,149
That's why you're sitting there, Director Cho.

209
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,385
Companies have a system.

210
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,015
If Director Cheon Seo Jin were here,

211
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:03,190
it wouldn't have gotten this bad.

212
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,059
I won't tolerate your abuse of power any longer.

213
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,124
Listen to that wild hog talk.

214
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,029
If you miss Seo Jin so much,

215
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,469
go visit her in prison.

216
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,430
You're fired.

217
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,035
Chairman Joo!

218
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,210
Even the chairman can't abuse executives like this.

219
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,704
You're fired too.

220
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,248
Anyone who's unhappy with me, submit your resignation.

221
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:31,619
I won't stop you, and there's no way I'll listen to your criticism.

222
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:34,619
Cheong A will be run as Joo Dan Tae dictates.

223
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:37,685
If you want to end up on the street, keep yapping away!

224
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,734
We must work together...

225
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,005
to save the company.

226
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,374
Let's hear your ideas...

227
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,104
for how to save Cheong A.

228
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,425
Seo Jin?

229
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:32,045
Honey. I've missed you so much.

230
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,574
What are you doing?

231
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,214
Thank you...

232
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:40,849
for doing everything you could to get me out of prison.

233
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:43,655
It's all thanks to you.

234
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,660
What are you babbling about?

235
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,729
Chairman Joo.

236
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:49,659
Thank you for agreeing to give us the first interview.

237
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,824
Me?

238
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,694
You returned quickly amidst much criticism.

239
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,999
Stock prices have been hitting all-time lows.

240
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,665
Don't you think your return was a bit rash?

241
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,479
You're the one who's rash.

242
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,905
How long has it been since he made his return?

243
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:08,415
However, Cheong A Group will change very soon.

244
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,645
Upon opening Cheong A Art Center,

245
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,790
we will make a great leap forward.

246
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,290
Ms. Cheon. Is it true that you gave Shim Su Ryeon...

247
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,690
50 million dollars in compensation?

248
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,628
Whereas I was wronged in many ways,

249
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,660
I've cleared up my misunderstandings with her.

250
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,624
Please explain the rumours of your problems with Chairman Joo.

251
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,535
My husband and I do not have any problems.

252
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,074
Those rumours are all lies.

253
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:44,279
My husband and I will make it up to the people.

254
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,790
We will cherish family...

255
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,714
and give our all in saving Cheong A Group.

256
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:55,025
We'll make more and use the money for good.

257
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,765
Please trust us...

258
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:02,135
and watch how we do.

Seo Jin hasn't changed at all.

269
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,009
No, she became more evil.

270
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:50,275
She went back to Dan Tae.

271
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,320
She had no choice but to join forces with him...

272
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,385
in order to increase the value of Cheong A stock.

273
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:58,460
This is what I was after.

274
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,285
You were after this?

275
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,930
I cut off all of her sources of funds.

276
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,265
That way, she'd run to Dan Tae.

277
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,334
I plan...

278
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:12,265
to fight fire with fire.

279
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,610
Since it's true that he messed with her profits.

280
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,205
Do you think she'll help you though?

281
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,074
Would she bring you evidence that he killed Logan?

282
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,578
Why are you pretending to be strong?

283
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,249
You're not fine at all.

284
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:27,485
You're dying inside because of Logan.

285
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,215

286
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,285
the man you love die.

287
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:36,555
You can be honest when you're with me.

288
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,664
I'm more worried because you're acting so tough.

289
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,065
I don't have the luxury of crying.

290
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,535
I have to prove Dan Tae killed him. That's priority.

291
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,140
You planned this little charade as soon as you got out.

292
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,475
Let's remain married until Cheong A is stabilized.

293
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,114
Consider it a contract marriage.

294
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,884
Says who?

295
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,589
I can de-list this company...

296
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,059
or build it up.

297
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:07,930
In other words, if I can't have it, I can kill it.

298
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,700
You can't return to Cheong A Group.

299
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,430
Your followers have been fired already.

300
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,539
I know you're here...

301
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,839
to stab me in the back.

302
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,565
I can't trust you either.

303
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,134
It's simple. We'll use each other.

304
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,305
Until we have money in our hands.

305
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,715
If stock prices shoot up every time we smile at each other,

306
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,945
what's so hard about it?

307
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:34,720
Weren't you planning...

308
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,884
to build up the company and sell it anyway?

309
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,324
But sorry.

310
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,995
I...

311
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:46,094
don't want to team up with you...

312
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,394
in the slightest.

313
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,334
You'll regret it.

314
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,384
What is this?

315
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,055
Your disguise was incredible.

316
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,295
It's so you.

317
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,100
Who is this old man?

318
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,164
You know exactly who it is.

319
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,939
Did you forget?

320
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,979
Secretary Do is great at his job.

321
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:34,074
But then,

322
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,275
he learned from the great Joo Dan Tae.

323
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,884
I was actually quite surprised.

324
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:45,190
That you'd kill Logan to get a not-guilty sentence?

325
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,025
I never even imagined that.

326
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,725
Turn my Hera Palace to what it was.

327
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,339
And make me a joint partner of Cheong A Group.

328
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:56,769
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

329
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:57,864
You don't want to?

330
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:01,809
Would you not mind if I send those photos to Shim Su Ryeon now?

331
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,434
Actually, no.

332
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:07,380
Wouldn't it be best if I send them to Logan Lee's...

333
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,275
grieving family in the US?

334
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:13,144
I heard they're frantically trying to find their son's killer.

335
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,315
What shall I do?

336
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:24,455
I quite like the new interior and furniture.

337
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,924
Good job.

338
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,765
Oh, right.

339
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,134
Who's the guy who came in with Logan?

340
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,735
Did you kill him too?

341
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,180
He was with someone?

342
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,614
My goodness. You didn't know that either?

343
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,715
It's not fun if there are too many witnesses.

344
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:55,955
Darn it!

345
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,104
What is it, Su Ryeon?

346
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,874
It's nothing.

347
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,565
Mom.

348
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,594
Who are you people?

349
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,664
How did you get in here?

350
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:46,445
Oh. So you're the infamous Su Ryeon Shim, huh?

351
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,479
Who are you?

352
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:53,285
I want you to answer my god damn question first.

353
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,555
What did you do to my brother Logan?

354
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:59,285
He is Logan's older brother.

355
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,265
Do you actually think I killed Logan?

356
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,465
Yeah. Because all the motivations are there.

357
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,470
You see, you must have a grudge against my family...

358
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,535
for what my parents did to your daughter.

359
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:18,805
But shoot. Did you really have to go that far?

360
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,579
Yo, my parents, they're already on trial.

361
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:24,680
My parents, they're already paying for their mistakes.

362
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,844
So why the...

363
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,184
Logan has to go and die like that?

364
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,184
You call this revenge?

365
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,860
I wish I were the one who had killed him.

366
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,955
What was that?

367
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:36,995
If I hated him,

368
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,529
and I killed him because I couldn't forgive him,

369
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,324
then at least I'd feel better.

370
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,809
He called me every day and showed his concern for me,

371
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:49,604
and suddenly he's gone from my side.

372
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,344
Do you know how dreadful that feeling is?

373
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,414
So many times a day I think I should've stopped him from coming.

374
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:01,985
Was there something I could've done for him?

375
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,015
The regret and anger are driving me crazy.

376
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,755
If only I could turn back time,

377
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:14,164
I'd be okay with not seeing him ever again.

378
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,565
I would do anything if only I could bring him back.

379
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,475
Then you should've never called him back in the first place!

380
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,235
You should've just let him go!

381
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:26,910
Don't you know him better than that?

382
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,180
He wanted to be responsible for what his parents did.

383
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,414
I trusted his sincerity.

384
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:33,344
We...

385
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,914
Jesus.

386
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:42,124
Shoot.

387
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,394
Now, on the day of Logan's death,

388
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,039
there was 10 billion dollars...

389
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,394
withdrawn from his personal bank account.

390
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,834
You know where this money is, right?

391
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:55,839
I don't know about that.

392
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,035
Liar!

393
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,745
If you don't know where this money is, then who does?

394
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,574
He told me that money was for Seol A.

395
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,144
Move.

396
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,114
Move.

397
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,955
No, sir.

398
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,025
You cannot leave the house. Direct orders from the master.

399
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:16,195
I have to go.

400
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,324
Can't you tell I'm with a company?

401
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:20,265
- Get out of the way. - Hey!

402
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,035
Just where the heck do you think you're going?

403
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,035
- You are going nowhere. - Alex.

404
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,934
Why are you stopping me too?

405
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,674
Joo Dan Tae's a very dangerous person.

406
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:35,180
If I don't go back and prove him guilty...

407
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,079
for all his wrongdoings in the past,

408
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,574
and have him rot in jail,

409
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:41,485
Su Ryeon can end up in danger again.

410
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,759
Well, that's exactly why I'm telling you...

411
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,255
you are going nowhere.

412
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,255
Do you not know what you mean to this family?

413
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:51,960
Do you not know what our parents did...

414
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,624
to save your darn life?

415
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:55,934
You.

416
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:58,940
You're the one who's supposed to take over Pop's business.

417
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,164
I have to go and protect her, no matter what.

418
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,440
I promised her that I'd make her happy.

419
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,005
Do you really think...

420
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:09,519
this woman, she's going to forgive our family?

421
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:11,574
That's more the reason why I'm sorry.

422
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:14,414
Instead of hating me like she's supposed to,

423
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,414
she chooses to care for me.

424
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,755
Alex. I need her by my side to be happy. So please.

425
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,864
Let me go.

426
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,725
Jesus Christ.

427
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,710
What about the 10 billion dollars you cashed out from real estate?

428
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,535
Is all that money for her too?

429
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:38,475
That money was for Seol A anyway.

430
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,279
I never thought it was mine.

431
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,344
For goodness sake, Logan.

432
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,045
Who, I mean... What is this woman to you?

433
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,055
I like her. I like Su Ryeon.

434
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,285
What did you say?

435
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,624
I like her.

436
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,025
Very much.

437
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,900
Listen, Alex. I only got a second chance at life...

438
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,124
because of Seol A.

439
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,334
The new life she gave me, I want to spend for Su Ryeon.

440
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:05,965
My heart...

441
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,834
and all my belongings.

442
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:17,279
Now, whoever was after Logan for that 10 billion dollars,

443
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,945
I swear to almighty, I'll find him...

444
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,745
and I'll kill him.

445
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,654
Even if that means you, lady.

446
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,154
So you best be prepared.

447
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,934
Hey, yo! Let's go.

448
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,795
Was there really something between Mom and Logan?

449
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,795
No, right?

450
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,594
The weird rumour isn't true, is it?

451
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,735
I told you to trust Mom.

452
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:14,265
Once we believe, we trust forever.

453
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,055
Mom.

454
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:35,824
My little girl.

455
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,065
Have you been strong?

456
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:41,364
You're not sick, are you?

457
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,634
You look like you lost weight.

458
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:48,164
I went on a diet.

459
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,715
I missed you, Ro Na. I missed you so much.

460
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:09,894
You stupid jerk!

461
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:12,765
You had no idea Secretary Do was following you?

462
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:15,495
Why didn't you tell me he had company?

463
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,094
What if he saw something?

464
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:20,805
You haven't found him yet, have you?

465
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,279
I'm checking all the CCTVs...

466
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,749
and dashboard cameras from nearby...

467
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:28,174
and he didn't show up.

468
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,574
What do you know so far?

469
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,914
Nothing other than that he flew in with Logan.

470
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,854
His name is Baek Jun Ki.

471
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,124
Baek Jun Ki?

472
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,995
Have the police not yet called about Baek Jun Ki?

473
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,465
I don't think they found him yet.

474
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:52,834
Where is he hiding?

475
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,404
Any departure records?

476
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:56,880
None.

477
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,680
I downloaded a tracking app on the phone...

478
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,579
Logan gave him to use in Korea,

479
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:02,674
and he hasn't turned on his phone yet.

480
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,084
That means he's still in Korea.

481
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,384
We must find him first.

482
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,424
Before Joo Dan Tae does something.

483
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:28,664
Bang.

484
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,805
Bang.

485
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,914
Yes, honey. Did you get there okay?

486
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,860
What's the weather like in New York?

487
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,755
The jet lag must be killing you.

488
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,789
Okay.

489
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:49,559
What? Of course, I'm home.

490
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,758
I just lay down to go to bed.

491
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,195
Got it. I love you.

492
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,904
No!

493
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:13,745
Get out. Get out.

494
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:15,614
Get out.

495
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,485
What are you doing here?

496
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,455
Shouldn't you lead with "long time no see?"

497
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,364
Is this why you never visited?

498
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,094
I'm disappointed.

499
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:36,775
There she is. Your mom.

500
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,475
What happened?

501
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:43,074
Seo Young, what is all this?

502
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,775
There you are.

503
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,489
You said my adultery...

504
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:48,914
brought shame to the family.

505
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:53,359
But I don't think your daughter leads a much better life.

506
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,460
What? "Your daughter?"

507
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,670
I believe Seo Young's in-laws are very sensitive about these issues.

508
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,864
Is it okay if...

509
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,864
I tell them?

510
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:08,604
Their classy, quiet daughter-in-law...

511
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,038
cheated on her husband with their driver.

512
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,644
- What are you doing? How crude... - Crude?

513
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:22,315
How classy did you think I was going to be after serving time?

514
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,890
Is that why you never visited...

515
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,329
when your "classy" daughter went to jail...

516
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:29,225
and even pushed Eun Byeol away?

517
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,065
How dare you call yourself family?

518
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:36,495
What is it...

519
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,134
that you want?

520
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:43,834
Return everything you stole from me.

521
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:48,344
Cheong A Foundation,

522
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,874
and the Myeongdong building.

523
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,114
(Building transfer agreement)

524
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:57,555
What are you waiting for? Sign it.

525
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:00,255
Unless you want to destroy...

526
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,695
the life of your precious daughter.

527
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,594
Mom. Tell her we'll give anything.

528
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,394
You want to see me get divorced?

529
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,975
(Building transfer agreement, Share transfer agreement)

530
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:25,844
I'll give you back the Myeongdong building.

531
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,684
But not Cheong A Foundation.

532
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,584
I sold it to Shim Su Ryeon.

533
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,485
How can you sell that?

534
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,929
Bring it back!

535
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,394
Even if it means a high penalty!

536
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,124
It's already done.

537
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:44,934
Please, Seo Jin. Let's just end it here.

538
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,009
I beg of you.

539
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:49,140
Please. I'm sorry.

540
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,479
- Seo Jin... - She's your sister, after all.

541
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:54,275
- Seo Jin, please... - Seo Jin, we're family.

542
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,445
Shim Su Ryeon. Of all people, why?

543
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:01,914
You really want to be my nemesis?

544
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,386
What's this?

545
00:33:55,691 --> 00:33:58,316
What? Do you think it's poisoned?

546
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,530
If we're going to pretend to be a happy couple,

547
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,026
you should get used to this much.

548
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:15,711
Don't do anything unless I ask you to.

549
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:17,280
Do you think I wanted to do this?

550
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,341
Since we made a deal,

551
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:20,306
I think we should sign a contract.

552
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,851
I find it offensive when you invade my personal space.

553
00:34:23,851 --> 00:34:26,021
Gladly.

554
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:27,446
This time, I get to decide.

555
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:33,261
Strictly abide by the rules written here.

556
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:36,360
Every time you break a rule, you lose one percent of your stock.

557
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,455
Sign it.

558
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,771
(Contract Marriage Rules)

559
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:51,576

00:34:57,981 --> 00:35:00,785
"We smile kindly to each other when others are around."

00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,545

"Cheon Seo Jin decides when and how..."

566
00:35:08,591 --> 00:35:10,285
"to split the property."

567
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:14,500
What is this, a slave contract?

568
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,831
The show will go on...

569
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:18,701
until Cheon A Group's stock price doubles.

570
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,070
Once my goal is achieved, we'll get divorced...

571
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,910
and part ways. Keep your promise.

572
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,910
You should do the same. I'm not some thug.

573
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,380
You're not a thug. You're a scumbag.

574
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,750
What did you say, you wench?

575
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,005
Remember this.

576
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,246
Your life depends on me.

577
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,385
Get on my nerves again,

578
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:43,355
and the whole world will find out about your explosion show.

579
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,936
Unbelievable.

(Installation completed)

584
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,116
Did you know about this?

585
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:40,575
Did you know Dad moved back to Hera Palace?

586
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,121
Seok Hoon, I can explain.

587
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:45,216
I'm the one who asked the restraining order to be lifted.

588
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,355
What?

589
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,426
Why? Can't I do that?

590
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,630
He's been cleared of murder charges.

591
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,366
Why can't he live here?

592
00:36:57,641 --> 00:36:59,671
Why should we object to the court's decision?

593
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:02,866
I thought we were finally out of Dad's grip. Why in the world...

594
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:05,505
are you doing this?

595
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:08,551
Seok Kyung, if you want, I'm not going to stop you...

596
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:10,915
from seeing your dad.

597
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,651
But think about Ro Na.

598
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:15,445
If your dad lives at Hera Palace...

599
00:37:16,191 --> 00:37:18,461
Why should I think about Ro Na?

600
00:37:18,461 --> 00:37:20,385
She's a victim.

601
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:23,125
She can't live in the same building as the perpetrator.

602
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,895
You still see Ro Na's mom.

603
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,930
You keep the woman who killed your daughter with you.

604
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,201
Why not Dad?

605
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:32,596
- Seok Kyung! - Don't yell at me!

606
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,765
I know you're going to the US with Ro Na.

607
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,205
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

608
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,651
You only care and think about Ro Na.

609
00:37:41,651 --> 00:37:43,110
You don't care at all about me,

610
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,980
so why are you stopping me from being close to Dad?

611
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,091
Did you forget what he did to us?

612
00:37:49,091 --> 00:37:51,321
He even tried to kill our mom.

613
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:53,521
How are you still like this after all that he did to us?

614
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,426
I need him more.

615
00:37:55,631 --> 00:37:57,930
Mom doesn't want me to go to Seoul University.

616
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,501
What do you mean,

617
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:01,996
I don't want you to go there? You're mistaken.

618
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:05,496
Why did Logan's family come to see you?

619
00:38:05,571 --> 00:38:07,296
Is that a misunderstanding too?

620
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,341
What did he mean to you?

621
00:38:11,341 --> 00:38:13,711
Did you like the jerk who harassed us or something?

622
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:16,011
Was he the one who tried to send Seok Hoon to the US?

623
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:18,581
To claim the penthouse by yourself as Dad said?

624
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:20,145
That's enough, Joo Seok Kyung!

625
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:22,585
What are you doing?

626
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:24,145
Are you okay?

627
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,656
You have no right to hit me!

628
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:38,895
Are you happy now?

629
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:42,065
You turned us against each other. Does that make you happy?

630
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,705
I will never leave the penthouse...

631
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,705
because this is my dad's home.

632
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:06,356
Hey.

633
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:08,726
I keep running into you.

634
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:11,135
I heard your mom got out.

635
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,996
Will you keep living here?

636
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:16,536
You're the one who should leave, not me.

637
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,511
You are just as shameless as your mom.

638
00:39:21,511 --> 00:39:25,275
I live here too. On the 85th floor.

639
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,790
We'll run into each other morning and night.

640
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,315
Do you not care?

641
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:34,755
What? Are you looking for your bodyguard?

642
00:39:35,631 --> 00:39:37,831
Stay away. I warned you.

643
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:39,761
Get away from Seok Hoon.

644
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:42,926
I don't know what you're up to and why you approached my son...

645
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,236
What do you think you're doing?

646
00:39:47,941 --> 00:39:51,476
I remember everything you did to me.

647
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,341
So don't underestimate me.

648
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:56,075
- I'll make sure you pay! - You witch.

649
00:39:56,581 --> 00:39:58,075
You witch!

650
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:04,286
I should've killed her for sure back then.

651
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,755
You did well.

652
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:09,926
You did well, Ro Na.

653
00:40:09,961 --> 00:40:11,796
You did well.

661
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,021
And get along with Jenny.

00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:37,486
Okay.

- Thank you. - Thanks.

665
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:42,860

666
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,325
- All of it. - Okay. Give me a minute.

You are? You'll really take the test?

670
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,406
I have no reason to run away.

671
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,140
I'll prepare hard.

672
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:01,005

Hey. Drink like Jenny.

678

Okay. That's it.

Here, my princess. Eat more.

683
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,926
You need to eat well and be strong to perform well.

684
00:41:48,061 --> 00:41:50,656
I don't want to eat anymore. I'll gain weight.

685
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,461
I have to watch my weight now.

686
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:55,000
I want to do everything for you that I couldn't while I was away.

Why are you refusing?

688
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,671
You're just excited that Mom's coming out, aren't you?

689
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:04,036
Gosh. That too.

690
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:06,841

Stand tall. Stand proud.

Don't be discouraged, okay?

693
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,995
I must be studying too hard. I'm hallucinating.

694

You haven't changed.

697

you're strong and confident. That's your strength.

708
00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:21,686
See you later.

710

I just heard the news.

That you'll be our interim director.

716

I got the call too late.

717
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,031
I didn't get to clean up. I'm sorry.

As the interim director,

720
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,235
I'd like to see all the student records.

721
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:20,341
Will you get them for me right now?

722
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:22,546
Why do you want to see...

723
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:25,350
I see. You must be worried about Seok Hoon's...

724
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,220
and Seok Kyung's college applications.

725
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,520
You don't have to worry about a thing.

726
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,720
You know me.

727
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,821
I've made sure they're perfect as per Chairman Joo's orders.

728
00:44:33,821 --> 00:44:37,191
I made sure they won every award that was given out...

729
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:39,130
within the school.

730
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,270
They received 50 awards.

731
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,465
I heard you've even lost your house in a speculative investment.

732
00:44:46,071 --> 00:44:48,335
I guess you still haven't learned your lesson.

733
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,581
- Pardon? - From this day forth,

734
00:44:51,581 --> 00:44:54,235
you've been removed from all of your duties.

735
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:57,776
The grounds will be what you just admitted.

736
00:44:58,451 --> 00:44:59,876
Manipulating student records.

737
00:44:59,921 --> 00:45:03,050
But I did that for your babies...

738
00:45:03,051 --> 00:45:05,490
I mean, your children.

739
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,760
I devoted myself to them.

740
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,291
It is my rule...

741
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,955
that no one gets special treatment. Not even my own children.

742
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:14,801
Given the disgraceful incident...

743
00:45:14,801 --> 00:45:17,126
during the festival this year,

744
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,796
the principal will no longer give recommendations.

745
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:24,306
That is all. You may leave.

746
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,551
This is unfair.

747
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:30,711
All I did was devote myself...

748
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:32,681
to the school and the parents.

749
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:35,051
And I've played a big part...

750
00:45:35,051 --> 00:45:37,945
in sending so many students to the top colleges.

751
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,825
You can't do this to me.

752
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,695
I'll submit a complaint to the Ministry of Education.

753
00:45:48,701 --> 00:45:50,565
I won't go down alone.

754
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,835
So please, give me one more chance.

755
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:00,911
As an educator,

756
00:46:00,911 --> 00:46:03,245
you should not have submitted to the parents.

757
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:05,845
I'm done listening to you.

758
00:46:06,051 --> 00:46:10,085
Ma'am. Director Shim. Director Shim!

759
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:13,390
He must be waiting.

760
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,729
Mother, do you really plan not to go?

761
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,000
Why should I go there?

762
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,825
Did Kyu Jin save the country or something?

763
00:46:19,931 --> 00:46:21,801
When I think about my money that he blew,

764
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:24,095
I stay up at night crying.

765
00:46:24,301 --> 00:46:27,735
I'm only stopping by because of my grandson.

766
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,705
Well, now that you're out, I don't need to come anymore.

767
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:38,975
Mother. He'll be very hurt.

768
00:46:39,921 --> 00:46:41,250
Father...

769
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,416
cut all ties with us as soon as he went to jail.

770
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,591
He's just waiting...

771
00:46:46,591 --> 00:46:49,526
for us to post his bail.

772
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,100
Give me a break.

773
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,130
My son is in prison.

774
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,201
My daughter-in-law is out on probation.

775
00:46:54,201 --> 00:46:55,965
My grandson is a school bully.

776
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,941
What idiocy is this...

777
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,995
in a family of lawyers?

778
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:03,711
Don't come over for the time being.

779
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:06,475
Stay quiet until you hear from me.

780
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,350
Mother. Mother.

781
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,945
You can't just leave, Mother.

782
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,815
Mother!

I am free of my in-laws.

00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:34,436
I am free of my husband!

786
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:36,711
It's been so long since I was free.

787
00:47:36,711 --> 00:47:38,781
Kyu Jin, I'm sorry.

788
00:47:38,781 --> 00:47:40,581
You never served in the army,

789
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:42,281
so you've never lived with a group before.

790
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:43,776
Since you're in there,

791
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:47,516
I hope you come back out as a decent human being.

792
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,485
Good luck.

793
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:55,256
I wish you the best.

794
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,455
Sang A!

795
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:02,495
Why am I hearing things?

796
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,636
Come back home

797
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,406
Kyu Jin got out on bail.

798
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,886
Sang A!

799
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:59,815
(Seoul Bank)

800
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:20,041
Hey! Mr. Yoo.

801
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,081
Attorney Lee, you got out.

802
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:24,245
I should've visited you sooner.

803
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:26,115
Your wife got out too, right?

804
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,720
You bet. I did my time,

805
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,855
and then Kyu Jin got out to see you.

806
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:38,796
Why is there black stuff on the surface? That's a bad omen.

807
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:40,630
I think there's an issue with the plumbing.

808
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,126
It smells bad, doesn't it?

809
00:49:42,571 --> 00:49:44,331
I'll call Maintenance...

810
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:46,201
and fix it up perfectly myself.

811
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:47,600
I'm sure they'll manage.

812
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,911
Let's get going. Chairman Joo wants us there by 9pm.

813
00:49:49,911 --> 00:49:53,235
But darn it, this rotten smell is really bad.

814
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,646
Do you think it's a dead body?

815
00:50:00,321 --> 00:50:01,416
Let's go.

816
00:50:02,551 --> 00:50:03,745
Oh, my.

817
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,555
Cheers.

818
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:13,761
Are you sure Cheong A Group can make a comeback?

819
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:17,426
Your shares reached a new low. It's killing me.

820
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:20,501
I trusted my stupid aide and bought at the last minute...

821
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:22,965
and now I'm totally ruined.

822
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,741
But then, both husband and wife ended up in handcuffs.

823
00:50:26,741 --> 00:50:27,811
Who would invest?

824
00:50:27,811 --> 00:50:31,205
Have you forgotten already who got you out on bail?

825
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:34,450
Do you know how much I spent to get your wife out too?

826
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,190
Try not to get too upset.

827
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,215
I said that out of pure concern.

828
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:43,091
Stock prices will rise again with one good piece of news.

829
00:50:43,091 --> 00:50:45,360
What good news? A friend?

830
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,725
Do you have a friend called Good News?

831
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:51,100
Good news isn't a person's name here.

832
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,071
Dong Pil is way older than me,

833
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:57,241
but you're an idiot.

834
00:50:57,241 --> 00:51:01,305
What gives you the guts to keep sidling up to me?

835
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:03,346
If there's no good news, make some.

836
00:51:03,481 --> 00:51:04,805
Right, Chairman?

837
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:06,445
Don't you have a plan?

838
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:10,545
- Cheonsoo District. - Cheon... Cheon...

839
00:51:11,251 --> 00:51:14,955
Not again. Not that darn Cheonsoo District again!

840
00:51:15,091 --> 00:51:17,390
I sunk millions of dollars into that...

841
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,960
and my mom disowned me and I had to quit politics.

842
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,200
My whole life was ruined!

843
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,795
Get back up after you fall. Isn't that how life is?

844
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:27,771
Do you have what I asked for?

845
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:29,735
Here's the report on Opyeong District.

846
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:31,241
After the redevelopment was announced,

847
00:51:31,241 --> 00:51:34,106
everything's been going well without a hitch.

848
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,051
Opyeong District's redevelopment. We have to flip it.

849
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:42,285
Does that make sense? The land there...

850
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,690
was flattened out...

851
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:46,061
and they started work already.

852
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,555
Isn't that why we gathered to put our heads together?

853
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:52,856
How did you pass the bar with a brain like that?

854
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:57,166
The planner of our group...

855
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:59,600
was always Dr. Ha.

856
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,936
Yes.

857
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,341
He was a hypocrite, but he was a smart one.

858
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:06,836
I lost my appetite for alcohol!

859
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,081
Why must you mention a fool...

860
00:52:09,081 --> 00:52:11,846
who needs to rot in jail for much longer?

861
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:14,176
So I invited another person...

862
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:16,485
with the smart brain that you want.

863
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,715
Come in!

864
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,396
How've you been?

865
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,910
Stay seated.

866
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:37,705
You don't have to stand to welcome me.

867
00:52:37,771 --> 00:52:38,880
It's too much of an honour.

868
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,376
Ha Yoon Chul, how come you're here?

869
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:42,950
When did you get out?

870
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,346
Just today.

871
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,545
I had the shortest sentence of us all.

872
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:50,146
Wasn't my release a long time coming?

873
00:52:58,331 --> 00:53:00,096
This is fantastic.

874
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:02,725
Let's talk about work first.

875
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,566
Mr. Yoo briefed me on why you're meeting today.

876
00:53:06,741 --> 00:53:09,136
I'm here because I'd like to join this project.

877
00:53:09,471 --> 00:53:11,740
Why did you invite him without my permission?

878
00:53:11,741 --> 00:53:13,541
How much did you tell him?

879
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:14,940
Two years ago, near Opyeong District,

880
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,176
a Joseon kiln site was found.

881
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,376
You know that, right?

882
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,156
The trick to put a stop to the Opyeong District development.

883
00:53:27,221 --> 00:53:28,586
I have one.

884
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,465
I did some thinking when I was left alone in jail.

885
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,041
What do I get from pretending to be...

886
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,936
just and straight?

887
00:53:42,471 --> 00:53:45,876
I won't do that anymore, and now I know my place.

888
00:53:46,511 --> 00:53:50,680
I decided to be the worst of the worst trash.

889
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,775
Wrong.

890
00:53:52,481 --> 00:53:53,846
I disapprove.

891
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:57,521
He's an expert at stabbing people in the back.

892
00:53:57,521 --> 00:54:00,920
Don't you remember how he betrayed us in court?

893
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,856
Chairman Joo, you won't trust Traitor Ha, will you?

894
00:54:05,331 --> 00:54:09,225
Right now, right here, no one's as desperate as I am.

895
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:11,170
I lost everything.

896
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:14,465
My wife, kid, home, money, honour, everything!

897
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:17,265
Even my doctor's license was suspended.

898
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:20,836
I can't even practice now.

899
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,275
Isn't that why...

900
00:54:25,751 --> 00:54:31,215
you're back here, to get revenge on us?

901
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:36,785
Hey. Do you think we are stupid and...

902
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,166
Revenge is only possible when you have money and power.

903
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,965
I need to survive.

904
00:54:52,541 --> 00:54:54,376
What must I do to make you believe me?

905
00:55:08,061 --> 00:55:09,455
He's insane.

906
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,326
Shall I dig out my heart too?

907
00:55:20,741 --> 00:55:21,836
Do it.

908
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,805
Stop.

909
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,025
You won't regret this.

910
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:54,096
I'm even prepared to lick the soles of your feet.

911
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,436
(Opyeong District Redevelopment Plan)

912
00:56:02,551 --> 00:56:04,005
(Wiretapped)

913
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:07,581
You idiot. How many times must I tell you?

914
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:11,751
Look. If an artifact is unearthed in Opyeong District...

915
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:13,261
Construction will be stopped...

916
00:56:13,261 --> 00:56:15,190
and an investigation will begin.

917
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:18,261
Then Cheonsoo District that was going to be redeveloped...

918
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:21,725
but then not will resurface as the next place to redevelop.

919
00:56:23,271 --> 00:56:24,600
It's next to a kiln site,

920
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,465
so the artifact should be pottery.

921
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,495
I will look into that.

922
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,440
We'll get something if we ask a fencer.

923
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,771
We'll need an excavator.

924
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:33,410
I will drive it myself.

925
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,551
I can invite reporters and civic groups...

926
00:56:35,551 --> 00:56:37,305
to make a huge fuss.

927
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,285
Hey, Ha Yoon Chul.

928
00:56:42,321 --> 00:56:45,591
I can no longer stand watching you be so haughty.

929
00:56:45,591 --> 00:56:48,985
Tonight, let's get things straight.

930
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,326
We need to sort out our rank.

931
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,626
I was born in October of 1978.

932
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,965
I was born in early 1978.

933
00:57:02,071 --> 00:57:03,666
But you can be my senior.

934
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,936
I am your minion!

935
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,850
It has been a while since the four of us got together.

936
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:12,445
We must make it big.

937
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:16,086
Let's score so that we stink of money.

938
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,620
You're way too eager.

939
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:23,360
The group feels perfect now that Dr. Ha is back.

940
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,955
Let's make a toast.

941
00:57:25,331 --> 00:57:28,301
Here's to the grand return of Hera Club in its entirety.

942
00:57:28,301 --> 00:57:30,096
- Cheers! - Cheers!

943
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,370
- Hey. Yoon Chul. - Yes?

944
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,535
Why don't you sing for us?

945
00:57:51,595 --> 00:57:52,690
Freeze.

946
00:57:53,215 --> 00:57:54,544
Do you know what time it is?

947
00:57:54,544 --> 00:57:56,345
Your wife was released from prison today.

948
00:57:56,345 --> 00:57:59,179
How could you come home at this hour reeking of alcohol?

949
00:58:02,455 --> 00:58:03,550
Honey.

950
00:58:05,794 --> 00:58:06,949
Sweetheart.

951
00:58:09,665 --> 00:58:12,459
My lady, tonight is going to be an unforgettable night.

952
00:58:14,364 --> 00:58:16,229
- Dad! - Jenny.

953
00:58:16,864 --> 00:58:19,775
Jenny, were you still up?

954
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,970
Of course, I waited up.

955
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:24,440
Our family is finally reunited. How about some chicken and soda?

956
00:58:24,775 --> 00:58:26,975
Dad, I found an amazing chicken place.

957
00:58:26,975 --> 00:58:29,045
You did? Then shall we?

958
00:58:29,045 --> 00:58:32,809
This is not okay. I had a plan, Jenny.

959
00:58:33,015 --> 00:58:34,750
- Go in. - Okay.

960
00:58:35,184 --> 00:58:36,349
Come on.

961
00:58:38,424 --> 00:58:40,550
Let me just change first.

962
00:58:40,864 --> 00:58:42,659
Order everything you want.

963
00:58:43,164 --> 00:58:46,364
Anyway, why did you come home so late?

964
00:58:46,364 --> 00:58:47,929
Did you already start working?

965
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:50,135
I should get moving soon.

966
00:58:50,135 --> 00:58:51,670
I had a business meeting.

967
00:58:52,105 --> 00:58:54,940
The fountain on the first floor seems to be out of order.

968
00:58:55,075 --> 00:58:56,304
Has it ever happened before?

969
00:58:56,304 --> 00:58:58,140
The fountain is out of order?

970
00:58:58,375 --> 00:59:00,745
It was built with the best materials from Europe.

971
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:01,840
That's strange.

972
00:59:02,185 --> 00:59:05,409
As the person who built it, I feel bad.

973
00:59:05,985 --> 00:59:07,480
I should probably take it apart myself.

974
00:59:15,224 --> 00:59:17,390
You're going to quit this, right?

975
00:59:17,864 --> 00:59:19,235
Quit right now.

976
00:59:19,235 --> 00:59:21,860
I'll make sure we move to the top floor of Hera Palace.

977
00:59:23,504 --> 00:59:24,599
Well...

978
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:30,205
I'm still too young to retire.

979
00:59:30,205 --> 00:59:32,314
As long as there are ladies who insist on receiving my service,

980
00:59:32,314 --> 00:59:34,170
how can I quit?

981
00:59:34,814 --> 00:59:37,480
Here. Cheers.

982
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:47,249
I hope you're not getting involved with Joo Dan Tae.

983
00:59:47,665 --> 00:59:49,494
I'm not. That's absurd.

984
00:59:49,494 --> 00:59:51,394
You'd better not.

985
00:59:51,394 --> 00:59:53,929
I won't sit back if you get involved with that jerk in any way.

986
00:59:54,165 --> 00:59:57,899
He deserves to be torn to pieces. That piece of trash.

987
00:59:58,535 --> 01:00:00,475
You're on probation now.

988
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:02,545
You shouldn't tear a person to pieces.

989
01:00:02,545 --> 01:00:04,739
So? Are you going to continue to hang out with him?

990
01:00:04,815 --> 01:00:07,614
You were in prison for six years because of that jerk.

991
01:00:07,614 --> 01:00:10,815
- It makes my blood boil. - Is someone talking about me?

992
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,649
Are you listening to me or not?

993
01:00:14,154 --> 01:00:16,024
Jenny, has the food arrived yet?

994
01:00:16,024 --> 01:00:17,119
Wait.

995
01:00:18,124 --> 01:00:21,459
He's not only good-looking but also so kind-hearted.

996
01:00:21,695 --> 01:00:24,589
I can never relax.

997
01:00:41,344 --> 01:00:42,815
I'm so worried.

998
01:00:42,815 --> 01:00:44,584
SNU's performance test is right around the corner.

999
01:00:44,584 --> 01:00:46,480
I wonder if I can lose weight until then.

1000
01:00:48,084 --> 01:00:49,654
It's your kid taking the test.

1001
01:00:49,654 --> 01:00:52,325
Why should you lose weight?

1002
01:00:52,325 --> 01:00:54,894
As her mom, I should do something.

1003
01:00:54,894 --> 01:00:56,860
It's the least I can do to get her into SNU.

1004
01:00:57,795 --> 01:01:01,804
At our age, we don't have the energy to work out.

1005
01:01:01,804 --> 01:01:04,705
And it's not easy to lose weight simply by fasting.

1006
01:01:04,705 --> 01:01:05,800
You're right.

1007
01:01:05,975 --> 01:01:09,339
- Excuse me. What's taking so long? - Gosh.

1008
01:01:14,915 --> 01:01:16,080
Hello.

1009
01:01:16,684 --> 01:01:17,684
Oh, my.

1010
01:01:17,684 --> 01:01:19,184
How have you been?

1011
01:01:19,184 --> 01:01:22,719
Yoon Hee, what are you doing here?

1012
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:25,019
Don't tell me you work here.

1013
01:01:25,424 --> 01:01:27,054
I did hear that you got released,

1014
01:01:27,054 --> 01:01:30,094
but I didn't expect you to find a job so soon.

1015
01:01:30,094 --> 01:01:34,029
Anyway, how did you get released so early?

1016
01:01:34,135 --> 01:01:37,459
We really need stricter laws in this country.

1017
01:01:38,674 --> 01:01:40,705
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin walked free...

1018
01:01:40,705 --> 01:01:43,100
after committing crimes too.

1019
01:01:43,644 --> 01:01:44,910
Are you okay with that?

1020
01:01:46,575 --> 01:01:49,309
I got released legally.

1021
01:01:50,015 --> 01:01:51,350
Stop being nosy.

1022
01:01:51,984 --> 01:01:53,815
How dare you speak to me like that?

1023
01:01:53,815 --> 01:01:55,749
You're a murderer!

1024
01:02:09,435 --> 01:02:10,530
My gosh.

1025
01:02:10,765 --> 01:02:12,770
You scared me.

1026
01:02:14,445 --> 01:02:17,910
From now on, please be more careful.

1027
01:02:18,515 --> 01:02:22,939
The first time is always the hardest.

1028
01:02:29,755 --> 01:02:32,590
Let me know if you need any help.

1029
01:02:34,894 --> 01:02:35,964
Gosh.

1030
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:39,829
Did she just threaten to kill us?

1031
01:02:40,034 --> 01:02:42,664
Unit 4502 belongs to JohnBIO,

1032
01:02:42,664 --> 01:02:44,104
so I thought she'd move out immediately.

1033
01:02:44,104 --> 01:02:46,205
But apparently, I was wrong.

1034
01:02:46,205 --> 01:02:49,505
Hera Palace is no rehab center for criminals.

1035
01:02:49,505 --> 01:02:51,075
To rent a shop this size in Hera Palace,

1036
01:02:51,075 --> 01:02:52,939
she must've paid a huge deposit.

1037
01:02:53,274 --> 01:02:55,385
I wonder where Ms. Oh got that much money.

1038
01:02:55,385 --> 01:02:58,615
I know. Maybe Su Ryeon lent her some money.

1039
01:02:58,615 --> 01:02:59,885
No way.

1040
01:02:59,885 --> 01:03:02,650
Why would she lend money to a woman who killed her daughter?

1041
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,489
Did she hit the jackpot or something?

1042
01:03:06,394 --> 01:03:08,224
Did she make money in prison?

1043
01:03:08,224 --> 01:03:11,129
She sure has a way with money.

1044
01:03:11,394 --> 01:03:13,495
That's not it. Be quiet for a moment.

1045
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:17,629
There must be something huge behind her.

1046
01:03:23,274 --> 01:03:25,009
Su Ryeon, it's been a while.

1047
01:03:26,214 --> 01:03:29,584
Thanks to you, I experienced so many things...

1048
01:03:29,584 --> 01:03:31,980
that I never imagined I would.

1049
01:03:32,385 --> 01:03:33,480
I see.

1050
01:03:34,154 --> 01:03:35,925
You know,

1051
01:03:35,925 --> 01:03:39,150
if we're going to keep seeing each other as neighbours,

1052
01:03:39,325 --> 01:03:42,860
I think we should let bygones be bygones.

1053
01:03:42,894 --> 01:03:45,995
We went through so much in there.

1054
01:03:45,995 --> 01:03:48,259
You have no idea.

1055
01:03:49,834 --> 01:03:51,670
It must've been so hard.

1056
01:03:53,534 --> 01:03:55,170
Is that what you want to hear?

1057
01:03:56,945 --> 01:04:01,179
Let's face it, you're not entirely innocent either.

1058
01:04:01,544 --> 01:04:03,344
Oh Yoon Hee is already out of prison...

1059
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:06,815
and has even opened her own shop.

1060
01:04:06,815 --> 01:04:09,720
It isn't exactly a pretty sight, I must say.

1061
01:04:09,955 --> 01:04:10,984
She opened her own shop?

1062
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:12,894
You didn't know that?

1063
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:15,689
We thought you financed it.

1064
01:04:16,325 --> 01:04:18,660
Then who financed it?

1065
01:04:18,995 --> 01:04:20,559
Did Logan leave some money to her...

1066
01:04:20,894 --> 01:04:22,805
when he died?

1067
01:04:22,805 --> 01:04:24,065
Why would he?

1068
01:04:24,065 --> 01:04:25,699
What's their relationship?

1069
01:04:27,234 --> 01:04:29,844
Could it be that Oh Yoon Hee...

1070
01:04:29,844 --> 01:04:31,214
Killed him?

1071
01:04:31,214 --> 01:04:33,710
You people haven't changed a bit, have you?

1072
01:04:34,044 --> 01:04:36,040
Do you still fear nothing in the world?

1073
01:04:36,445 --> 01:04:38,249
Watch your mouth.

1074
01:04:42,654 --> 01:04:46,094
Is she going to report us or something?

1075
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:48,160
What's the big deal about Logan?

I was too harsh on you yesterday.

1087

I thought about it,

1088
01:05:36,044 --> 01:05:37,274
and I think it was a great move...

1089
01:05:37,274 --> 01:05:40,639
to invite Yoon Chul to join the Cheonsoo District project.

1090
01:05:41,015 --> 01:05:43,239
Thank you for thinking of it that way.

1091

Is Jenny doing okay with getting ready for college?

1092
01:05:45,284 --> 01:05:46,850
Do you need anything?

1093
01:05:47,185 --> 01:05:48,550
No, it's okay.

1094
01:05:48,584 --> 01:05:50,584
You've already given us a great house,

1095
01:05:50,584 --> 01:05:52,720
and you helped my wife with her work.

1096
01:05:52,925 --> 01:05:55,590
I have no idea how I'm going to pay you back.

1097
01:05:55,594 --> 01:05:58,065
These days, I spend most of my time doing things for Jenny...

1098
01:05:58,065 --> 01:05:59,590
to make up for the time while I was gone.

1099
01:06:02,505 --> 01:06:05,935
Jenny doesn't know...

1100
01:06:05,935 --> 01:06:07,270
that you went to jail...

1101
01:06:07,734 --> 01:06:09,939
for murder, right?

1102
01:06:11,045 --> 01:06:14,569
Of course not. I'll keep my lips sealed forever.

1103
01:06:14,614 --> 01:06:18,079
Good. I'll do the same.

1104

1106

1107
01:06:25,025 --> 01:06:26,620
I'd be honoured.

1108
01:06:27,555 --> 01:06:29,490
You really are a generous man.

1109
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:31,429
I admire you, sir.

1110
01:06:31,435 --> 01:06:33,390
Okay, you may go now.

1111
01:06:45,874 --> 01:06:47,270
I'm impressed.

1112
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:50,040
How was that?

1113
01:06:50,815 --> 01:06:52,309
Do you believe me now?

1114
01:06:52,614 --> 01:06:54,410
I have Jenny's father...

1115
01:06:54,685 --> 01:06:57,124
in the palm of my hand.

1116
01:06:57,124 --> 01:06:58,494
You're right.

1117
01:06:58,494 --> 01:07:01,020
I hated how he kept going around acting like a big shot.

1118
01:07:01,665 --> 01:07:03,990
Now tell me why you're here.

1119
01:07:04,264 --> 01:07:06,134
What is it that you want?

1120
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:08,500
Mom doesn't want me to go to SNU.

1121
01:07:08,935 --> 01:07:10,405
As soon as she became the director of Cheong A Foundation,

1122
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:12,170
she forbade the principal from recommending anyone.

1123
01:07:14,374 --> 01:07:16,300
Well, obviously.

1124
01:07:16,405 --> 01:07:18,040
You and that woman...

1125
01:07:18,374 --> 01:07:20,910
aren't related at all. She's pretty much a stranger.

1126
01:07:20,915 --> 01:07:22,984
Why would she want you to go to SNU...

1127
01:07:22,984 --> 01:07:25,709
when you were one of the kids who bullied her daughter?

1128
01:07:26,114 --> 01:07:27,555
You're my daughter,

1129
01:07:27,555 --> 01:07:29,979
so she'll never let you become happy.

1130
01:07:30,185 --> 01:07:32,349
What would you do if you were in her shoes?

1131
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:34,859
Wouldn't you want to destroy whomever hurt your daughter?

1132
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:37,160
Don't speak ill of her.

1133
01:07:40,195 --> 01:07:42,660
Just get rid of a disgusting loach for me.

1134
01:07:44,205 --> 01:07:46,770
A loach? Whom?

1135
01:07:47,874 --> 01:07:49,945
- Bae Ro Na. - "Ro Na"?

1136
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:52,209
But she's not even going to take the CSATs.

1137
01:07:52,474 --> 01:07:54,809
She changed her mind.

1138
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:56,809
I bet Mom convinced her.

1139
01:07:58,714 --> 01:08:02,120
Do everything you can to make her fail the test.

1140
01:08:02,185 --> 01:08:03,520
You'll do that for me, right?

1141
01:08:05,854 --> 01:08:10,089
When have I ever let you down?

1142
01:08:10,994 --> 01:08:13,559
Don't worry. I'll deal with it for you.

1143
01:08:15,334 --> 01:08:18,569
I really want to go to SNU.

1144
01:08:19,134 --> 01:08:20,829
With Seok Hoon.

1145
01:08:22,004 --> 01:08:24,699
Yes, of course. It's only right that you go there.

to stay by my side.

1192

I thought you went back to the States.

1201
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:38,405
I'm actually taking care of Eun Byeol at the moment.

She has no parents.

1203

Why are you still taking care of her?

I don't see why I need to explain my private life to you.

1206
01:11:49,244 --> 01:11:52,250

1250
01:14:48,494 --> 01:14:49,919
There comes your father.

1251
01:14:53,195 --> 01:14:56,004
Jenny doesn't know...

1252
01:14:56,004 --> 01:14:59,230
that you went to jail for murder, right?

1253
01:14:59,335 --> 01:15:02,470
Of course not. I'll keep my lips sealed forever.

1254
01:15:03,304 --> 01:15:05,844
I'm not late, am I? They didn't call your name, right?

1255
01:15:05,845 --> 01:15:07,909
Here's your scarf...

1256
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:10,645
Why are you so nervous?

1257
01:15:10,645 --> 01:15:12,655
Your face is pale.

1258
01:15:12,655 --> 01:15:14,484
Don't worry. Just be at ease.

1259
01:15:14,484 --> 01:15:17,520
If my daughter doesn't get into SNU, the school will be losing out.

1260
01:15:17,984 --> 01:15:20,695
Wait. I need to go to the bathroom.

1261
01:15:20,695 --> 01:15:22,294
The bathroom? I'll go with you.

1262
01:15:22,294 --> 01:15:23,464
- Jenny. - You're unbelievable.

1263
01:15:23,464 --> 01:15:25,595
- You can't go with her. - Oh, right.

1264
01:15:25,595 --> 01:15:27,464
Why does she keep going to the bathroom?

1265
01:15:27,464 --> 01:15:28,705
Do you think it's because she's nervous?

1266
01:15:28,705 --> 01:15:29,859
I know, right?

1267
01:15:31,534 --> 01:15:33,399
Everyone, attention.

1268
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:36,440
The performance test for classical singing will begin now.

01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:47,750
or any other accessories that could make you stand out.

1273
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:57,859
Jenny, are you ready?

I can't go to the same school with someone I bullied.

Hey, Ro Na. Did you do a good job?

1290
01:17:31,324 --> 01:17:33,125
Yes, I got to sing the song I practiced the most.

1291

I'm so glad to hear that. You did great.

1323

I can't believe this is how you chose to take revenge.

01:19:33,014 --> 01:19:35,809
Fine. I'll do the exact same thing to you.

Stop taking it out on her...

1330
01:19:45,224 --> 01:19:46,695

While I was taking my test,

1333
01:19:53,865 --> 01:19:56,599
your cell phone suddenly rang inside my pocket.

1334
01:19:57,504 --> 01:19:59,270
You put it in there on purpose, didn't you?

1335
01:20:00,274 --> 01:20:01,500

1373
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:20,339

Why?

1378
01:22:43,964 --> 01:22:47,230
She wants to become your sole guardian...

1379
01:22:47,675 --> 01:22:50,500
so she can take the inheritance of your biological mother.

1380
01:22:52,214 --> 01:22:54,669

But it's true.

1383
01:23:01,754 --> 01:23:03,550
She's related to...

1384
01:23:03,784 --> 01:23:05,690
the death of your biological mother.

1385

You're Baek Jun Ki, aren't you?

1391
01:23:41,824 --> 01:23:44,520
Let me go. I'm going to kill him.

1392
01:23:44,564 --> 01:23:47,389
Baek Jun Ki, who are you really?

1393

1404

1406
01:24:59,534 --> 01:25:01,304
- Mr. Baek. - Logan?

1407
