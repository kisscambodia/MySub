(Ministry of Justice)

2
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,329
- Gosh.
- What is all this?

3
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,758
What did you do before
coming in here?

4
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,729
- Me?
- Yes.

5
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,129
Why would you ask
such a miserable question?

6
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,199
- Shoot.
- What about you?

7
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,868
Are you married?

8
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,199
No, I'm not.

9
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,869
Did you have a bad dream, Chairman?

10
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,810
It's uncomfortable sleeping here,
isn't it?

11
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,056
How do you expect me to live
in a dump like this?

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,649
This is so far from decent,
and why are there so many bugs?

13
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:04,050
You know, there's a place they call
the penthouse of the prison.

14
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,419
They remodeled it last year,
so it's way more spacious than here,

15
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,529
and the bathrooms are clean.

16
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,759
All the rich ones
have gathered there already.

17
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,759
If you bribe the guard a little,
it should be enough.

18
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,469
The prison penthouse?

19
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,868
Kyu Jin can't do it.

20
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:22,439
What did you say? You can't do it?

21
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,779
I was an attorney
at a major law firm.

22
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:29,950
When I was in Gangnam,
I was even an assemblyman.

23
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,748
What use is any of that in prison?

24
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:34,580
That's not how it works here.

25
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:38,659
But yesterday, and the day before,
and the day before that,

26
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,018
Kyu Jin did all the dishes.

27
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:42,428
Why, you...

28
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,230
Affair, unbridled love,
unparalleled achievement.

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,028
I was an attorney who specialized
in doing dishes.

30
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:50,898
I'll make sure every dish
is sparkling clean.

31
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,140
Gosh.

32
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,939
Who does the dishes in the bathroom?

33
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,279
Honey.

34
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,790
Sang A...

35
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,290
Sang A.

36
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,230
Gosh, Sang A.

37
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,399
Sang A, Sang A!

38
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,200
I miss you.

39
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:25,469
Sang A...

40
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,869
How is it on your side?

41
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,070
How?

42
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:39,279
My dear.

43
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,319
Your neck looks a bit tense.

44
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,660
Should I show you how skilled
my hands are?

45
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,130
- Okay.
- Okay?

46
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:59,040
That's so refreshing. That's great.

47
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:02,139
Before I came in here,

48
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,510
my nickname was Lumber and Brick.

49
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,080
You need more than three hours
to break the brick in my shoulders.

50
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,849
Wow, your hands really are skilled.

51
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,979
You have to really get
your pressure points,

52
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,219
and relieve the tension there.

53
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,618
You must've suffered
from this slipped disc here.

54
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:21,759
While I'm here,

55
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,960
I'll make sure
you recover completely.

56
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:28,800
I've met a great doctor in prison.

57
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,869
Of course, I'm an expert.

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,270
Hey, 4815, bring me the snacks.

59
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,540
Now.

60
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,009
That looks really tasty.

61
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,229
(Matdongsan Peanut Crunch Snack)

62
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,290
Here, some special praise.

63
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,488
Gosh.

64
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:55,559
I wasn't doing all that
just to get this from you,

65
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,829
but I'll eat it gratefully.

66
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,499
5450.

67
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,308
Hang them up on this side.

68
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,939
The light's better here.

69
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,910
How do you adjust so well
to this place?

70
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,650
After coming here,
I never got a good night's sleep.

71
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,049
But you eat well, sleep well,

72
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,549
and poop well too.

73
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,590
Does prison life suit you?

74
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:26,290
Have you done this before?

75
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,759
Everywhere people live,
it's all the same.

76
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,429
You want?

77
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,569
Sang A, you have no social skills.

78
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,210
After coming here,
I do feel I lived my life in vain.

79
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:52,019
But have you seen
Cheon Seo Jin at all today?

80
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,419
No. She said she had a meeting
with her lawyers in the morning.

81
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,789
But why isn't she back yet?

82
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,659
They cut off all our visits
the second they're over.

83
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,628
Our visits are ordinary visits,

84
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:05,058
and she's getting a special,
golden session with her lawyers.

85
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:07,860
And that's exactly what rank is.

86
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:11,068
Just because we're all wearing
the same clothes in here,

87
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,999
it doesn't mean we're all living
the same lives.

88
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,170
This place is just like Hera Palace.

89
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,280
The one in the penthouse.

90
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,008
The ones on the upper floors,
like me.

91
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:21,780
And the ones on the lower floors,
like you.

92
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,549
What? Why am I the lower one?

93
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm the wife of an Assemblyman.

94
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,739
I heard your in-laws
want nothing to do with you.

95
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,530
Just shake out the laundry
really well and hang it up,

96
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:42,530
if you want to survive from here.

(Lawyer Meeting Room)

98
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,579
After the Cheong A Foundation
went over to your mother,

99
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,649
I mean,
to the lady in Seongbuk-dong,

100
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,019
Cheong A Group's stock prices
fell by half.

101
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,049
The shareholders' discontent
is growing.

102
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,649
There's even talk
of dismissing the director...

103
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,360
pending the results of the appeal.

104
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,888
That's why I'm telling you
to prepare well for the appeal.

105
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,860
I'm telling you to find a way to get
me out on insufficient evidence.

106
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,199
That way, I can also recover
my Cheong A Foundation.

107
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,738
There's a rumor that
the lady in Seongbuk-dong...

108
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,169
is selling off
the Cheong A Foundation.

109
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,238
Apparently,
there's already a buyer too.

110
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:26,309
What?

111
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:28,549
That's absurd.

112
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,909
How dare she do what she wants
with my foundation?

113
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,480
Who's the buyer?

114
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,980
That is...

115
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,020
Is it...

116
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:41,090
Shim Su Ryeon?

117

(Provisions for the sale
of Cheong A Foundation)

118
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:47,629
I had no idea you'd be selling
the foundation so quickly.

119
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,099
I had no interest in it.

120
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,099
It was my husband's obsession.

121
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,839
But right now, the foundation
has been ruined...

122
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,109
because of my sister.

123
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,209
Why are you trying to buy it now?

124
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,809
Why are you asking
something like that?

125
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,550
You were curious about it too, Mom.

126
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,378
To be honest,
an academic foundation...

127
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:07,650
won't earn you any money either.

128
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,290
Is it noblesse oblige?

129
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,220
Oh, money laundering.

130
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:16,030
So that's how you ran
the foundation up till now.

131
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,829
And that's why it had done
such outrageously corrupt things.

132
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,129
Check the terms.

133
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,139
I'd like to finalize
the acquisition right away.

134
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,739
I'll try to sign it
as soon as possible.

135
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,910
I have good news, Mom.

136
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,850
What is it?

137
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,348
Mr. Ma says...

138
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:41,478
with the principal's
recommendation letter,

139
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,439
I'll get a free pass
to Seoul University of Music.

140
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,859
I was worried,
but I don't have to anymore.

141
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,589
Aren't you happy?

142
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,089
I just have to stay healthy
until the performance test.

Seok Kyung.

144
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,400
You don't have to go
to Seoul University of Music.

145
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,339
And you don't have to sing anymore
if you don't want to.

146
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:02,809
Weren't you singing
against your will because of Dad?

147
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:05,978
I didn't want to sing
while getting beat up.

148
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,009
I didn't mean I hated singing.

149
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,009
I have to go
to Seoul University of Music...

150
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,650
before studying abroad if I want
to become a top vocalist.

151
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,019
I want you to enjoy
doing what you do...

152
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,359
rather than just being famous.

153
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,659
Don't worry about what others think.

154
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,529
Do what makes you happy.

155
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,059
Who succeeds by doing
only what makes them happy?

156
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,599
Dad said...

157
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:32,439
we must pay our dues somehow
if we don't want to live like pigs.

158
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,539
I respect him in that sense.

159
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,880
I never saw him sleep
for more than three hours a day.

160
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,510
You came early.

161
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:43,178
Hi. You're just on time.

162
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:45,349
Hello. Have a seat.

163
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,078
You called Ro Na too?

164
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:49,588
The performance test is coming up.

165
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,219
Let's all enjoy some good food.

166
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,130
I've been seeing you often lately.

167
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,990
Aren't you working today?

168
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,090
It must be nice having time to kill
since you're not going to college.

169
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:02,799
You're not going to college?

170
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,000
Didn't you know?

171
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,040
She's not taking the CSAT.

172
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:08,938
She stopped practicing a while ago.

173
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:11,309
Why? You even won the grand prize.

174
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,179
When did you decide this?

175
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,679
Why?

176
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:17,750
Why are you getting so worked up?

177
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,219
It's her life.

178
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:25,790
Okay. Let's order
the main dishes first.

179
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,760
What do you want, Ro Na?

180
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,838
This is the money
you gave me last time.

181
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,439
I can't accept it.

182
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,540
Why not?

183
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,308
I'm filling in for your mom
until she gets out.

184
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:48,009
I'm making money.

185
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,650
I can manage on my own.

186
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,848
Ro Na. You're too talented...

187
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:55,849
to give up on singing.

188
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,519
If you get into the college
that you want,

189
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,958
it'll be of great comfort
for your mom.

190
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,689
I can't. I'm not that shameless.

191
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,698
You know how I got into
Cheong A Arts High School.

192
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,760
That was not your fault.

193
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:10,069
Your mom is paying for her crime...

194
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:15,510
Think about it some more
and then decide.

195
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,479
I really want to see you...

196
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,650
grow and develop into
a great vocalist.

197
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,849
Your neck must be cold.

198
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,329
You can't catch a cold
before the exam.

199
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Take it.

200
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,400
Let's go. The food will get cold.

201
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:08,929
(Establish Law and Order)

202
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,689
(Caution - Slippery)

203
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,939
Joo Dan Tae.
You don't deserve to live.

204
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,250
I'll slit your throat
with my own two hands.

205
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,920
It isn't common to get moved
to another room midway like this.

206
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,719
You're a lucky man.

207
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,959
It isn't luck. It's all about money.

208
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:20,699
Right.

209
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,630
Hey! Look over here! Over here!

210
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,650
(As long as there is hope,
you can start again.)

211
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,709
Hey you! Guards!

212
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,280
Seriously! I know you hear me!

213
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,380
I wish you luck, Joo Dan Tae.

214
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,490
What is this?

215
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,510
Why are you here?

216
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:03,809
Hey, Lifer Joo.

217
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:06,609
What?

218
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:10,809
Who did that?

219
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,620
You should introduce yourself
when you move into a new room.

220
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,079
To our boss.

221
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,020
Hi, newbie.

222
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,920
Newbie? Have you lost your...

223
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,598
This is my room.

224
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,199
Do you know how much money I spent
to get in here?

225
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:29,929
Quiet.

226
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:34,969
I say everything
with this one finger.

227
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:37,910
And I decide the rules of this room.

228
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:39,439
What...

229
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,949
I will assign everyone's spot
for today.

230
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:02,969
Give me a break.

231
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,800
Why am I next to the bathroom?
It stinks there!

232
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:22,119
Why are you banning me
from seeing my lawyer?

233
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,448
It's a right granted by law...

234
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:27,489
Do you know what garbage
we're going through because of you?

235
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,259
People are complaining that you are
being treated like royalty.

236
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,429
There are thousands of
nasty online comments.

237
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,699
You can only have regular visits
for the time being.

238
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,269
It is the warden's orders,
so just accept it.

239
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,938
You can't do that.

240
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:43,269
My appeal is just around the corner.
You can't keep me from my lawyer.

241
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,230
Are you telling me to rot in here
for seven years?

242
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:47,208
We have rights in this country.

243
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:49,708
I'm going to file a complaint.
Do you think I'll just take this?

244
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:50,709
Hey!

245
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,010
Why you...

246
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,588
Hey! Bring me my lawyer! Bring him!

247
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,920
You can't do this! Why you...

248
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,889
Who would visit her?

249
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,759
Her ex-husband, current husband,
everyone's in prison.

250
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,260
And her daughter's in juvie.

251
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,569
What? Ma Ri. Are you done?

252
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:13,439
Since when did you talk down to me?

253
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,540
What? Can't I talk down to you?

254
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,079
Glare at me all you want.

255
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:25,050
Look down, Ms. Cheon!

256
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:26,420
Forget it.

257
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:30,390
It's nice out, but I feel down.

258
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,559
You. 3388. Sing me a song.

259
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:35,420
I hear you sang before you came in.

260
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,858
Why should I care
if you feel down or up?

261
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:42,058
Sing to make you feel better?

262
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:44,198
I'd rather have you
pull out my tongue.

263
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:47,438
I'm Cheon Seo Jin,
the best soprano in Korea.

264
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,438
I don't sing just anywhere.

265
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:50,910
Oh my goodness.

266
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:54,708
Why are you acting out?
Do you have a death wish?

267
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,649
Just sing for her, Ms. Cheon!

268
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,848
What if she gets angry?

269
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,479
I won't. I refuse.

270
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,688
How could someone like her know...

271
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,759
what an aria is
or "Deutschlandlied"?

272
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,489
What? You're the cell boss?

273
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,659
How dare someone with nine priors
insult my singing?

274
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,729
Hey, you.

275
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,329
3388.

276
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,940
I may look like this,

277
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,680
but I studied vocal arts
at Ewha Womans University.

278
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:29,749
Okay. 3952 and 5450.

279
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,878
Every time you hear "Ah"
from my lips,

280
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:34,750
you may hit 3388
as hard as you want.

281
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:35,859
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

282
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,550
(Silence)

283
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:06,780
Sing with joy

284
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,749
Bless us

285
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,219
All the earth

286
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,388
My heart

287
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:19,158
- I will become a light and
- Oh, you are good.

288
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,629
Shine over you

289
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,359
Did you get some rest?

290
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,329
It must've been hard
getting over the jet lag.

291
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:54,430
I still don't know what's going on.

292
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,129
Or why you had me brought here.

293
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,699
It took me
quite a while to find you.

294
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,098
I never imagined you'd be living...

295
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,639
as Baek Jun Ki.

296
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,510
I didn't do it.

297
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,849
Someone trapped me
with that dirty name.

298
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,879
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

299
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,020
The man with the dirty name.

300
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,089
Is it him?

301
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,290
(Chairman Joo Dan Tae)

302
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,898
Mr. Baek.

303
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:33,000
That's right. Mr. Baek.

304
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,940
What on earth did he do to you?

305
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,780
He is a murderer.

306
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:43,210
He killed both my parents...

307
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,919
and ran off with my family's assets.

308
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,450
Mr. Baek is alive and in Korea.

309
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,760
Joo Dan Tae.

310
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,690
He took your name.

311
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,599
Why take my name?

312
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,069
That evil jerk...

313
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,710
No way...

314
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,780
No way!

315
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,889
Joo Dan Tae. Why did you
hurt Ro Na, you jerk?

316
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,929
Chief, chief. Gosh, boss.

317
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,329
- What's going on?
- You scumbag.

318
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,138
Guard! Guard!

319
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:19,279
There's a fight! Guard!

320
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,240
On your knees! On your knees!

321
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,250
Get off each other. Leave it!

322
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,919
What are you doing?

323
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,290
He tried to kill me.

324
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:33,760
He tried to stab me
with a sharpened toothbrush!

325
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,030
Is that true?

326
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,059
Sir.

327
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,059
That cannot be.

328
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,770
There's no way
we have a sharpened toothbrush.

329
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,539
Actually, this man...

330
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,040
attacked that man
while he was asleep.

331
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:51,808
What are you talking about?

332
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,878
That's true. We saw it too.

333
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,509
He's the worst!

334
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,108
It's a lie. They're lying.

335
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,848
He tried to stab me
with a toothbrush!

336
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:01,979
I apologize for the ruckus
late at night.

337
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,889
Sir. This has never happened before.

338
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,520
Let them off this once.

339
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,259
I will teach him a lesson.

340
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,599
Take extra care to keep him in line.

341
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,869
He was transferred here
for being a troublemaker.

342
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,730
Darn you.

343
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,200
You punk. How can you do this
after taking my money?

344
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:28,480
I'm warning you.

345
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:31,480
One more incident from you
and things will get really boring.

346
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:35,149
Your sentence could be finalized
without a chance of an appeal.

347
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,950
Is that what you want?

348
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,589
We're done here.

349
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:53,339
Boys.

350
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:01,539
Die.

351
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,280
Die. Die.

352
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,020
Only fools get blood
on their own hands.

353
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:15,359
You cannot leave a mark.

354
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,629
It's not the right time to kill him.
Back down and wait.

355
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,909
Yes.

356
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,550
I understand. Well done.

357
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:40,079
Don't slack off for a moment
and keep a close eye on him.

358
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,750
No one knows what he will do.

359
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,418
Yes, of course, sir.

360
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:49,088
You have my loyalty.

361
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:51,329
Yes, sir. I'm at your service.

362
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,129
Oh, that's under control. Yes, sure.

363
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,540
Come and wash my back for me.

364
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,839
- This is really nice.
- This is lovely.

365
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:11,609
- You need to get prettier.
- Come on.

366
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,450
Rub harder.

367
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,449
Oh, this feels good.

368
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,190
I feel refreshed.

369
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,628
What's he doing?

370
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:27,598
Boss, what are you doing?

371
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,730
Do something. He might die.

372
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,109
Is he trying to kill him?

373
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:43,550
What if he actually dies?

374
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:49,990
- Go and help him.
- No way.

375
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,849
He looks dead.

376
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,219
- Will you stop it now?
- Stop it.

377
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,729
- What's happening?
- Is he dead?

378
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,459
- No, he passed out.
- Did he?

379
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,800
- He fainted.
- He looks dead.

380
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,280
What happened?

381
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,349
Did you get into another fight?

382
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,819
No. He collapsed on his own.

383
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:23,088
He's sick now, is he?

384
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:26,720
Why is he on the floor,
ruining everyone's shower time?

385
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:28,619
Wake him up.

386
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,359
I'll do it, sir.

387
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,229
He wasn't dead.

388
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,639
- He's alive.
- I was scared for a second.

389
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,970
Chairman Joo. Get up!

390
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:48,510
Oh, dear. Chairman Joo.

391
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:51,108
Can you get him some help?

392
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:52,950
He's suffering.

393
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,069
Sir. Why do you look so dreadful?

394
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,000
You don't look well at all.

395
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:17,869
Cut out the nonsense and brief me.

396
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,979
Who is that old fool?

397
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,440
His name is Bang Chi Soon.

398
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,408
He ends up here so often,

399
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:25,078
he's friendly with all the guards,

400
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:27,079
and he'll do anything for money.

401
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,050
What's odd is, this time
he came here voluntarily.

402
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,289
He wasn't charged with anything,

403
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,690
and no trial date is set.

404
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:41,329
I think he's targeting you.

405
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,300
He's targeting me?

406
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,639
It's also strange
how all your lawyers are resigning.

407
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,639
It's his handiwork.

408
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:56,879
Logan Lee, that scumbag.

409
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,818
Get to my slush fund...

410
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,918
and bribe the most capable guard.

411
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,789
I don't care how much it costs.

412
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,449
Get me out of that cell.

413
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,220
If you don't, I might die.

414
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,030
The jerk.

415
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,409
(Nothing is too hard)

416
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,220
Mr. Chairman. Take it easy.

417
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:39,720
Here, have this.

418
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,599
There's a fun article in the paper.

419
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,918
(Logan Lee)

420
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,318
(Out!)

421
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,219
(D-day)

422
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,250
(9)

423
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,430
Let's go.

424
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,500
(9 days later)

425
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,979
- What a nice day.
- The weather's great.

426
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,180
- Gosh, this is nice.
- Yes, it is.

427
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,949
It's nice to be outside.

428
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,449
This is great.

429
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,848
- Nice.
- My gosh.

430

(Establish Law and Order)

431
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,658
Your wife cheated on you
with an upstairs neighbor,

432
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,828
and you cheated on her
with your first love?

433
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:56,158
Two-way adultery
could complicate things a little.

434
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,898
- But you should file a suit first.
- File a suit?

435
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:01,568
Don't worry about it.

436
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:05,740
I used to be the best divorce lawyer
before I came in here.

437
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:09,578
Then can I get a consultation
from you?

438
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:11,878
- Me too.
- No, wait.

439
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:14,719
My wife cheated on me!

440
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,618
You guys, that's it for today.

441
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:19,519
- My gosh, come on.
- Spare me some time!

442
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,889
(Establish Law and Order)

443
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,399
Traitor Ha, I'm so scared.

444
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,229
I never even went to the army,

445
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,399
but I'm slowly
getting used to this group life.

446
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,200
It's giving me the creeps.

447
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:39,169
By the way,
don't you miss Eun Byeol?

448
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,339
Isn't your darn daughter...

449
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:45,379
still locked up in juvie?

450
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,950
I heard she never came to visit.

451
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,450
Get lost, you darn scumbag.

452
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:55,260
Listen, you punk.

453
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:58,888
You're in no position
to be talking to us right now.

454
00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:00,530
Now get lost. Darn it.

455
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,598
Do you enjoy
being the big guy's little dog?

456
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,429
You acted as if you were
a righteous man.

457
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,200
But you're nothing but his minion.

458
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:11,368
By the way, I heard JohnBIO...

459
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:12,710
belongs to Logan Lee.

460
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:16,849
You're completely broke, aren't you?

461
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,550
Do you have a death wish?

462
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,950
Once I get out of here,

463
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,089
the first thing I'll do is kill
Oh Yoon Hee and her daughter.

464
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,459
I'll destroy everything
that's precious to you.

465
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,260
You crazy jerk!

466
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,800
Hey, Lifer!

467
00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:37,299
Do you think
it's okay to be violent...

468
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,270
because you've already received
a life sentence?

469
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:42,599
You darn punk!

470
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,050
You scum. Come here.

471
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,460
Get over here. Come here.

472
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,470
Get him!

473
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Come here.

474
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:26,480
Get him!

475
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,919
Get off!

476
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:33,159
Come here!

477
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:38,559
You punk! Get off! Let go!

478
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,799
Let go already!

479
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,599

- No, don't! It's dangerous!
- Get off me.

482
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:59,308
- Get off me! Come here!
- No, stop it!

483
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:01,348
- Come here! Get off!
- No!

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
He's bleeding.

486
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,300
- He's bleeding!
- What just happened?

487
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,780
What... What in the world...
Who did this?

488
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,618
Inmate 2528! Inmate 2528! Wake up!

489
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:42,189
My gosh, what happened?
Who did this to him?

490
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,889
Hurry up and call an ambulance!

491
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,559

being transported to the hospital.

- Here.
- Oh, gosh.

496

Hey, wake up.

498
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:11,879
Give him some painkillers, at least.

499
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,219
Hey.

500
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:22,260

My princess, how have you been?

506
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,600
I'm back in Korea.

507
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,609
Are you really back in Korea?

508

Come home quickly!

I'll be home soon. See you.

- That punk?
- You don't know who I mean?

515
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:34,299
I wouldn't feel better even if
I chewed his bones to mash.

516
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,839
It's been a while, by the way.

517
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,869
You look well.

518
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,210
Where's the car?

519
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,880
- What about a gift for my princess?
- It's in the back.

520
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,088
It's so bulky.
Did you buy the whole store?

521
00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:00,259
Mr. Yoo! It's not that one.

522
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:02,729
It's the bag next to it.
The blue one.

523
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,899
Why are you so shocked?

524
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,620
Are you hiding
a pile of gold bars in there?

525
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,829
You got all the most popular things
from Dubai, right?

526
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,440
Of course.
I brought new clothes for you too.

You punk.

529
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,548
You want to kill me
the day I get out of jail?

my daughter.

It sure has.

at Incheon International Airport.

00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:56,479
I'm excited
because it's been so long.

538
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,678
Please fasten your seatbelts
as we prepare for the descent.

539
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:01,049
I finally get to meet
my old friend again.

540
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,218
Ladies and gentlemen, we are...

541
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:04,219
I'm glad I lived...

542
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:07,560
to meet him again.

543
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,199
Mr. Baek.

544
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:14,770
It isn't Mr. Baek anymore.
It's Joo Dan Tae.

545
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,550
I've scheduled a visit with him
in the afternoon.

546
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:20,040
We can go to the prison together...

547
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,810
after I see Su Ryeon.

548
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,810
Use this when you're in Seoul.

549
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:28,610
That punk won't...

550
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,949
remember what I look like, will he?

551
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:34,389
Probably not.

552
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:38,489
I'll get it all back.

553
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,130
Everything he took from me.

554
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:55,639
Did everything go well in the US?

555
00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:57,709
You seem at peace.

556
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,178
Yes. Now that
everything's back to normal.

557
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,279
Anything new here?

558
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,778
I want to introduce you.

559
00:37:03,779 --> 00:37:05,919
You guys are going to be seeing
a lot of each other.

560
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,250
He has a lot of information
on Mr. Baek.

561
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,750
It's nice to meet you.

562
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,618
Give me the car keys.
I'll drive myself.

563
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:13,629
Here you go.

564
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,388
All right.
I'll see you back at the hotel.

565
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:16,589
I'll be running late.

566
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,139
Hello?

567
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,250
Su Ryeon, where are you?
I just got back.

568
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:35,850
Already?

569
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,819
I was getting impatient,
so I couldn't wait any longer.

570
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,419
I'm back in the penthouse too.

571
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,389
I'm busy organizing all the stuff.

572
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:46,989
The kids must be excited.

573
00:37:48,429 --> 00:37:50,699
Well... I'd love to see you.

574
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,130
Can we meet soon?

575
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:55,969
I have something to tell you too.

576
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:00,639
I'm going to my store soon.
Should we meet there?

577
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,310
Sure, let's do that.

578
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,259
I'll go in.

579
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,029
Joo Dan Tae was hurt.
He may not make it.

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,839
Darn it.

583
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,069
This way. Here.

584
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:16,278
It nicked the aorta,
so it's very dangerous.

585
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:17,679
He needs surgery right away.

586
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:21,048
Let's put the handcuffs on
after he's been examined.

587
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:22,388
No, we can't do that.

588
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:23,859
He needs to be examined first.

589
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,420
Call the prison and
get approval for surgery.

590
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:39,869
Hello. We're at the hospital now.

591
00:39:40,509 --> 00:39:43,610
They say it's really bad
and he needs emergency surgery.

592
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:46,409
Can we get an approval issued
right away?

593
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:48,779
Yes, right now.

594
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,889

00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,440
You did great, sir.

597
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:50,169
I've paid off the doctor,
so don't worry.

598
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,379
The staff will end their shifts
in one hour.

599
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,649
Do you have the stuff?

600
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,850
It's in the backseat.

601
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,119
Let's go.

602
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:03,719
We have exactly one hour.

603
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:05,989
If I'm not back in one hour,

604
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:07,960
We're dead.

605
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:09,889

How dare you conspire with Su Ryeon
to frame me for murder?

608
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:24,739
If you want to die so badly,
I grant you your wish.

610
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,618
Hi. I'm here.

611
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,319
Me too. I just arrived.

612
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,219
I'm in the parking lot.

613
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:43,928
Can you come out for a second?

614
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:45,429
I'll be right there.

615
00:41:55,909 --> 00:41:58,480
Can I go have a smoke first?

616
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:00,179
I'm a little nervous.

617
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,750
Sure, go ahead.

618
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:25,000
Goodness. My bad.

619
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:28,239
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,929
Goodbye, Logan.

630

- We'll go now.
- My stomach.

I told you I didn't do it!

If you didn't stab him, who did?

637
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:07,988
Joo Dan Tae stabbed himself.

638
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:09,560
It was all a show!

639
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,899
He got the sharpened toothbrush
from his sleeve. I'm sure of it.

640
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,928
Does that make sense?

642
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,609

on the toothbrush.

Witnesses? Who would...

645
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,879
Your appeal hearing is tomorrow.

646
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,810
Why didn't you wait
just one more day?

647
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,350
Why would you go and do this?

648
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,650
Your hearing tomorrow was canceled.

649
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,389

- Take him to solitary.
- It really wasn't me!

00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,988
Why won't you believe me?

652

00:46:55,469 --> 00:46:57,040
Too bad.

However much you hate the guy,

659
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:06,249
how could you do that to him
when you're here to turn a new leaf?

660
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,488
You scumbag. You're in it
with Joo Dan Tae, aren't you?

661
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:13,889
Must you do this
when Chairman Joo's at death's door?

- I'm sorry, Dr. Ha.

about life in here.

You'll get me out of here?

672
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,429
You seem to be gravely mistaken.

673
00:47:52,429 --> 00:47:54,968
Hey. You got a life sentence.

674
00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:58,040
And I'll be released on bail soon.

675
00:47:59,069 --> 00:48:01,940
How, when everyone knows
your parents cut you off?

676
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,710
Your mom blocked your number.

677
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,580
You scumbag.

00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:11,520
Your bail.

679
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,519
I'll pay for you.

680
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,360
You idiot.
Do you still want to show off?

681
00:48:18,759 --> 00:48:20,860
Stop trying to be cunning.

682
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,730
I'll get out of here soon.

683
00:48:26,759 --> 00:48:30,469
If you don't believe me,
see what happens tomorrow.

684
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:34,939
I'm giving you a chance
to side with me.

685
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,409
Especially just you.

686
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:40,409
In return, get me
Ha Yoon Chul's toothbrush.

687
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,559
Joo Dan Tae, you lunatic.

688
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,830
He's a total crazy fool.

689
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,338
Who are you people?

690
00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:46,009
You're having fun,
Mr. Chief Justice.

691
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:50,049
When did your wife get so young?

692
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:54,920
Joo Dan Tae?

693
00:49:56,449 --> 00:50:00,718
You took so much money from me,

694
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,690
so why are you refusing my calls?

695
00:50:04,089 --> 00:50:06,329
Why do you think I came here...

696
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,500
in my current condition?

697
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,000
I feel so wronged,
I could die right now.

698
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,040
What are you doing?

699
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,179
I need you to get me out.

700
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,738
With the information I gave you,

701
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:23,579
you bought land in Yongsan
slated to be redeveloped,

702
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,149
and news of Paju's
high-speed railway plan...

703
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,879
made your alpine real estate
priceless.

704
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,548
That got you
a 400m² Gangnam apartment...

705
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:31,019
and a luxurious holiday home
like this.

706
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,758
You should make yourself
equally worthwhile.

707
00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:35,630
Isn't that a fair rule?

708
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,198
What you demand
will cripple legal order.

709
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,369
Murderers aren't allowed
reduced sentences.

710
00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:44,269
I will call the police immediately.

711
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,170
That fugitive Joo Dan Tae is here.

712
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,468
Do whatever you want.

713
00:50:49,469 --> 00:50:52,980
I'm a lifer, so all I have to do
is return to prison.

714
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,650
But it won't be that simple for you,
Mr. Chief Justice.

715
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,179
There's talk you'll be made
Head of the Supreme Court,

716
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,250
and your daughter's
getting married next week.

717
00:51:03,949 --> 00:51:07,389
What do you say?
Should I show up at the wedding...

718
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:10,159
and cause a scene?

719
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:11,799
Yes?

720
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,250
Turn on the news.

721
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:31,350
Yes, sir.

722
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,318
This just in.

723
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:35,849
A car just exploded...

724
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:38,258
in the parking lot
of Cheonsoo District 27.

725
00:51:38,259 --> 00:51:39,718
According to police,
the victim is...

726
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:42,359
a Korean-American businessman
and CEO of Logan Lee Corporation.

727
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,529
He is thought to have died on site.

728
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:47,829
Police sent the car
to the National Forensic Service...

729
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,269
to investigate
the cause of the explosion.

730
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:52,599
They're also questioning witnesses
and getting surveillance footage...

731
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,009
to find out what happened.

732
00:51:57,469 --> 00:51:59,940
- He's gone.
- Go that way. You, that way.

733
00:52:01,009 --> 00:52:02,380
Darn it.

734
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,519
What happened?

735
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,948
I don't know.
He was here a while ago.

736
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:10,189
This punk escaped.

737
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:11,758
Block all the exits...

738
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:14,218
and contact the stations and
have them set up roadblocks.

739
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:15,529
Get to it.

740
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,829
Darn you, fool.

741
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,999
Sir! Come and see this.

742
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,969
Why? What is it?

743
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:24,130
- Let's go.
- This way.

744
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,080
This fool...

745
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,309
How long was he here for?

746
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,548
I think he walked off in a delirium.

747
00:52:35,549 --> 00:52:37,279
I'm glad we found him.

748
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,549
Get him out of here.

749
00:52:47,259 --> 00:52:49,329
He's not breathing.

750
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:50,790
He had a heart attack.

751
00:52:51,529 --> 00:52:53,459
No. Save him!

752
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,368
Take him to an OR now!

753
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:57,600
Carry him on your back.

754
00:52:57,869 --> 00:52:59,170
It's this way.

755
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,739
(Surgery in progress)

756
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:10,080
Charge to 120 joules.

757
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:12,380
- 120 joules.
- Clear.

758
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,718
- Charge to 150 joules.
- 150 joules.

759
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:17,819
Clear!

760
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,758
- Charge to 200 joules.
- 200 joules.

761
00:53:21,759 --> 00:53:22,860
Clear!

762
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,299
(Police Line Do Not Cross)

763
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:32,739
(Rest in peace in a better place.)

764
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:44,150
(Rest in peace, Logan.)

765
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,019
(My condolences. Rest in peace.)

766
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,960
(We hope you rest in peace.)

767
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,589
It was you, Joo Dan Tae.

768
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,330
You did it, didn't you?

769
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:03,400
You're the only one who'd do this.

770
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:05,569
Only you.

771
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:25,789
People only come to their senses
after a beating.

772
00:54:26,249 --> 00:54:28,018
If you just keep to the hierarchies,

773
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:31,260
there's no place more humane
than this one.

774
00:54:35,129 --> 00:54:36,859
Here, have some.

775
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,769
Thank you.
I love soy sauce braised beef.

776
00:54:46,339 --> 00:54:48,280
What was that just now?

777
00:54:48,379 --> 00:54:49,978
I have to eat to live.

778
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:51,609
If I die, no one will know.

779
00:54:53,209 --> 00:54:55,478
What are you looking at?
What do you want me to do?

780
00:54:55,479 --> 00:54:57,079
You're not eating?

781
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,519
Then give me all your food.
I'm starving anyway.

782
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:01,958
Hey.

783
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:03,120
Gosh.

784
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,430
I was saving that.

785
00:55:06,729 --> 00:55:10,260
How dare you steal that from me?

786
00:55:13,229 --> 00:55:15,439
How dare you throw my food
on the floor?

787
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,909
- Ko Sang A.
- You started it.

788
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:21,878
- You did it first.
- How dare you touch my food.

789
00:55:21,879 --> 00:55:23,839
Who do you think you are?

790
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:28,319
How dare you do that to me?

791
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,849
I'll kill you.

792
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,588
Why, you...

793
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:36,319
Who needs more side dishes?

794
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:42,128
- Me!
- Me!

795
00:55:42,129 --> 00:55:43,858
- Here!
- Me!

796
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:45,969
- Please!
- Me! Cheon Seo Jin!

797
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,300
What are you waiting for?

798
00:55:48,399 --> 00:55:49,839
What is this?

799
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:52,010
What? Oh Yoon Hee?

800
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:56,339
How come
you are the meal distributor?

801
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:59,748
Why? Is that a good position?

802
00:55:59,749 --> 00:56:02,648
They're highly esteemed positions
in prison.

803
00:56:02,649 --> 00:56:06,318
You have to get on her good side
if you want an extra egg.

804
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,660
But how did she manage
to get that job so easily?

805
00:56:09,859 --> 00:56:11,490
Who's supporting her?

806
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:15,260
What skills did you use?

807
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,228
So does that mean that Yoon Hee
has more power...

808
00:56:19,229 --> 00:56:20,970
than Jenny's mom?

809
00:56:23,169 --> 00:56:26,469
Yoon Hee, you know a bond of hatred
is still a bond, right?

810
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,909
I'm okay with everything,

811
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,949
but if I don't have any meat,
I can't even stand up for a second.

812
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,180
Me too.

813
00:56:37,149 --> 00:56:38,390
Here.

814
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:42,689
Awesome.

815
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,830
If you have something to request,
say it.

816
00:56:46,189 --> 00:56:47,799
Do you need anything?

817
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,129
My gosh.

818
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,269
Laver.

819
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,069
What?

820
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:57,300
Did you not hear me?
I want a lot of laver.

821
00:56:58,539 --> 00:57:01,878
Don't you have a lot of money?
Buy it yourself.

822
00:57:01,879 --> 00:57:03,679
Why did you even ask me
if you weren't going to give me any?

823
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,679
Who do you think put me here,
and made me this way?

824
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,120
Are you saying I'm the one
who did this to you?

825
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,450
You still haven't
come to your senses, have you?

826
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:15,260
You got 7 years, and I got 3.

827
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,929
I'll get out of here before you.

828
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,429
Sure, congratulations.

829
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,760
How dare a murderer talk back to me?

830
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,729
Logan is dead.

831
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:30,800
Logan died? When?

832
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:32,409
Did you kill him?

833
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,780
What are you talking about?
I have nothing to do with it!

834
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,479
Know that I'm watching you.

835
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,220
If you try anything,
I'll kill you myself.

836
00:57:47,289 --> 00:57:48,419
(Seoul Detention Center)

837
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,899
What did you just say?

838
00:57:56,959 --> 00:57:59,869
There's a witness who says
the person who killed Na Ae Gyo...

839
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:02,338
wasn't Joo Dan Tae, but Logan.

840
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:03,800
A witness?

841
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,410
We discovered that Logan
bribed a crematorium owner.

842
00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:10,809
The murderer's height, silhouette,

843
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:13,648
and stride captured by CCTV...

844
00:58:13,649 --> 00:58:16,279
were also found to match...

845
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,779
those of Logan.

846
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,689
But Logan is the one who died.

847
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,918
Someone murdered him.

848
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:24,490
Don't you think you should change
the aim of your investigation?

849
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,529
You need to find the person
who was traveling with Logan first.

850
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:29,129
Right before the explosion,

851
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:32,029
he got out of the car
and his whereabouts are unknown.

852
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:34,068
He has no relatives in Korea,

853
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:35,938
and we have no record
of him using his credit card.

854
00:58:35,939 --> 00:58:37,399
Joo Dan Tae.

855
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:40,370
Did you check on him?

856
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,809
I heard he was hurt
and being taken to the hospital.

857
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,978
At the time of the explosion,
Joo Dan Tae had been stabbed...

858
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,579
by a sharpened toothbrush,
which put his life in danger.

859
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:49,018
He might've been acting
to create an alibi.

860
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:51,288
He even suffered cardiac arrest.

861
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:54,149
It makes no sense
to suspect him of this.

862
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,319
I'm sure he ordered someone
to carry this out.

863
00:58:56,859 --> 00:58:58,329
It's definitely him.

864
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:01,560
- No one else could do...
- How much do you know about Logan?

865
00:59:01,899 --> 00:59:04,299
You know that after getting
her bone marrow,

866
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,870
he dissolved his adoption
of Min Seol A.

867
00:59:06,399 --> 00:59:07,769
Are you aware of this?

868
00:59:08,539 --> 00:59:10,938
- But that's...
- According to others,

869
00:59:10,939 --> 00:59:14,439
Logan has been stalking you
for a very long time.

870
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,909
Is that true?

871
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,208
What are you talking about?

872
00:59:18,209 --> 00:59:19,549
Stalking?

873
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:21,249
Then were you lovers?

874
00:59:23,319 --> 00:59:26,950
With a man who transplanted your
dead daughter's marrow illegally?

875
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:29,090
To hold a special affection
for someone like that...

876
00:59:29,289 --> 00:59:32,830
It can't be true, can it?
He is the stepbrother of your...

877
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,430
I won't sit here listening
to you badmouth him any longer.

878
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,998
The one thing that's clear...

879
00:59:37,999 --> 00:59:41,600
is that Logan would never
hurt anyone.

880
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,300
I guarantee it.

881
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,478
The victim of the car explosion
occurring in the heart of Seoul...

882
00:59:48,479 --> 00:59:51,279
was a Korean-American
businessman, Logan Lee.

883
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,978
We were shocked to learn that he is
the suspect in Na Ae Gyo's murder.

884
00:59:54,979 --> 00:59:57,779
As a result, the CEO
of J King Holdings,

885
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,659
Mr. Joo, who was arrested
for murdering his former wife...

886
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,259
was revealed to have been framed
and a reinvestigation has opened.

887
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,288
The person to take charge
of the new case...

888
01:00:06,289 --> 01:00:09,829
will work towards a just future
while investigating this case.

889
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,729
During the investigation
of Na Ae Gyo's murder, Mr. Joo...

890
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,269
Hello.

891
01:00:15,899 --> 01:00:19,309
This is a junior colleague
of Chief Justice Jung.

892
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:22,539
The second trial has been
taken on by our law firm.

893
01:00:22,939 --> 01:00:24,579
I'm in your hands.

894
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:26,849
When can I get out of here?

895
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:29,248
To hold someone who's innocent,

896
01:00:29,249 --> 01:00:31,079
what a state this country is in.

897
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,549
The Supreme Court justice
is paying much attention to this.

898
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:36,818
How much attention?

899
01:00:36,819 --> 01:00:38,629
Could I get a briefing?

900
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:42,998
The imprisonment of Shim Su Ryeon...

901
01:00:42,999 --> 01:00:46,200
will be framed as the sole act
of Cheon Seo Jin.

902
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:49,239
In the Ro Na incident, we'll say
the victim hurt her head,

903
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,640
and her testimony is inconsistent
and therefore problematic.

904
01:00:52,769 --> 01:00:54,680
And one more thing.

905
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:58,510
Let's say Ha Yoon Chul was the one
masterminding Seol A's desecration.

906
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,608
I tried to reveal the truth...

907
01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:03,780
and ended up suffering this mishap.

908
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:13,289
Bandages for the patient.

909
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:45,959
Oh, no.

910
01:01:47,189 --> 01:01:49,060
The IV isn't in my arm.

911
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:53,469
Trash like you shouldn't be allowed
back in the world a second time.

912
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:55,039
Die, Joo Dan Tae.

913
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:02,039
What an honor for you
to come visit me personally.

914
01:02:02,339 --> 01:02:04,309
I missed you, Shim Su Ryeon.

915
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:06,679
It makes me sad to see
you've become more beautiful.

916
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,248
You're crazy.

917
01:02:08,249 --> 01:02:10,449
It's you, isn't it?
The one who killed Logan?

918
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,850
What are you talking about?

919
01:02:14,089 --> 01:02:15,419
Don't you see this?

920
01:02:15,919 --> 01:02:19,129
Aren't you being too harsh
to a former husband who nearly died?

921
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,899
I'll kill you, Joo Dan Tae.

922
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:28,030
Were you in love
with that punk, for real?

923
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,039
This is tearing my heart apart.

924
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,038
If you can kill me, try.

925
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:41,979
Until you do, those around you
will die off, one by one.

926
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,579
Just like Min Seol A and Logan.

927
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,248
Oh, and there was
Min Seol A's father too.

928
01:02:47,249 --> 01:02:50,318
Everyone you love will all die.

929
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,958
So please, don't do anything,
Shim Su Ryeon.

930
01:02:53,959 --> 01:02:56,330
Shut it.

931
01:02:56,999 --> 01:03:00,200
Save your rage
if you want to face me again.

932
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:11,310
I'll face you as much as you want.

933
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,180
I don't rely on the judgment
of the law anymore.

934
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:19,188
I'll use your own methods,
your inhumane methods,

935
01:03:19,189 --> 01:03:21,589
to end your life.

936
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:24,859
What are you doing?

937
01:03:26,089 --> 01:03:27,628
I'm going to kill that man.

938
01:03:27,629 --> 01:03:29,629
That psychopath.

939
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:32,370
Just let me kill him.

940
01:03:32,769 --> 01:03:34,898
Let me kill him with my own hands.

941
01:03:34,899 --> 01:03:37,268
Hey.

942
01:03:37,269 --> 01:03:39,668
- Stop it.
- I need to kill that scumbag.

943
01:03:39,669 --> 01:03:42,378
Let me go.

944
01:03:42,379 --> 01:03:45,850
Let me go. Let go!

945
01:05:08,999 --> 01:05:11,729
(Safety first)

946
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:31,279
Will you please let us sleep?

947
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,588
- Let me sleep!
- Shut it!

948
01:05:32,589 --> 01:05:35,188
- My gosh.
- She's so annoying.

949
01:05:35,189 --> 01:05:37,219
Has she lost it?

950
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,859
She's unbelievable.

951
01:05:39,229 --> 01:05:42,430
- Let us sleep already!
- I want to kill that witch.

952
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,229
My gosh, I can't stand this.

953
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:47,498
- My gosh.
- My goodness.

954
01:05:47,499 --> 01:05:49,200
Let me sleep already.

955
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,510
- Can we please sleep?
- This is driving me crazy.

956
01:05:53,709 --> 01:05:56,338
- What's wrong with her?
- My gosh.

957
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:58,708
What's wrong with her?
I'm sick of listening to you.

958
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:00,280
She must've lost it.

959
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:05,518
You're so darn loud. I can't sleep.

960
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:07,049
It's been days already.

961
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:12,229
Thank you for inviting me
to perform in New York, everyone.

962
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:14,229
The next song is...

963
01:06:16,399 --> 01:06:19,369
- Shut your mouth, you lunatic.
- I'm so honored.

964
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:20,429
Eun Byeol!

965
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:22,438
I told you to focus on the diaphragm
and project your voice forward.

966
01:06:22,439 --> 01:06:23,568
Practice makes perfect.

967
01:06:23,569 --> 01:06:26,268
I want you to sing until you sleep
and then sing again in your dreams.

968
01:06:26,269 --> 01:06:30,608
Let me sleep so I can dream.

969
01:06:30,609 --> 01:06:35,148
What's the matter with you?
What made you go so crazy?

970
01:06:35,149 --> 01:06:40,349
Why did you have to mess with
this lunatic, Cheon Seo Jin?

971
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:42,560
That's not good enough
to make you the best!

972
01:06:42,689 --> 01:06:45,359
Try it again. I said, try it again!

973
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:47,459
Stand up straight!

974
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,530
Hey! I'm not your darn daughter!

975
01:06:51,499 --> 01:06:55,268
Yoon Hee, you're still so vulgar.

976
01:06:55,269 --> 01:06:56,799
Cheong A Foundation
belongs to Seo Young.

977
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,338
It belongs to Seo Young.

978
01:06:58,339 --> 01:06:59,869
No! No, it can't be...

979
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:02,878
No! It belongs to Seo Young?

980
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:04,510
No!

981
01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:11,248
Eun Byeol!

982
01:07:11,249 --> 01:07:12,720
Who are you? Who's there?

983
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:14,918
Eun Byeol! Your mom is right here!

984
01:07:14,919 --> 01:07:18,660
Eun Byeol, focus on the diaphragm
and project your voice forward.

985
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:27,370
What's wrong with her?

986
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,768
- My gosh.
- Is she choking?

987
01:07:30,769 --> 01:07:32,209
- What's going on?
- What's with her?

988
01:07:32,539 --> 01:07:34,709
- I think she's having a seizure.
- My gosh.

989
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:36,580
What's happening?

990
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,609
- Hey.
- Shouldn't we do something?

991
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:41,149
- Seo Jin!
- Hey, 3388.

992
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:44,018
Ring the bell. Call the guard.
Call the guard!

993
01:07:44,019 --> 01:07:46,248
- Guard!
- Guard!

994
01:07:46,249 --> 01:07:48,220
- Guard!
- Over here!

995
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,489
- My gosh.
- What's wrong with her?

996
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:53,129
- Hurry.
- Please take a look.

997
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:56,358
Inmate 3388! Inmate 3388!

998
01:07:56,359 --> 01:07:57,930
Call a doctor!

999
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,999
Hurry!

1000
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:07,609
Give me the syringe.

(62 days to CSAT,
37 days to performance test)

1004
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,569
Seok Kyung,
you must feel reassured...

1005
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:36,600
since you got
a principal's recommendation letter.

1006
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:38,569
Are you only going to apply for SNU?

1007
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:40,609
What about other schools?
Didn't you even apply?

1008
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:42,238
I won't be going to
any of the other schools anyway.

1009
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:44,639
If I get accepted everywhere,
it'll only be bad for you guys.

1010
01:08:44,839 --> 01:08:45,979
I just need to get into SNU.

1011
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:48,248
I can't believe you're going to SNU
with such a low GPA score.

1012
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:49,578
You're so lucky.

1013
01:08:49,579 --> 01:08:52,139
You don't even have any competitors
now that Eun Byeol's lost it.

1014
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:54,519
The grand prize winner is back now,

1015
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,359
so shouldn't you give her
the free pass to SNU back?

1016
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,260
She's right. Ro Na was supposed
to get the recommendation.

1017
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:03,129
That's not for me to decide.

1018
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:06,629
I only followed the school rules.

1019
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,368
Ro Na turned down
the recommendation letter.

1020
01:09:09,369 --> 01:09:11,908
What's the use anyway?
She's not even going to university.

1021
01:09:11,909 --> 01:09:12,909
She's right.

1022
01:09:14,169 --> 01:09:15,680
I turned it down.

1023
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:24,278

You should still take the test.

Are you getting ready
to get into SNU?

1035

What? Who are you...

1036
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,890
Have you forgotten my voice already?

1037
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,329
How have you been, my daughter?

1038

Are you listening to me,
Inmate 3388?

Please don't bother me
when I'm eating.

1048
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:23,069
Eun Byeol is the most adorable kid
in the entire world.

1049
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:25,239
She's a fool for her mother.

1050
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,769
She came to visit me today...

1051
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:30,279
and told me everything
that happened at school.

1052
01:11:30,379 --> 01:11:32,749
She's such a lovely kid.

1053
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:37,980
I'd love to introduce her to you.

1054
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:42,889

I'm scared.

1064
01:12:16,459 --> 01:12:18,690
I'm scared.

1065
01:12:37,379 --> 01:12:40,279
Ms. Shim, it's time for you
to wake up.

1066
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,680
1, 2, 3.

1067
01:12:54,529 --> 01:12:56,100
I stopped there again.

1068
01:12:57,629 --> 01:12:59,070
I heard a strange metallic sound.

1069
01:12:59,629 --> 01:13:02,199
Can you describe
what kind of sound it was?

1070
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,600
I don't know.

1071
01:13:04,869 --> 01:13:06,770
Gosh, I really can't remember.

1072
01:13:10,339 --> 01:13:12,810
It was a creepy sound
that I really didn't like.

1073
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,279
It was a very shocking accident,

1074
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,920
so it'll be difficult for you
to remember everything at once.

1075
01:13:18,789 --> 01:13:20,020
I'm sure...

1076
01:13:21,289 --> 01:13:23,159
someone was there.

1077
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:27,589
The answer lies in that sound.

1078
01:13:29,629 --> 01:13:33,329
Mr. Hong, who was the guy
that came in with Logan?

1079
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:35,570
Why did Logan want me to meet him?

1080
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:38,770
Is he someone dangerous
seeing he hasn't shown up yet?

1081
01:13:40,339 --> 01:13:43,909
What if he did something to Logan?

1082
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,610
He's someone
who knows Mr. Baek very well.

1083
01:13:47,409 --> 01:13:48,550
"Mr. Baek?"

1084
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:52,089
He will tell you everything
about Joo Dan Tae's past.

1085
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:53,690
I need to find him.

1086
01:13:53,949 --> 01:13:56,360
I'm sure he knows something
about Logan's death.

1087
01:13:57,119 --> 01:13:58,459
He might've...

1088
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,860
seen Joo Dan Tae that day
at the scene.

1089
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:47,310
Logan?

1090
01:15:01,449 --> 01:15:02,690
Logan...

1091
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:12,930
I'm back, Su Ryeon.

1092
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,800
It's really nice
to see you here again.

1093
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:19,970
You crazy jerk.

1094
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,839
Get out of here right now.
How dare you come in here!

1095
01:15:24,739 --> 01:15:27,379
What's going on? How is he here?

1096
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,049
How did he get out?

1097
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:32,488
I missed you guys so much,

1098
01:15:32,489 --> 01:15:34,520
so I pulled some strings.

1099
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:38,220
Gosh, Ro Na. I love your hair.

1100
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,788
I told you to get out.

1101
01:15:40,789 --> 01:15:44,100
You lost your custody of the kids
and received a restraining order.

1102
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:45,599
Do you want the cops
to drag you out?

1103
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:48,169
There's no need to cause a fuss.

1104
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:50,940
I only dropped by to say hello
to the kids.

1105
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:55,010
It's nice to see the family
all together again.

1106
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:57,739
Don't you guys miss
having me around at home?

1107
01:15:58,739 --> 01:16:00,550
Stay away from the kids.

1108
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:05,249
You're the one who needs to leave.

1109
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:07,919
This penthouse was mine
to begin with.

1110
01:16:08,789 --> 01:16:10,418
I'm going to take it all back.

1111
01:16:10,419 --> 01:16:13,029
The penthouse and my kids.

1112
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,430
Get lost right now.

1113
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,029
Sure.

1114
01:16:50,329 --> 01:16:53,529
I'll make sure
he never shows up again. I'm sorry.

1115
01:16:54,869 --> 01:16:56,940
Did you not know he was out?

1116
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:59,909
I talked to him over the phone once.
He called me so many times.

1117
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,539
Why did you even pick up?

1118
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:04,509
We don't have a dad anymore.

1119
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:07,650
You can't just make him disappear
by thinking he doesn't exist.

1120
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:10,979
Dad got acquitted.

1121
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:13,418
He didn't kill
our biological mother.

1122
01:17:13,419 --> 01:17:15,019
Even the cops said it was Logan.

1123
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,060
Are you really that dumb enough
to believe that?

1124
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,159
I should go.

1125
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,529
Ro Na, wait for me.

1126
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,310
Why is he acting like an idiot
for Ro Na?

1127
01:17:35,879 --> 01:17:37,579
He's so annoying.

1128
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:50,788
(Bae Ro Na)

1129
01:17:50,789 --> 01:17:54,589
(Joo Seok Hoon)

1130
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:59,199
They're planning to go
to the States together?

1131
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:02,470
Is that what they've been planning?

1132
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,390
Joo Dan Tae.

1133
01:18:26,959 --> 01:18:28,390
Joo Dan Tae.

1134
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:31,699
Mr. Baek?

1135
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:39,208
Here's my verdict.

1136
01:18:39,209 --> 01:18:40,269
(One month later)

1137
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:42,338
The defendant, Cheon Seo Jin,
has consistently claimed...

1138
01:18:42,339 --> 01:18:45,039
that she had nothing to do
with Na Ae Gyo's murder.

1139
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:47,379
Now that the real culprit
has been discovered,

1140
01:18:47,409 --> 01:18:49,680
I overrule the original sentence
and find her innocent.

1141
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:51,578
Also, the confinement
of Shim Su Ryeon...

1142
01:18:51,579 --> 01:18:53,088
and the murder of Min Seol A...

1143
01:18:53,089 --> 01:18:54,788
were both very severe crimes...

1144
01:18:54,789 --> 01:18:56,918
and unacceptable as someone
working in the educational industry.

1145
01:18:56,919 --> 01:18:58,788
However, considering the fact
that she compensated the victims...

1146
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:01,288
and is in urgent need
of psychological treatment,

1147
01:19:01,289 --> 01:19:04,009
I sentence her to 2 years in prison
followed by 4 years of probation.

1148
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:17,709
(Seoul High Court)

1149
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:46,038
Who are you? What are you doing?

1150
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:48,110
Who are you? Let go of me.
Who is this?

1151
01:19:48,739 --> 01:19:49,879
Who are you?

1152
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:52,110
Get off.

1153
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,779
Who are you? Oh Yoon Hee?

1154
01:20:25,949 --> 01:20:28,010
Let me go! Where am I?

1155
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:31,479
Let go of me! Oh Yoon Hee?
Shim Su Ryeon?

1156
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,619
Get off me!

1157
01:20:33,089 --> 01:20:35,349
Where am I? What's going on?

1158
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:37,060
Get off me! Let me go!

1159
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:55,209
Shim Su Ryeon. Oh Yoon Hee.

1160
01:20:55,409 --> 01:20:58,579
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

1161
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:01,409
How did you manage to get out?

1162
01:21:02,379 --> 01:21:05,219
I guess you did a pretty good job
of acting like a psycho.

1163
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:08,050
Or did Joo Dan Tae help you?

1164
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,260
Did you help him kill Logan?

1165
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:20,999
You killed Logan, didn't you?

1166
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:23,639
What are you talking about?
It wasn't me!

1167
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,869
You killed him.
Do you think I don't know that?

1168
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:35,079
Why are you doing this?

1169
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:39,589
Why are you doing this to me?

1170
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,800
(The Penthouse 3)

1171
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,868
Did you kill my birth mother?
Because of Mom?

1172
01:22:34,869 --> 01:22:35,979
That's enough, Joo Seok Kyung!

1173
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,609
Now tell me why you're here.

1174
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:39,309
I really want to get into
Seoul National University.

1175
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:41,109
Take care of that little rat for me.

1176
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:42,979
Do you have a death wish?
Know when to stop.

1177
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:44,618
It's simple. We'll use each other.

1178
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:46,219
Until we have money in our hands.

1179
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:48,988
I'm determined
to kneel before you from now on.

1180
01:22:48,989 --> 01:22:51,118
Who's the guy
who came in with Logan?

1181
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:52,559
He was with someone?

1182
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,028
We must find him first.

1183
01:22:54,029 --> 01:22:56,429
Oh Yoon Hee killed Logan?

1184
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,899
It's only hard
the first time around.

1185
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:00,930
- Su Ryeon Shim.
- Who are you?
