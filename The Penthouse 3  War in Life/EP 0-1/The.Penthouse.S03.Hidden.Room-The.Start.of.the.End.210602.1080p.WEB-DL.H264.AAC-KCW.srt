1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,685
(The start of the end
of The Penthouse 3 by keymen)

2
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:11,695
(It's my first time.)

3
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:15,864
(The unpredictable world
of The Penthouse)

4
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:17,594
(It's crazy.)

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,934
(The three secretaries
are appearing.)

6
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:22,705
(Just enough spoiler)

7
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:25,005
(Just enough suspense)

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,574
(Just enough push and pull)

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,975
(Revealing all the charms)

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,320
(New type of talk show...)

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,085
(by the kids of The Penthouse
continues.)

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:43,025
(Revealing their real singing skill)

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,894
(And)

14
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:48,924
(The whole story of The Penthouse 3
slowly reveals.)

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,835
(The footage of The Penthouse 3
is revealed for the first time.)

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,934
(Please send us lots of love.)

17
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,604
(The Penthouse 3 Special
begins now.)

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,879
The Penthouse 3 Hidden Room,
The Start of the End.

19
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,780
I'm your host, Jang Do Yeon.

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,875
(Jang Do Yeon)

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,815
- I'm Jo Jung Sik.
- Hello.

22
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:08,320
In The Penthouse 3
Hidden Room today,

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,190
we're going to talk about...

24
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,660
the start and the end...

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,020
of The Penthouse.

26
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,259
The Penthouse 3 Hidden Room,
The Start of the End.

27
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,100
First, it's "Back to the Beginning".

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,499
There were flashbacks
throughout the drama.

29
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:24,169
We collected all the flashbacks...

30
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:25,969
and created new footage.

31
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,869
It is The Penthouse Youth Theater.

32
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:30,904
- Youth Theater.
- Let's watch.

33
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,779
(The Penthouse Youth Theater)

34
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:37,074
(The story of their youth
through flashbacks)

35
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:42,749
- Back in high school.
- Yes.

36
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:44,490
(Seoul, 1996)

37
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,615
- It goes back to 1996.
- Stop! Stop!

38
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,389
You need to project!

39
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:51,389
(One father and daughter had
an extraordinary passion for music.)

40
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:53,395
Don't you know how important
this audition is?

41
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,525
It's an opportunity to sing with
the best opera company in Italy.

42
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,570
They only wanted to see Yoon Hee,
the top student in the school,

43
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,335
but I forced your way in.

44
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,339
I'll practice more, Father.

45
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:04,509
I can do it.

46
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:07,710
Are you weeping
because I nagged a little?

47
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,050
You know I can't stand
seeing chicks cry.

48
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,210
Do it again!

49
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,680
(Everything her father said was
absolute law to Cheon Seo Jin.)

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,119
The trauma to be the top.

51
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:17,184
(After the audition)

52
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,914
How did it go?

53
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,085
- Who made it?
- This music is playing.

54
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,754
Loser.

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,724
You can't beat her even once?

56
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,564
Then...

57
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,240
is Yoon Hee going to Italy?

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,969
- My.
- I can't allow that.

59
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:36,205
(Yoon Hee with the skill
and Seo Jin with power)

60
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,175
We arranged it to say
Yoon Hee turned them down.

61
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:42,509
After what I did to get you in,
you almost lost it.

62
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,045
What a disgrace.

63
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,779
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

64
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:47,150
(Seo Jin couldn't meet
her father's expectations.)

65
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,550
She wants her father
to approve her the most.

66
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,658
(The big day)

67
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,124
(The day of Cheong A Art Festival to
get into Seoul National University)

68
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,830
(Yoon Hee, the top student shows off
what she's capable of.)

69
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,754
- She never makes a mistake.
- Yes.

70
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,830
She's the center of S.E.S.

71
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,900
(She finishes her performance
with cheer and applause.)

72
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,599
The highlight of the 25th
Cheong A Art Festival.

73
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,404
The grand prize winner
for the best classical singer.

74
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,134
The Bella Voce Award goes to...

75
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:14,534
- Cheon Seo Jin!
- My.

76
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,745
(An incomprehensible result is
announced.)

77
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:23,189
What? The grand prize?

78
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:25,059
- How could you win when you were...
- It's the prelude to war.

79
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:26,119
unstable and your voice cracked?

80
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:28,189
Did you think you'd always win
first place?

81
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:29,525
This is mine.

82
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:31,129
- Give it to me.
- Let go!

83
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,955
(No one can yield.)

84
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,670
This is where the whole story
begins.

85
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,700
That's right.

86
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,735
(There's an intense fight
over the trophy.)

87
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,464
When I first watched this drama,
this scene was shocking.

88
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,015
(Yoon Hee can barely get
close to the trophy.)

89
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,045
No!

90
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,420
The trophy looks so dangerous.

91
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,990
Yes. It's got a pointy end.

92
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,789
I will never let you take this.

93
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:03,089
(That's how their worst
ill-fated relationship begins.)

94
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,684
You pitiful brat.

95
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:09,265
- What?
- The fake winner, Cheon Seo Jin.

96
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,194
You're just a darned thief.

97
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,170
It's scary to watch it again.

98
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:22,045
(Seo Jin whose pride is hurt
ends up wounding Yoon Hee's neck.)

99
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,704
Look at her face.

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,845
- That reminds me of Eun Byeol.
- Right.

101
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,684
It keeps reminding me of
Eun Byeol and Ro Na.

102
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:37,830
(Only if they had met
in an environment...)

103
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,529
(where the competition
wasn't so fierce.)

104
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,624
- Seo Jin!
- Seo Jin!

105
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,595
- What happened?
- Seo Jin!

106
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,774
The lyrics sound different.

107
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,545
(They could've been good friends.)

108
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,359
You can get up now.

109
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:09,659
(The investigation shows that
Seo Jin fabricated it.)

110
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:12,295
Fathers all know if they're sleeping
or just pretending.

111
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,324
Fathers always say
they're not sleeping.

112
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,969
Yoon Hee bled a lot from her neck.

113
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:20,140
I'm sorry, Father.

114
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,634
- My.
- Boy.

115
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,380
Father.

116
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,305
Do you know why I slapped you?

117
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:31,444
Not because you hurt
a brat like her.

118
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,820
It's because you lost to her.

119
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,184
Your father is the director
of the Cheong A Foundation.

120
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:40,485
And yet, you lost to a girl
with no father...

121
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,789
and made me go and beg the judges...

122
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,089
to give you the Grand Prize.

123
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:47,229
Her father is turning her
into a monster.

124
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:49,570
I'm sorry, Father. It's my fault.

125
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,130
This can never happen again.

126
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,700
You must be the best.

127
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,405
Or you don't deserve to take over
Cheong A Foundation.

128
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,365
Okay.

129
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:00,074
I will be the best.

130
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,510
She ended up hurting her neck...

131
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,750
I can't believe
this music is playing.

132
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,574
I feel so bad for her.

133
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,320
She won't be able to sing anymore.

134
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,919
She was the top student
for three years straight.

135
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,120
But now, she's hit rock bottom.

136
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,589
It's Chelsia Chan's song.

137
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,355
Does that mean she won't be
able to go to college?

138
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,684
(They end up walking
different paths.)

139
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:19,900
(Meanwhile in Japan)

140
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,295
Is it Japan?

141
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:25,535
(Na Ae Gyo,
Joo Dan Tae's girlfriend)

142
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,405
(Joo Dan Tae, Na Ae Gyo's boyfriend)

143
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:35,210
Joo Dan Tae doesn't have much yet.

144
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,810
I'll make sure that you live
like Shim Su Ryeon.

145
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,120
For how much longer
do I have to wait?

146
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,019
It won't be long.

147
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,150
If I use Shim Su Ryeon's name right,

148
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,620
we'll become so rich that we could
suffocate under our piles of money.

149
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,890
He talks about such a scary plan...

150
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,130
- with such a naive face.
- I'll buy a house in Gangnam,

151
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,060
and build a Joo Dan Tae Village...

152
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,060
on the land where my mother has
passed away on,

153
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,425
and make the whole world kneel
before me.

154
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,940
And we'll have children?

155
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,535
Of course.

156
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:05,010
Just thinking about it makes me
so happy.

157
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,305
(They plan to steal other's life
for their happiness.)

158
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:12,245
(Should they be thankful?)

159
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,845
(Is this what love is?)

160
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:19,460
It's Oh Yoon Hee's song.

161
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,820
(As the first step of his plan,)

162
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,225
- When she was a k-pop singer.
- I like it.

163
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,460
(Joo Dan Tae plans a marriage
with Shim Su Ryeon.)

164
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,159
- I'll get this gift-wrapped.
- Okay.

165
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,454
(Joo Dan Tae plans a marriage
with Shim Su Ryeon.)

166
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,700
He's marrying Shim Su Ryeon,
not Na Ae Gyo.

167
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,165
You're right.

168
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:37,535
Su Ryeon, what is it?
I'm surprised you called me first.

169
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,475
I feel happy.

170
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,405
Are you coming back
for summer break?

171
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,779
My parents are mentioning
our marriage and...

172
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,045
Let's call off the marriage.

173
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,215
That's cruel.

174
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,014
What did you just say?

175
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:51,989
- These are all great songs.
- I'm...

176
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:54,355
getting married soon in the States.

177
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,789
(Dan Tae got dumped.)

178
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:57,555
I'm sorry, Dan Tae.

179
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,429
Hello?

180
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,969
(However, the plan goes wrong.)

181
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:05,339
With the wrong method...

182
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:07,339
Yes, he comes up with a scary plan.

183
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:08,510
Who says you can?

184
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,140
(He plans one scary incident
to marry her.)

185
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,909
Who says you can call it off?

186
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,235
(He plans one scary incident
to marry her.)

187
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,580
Is it possible for a human
to become that wicked?

188
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,045
(Several months later in the USA)

189
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:20,620
(Su Ryeon's spending a pleasant time
with the man she loves.)

190
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,089
She's pregnant.

191
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:23,750
(Su Ryeon's spending a pleasant time
with the man she loves.)

192
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,985
It's sad since I know
what's going to happen next.

193
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:42,935
(There are so many things
I should not love)

194
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,345
(Dan Tae decides to punish Su Ryeon
for choosing someone else.)

195
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,914
(What upsets him the most is...)

196
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:57,720
How cruel.

197
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,225
(You who don't love me)

198
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:09,995
(I didn't ask you to stay
by my side)

199
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:12,400
(You didn't have to call off
our marriage.)

200
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,669
The flashbacks show the reasons...

201
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,709
- why they've become monsters.
- Yes.

202
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:18,209
(And)

203
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,679
There must've been a problem with
her brain due to premature birth.

204
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,975
(Su Ryeon ended up giving premature
birth due to shooting.)

205
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,949
It's my fault.

206
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:29,289
(The moment Dan Tae had been
waiting for has arrived.)

207
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:31,185
It's all my fault.

208
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,059
Don't blame yourself.

209
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:34,990
I'll take care of your child now.

210
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,029
(While Su Ryeon became weak
due to shock and sadness...)

211
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:39,360
Now that I'm watching in order,

212
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,965
I can see the change in their looks.

213
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,299
- It's fun to watch the compilation.
- Yes.

214
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,569
(Meanwhile, after high school,)

215
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:51,634
(Yoon Hee got a job right away.)

216
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,380
It feels like an archive.

217
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,774
(Ha Yoon Chul, Yoon Hee's boyfriend)

218
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:58,850
(She's in love
with a poor medical student.)

219
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,745
I got my salary.

220
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,144
Pay for your lodgings.

221
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,985
- Oh Yoon Hee and Ha Yoon Chul.
- I don't want to.

222
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,059
Stop giving me money.

223
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:09,390
- What an adorable couple.
- I'm giving it to you to feel good,

224
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,590
so you don't have to feel bad.
It's true.

225
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,955
It's not much anyway. Take it.

226
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:15,695
I'll become a doctor
as soon as I can...

227
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,424
and support you.

228
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,370
They haven't met Cheon Seo Jin yet,
have they?

229
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,010
(Even poverty felt romantic to them
because they were in love.)

230
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,534
Cheon Seo Jin sees them now.

231
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,809
She gets jealous.

232
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:27,935
(Their ill-fated relationship with
Cheon Seo Jin begins again.)

233
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,880
(Seo Jin still feels
inferior to Yoon Hee.)

234
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,174
Dad, it's me.

235
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,414
About the next
Cheong A Foundation scholarship.

236
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,685
I want to recommend someone
who is studying medicine.

237
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,789
(Yoon Chul became a scholarship
student...)

238
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:45,329
(with Seo Jin's recommendation.)

239
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:49,394
<i>Holding onto the end of the night</i>
<i>It's no longer</i>

240
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:55,264
What's going on? Did you get
the Cheong A Foundation scholarship?

241
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,740
(Yoon Hee doesn't like it.)

242
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,380
Why didn't you tell me?

243
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,250
I couldn't refuse to attend
when they gave me a scholarship.

244
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,845
It doesn't mean anything.

245
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,014
Do you call that an excuse?

246
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:14,020
You being involved
with Cheon Seo Jin...

247
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,829
I hate that more than death!

248
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:20,154
Will you stop
talking about Cheon Seo Jin?

249
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,270
Just stop it.

250
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,924
I'm sick of it now!

251
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,209
Their relationship falls apart
as Seo Jin intended.

252
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:31,840
The conflict deepens.

253
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,105
- That's what Seo Jin wanted.
- Yes.

254
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,010
(Love...)

255
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,044
(and reality)

256
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,890
(The young medical student's woe
grows.)

257
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,914
- This scene.
- Oh, this scene.

258
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,315
- Cheon Seo Jin's really annoying.
- Yes.

259
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:52,730
Stop drinking.

260
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,799
(Yoon Chul has a drink with Seo Jin
out of frustration.)

261
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,195
He drank a lot.

262
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,764
That's the old Jinro soju.

263
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:06,435
- I got too excited.
- Darn it.

264
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,345
What else am I to do?

265
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,345
Studying must be hard enough.

266
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,144
Why do you want to live
with such a burden?

267
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:20,319
(Yoon Hee sees Yoon Chul
and Seo Jin together.)

268
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:21,615
Oh, why on earth?

269
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,289
- Why did she have to pass it?
- Especially at that moment.

270
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:25,825
I will give you...

271
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,264
A pair of wings.

272
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,299
(Seo Jin suddenly confesses
her feelings to Yoon Chul.)

273
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,270
That sounds so sweet to
a self-supporting student.

274
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,970
I know. In fact,
she's the director's daughter.

275
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,809
(With rain and drinks in between)

276
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,380
How cruel.

277
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,445
(Seo Jin steals
Yoon Hee's life again.)

278
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:48,789
Oh, this is the moment.

279
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:50,090
(You've left)

280
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,715
(And the rain is falling)

281
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:02,195
(To someone, it's an end.)

282
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,929
(To someone, it's a start.)

283
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,294
Oh, gosh. Why would you wrap
your arm around her?

284
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,909
Seriously.

285
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:15,335
(Youth and the start of the end)

286
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:19,245
(Time goes by)

287
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,445
(Over the years)

288
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:27,315
(A moment to achieve something
arrives.)

289
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,829
Today,

290
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:32,054
(Seo Jin expects
an important decision.)

291
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,600
You waited long enough.
The foundation...

292
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,524
is yours, Seo Jin.

293
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,400
(She finally becomes the director
she's long been waiting for.)

294
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,699
- Finally.
- He finally approves her.

295
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:43,209
It's what she's been waiting for.

296
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:44,335
Father.

297
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,404
It was Cheon Seo Jin's goal in life.

298
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,804
A halo.

299
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,075
- And fireworks inside the building.
- Yes.

300
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,860
- When you're really happy...
- Right.

301
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,429
- You're overwhelmed,
- you can't say anything.

302
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,529
but it's hard to describe it.

303
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,900
(The brightest moment in her life
has arrived.)

304
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,424
- It's hard to believe.
- Yes.

305
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,534
Now she feels like eating.

306
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,205
(I'm just happy to think about it.)

307
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:21,075
Today,

308
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,304
the most wonderful thing
happened to me.

309
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,575
Seo Jin and my husband
are having an affair.

310
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:31,544
(Soon, her affair with Dan Tae
is revealed.)

311
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,215
We must get divorced.

312
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,014
We can't.

313
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,784
Now, the whole
Hera Club members know.

314
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,695
We can't stay together.

315
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,829
Chairman Joo Dan Tae.

316
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:44,894
(Yoon Hee also
tries to threaten Seo Jin.)

317
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,965
What are you trying to pull?

318
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,835
Everyone already knows
about me and Dan Tae.

319
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:52,904
That's right.

320
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,404
But there's one person who doesn't.

321
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,685
(I don't know yet)

322
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,225
- "Dad."
- Dad.

323
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:13,254
He wishes to appoint someone else
as the director.

324
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,725
(Seo Jin's father dismisses Seo Jin
from the director position.)

325
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:19,970
No. Father.

326
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,069
(Seo Jin runs to stop her father.)

327
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:22,140
What a good choice of a song.

328
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,439
Let go.

329
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:26,205
(She went out of her way
to take the best position.)

330
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,049
(Seo Jin could never lose it.)

331
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:32,475
(She confronts her father
who's become an obstacle.)

332
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,279
(Her father's on the verge of life
after the scuffle.)

333
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,319
- Seo Jin.
- Grab him. You must grab him.

334
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:41,485
(Seo Jin turns her back
on her father.)

335
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,955
Greed can be very scary.

336
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:00,510
(She exchanged her father
for the director position.)

337
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,774
You abandoned me...

338
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,250
first, Father.

339
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,414
(Seo Jin ends up
killing her father.)

340
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,054
(Meanwhile, Joo Dan Tae)

341
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,900
She's the one...

342
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,039
he talked about the future with.

343
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,034
(He got this far all for Na Ae Gyo.)

344
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:31,939
(He ends up killing Na Ae Gyo
with his own hands.)

345
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:34,575
Who do you think she is?

346
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:39,449
(She was the goal
of Dan Tae's life.)

347
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:40,449
(Na)

348
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,120
(Ae)

349
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,715
(Gyo)

350
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,085
(She's gone...)

351
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,630
(out of Dan Tae's life for good.)

352
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,225
It's "She's Gone."

353
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:54,929
(Dan Tae finally realizes the person
he killed was Na Ae Gyo.)

354
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:56,465
This is like a music video.

355
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,664
So, Na Ae Gyo...

356
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,335
is really dead?

357
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:05,975
I...

358
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,004
killed...

359
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:11,344
Na Ae Gyo?

360
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:17,114
You jerk.

361
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,179
(He cries for the perfect future
he shattered on his own...)

362
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:44,205
(and the sense of loss.)

363
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,719
(Due to the shadow singer incident,)

364
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:53,985
(Seo Jin faces voting
to be appointed again.)

365
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,560
(But she barely avoids
losing her position.)

366
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,800
She finally protected it.

367
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,699
- It was hard to believe the result.
- I know.

368
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:03,824
(What protected Seo Jin was
her father's favor.)

369
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,225
What favor?

370
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,995
My first daughter
still has a long way to go.

371
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:11,534
She is ambitious
but lacks in many ways.

372
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,034
Support her.

373
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,104
So that she can keep her place
as Director.

374
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,675
Yet, she killed her father.

375
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,445
Gosh. It's breaking my heart.

376
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:25,114
Father...

377
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:30,584
Why did you do that?

378
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,564
(Her father has gone to a place
he can never come back.)

379
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,969
(Seo Jin wanted her father
to approve her...)

380
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:49,004
(by winning the highest
and best position.)

381
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,179
(Joo Dan Tae dreamed of a happy
future with Na Ae Gyo.)

382
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,890
(They both ended up killing the most
precious person in their lives...)

383
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,354
(for them and their lives.)

384
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:06,955
(And now...)

385
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,524
(Director Cheon Seo Jin)

386
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,969
(They've emptied their offices.)

387
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:13,264
- Bye, bye.
- Bye.

388
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:16,064
Goodbye, Assemblyman.

389
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,135
Bye.

390
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:19,975
Goodbye, Kang Ma Ri's bathhouse.

391
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,640
Bye, Ms. Cheon.

392
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,780
(People who went to prison,
Ha Yoon Chul)

393
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,249
(Lee Kyu Jin)

394
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,719
(Ko Sang A)

395
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:30,320
It was such
an unexpected conclusion.

396
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,519
(Joo Dan Tae)

397
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,159
(Oh Yoon Hee)

398
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:36,229
(People who went back home,
Shim Su Ryeon)

399
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:38,759
(People who went missing,
Jin Bun Hong and Eun Byeol)

400
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,499
(New appearances, Yoo Dong Pil)

401
00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:44,064
(Baek Jun Ki)

402
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,094
Not many of them were able
to keep their places.

403
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:55,304
(Logan Lee had
an explosion accident.)

404
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,580
(Find out what they will do
in Season 3.)

405
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,820
Their lives are so ironic.

406
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,844
Both Joo Dan Tae
and Cheon Seo Jin...

407
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,659
live for someone,

408
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,590
but they end up killing the person
with their own hands.

409
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,790
Like you said, they both killed
someone with their hands.

410
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,429
But there's another thing
they have in common.

411
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:16,625
Neither of them can do anything
on their own.

412
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:20,469
All they do is give orders.

413
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,540
The Penthouse would completely stop
without these three people.

414
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,975
You're right. They're at the beck
and call of the main characters.

415
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:30,979
It wasn't easy to bring
all of them here.

416
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,780
I can't believe it. It feels unreal.

417
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,350
You rarely see them in one place.

418
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,419
Exactly.

419
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:36,919
The three secretaries are here.

420
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,985
- Nice to see you.
- Welcome.

421
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,130
This is so exciting.
I've never met them before.

422
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,229
Didn't you shoot any scene
together in Seasons 1 and 2?

423
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:50,830
- We've never seen them together.
- This is the first time...

424
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,469
we've been on camera together.

425
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:54,540
The viewers would also think...

426
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,509
this is such a rare opportunity.

427
00:20:57,509 --> 00:20:59,040
Hello, I play...

428
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,709
Secretary Hong, who works for Logan.
My name is Kim Jae Hong.

429
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:04,009
Hello, I play Secretary Do,

430
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,120
who works
for Director Cheon Seo Jin.

431
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,419
My name is Kim Do Hyun.

432
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,844
Hello, I play Secretary Cho,
Joo Dan Tae's right-hand man.

433
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,685
My name is Kim Dong Kyu.

434
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:14,759
Your eyes are so sparkly.

435
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:17,084
Your eyes are really shiny.

436
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,594
You look like a little boy
with a beard.

437
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,764
It might sound rude,

438
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,070
- but the thing is,
- I know.

439
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,199
he looks so different in real life.
I'm shocked.

440
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,769
In real life,

441
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:31,870
- you look so innocent.
- You look so kind.

442
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,140
I'm still in my 20s too.

443
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,604
- You are?
- Yes.

444
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,405
(Shocked)

445
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,574
- What's that reaction?
- Your beard...

446
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,018
It's because you beat
older guys a lot.

447
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:44,084
I'm very polite in real life.

448
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,489
- You are.
- That's right.

449
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:48,060
Who's the oldest then?

450
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,284
I was born in 1983.

451
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,489
- Secretary Cho was born...
- I was born in 1994.

452
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:54,354
- I was born in 1992.
- 1992.

453
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,669
But their age doesn't really matter.

454
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:59,969
What matters in the Penthouse is
who has more money and power.

455
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:01,100
- That's right.
- That's what matters.

456
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,300
Who has the most power then?

457
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,109
In the show,
I used to be in the special forces.

458
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,409
It's something I've come up with.

459
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,150
- It's a secret?
- It's a secret.

460
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,705
I'm the only one who knows it.

461
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:14,514
These two have
more powers than I do.

462
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:19,385
I even lose
to Oh Yoon Hee and Bae Ro Na.

463
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,360
I get shoved aside by them.

464
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,659
Sometimes, I wonder if Secretary Do
has any muscular strength.

465
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:25,729
"Muscular strength?"

466
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:27,330
First things first.

467
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,130
We prepared a video that shows
the different work styles you have.

468
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,794
Let's watch it.

469
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:35,499
Excuse me!
You're Logan Lee's secretary, right?

470
00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:36,764
I'm Logan Lee's secretary.

471
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:39,239
(Secretary Hong,
User of cutting-edge technology)

472
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,074
So you really are a special agent.

473
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,080
(Using high-tech devices,)

474
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,580
(he prepares thoroughly in advance.)

475
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,074
Everything is set, sir.

476
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:49,850
(The one who killed Min Seol A
is in here.)

477
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,584
(He successfully threatens
the murder suspects of Min Seol A.)

478
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,090
(He uses even more
advanced equipment.)

479
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,554
- That's incredible.
- The fingerprint.

480
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,800
- It's your biggest accomplishment.
- It was the decisive move.

481
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,165
(He copied
Joo Dan Tae's fingerprint.)

482
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:06,665
You're very proud of it.

483
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:09,540
That's just...
It still makes me proud.

484
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,939
It's your only accomplishment.

485
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:12,040
(He always remains quiet.)

486
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,439
Oh Yoon Hee was also there
on the night...

487
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,004
when the lighting ceremony
took place.

488
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:18,280
(Secretary Hong relies
on high-tech equipment.)

489
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,514
Send this woman out.

490
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,574
- Secretary Do!
- He sent you a bouquet.

491
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,989
- What?
- Out of the blue?

492
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,114
The mood changed completely.

493
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,890
- Find out whom he met.
- Yes, ma'am.

494
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,259
Find where this person is.

495
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:32,689
- Any other information?
- There's none.

496
00:23:32,689 --> 00:23:34,130
I'll make sure to find her
no matter what it takes.

497
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,395
- Find out by all means.
- I will, ma'am.

498
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:38,594
He's like a sunflower.

499
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,840
My gosh.

500
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,965
Are you okay?

501
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:43,509
Why don't you call it a day?

502
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:44,804
You don't seem so well.

503
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,580
It's suddenly became a romance.

504
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,310
You were with me today...

505
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,979
and after that,
you were in the lesson room.

506
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:51,145
He's so cool.

507
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,044
You must pull yourself together.

508
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:54,650
(Because of one woman...)

509
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,979
He looks so cool.

510
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:57,749
This feels completely different.

511
00:23:57,749 --> 00:23:59,050
(He lives another day.)

512
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,254
It's so romantic.

513
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,554
It's amazing.

514
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,620
(Mental and emotional care provider)

515
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,354
(Secretary Do, the man of loyalty)

516
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,225
My goodness.

517
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,600
Secretary Cho, come in. Come in!

518
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,925
- Secretary Cho.
- Yes, sir.

519
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,140
(Secretary Cho, the tough guy)

520
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,435
He's the tough guy.

521
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,094
Move your car.

522
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,769
(From moving his boss's car...)

523
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:19,675
- That's how it all began.
- No.

524
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,405
- Did you take care of it?
- Yes, sir.

525
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,949
You stay right next to Joo Dan Tae.

526
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:27,445
(His specialty is violence.)

527
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:32,514
(He has beaten every man
on the show except for Dan Tae.)

528
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,485
(He is the strongest fighter
in The Penthouse.)

529
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,929
(When it comes to violence,)

530
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:38,485
(he never disappoints.)

531
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:39,759
(But apart from that...)

532
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,458
Why are you telling me that now?

533
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:42,870
She hasn't come back to the cottage.

534
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,330
- What is this?
- It's the perfect song.

535
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,400
Are you an idiot?

536
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,594
Our stock plummeted today.

537
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,235
They definitely said it was taken.

538
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:53,574
You moron.

539
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,145
If you have the time to say that,
get out and look for her!

540
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,009
Who have you been following,
you moron?

541
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,114
My gosh.

542
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,544
- Get out!
- Yes, sir.

543
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,150
That moron.

544
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,584
He's so mean.

545
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:07,955
What is this?

546
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,290
I'm sorry, sir.

547
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:14,254
(Secretary Cho, the violent fighter)

548
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:18,625
(The story of the hidden heroes
begins.)

549
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:23,140
Even though all three of you
are secretaries,

550
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,370
- your work styles totally differ.
- Absolutely.

551
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,540
It was so interesting
to see them next to one another.

552
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,435
A word that's still ringing
in my ears is...

553
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,004
- a "moron".
- A "moron".

554
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:32,550
What did you think?

555
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,749
It's such a shame.

556
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:37,090
Why do I always mess up
when he can easily beat me?

557
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,219
- Just when he is about to flip...
- I tell him about my mistake.

558
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:41,685
You're not so tactful, are you?

559
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,385
It's just that I try
to keep my boss updated.

560
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:45,725
That's a good interpretation.

561
00:25:45,729 --> 00:25:46,860
It's not easy.

562
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,625
- Are you athletic?
- I'm pretty athletic.

563
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,070
You've beaten...

564
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,040
almost every man on the show...

565
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,540
except for Joo Dan Tae.

566
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,935
Yes, I have.

567
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:01,610
Will we get to see Secretary Cho...

568
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,044
beat Joo Dan Tae in season three?

569
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,080
(Well...)

570
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,650
If not, I'd get upset.

571
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,574
That would be Secretary Cho's
last shoot.

572
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,790
But you never know what will happen
in The Penthouse.

573
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,320
Secretary Do's video was
so beautiful and touching.

574
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,084
What did you think?

575
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,900
I'm very satisfied.

576
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,030
- I'd love to get the file.
- Really?

577
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,294
If I was Cheon Seo Jin,

578
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,870
I might have developed feelings
for him.

579
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,840
In the show,

580
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,070
do you have personal feelings
for Cheon Seo Jin?

581
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,979
Not at all.

582
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:35,840
I blame the music.

583
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,009
It's not my intention at all.

584
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:38,409
- It totally gave us the wrong idea.
- Definitely.

585
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:40,415
- I totally got the wrong idea.
- I know.

586
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:43,189
I'm just fond of Ms. Cheon
as a person.

587
00:26:43,189 --> 00:26:44,584
- You admire her.
- Yes.

588
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,860
In the video, when Secretary Hong...

589
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,259
copied the fingerprint,

590
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:51,890
he looked so proud.

591
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,395
As if you really copied it yourself.

592
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,799
With the fingerprint aside,

593
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,800
there's a scene
the viewers think is...

594
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,499
Secretary Hong's
biggest accomplishment.

595
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:02,735
- Okay.
- Can you guess what it is?

596
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:05,640
I have many accomplishments
for sure.

597
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,034
Do you realize
you sound very arrogant?

598
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,449
- He doesn't even try to be humble.
- He looks so arrogant.

599
00:27:10,449 --> 00:27:12,409
I'd guess it's...

600
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:16,150
my contribution to the romance
between Logan and Shim Su Ryeon.

601
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,189
(Oh...)

602
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:19,145
- It's something else.
- Goodness gracious.

603
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,559
It's when you reported to Logan
about Shim Su Ryeon,

604
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,100
- who was disguised as Na Ae Gyo.
- Oh, I see.

605
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,130
Logan told you
you could stop spying on her.

606
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,300
But then you started showing him
pictures slowly, one by one.

607
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,499
That's right.

608
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:38,264
One of the pictures was
of a handbag, which seems random.

609
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:41,975
Some suspected Secretary Hong
is a handbag collector.

610
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:45,975
But I have something shocking
to tell you.

611
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:48,120
This should be in the preview.

612
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,249
Let us decide that.

613
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:52,385
- You're telling us how to edit?
- When we were shooting,

614
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:54,554
the pictures I showed him were...

615
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,159
(Are you...)

616
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,290
(ready...)

617
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,225
(for a shock?)

618
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,499
just green sheets of paper.

619
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:04,530
(Shock loading)

620
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,925
They were just
green sheets of paper.

621
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,169
Seriously?

622
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:08,499
(So this is how variety shows work.)

623
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:11,264
The pictures I was showing him
one by one were sheets of paper.

624
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:15,304
The pictures were edited in
by the CG team...

625
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,405
- That's so interesting.
- afterward.

626
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:20,475
I had no idea there was
a picture of a handbag...

627
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,945
until I watched the show.

628
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:26,014
Secretary Hong, do you really think
this will be in the preview?

629
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,024
Almost every character is
in prison right now.

630
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,794
Doesn't that mean the secretaries
have bigger roles now?

631
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,469
All our bosses are in prison.

632
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:40,135
And we don't even know
if Secretary Hong's boss...

633
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,935
- is still alive.
- Exactly.

634
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:44,965
But I'm sure they'll try to find
a way to get out.

635
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,679
Secretary Hong seems restless.

636
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,509
- He can't stop fidgeting.
- I know.

637
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:51,745
In seasons 1 and 2,
Secretary Hong didn't appear...

638
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:54,215
- as much as the other two.
- That's right.

639
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:57,249
If Logan Lee really disappears...

640
00:28:57,249 --> 00:28:58,985
What are you talking about?

641
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,620
- He's going to cry.
- That's how season two ended.

642
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,225
- Don't make him cry.
- That's why...

643
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,929
if Logan Lee leaves the show...

644
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:08,695
My gosh. That's...

645
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:09,929
(His reaction seems so real.)

646
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:11,925
His reaction feels so genuine.

647
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:14,769
Please don't say that.

648
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:18,239
Of course. I really hope we can
see him in season three too.

649
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,209
There's one important question.

650
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:21,780
Is Secretary Cho...

651
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,245
on Joo Dan Tae's side
or on Yoo Dong Pil's side?

652
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,219
The reason he stays
with Joo Dan Tae...

653
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:29,715
might be related to Yoo Dong Pil.

654
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:31,890
It seems like many people are
taking guesses...

655
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:36,014
after the last scene where I greeted
Yoo Dong Pil outside the prison.

656
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:39,029
I'm very curious too.

657
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,100
I want to know...

658
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,499
Secretary Cho's intention
behind working for Joo Dan Tae...

659
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:43,764
and if he worked for him
from the beginning.

660
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,030
I'm curious.

661
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,635
There's something going on, right?

662
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:49,239
That's my guess.

663
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,169
About Joo Dan Tae's trauma
related to blood,

664
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:53,179
not many people seem to know.

665
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:55,280
On top of that,

666
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,550
he can't stand dirty shoes.

667
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,610
That's right.

668
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,419
If you pay attention to that part
in season three,

669
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,774
I'd be very happy.

670
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:05,245
I think it's time
to ask this question.

671
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:06,584
Earlier...

672
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,419
- What did you do?
- He made a heart.

673
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:09,689
Logan.

674
00:30:09,689 --> 00:30:11,530
Instead of just making a heart,

675
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,199
I'll give you a chance...

676
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:15,459
- to say something properly...
- Oh my.

677
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:16,630
- That sounds good.
- to Logan.

678
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,264
If I get to say something to him...

679
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,100
"Please survive", for example.

680
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,534
Just the thought of Logan
makes me tear up.

681
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Seriously?

682
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,034
- He's acting.
- No.

683
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:28,939
I was so shocked.
He was really tearing up.

684
00:30:28,939 --> 00:30:30,949
- I'm just joking.
- He keeps doing this.

685
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:32,409
Please say something to him.

686
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:34,650
Logan. Logan?

687
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,989
(To Logan)

688
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:40,514
I can't figure out...

689
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:42,860
whether you're alive or dead now.

690
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,959
But I really hope you're alive.

691
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:48,360
If you come back alive
and I get to work for you again,

692
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,429
you can trust
the competent Secretary Hong.

693
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:53,794
I'll take care of everything
for you.

694
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,999
- Hypothetically speaking...
- Okay.

695
00:30:55,999 --> 00:31:00,205
If Logan somehow fails
to come back alive,

696
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:02,380
it seems like Su Ryeon
doesn't have a secretary.

697
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,705
- You'd work for her instead?
- So...

698
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:06,004
Ms. Su Ryeon.

699
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:08,745
I'm a competent man.

700
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:10,550
- I'm a hard worker.
- He's looking for a job.

701
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,689
He'd even work at Ma Ri Sauna.

702
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:13,784
(He can even work at Ma Ri Sauna.)

703
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,919
Right? Even if he doesn't
get the job...

704
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,090
- With a towel around his head.
- We'd love to see you.

705
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,790
It's a women's bathhouse,
so it won't be easy.

706
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,560
I'm ready to do anything.

707
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,199
You should sell
banana-flavored milk or something.

708
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:24,929
- Please stop.
- I'm sorry.

709
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:27,040
I didn't know when to stop.
I apologize.

710
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,439
The more I listen to him,

711
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:30,009
the more it seems like
he's talking to the writer,

712
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:31,909
- You're right.
- Kim Soon Ok.

713
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:34,140
- Soon Ok, we love you.
- We love you.

714
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,610
At the moment, we know nothing
about what's going to happen...

715
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,280
in season three.

716
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,179
We don't know how many episodes...

717
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:41,650
these three will appear in...

718
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,514
or if we'll get to see them at all.

719
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,249
- Secretary Hong sighed so deeply.
- Exactly.

720
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:48,189
Nothing is guaranteed.

721
00:31:48,189 --> 00:31:51,689
So we'd like to give you a chance
to promote yourselves.

722
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm suddenly feeling nervous.

723
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,800
You can do whatever you want.

724
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,769
- Right.
- You can do impressions, dance,

725
00:31:57,769 --> 00:31:59,070
do a monologue...

726
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,370
- A monologue?
- Secretary Hong did mention...

727
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,969
that he has many things to show us.

728
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:07,280
- I have 59.
- But we can't see all 59 of them.

729
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,978
I wasn't planning on doing
all 59 of them.

730
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:11,209
What's the most popular one?

731
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:13,745
It's the radio show, "Cultwo Show".

732
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:16,019
The host is Kim Tae Kyun.

733
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,419
This is how he sounds
when he reads a story.

734
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:19,449
Okay.

735
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:22,090
"Hello. I live in Ilsan..."

736
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,429
- "and work for a company."
- He sounds just like him.

737
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:26,189
"I'm a 39-year-old man..."

738
00:32:26,189 --> 00:32:27,594
Oh, it's a man.

739
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,594
(The details are perfect.)

740
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,925
When it's an older woman, "Hello."

741
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,294
Are you an actor or a comedian?

742
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:38,140
- I can do anything.
- Really?

743
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,239
You're open-minded.

744
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:41,040
Look how open-minded I am.

745
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,774
He's opening his jacket.

746
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,850
I'm sure you've never seen...

747
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,219
- the next one.
- Really?

748
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:49,150
I'll copy Jung Woo Sung's
facial expression.

749
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,749
Jung Woo Sung's facial expression.

750
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:52,150
It's just an impression.

751
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,259
I'm not saying I look like him.

752
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:56,390
The eyes are important.

753
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,530
(Jung Woo Sung loading)

754
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,754
(Complete)

755
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:00,599
(Oh!)

756
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,999
It's his smile.

757
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:04,130
- I've seen it.
- He looks exactly like him.

758
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,969
- I know what it is.
- My gosh.

759
00:33:05,969 --> 00:33:07,534
Goodness.

760
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:09,400
- I know what it is.
- That's incredible.

761
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,669
- That's hilarious.
- You look exactly like him.

762
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:11,739
It's incredible, right?

763
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,840
Once you put on that expression,

764
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,380
you look just like Jung Woo Sung.

765
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,949
- Exactly.
- This feels weird.

766
00:33:16,949 --> 00:33:19,009
His eyes and nose look
exactly like Jung Woo Sung's.

767
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:20,880
I just gave it a try,

768
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,280
and many seemed to love it.

769
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,419
You look just like him.

770
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,449
You're funnier than most comedians.

771
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:26,759
He's so good.

772
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,390
I should work harder.

773
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,790
Would you like to wrap things up
nicely here...

774
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,360
or do you want to try some more?

775
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,560
It's been going well so far.

776
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,800
Hwang Je Seong has already
done this.

777
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,195
It's Lee Kyoung Young singing
"Any Song" by Zico.

778
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:42,340
There's this gesture he always does.

779
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,764
(He starts
with his typical gesture.)

780
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,465
<i>Why are you all so down?</i>

781
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:46,509
(Hilarious)

782
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:48,504
<i>What's the problem? Say something</i>

783
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,650
- That's so funny.
- He's really good.

784
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,880
- That's hilarious.
- Let me try Lee Kyoung Young...

785
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,120
playing Jung Woo Sung's role...

786
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,320
in "A Moment to Remember".

787
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,350
That sounds so funny.

788
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,985
That's an interesting twist.

789
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:04,354
If you drink this,
we go out together.

790
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:07,294
You don't want to drink it?

791
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:09,354
I feel so lonely.

792
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,665
(Hilarious)

793
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,364
- That's it.
- My gosh.

794
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,999
- Oh, my.
- Nice job.

795
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:15,599
He's trying harder toward the end.

796
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,669
- I think that's it.
- That sounds good. It was perfect.

797
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:21,435
(Secretary Hong's self-promotion
ended successfully.)

798
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:24,079
- It's Secretary Do's turn now.
- But...

799
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,979
- Secretary Do...
- This is not good.

800
00:34:25,979 --> 00:34:27,320
You must feel a little pressured.

801
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,150
We had actually decided
on the order.

802
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,419
What was the original order?

803
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:32,050
- He was supposed to go last.
- He was supposed to go last.

804
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,590
It's our mistake. We apologize.

805
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,585
Do better next time.

806
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,090
- Do better next time.
- He's scolding us.

807
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,229
My goodness.

808
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:41,229
Between you two,
who wants to go first?

809
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:42,455
I actually...

810
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,769
was going to do impressions...

811
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:48,999
- of the cast of The Penthouse.
- That sounds great.

812
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:51,340
But after seeing what he did,
I don't dare...

813
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,439
- Don't be like that.
- Come on.

814
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:53,740
<i>Why are you all so down?</i>

815
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,240
Stop it.

816
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,010
Then I'll mix it with beatboxing.

817
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,479
- Okay.
- That sounds great.

818
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:01,745
I'll start with Joo Dan Tae,

819
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,820
and move on to Cheon Seo Jin,

820
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,685
and to Ma Doo Ki.

821
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,415
Sure.

822
00:35:10,729 --> 00:35:12,625
I'm so nervous.

823
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,194
(So far so good)

824
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,995
(Beatboxing)

825
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:26,996
<font color="#0080ff">[Kocowa Ver] SBS 'The Penthouse S03 Special'</font>

<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

826
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,475
What on earth did she see?

827
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:32,804
(His impression of Joo Dan Tae
is a success.)

828
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,484
Oh Yoon Hee?

829
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:39,844
Is it really you?

830
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,559
Oh Yoon Hee?

831
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:42,618
(What am I hearing?)

832
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:44,484
(Back to beatboxing)

833
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,059
Bae Ro Na.

834
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:48,800
- Oh, my.
- He sounds just like him.

835
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,499
You're so cheeky.

836
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:52,324
But I'm your homeroom teacher.

837
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:58,269
- That was amazing.
- My gosh.

838
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:00,209
What was that in the middle?

839
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:01,734
"Oh Yoon Hee?"

840
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,875
- "Is it really you?"
- "Is it really you?"

841
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:06,809
I can imagine him
practicing this at home.

842
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:09,479
- I do.
- He practices beatboxing.

843
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:11,884
Secretary Cho, will you be okay?

844
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,220
You must feel so pressured.

845
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,689
I don't have many things...

846
00:36:16,689 --> 00:36:18,559
- to show you.
- Okay.

847
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,660
But I wanted to do my best.

848
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,999
So I prepared "Rollin'",
which is so popular these days.

849
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:25,070
(Can he be this cute?)

850
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,769
"Rollin'"? That sounds awesome.

851
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:28,835
(Can he be this sexy?)

852
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,209
(The pressure is driving him crazy.)

853
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:33,610
I can't imagine Secretary Cho
dancing to "Rollin'".

854
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,674
(How will the boy with a beard
dance to "Rollin'"?)

855
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,950
I'll just do my best.

856
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,079
- Please enjoy it.
- Of course.

857
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,745
I can't wait to see it.

858
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:49,514
(His facial expression
changes immediately.)

859
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,185
What is this?

860
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,694
Look at his face.

861
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,594
What is going on here?

862
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,264
Oh, my.

863
00:36:58,669 --> 00:37:01,065
(He doesn't miss any move.)

864
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:02,939
(Are you watching?)

865
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:07,605
(This is the tough guy's ray dance.)

866
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,010
(He throws in some fancy steps.)

867
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,375
- Look at that.
- Look at his steps.

868
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,844
(He finishes up with hearts.)

869
00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:20,915
He prepared a lot.

870
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:22,990
Once the song started...

871
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,329
He changed completely.

872
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:26,054
He's a great dancer.

873
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,760
What do I do?

874
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,130
We've had so many
funny moments today.

875
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,999
So many variety shows
will want Secretary Hong...

876
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,169
- as their guest.
- Of course.

877
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,300
- I wish we had more time.
- You'll be seeing Do Yeon a lot.

878
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,939
Why is he doing this?

879
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:39,769
I'm old.

880
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:41,610
Don't sound so sad.

881
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,174
Everyone gets old.

882
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,249
(Laughing)

883
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:45,809
He keeps talking about his age.

884
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:47,450
You're still so young.

885
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,749
- Okay.
- Right?

886
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:52,189
I wish we could talk to them
a bit more.

887
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:53,990
- It was so fun.
- Time went so fast.

888
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,320
Please say something to the viewers.

889
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,059
I'm so happy we got a chance...

890
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:00,430
to meet our viewers
outside the show.

891
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,599
I hope you continue
to enjoy our show.

892
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,229
- We'll do our best.
- Thank you for your support.

893
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:07,039
Show us Jung Woo Sung's smile again.

894
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:08,269
(Jung Woo Sung's smile
one last time)

895
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:10,169
It's addictive. It's dangerous.

896
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:12,039
- I can't get enough.
- Me neither.

897
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,110
We'll look forward...

898
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,634
to seeing the three of them
in season three.

899
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,074
Hi.

900
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:28,554
(The Penthouse kids played a big
part in the show's popularity.)

901
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:34,795
(Here they come!)

902
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,165
(I'll make your dream come true
on your behalf.)

903
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,835
(A natural talent)

904
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,674
(She patiently puts up
with bullying.)

905
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:54,775
(But Bae Ro Na is branded
as a murderer's daughter.)

906
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,145
(Apart from his mean personality,
he is absolutely perfect.)

907
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:06,424
(He changes when he meets
his first love, Ro Na.)

908
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:13,495
(Joo Seok Hoon rebels
against his father.)

909
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:20,304
(She inherited her mother's
obsession with first place.)

910
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:26,574
(Her inadequacy leads
to a mental breakdown.)

911
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,919
(Ha Eun Byeol,
who is forever number two,)

912
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:36,714
(is determined to be number one.)

913
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:41,225
Welcome to your nightmare.

914
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:46,764
(The queen of Cheong A Arts
High School can't stand poverty.)

915
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,134
(On the inside, the soft-hearted
girl misses her mom.)

916
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:54,435
How dare you?

917
00:39:55,579 --> 00:40:01,475
(Joo Seok Kyung, the troublemaker
who is both strong and weak)

918
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:03,019
You have to eat very balanced meals.

919
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:10,014
(The immature boy whose parents
are his biggest strength)

920
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,324
(With his credentials gone, Min Hyuk
starts caring about his parents.)

921
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,935
(The hidden story of the Penthouse
kids begins now.)

922
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:28,410
They're finally here.

923
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,709
If only I could share...

924
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:33,304
- my optic nerves with our viewers.
- I know.

925
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:34,919
Isn't it incredible?

926
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:37,689
- They should see them in real life.
- Exactly.

927
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:39,315
They look even better in real life.

928
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,820
Each of them...

929
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,760
really glows.

930
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,329
It feels different from seeing them
in the show.

931
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:47,030
None of you seem to deny it.

932
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,125
No one says, "That's not true."

933
00:40:48,499 --> 00:40:49,625
- I know.
- "That's not true."

934
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,329
- They all love themselves so much.
- The secretaries...

935
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:53,530
are watching.

936
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,599
By the way,

937
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,169
- you may wonder where Jenny is.
- She's missing.

938
00:40:57,169 --> 00:40:58,709
She has an important performance...

939
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,910
at her school,
not Cheong A Arts High School,

940
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,039
but the one in real life.

941
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,209
That's why she couldn't make it.

942
00:41:04,209 --> 00:41:06,880
I'm sure the five of you
can make up for it.

943
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,780
The Penthouse is extremely popular.

944
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,349
Has anything changed
since the show started airing?

945
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,590
Many things have changed.

946
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,419
But since we have to wear masks,

947
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:19,590
- I can't notice much of it.
- It's the pandemic's fault.

948
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,229
Did you know
the show would be such a hit?

949
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,869
This was my first show,

950
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:25,930
so I couldn't really make
any predictions.

951
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,169
When I read the script,

952
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,240
I was just shocked...

953
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,309
by Seok Kyung's personality.

954
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:33,439
Was this your debut show?

955
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:34,780
Almost.

956
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,034
(It was her first main role.)

957
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:37,139
What are you going to do now?

958
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:38,180
(What?)

959
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,479
What do you mean?

960
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:42,019
- What I mean is...
- Because it became such a hit?

961
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:44,619
Her debut show became
such a big hit.

962
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:45,950
What about you, Min Hyuk?

963
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,519
I knew it was going to be a hit...

964
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,490
as soon as I read the script.

965
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,289
Since the story is so intense,

966
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:53,389
I thought it could add
a little fun...

967
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:54,959
to the dull everyday life.

968
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,755
He sounds like a professor.

969
00:41:57,229 --> 00:41:58,669
"The dull everyday life..."

970
00:41:58,669 --> 00:42:00,869
- "The dull everyday life..."
- He sounds like a professor.

971
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:02,700
But he's always like that.

972
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,110
He's extremely calm in real life.

973
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,304
He's very mature.

974
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:08,205
- Thank you.
- He's a genius.

975
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:10,849
There's something
I really want to ask you.

976
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:13,479
Your parents must be so proud.

977
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:15,150
The people around them...

978
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,550
talk a lot about the show.
It makes my parents very proud.

979
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,619
I think I should try
to be more careful and humble...

980
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,889
at a time like this.

981
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:24,255
She smiles a lot in real life.

982
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:27,160
- She looks completely different.
- In the show, she glares at people.

983
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,729
Even before the cameras
started rolling,

984
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:30,395
she was smiling the whole time.

985
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,769
I wondered if she was seeing things.

986
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:32,829
(Everyone claps their hands.)

987
00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:36,039
She's so lovely.

988
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,369
You do smile a lot.

989
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:40,240
The Hidden Room crew analyzed...

990
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,780
every scene of the Penthouse kids...

991
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,979
in seasons 1 and 2.

992
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,479
Surprisingly,

993
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:47,849
one of them...

994
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:49,880
turned out to be...

995
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,450
extremely materialistic and greedy.

996
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,189
Can you guess who it is?

997
00:42:54,189 --> 00:42:55,220
(Seok Kyung raises her hand.)

998
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,490
Seok Kyung?

999
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,559
- No? I think it's me.
- Seok Kyung.

1000
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,559
If it's among us.

1001
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:01,800
They think it's Seok Kyung.

1002
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,200
- This is so real.
- It's not me?

1003
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,599
I heard that you didn't see
the script for today.

1004
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,669
- That's right.
- That's right.

1005
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:08,240
So they don't know
what we're going to do?

1006
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,639
- They don't.
- We don't.

1007
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:10,869
- We have no idea.
- We don't know.

1008
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:12,970
All of you are going to dance
to "Rollin'" later.

1009
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,880
- No! We didn't hear about that.
- No!

1010
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,808
(Do Yeon's scheme fails.)

1011
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:18,904
I failed.

1012
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,309
Please tell us.

1013
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:22,349
Let's see if it's really Seok Kyung.

1014
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:25,849
The typical materialist
turns out to be...

1015
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:27,220
Bae Ro Na.

1016
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,689
- What?
- Why?

1017
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,990
- It's Ro Na.
- Are you greedy?

1018
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,525
Here's the proof. Let's watch it.

1019
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,959
(Ro Na is full of anger.)

1020
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:38,430
- She's very angry.
- She's angry.

1021
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,094
(Fierce)

1022
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:42,099
(She often rebels against her mom.)

1023
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:43,464
That's right.

1024
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:45,470
It's from season one.

1025
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,804
(The only way
to make her laugh is...)

1026
00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:51,275
(I have presents for you.)

1027
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,680
- She's so cute.
- She's so cute.

1028
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,820
How did you know?

1029
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,714
She can't stop smiling.

1030
00:43:58,019 --> 00:43:59,585
(Excited)

1031
00:43:59,749 --> 00:44:01,919
(She automatically smiles.)

1032
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,154
She couldn't be happier.

1033
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,490
(She also gets irritated easily.)

1034
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:07,995
She gets irritated easily.

1035
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,260
She has mood swings.

1036
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,924
(But presents can calm her down.)

1037
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,395
That's right.

1038
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:15,169
It's very easy to calm her down.

1039
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:16,240
You're right.

1040
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,034
Mom, I'm not dreaming, am I?

1041
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:19,534
I'm proud of you.

1042
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:20,975
(How could you call yourself human?)

1043
00:44:21,209 --> 00:44:22,775
You're disgusting! You creep me out!

1044
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:25,550
- Wait a second.
- She looks so happy.

1045
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,079
You are materialistic.

1046
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:29,475
The editing is so mean.

1047
00:44:29,749 --> 00:44:31,450
Even the song sounds so happy.

1048
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,114
(Her mom used to creep her out.)

1049
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,255
Yes, we're going to live here.

1050
00:44:34,419 --> 00:44:37,990
(Bae Ro Na's capitalistic smile)

1051
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,590
- That was funny.
- It was true.

1052
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,459
The editing is so mean.

1053
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:44,030
(It's the result of our analysis.)

1054
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:47,070
Can you relate to your character?

1055
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,470
Since this is the third season...

1056
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,804
and we've been shooting
for a long time,

1057
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,740
it's easier to relate to Ro Na...

1058
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,634
than my previous characters.

1059
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,709
(Nodding)

1060
00:44:56,709 --> 00:44:58,579
Seok Hoon seems to be
immersed in his role.

1061
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:00,275
(Is he still immersed in his role?)

1062
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,880
Say something.

1063
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,150
- He's even dressed in black.
- He's dressed in black.

1064
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,090
You could've worn a helmet too.

1065
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:08,559
We were told to wear...

1066
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,130
- bright, casual clothes.
- That's right.

1067
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,090
That's why we're wearing
these colorful clothes.

1068
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,360
And he showed up in a black suit.

1069
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,400
I didn't hear that.

1070
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,725
Did you come straight from
the Baeksang Arts Awards?

1071
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:19,525
Exactly.

1072
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,039
How do you get into the role?

1073
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:24,740
You must be more cheerful
in real life.

1074
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,835
I am.

1075
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:27,605
That's it?

1076
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,534
I didn't expect that.

1077
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,249
- I see.
- Okay.

1078
00:45:32,249 --> 00:45:34,180
Another reason for
the popularity of The Penthouse...

1079
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,919
is the perfect acting.

1080
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:38,220
Their excellent acting
definitely contributed...

1081
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,019
to the show's popularity.

1082
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:42,760
But the acting of one of them
was pretty embarrassing.

1083
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,114
Can you guess who it is?

1084
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,130
Is it me?

1085
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,729
I was wondering if it was me.

1086
00:45:46,729 --> 00:45:48,295
Could it be literal?

1087
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:51,065
(Seok Kyung lifts her foot.)

1088
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,300
It must be me.

1089
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,900
- We have proof.
- We do.

1090
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,764
Let's watch it together.

1091
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,039
She used her feet a lot.

1092
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,534
3, 2, 1, 5. 2, 1, 3, 2.

1093
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,110
(That's embarrassing.)

1094
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,680
That's so embarrassing.

1095
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,749
I'm wiggling my toes.

1096
00:46:07,749 --> 00:46:11,090
(I do everything with my feet.)

1097
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,284
- She keeps using her feet.
- She's so charismatic.

1098
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,490
- Look at that.
- She's so cute.

1099
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:15,559
(She moves her foot up and down.)

1100
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:16,559
She looks so cute.

1101
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:18,090
(This is how I act with my foot.)

1102
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,829
With the background music,
she looks so cute.

1103
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:21,995
(Watch this.)

1104
00:46:22,459 --> 00:46:26,099
(Here comes the ultimate
foot acting.)

1105
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:27,995
It must have been so hard
to shoot that scene.

1106
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,740
(This time, she acts
with her entire body.)

1107
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,835
My goodness.

1108
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,139
- That scene...
- That was really...

1109
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:36,404
It was really hard.

1110
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,775
(Stop putting on an act.
You can't fool me.)

1111
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:39,849
Oh, my.

1112
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:43,315
(Seok Kyung's foot acting
gets a thumbs-up.)

1113
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,685
It ended with a thumbs-up.

1114
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:49,019
She can even express emotions
using her feet.

1115
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:50,220
- I know.
- It's incredible.

1116
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,260
Did you try to pay more attention
to your feet?

1117
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,260
It was the director's idea.

1118
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,459
So it wasn't in the script...

1119
00:46:57,459 --> 00:46:58,970
but the director ordered you
to do it?

1120
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,570
Yes. He'd say, "How about
you put your feet up?"

1121
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,099
He wanted me to look
more rebellious.

1122
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:06,240
At first, I was wearing socks.

1123
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,709
And he wanted me to take them off.

1124
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:11,550
So I put nail polish on my toes
a couple of days before.

1125
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,419
The scene where you fall
in the water looks hard.

1126
00:47:14,419 --> 00:47:16,180
It was very cold.

1127
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,550
After I fell in the water,

1128
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,415
Young Dae came in to save me.

1129
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,919
He came in floundering.

1130
00:47:22,919 --> 00:47:24,114
And I slipped.

1131
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:26,625
- I ended up falling too.
- That's right.

1132
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,499
She said, "You should go out."

1133
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:30,200
Seok Hoon is finally getting
out of his role.

1134
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,729
When season three starts,

1135
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:33,669
I'll pay extra attention
to Seok Kyung's feet.

1136
00:47:33,669 --> 00:47:35,900
- Let's see if there's more.
- Did I shoot more?

1137
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,070
Can you act with your feet
right now?

1138
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,209
Please express your emotion
right now.

1139
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:40,709
- Well...
- Show us how you feel.

1140
00:47:40,709 --> 00:47:43,010
No. I don't know what to do.

1141
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,010
(Flapping)

1142
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,079
I did it.

1143
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:46,880
- I did it.
- You did it?

1144
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,180
I'm done.

1145
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,280
Good job.

1146
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,320
- By the way, Do Yeon,
- Yes?

1147
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,389
we should be careful
with what we do and say today.

1148
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:54,990
- You're right.
- There's a secret agent here.

1149
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,490
The secret agent is watching us
even at this moment.

1150
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,694
Can you guess who it is?

1151
00:48:08,466 --> 00:48:11,427
Can you guess who it is?

1152
00:48:11,759 --> 00:48:13,060
- Not really.
- I think this might be hard.

1153
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,394
- Of the five of you...
- I think...

1154
00:48:14,629 --> 00:48:15,700
Maybe not?

1155
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,095
- The secret agent?
- I'm not sure.

1156
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,494
The secret agent is...

1157
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,264
- Joo Seok Hoon.
- I knew it.

1158
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,509
- I got it wrong again.
- Oh, because I'm always watching.

1159
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:25,905
Every time I cause trouble,
he comes running over,

1160
00:48:25,939 --> 00:48:27,339
and screams,

1161
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:28,450
"Joo Seok Kyung!"

1162
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,180
- You shocked the audio director.
- I'm sorry.

1163
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,644
He thought you were quiet.

1164
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:33,649
(Seok Hoon said something
for the first time in 10 minutes.)

1165
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:34,790
I'm sorry.

1166
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:38,160
Let's look at Joo Seok Hoon's
true nature for ourselves,

1167
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,255
after he's infiltrated
The Penthouse.

1168
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:42,989
(Secret Agent, The Hoon Identity)

1169
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:45,430
(Focused)

1170
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:49,264
(Specialty 1, Boxing)

1171
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:51,600
(Specialty 2, Stakeouts
and shadowing people)

1172
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,365
That's right, that happened.

1173
00:48:53,399 --> 00:48:54,934
He was following Ro Na.

1174
00:48:56,609 --> 00:48:57,810
(Specialty 3, Monitoring the enemy)

1175
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,104
- He's right there.
- That's right.

1176
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,640
- Isn't it like "Where's Willy?"
- This is too funny.

1177
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,874
That's so scary.

1178
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:03,649
Watching from above.

1179
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,779
(Embarrassed)

1180
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:07,379
(Specialty 4, Wiretapping)

1181
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:08,715
Wiretapping.

1182
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:11,885
- Isn't that when you saw Ro Na?
- Yes, it is.

1183
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,719
(He is a team leader who is smart
and makes the right decision.)

1184
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:15,460
Leave the group chat
and block this ID.

1185
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,624
And don't tell anyone.

1186
00:49:18,899 --> 00:49:20,000
That's right.

1187
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,230
This part was so dashing.

1188
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,695
(He can carry out his mission
perfectly no matter what.)

1189
00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:25,439
Min Seol A died in Hera Palace.

1190
00:49:25,439 --> 00:49:27,169
(Interrogating the suspect)

1191
00:49:27,169 --> 00:49:28,239
Isn't that right?

1192
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:29,770
(Interrogating the suspect)

1193
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,075
Are your memories back?

1194
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:33,580
Why do I find that so cute?

1195
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,509
(Hostage rescue)

1196
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:36,744
Hostage rescue.

1197
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:41,144
(He figured out the escape route
in advance.)

1198
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:45,084
(He carries out the rescue
secretly and quickly.)

1199
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,529
(The last order from headquarters)

1200
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:50,689
Yes, it's me.

1201
00:49:50,689 --> 00:49:52,060
(The last order from headquarters)

1202
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,255
Tonight?

1203
00:49:53,259 --> 00:49:54,494
He really seems like
a secret agent here.

1204
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,994
I'll wait for you.

1205
00:49:58,339 --> 00:49:59,439
- What's with the song?
- No way.

1206
00:49:59,439 --> 00:50:00,934
(His last mission)

1207
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,310
(The quiet agent who resolutely
carries out his missions)

1208
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,339
He's like a cartoon character.

1209
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:08,945
(The Hoon Identity, Season 3,
coming soon)

1210
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:10,175
My goodness.

1211
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,620
- He wasn't looking for me, I guess.
- The Hoon Identity.

1212
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,719
What did you think?

1213
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,489
First of all, they edited it
so well, which I was happy to see.

1214
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:18,715
(Could this be?)

1215
00:50:18,819 --> 00:50:21,155
It's like he's giving a speech
at an award ceremony.

1216
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,759
I think you've still got your head
in the Baeksang Arts Awards?

1217
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:26,830
(We'll hear the rest of your speech
at the SBS Drama Awards.)

1218
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,569
I'm sure you noticed this too
as we were watching the clip,

1219
00:50:28,569 --> 00:50:31,635
but Seok Hoon acts with his eyes
so well.

1220
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,534
(It can't be, can it?)

1221
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:35,405
- To Do Yeon, could you...
- No, no.

1222
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,135
(He's the only one
having trouble laughing now.)

1223
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,879
- You don't have to.
- The way you look at Ro Na.

1224
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:42,175
Just do it for us once.

1225
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,874
Just pretend it's Ro Na
20 years into the future.

1226
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,945
A lot happened to Ro Na,

1227
00:50:47,049 --> 00:50:48,715
and she suffered a lot
over the years.

1228
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:51,259
1, 2...

1229
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:52,784
(Fidgeting)

1230
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,060
Stop fidgeting.

1231
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,390
(Even the ones watching feel
nervous about it.)

1232
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,200
Now, 1, 2, 3.

1233
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,264
(No...)

1234
00:51:01,469 --> 00:51:02,500
- Three.
- No...

1235
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,899
(Interpretation,
"This is too embarrassing.")

1236
00:51:03,899 --> 00:51:05,064
- Three.
- No...

1237
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,564
(Do Yeon is confused.)

1238
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:08,969
Do Yeon...

1239
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:11,480
- Her heart was racing just now.
- No, I'm sorry.

1240
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,310
(Do Yeon's heart was racing
within 1 second of gazing.)

1241
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,644
I'm sorry, Do Yeon.

1242
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,405
- As for Min Hyuk,
- Yes?

1243
00:51:16,609 --> 00:51:19,850
after watching this clip,
you'll be able to participate...

1244
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:22,615
in season three not as an actor,
but in a different role.

1245
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:25,314
Is it a camera director?

1246
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:27,514
That's right, the cameras.

1247
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,095
Let's confirm if they're right
or wrong in the video.

1248
00:51:32,129 --> 00:51:34,965
(Min Hyuk is in charge of filming,
anytime, anywhere.)

1249
00:51:35,169 --> 00:51:37,270
(That includes
dynamic sports filming,)

1250
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,394
(with live moving shots,)

1251
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,434
(and appropriate close-ups.)

1252
00:51:41,669 --> 00:51:42,870
That's right.

1253
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,879
(He even follows characters'
movements properly.)

1254
00:51:44,879 --> 00:51:47,175
- Even there.
- Even in that tight space.

1255
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:49,474
Quickly, do it now.

1256
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,345
Filming sideways.

1257
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,450
- Drink up, quickly.
- Drink it.

1258
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:54,790
(He can turn horizontally filmed
videos into vertical ones.)

1259
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:55,985
That's so true.

1260
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:57,954
They filmed this well.

1261
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,184
What?

1262
00:51:59,189 --> 00:52:01,985
I'm not the old Min Hyuk.

1263
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,529
(Call me Director Lee from now on.)

1264
00:52:03,529 --> 00:52:05,854
- Director Lee.
- Wow.

1265
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:07,795
Director Lee.

1266
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:12,169
The current camera director
of The Penthouse is nervous.

1267
00:52:12,169 --> 00:52:13,365
(Chuckling)

1268
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:16,305
I'm sure he really is, right?

1269
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:20,075
I know I've said it but
I'm not sure about that.

1270
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,675
He's breaking out
in a cold sweat, even now.

1271
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:24,575
- So he is nervous after all.
- Yes.

1272
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,250
I'm really curious about one
weird detail.

1273
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,845
Do you film with your own phone,
or with a set prop?

1274
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,850
As in, is he really filming?

1275
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,160
Yes, I'm really curious about that.

1276
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,319
I film with a prop.

1277
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,419
But you're really filming?

1278
00:52:33,419 --> 00:52:36,584
Yes, I think they do that
so they can really use the footage.

1279
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:39,354
I end up focusing more on filming
than I do on acting.

1280
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,830
Are your skills getting better?

1281
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:44,834
Yes, because I keep wanting
to make everything look good.

1282
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,635
I'll adjust the angles.
I filmed a lot for Jenny, actually.

1283
00:52:47,939 --> 00:52:50,104
I'd say,
"Your right side looks pretty."

1284
00:52:50,439 --> 00:52:52,235
- Wow.
- That's what I'd end up doing.

1285
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,204
You smell like a pro.

1286
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,879
- At the last interview, Min Hyuk...
- I got a lot of criticism.

1287
00:52:57,879 --> 00:53:00,120
You said that it was hard for you
as a result, right?

1288
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,250
After the last
special episode aired...

1289
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,184
(After The Penthouse 2 Hidden Room,
The Unfinished Story aired.)

1290
00:53:05,259 --> 00:53:09,084
I got a lot of people
showing me their support.

1291
00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:10,925
- That means you acted well.
- That's right.

1292
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,299
Eun Byeol, did you experience
anything similar?

1293
00:53:12,299 --> 00:53:15,600
I had a lot of scenes
where I picked on others,

1294
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,629
so I also got a lot of criticism
for that as well.

1295
00:53:17,629 --> 00:53:20,735
Since I also tend to flip out
on my own, chaotically,

1296
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,865
I think some viewers...

1297
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,704
didn't like that side of me.

1298
00:53:26,939 --> 00:53:29,104
How do you feel when you see that?

1299
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:30,474
Are you disappointed?

1300
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,945
- I'm disappointed, but...
- Are you smiling at negative posts?

1301
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,715
Now we just have Eun Byeol left,

1302
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,454
but it turns out she has
an incredible alter ego.

1303
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,060
Let's find out Eun Byeol's
alter ego in this video.

1304
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,195
Alter ego?

1305
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:49,770
(Ha Eun Byeol is dying.)

1306
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:50,965
That's scary.

1307
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,965
I look like a zombie.

1308
00:53:53,399 --> 00:53:54,469
Oh, gosh.

1309
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:57,534
(In order to save her...)

1310
00:53:57,879 --> 00:53:58,879
Oh, no.

1311
00:53:58,879 --> 00:54:01,350
(Dr. Ha decides to take a gamble.)

1312
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,580
That was shocking.

1313
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,445
(He gives Eun Byeol
a super serum, but...)

1314
00:54:05,919 --> 00:54:07,020
Is she a zombie?

1315
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,615
- A zombie.
- Eun Byeol!

1316
00:54:09,649 --> 00:54:11,719
What's happening?
Did something go wrong?

1317
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:12,960
Do something!

1318
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,784
(The revived Eun Byeol
experiences strange events.)

1319
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,965
(An inexplicable ringing
in her ears)

1320
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,635
(Strange images)

1321
00:54:28,109 --> 00:54:32,480
(Even ghost sightings)

1322
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,739
That sounds like it would be
so miserable.

1323
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:35,075
It's all mine.

1324
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,505
She is sick and tired of ghosts now.

1325
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:42,350
(Eun Byeol decides to become
an exorcist.)

1326
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:43,514
So suddenly?

1327
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,290
Start over with your breathing.

1328
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,319
(Her training began.)

1329
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,025
- She's training to be an exorcist?
- Yes.

1330
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:50,359
(As her exorcism training
starts to come to a close...)

1331
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:51,555
Contract your abs more.

1332
00:54:52,759 --> 00:54:56,525
(She even gains a legendary weapon
in the exorcism world.)

1333
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,839
From the exorcism world.

1334
00:54:58,839 --> 00:55:00,434
(Exorcist Eun Byeol maxes out
her battle points.)

1335
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,609
(She heads to Hera Palace...)

1336
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:03,910
Here we go with the music.

1337
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,735
(where ghosts have been spotted.)

1338
00:55:07,279 --> 00:55:08,379
There.

1339
00:55:08,379 --> 00:55:09,450
But...

1340
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:12,874
(But she's overwhelmed
by the sight of Ro Na's ghost.)

1341
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,750
(Scared to death
by the ghost's singing attack.)

1342
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,584
Ro Na is right there!

1343
00:55:19,089 --> 00:55:21,255
- The attack?
- It's a musical attack.

1344
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,759
(She tries wielding
the legendary weapon.)

1345
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:26,460
Oh, my gosh.

1346
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,529
(It's stronger than she thought.)

1347
00:55:27,529 --> 00:55:29,064
This was honestly a bit scary.

1348
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,394
Oh, no. No!

1349
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:33,469
Eun Byeol!

1350
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:34,664
This is so funny.

1351
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,104
- Here.
- Wow.

1352
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,834
No.

1353
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:39,080
Eun Byeol.

1354
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,575
(Ro Na's ghost finally disappears.)

1355
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:43,945
(Eun Byeol won her meaningful
victory with her own courage.)

1356
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:46,279
(The protector of Hera Palace)

1357
00:55:46,279 --> 00:55:48,049
I'm amazed they managed
to edit it this way.

1358
00:55:48,049 --> 00:55:49,350
Wow.

1359
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:53,215
(She's the exorcist, Ha Eun Byeol.)

1360
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,084
She's an exorcist now.

1361
00:55:56,689 --> 00:55:59,259
We saw this in the clip too,

1362
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:01,770
but you had an unusually large
number of ghost sightings.

1363
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:03,600
Wasn't that hard to film?

1364
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,399
When we film, I see the real Ro Na,
the person,

1365
00:56:07,399 --> 00:56:11,009
but when it airs, there are
bats flying around everywhere.

1366
00:56:11,009 --> 00:56:13,279
- Are you two separated?
- We start out in the same area,

1367
00:56:13,279 --> 00:56:14,480
and Eun Byeol attacks the air,

1368
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,374
and then I'll go in
with a green screen,

1369
00:56:17,609 --> 00:56:18,914
and fly around.

1370
00:56:19,819 --> 00:56:20,819
(Why are you laughing?
It is a green screen.)

1371
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:22,414
She's so cute.

1372
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:23,890
Do you practice
any individual skills?

1373
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:27,184
- Eun Byeol has a ton of them.
- No, I'm not.

1374
00:56:27,189 --> 00:56:30,224
She'll show them to us
while we're on set.

1375
00:56:30,989 --> 00:56:32,730
- Really?
- This is a set too.

1376
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,000
(Show us.)

1377
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,770
I'll do Krusty Krab
from "Spongebob Squarepants."

1378
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:38,770
(It's already funny
before she even tries it.)

1379
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,865
That's so funny. Krusty Krab.

1380
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:43,465
"I love money."

1381
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:46,034
"I love money."

1382
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,509
(They totally love it.)

1383
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:49,879
- That was so cute.
- She did it.

1384
00:56:49,879 --> 00:56:52,379
I've never seen it before
but I get a good sense of it.

1385
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:53,649
That was so cute.

1386
00:56:53,649 --> 00:56:56,790
But as a viewer, the thing
I'm most curious about...

1387
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:00,814
is that in the drama,
your singing is cleaned up...

1388
00:57:00,859 --> 00:57:02,724
before the show airs,
but what is it like in reality?

1389
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,555
Opera?

1390
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,899
- Really?
- I was curious about it.

1391
00:57:06,899 --> 00:57:08,568
Can we hear you sing without
the recording?

1392
00:57:08,569 --> 00:57:10,465
(Sing without any music here?)

1393
00:57:10,569 --> 00:57:12,365
(Frozen for a moment)

1394
00:57:12,439 --> 00:57:14,834
The three of you in the middle...

1395
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,040
had the most scenes like that.

1396
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,204
Let's do it.

1397
00:57:18,279 --> 00:57:19,910
Let's decide the order with
rock paper scissors.

1398
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:21,545
You lose if you don't play,
rock, paper, scissors.

1399
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:22,950
(Ro Na goes last.)

1400
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,974
You lose if you don't play,
rock, paper, scissors.

1401
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,379
(Eun Byeol goes first.)

1402
00:57:27,379 --> 00:57:28,989
I thought you were holding
the Cheong A Art Festival trophy.

1403
00:57:28,989 --> 00:57:30,985
(It's like the results announced
at Cheong A Art Festival.)

1404
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:34,084
What are you going to sing?
The final song?

1405
00:57:34,089 --> 00:57:36,089
The song I sang
in the basement in season one.

1406
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:38,600
- That's great.
- That's a famous scene.

1407
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,960
I'm honored to hear this.

1408
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,200
- That's a lot of pressure.
- Just a moment, please.

1409
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,029
I have to warm up my voice
a little bit for this.

1410
00:57:43,029 --> 00:57:44,735
Of course, go ahead.

1411
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,439
Hee, hee, hee.

1412
00:57:47,439 --> 00:57:49,534
She's really passionate.

1413
00:57:54,439 --> 00:57:57,445
(Making a big effort)

1414
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,175
What was it again?

1415
00:58:00,219 --> 00:58:02,644
(She forgot the lyrics
because she's nervous.)

1416
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:07,914
(Still, she works hard
until the very end.)

1417
00:58:10,489 --> 00:58:12,230
That was so impressive.

1418
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:16,264
- That was great.
- Brava, brava!

1419
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:17,795
Wow.

1420
00:58:18,169 --> 00:58:19,469
You sang so well for us.

1421
00:58:19,469 --> 00:58:21,339
She has so much passion.

1422
00:58:21,339 --> 00:58:23,439
- Seok Kyung, how about you?
- What shall I sing for you?

1423
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:25,710
A song from season one?

1424
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,839
Or season two?

1425
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:27,910
Then from season two.

1426
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:29,974
(She's confident enough to start
without even warming up.)

1427
00:58:31,279 --> 00:58:32,549
- This does make you nervous.
- It does.

1428
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:34,985
- It does make you nervous.
- It's nervewracking.

1429
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,084
(Gesturing to make sure
she stays on the beat)

1430
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:44,894
(Seok Kyung sang this over and over
for the sake of the drama.)

1431
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,854
(Shall we enjoy it for a moment?)

1432
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:57,264
I think that's how it went.

1433
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,334
Brava.

1434
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,680
(Seok Kyung's performance led to
a standing ovation.)

1435
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,104
- Brava.
- Nice.

1436
00:59:04,109 --> 00:59:06,080
I think I forgot the lyrics.

1437
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,980
You were so good.

1438
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,215
It would've been terrible
if we didn't request this.

1439
00:59:10,649 --> 00:59:12,759
You're exactly like Seok Kyung
in the drama.

1440
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:13,960
You're so good at singing this.

1441
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,655
Now we have the grand prize winner.

1442
00:59:15,759 --> 00:59:17,390
(The winner of
the Cheong A Art Festival, Ro Na)

1443
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:19,799
That's right. She won.

1444
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:21,500
- She got the grand prize.
- With genius-like talent.

1445
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,529
In that case,

1446
00:59:23,529 --> 00:59:25,439
I'll sing the song...

1447
00:59:25,439 --> 00:59:26,739
I practiced with my mother,

1448
00:59:26,739 --> 00:59:28,669
when I was applying to Cheong A.

1449
00:59:28,669 --> 00:59:30,235
It's a meaningful song too.

1450
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:42,014
(With the emotions of that time,)

1451
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,890
(Ro Na sings carefully...)

1452
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:48,684
(with her pure voice.)

1453
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,060
(That's a skill worthy
of the grand prize winner.)

1454
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,129
(Thank you.)

1455
00:59:54,129 --> 00:59:55,629
- That was so great.
- At first, I wondered...

1456
00:59:55,629 --> 00:59:57,669
- if this request was all right.
- It was so good.

1457
00:59:57,669 --> 00:59:59,969
- It was so refreshing.
- Thank you so much.

1458
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:03,210
Right now, we've been filming...

1459
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:04,810
- for a few hours.
- Right.

1460
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,609
Do you want to hear something
incredible?

1461
01:00:06,609 --> 01:00:10,374
- What is it?
- We'll now start on season three...

1462
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:12,580
In season three,

1463
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,089
are all five of you
going to become adults?

1464
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:16,314
We don't know.

1465
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,485
You still don't know?

1466
01:00:19,089 --> 01:00:20,089
Really?

1467
01:00:20,089 --> 01:00:21,989
You're all trying not to say a word.

1468
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:24,354
Were you all scolded by the writers?

1469
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,764
I'm sure we'll all be adults
eventually since we're aging.

1470
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:31,230
- What was that?
- That's just...

1471
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,365
exactly what Ha Eun Byeol would say.

1472
01:00:33,439 --> 01:00:34,669
That was so incredible.

1473
01:00:34,669 --> 01:00:37,905
Tell us how you felt
as soon as you saw the script.

1474
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,135
(Gasping)

1475
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,644
- So that was it?
- Really? That was it.

1476
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:45,275
What about you, Eun Byeol?

1477
01:00:45,319 --> 01:00:48,045
(What? Oh, no...)

1478
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,450
- Eun Byeol...
- That's so interesting.

1479
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,954
It makes me want to guess
what will happen.

1480
01:00:52,089 --> 01:00:53,719
What is it?
Why is she reacting like that?

1481
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:55,124
(What does this reaction mean?)

1482
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,825
Did you eat something bad?

1483
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,795
What about Ro Na,
when you saw the script?

1484
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,354
Oh, no.

1485
01:01:01,399 --> 01:01:02,930
- I see.
- I see.

1486
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,239
All three reactions were different.

1487
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:07,600
- Min Hyuk?
- What a headache.

1488
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,939
- A headache.
- I see.

1489
01:01:08,939 --> 01:01:10,410
Last but not least, Seok Hoon.

1490
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,135
For me, as soon as I saw it,

1491
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:14,109
I thought, "Really? Who?"

1492
01:01:14,109 --> 01:01:16,345
- Who?
- Was that too much?

1493
01:01:16,509 --> 01:01:18,144
What is it?

1494
01:01:18,149 --> 01:01:19,480
Because you don't know
what will happen.

1495
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,980
As we watch the show,

1496
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,789
we'll know what those reactions
meant after all.

1497
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:25,160
So this is why Min Hyuk said that,
why Seok Hoon said that.

1498
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,684
But maybe it'll end and we still
won't know why they said that.

1499
01:01:28,089 --> 01:01:29,730
As our expectations
for season three...

1500
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:31,259
continue to grow,

1501
01:01:31,259 --> 01:01:33,859
there's another aspect of the show
that we should focus on.

1502
01:01:33,859 --> 01:01:36,230
There are three more characters
that hold the key to the plot.

1503
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:37,894
Let's meet them through video.

1504
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:45,480
My baby is sleeping so well.

1505
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,839
I love Eun Byeol very much.

1506
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,149
I think of her as my own daughter,

1507
01:01:50,149 --> 01:01:53,814
so if it's for her,
I could make a deal with evil.

1508
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:57,545
(A manic obsession with Eun Byeol,
Jin Bun Hong)

1509
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:00,960
My princess.
I'll be home soon. See you.

1510
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,629
An ally who's of help to his family,

1511
01:02:02,629 --> 01:02:04,060
and an enemy to everyone else.

1512
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:07,095
(His reason for living is family,
Yoo Dong Pil)

1513
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:09,795
I'm excited
because it's been so long.

1514
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:15,040
He is Baek Jun Ki,
but he also may not be.

1515
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,738
A fake that seems real,
the real that seems fake.

1516
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:20,505
(Neither real nor fake, Baek Jun Ki)

1517
01:02:20,879 --> 01:02:25,514
(The actors will introduce these
three critical roles personally.)

1518
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,319
Hello, I'm actor Park Ho San,

1519
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,089
who plays the role of Yoo Dong Pil
in The Penthouse 3.

1520
01:02:31,089 --> 01:02:35,060
I think many people thought of me
as a gangster.

1521
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:38,060
I thought so as well, at first,
but I'm actually very detailed.

1522
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:40,799
I think deeply about things,
and aspire to be a force for good...

1523
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,100
for my family, and the enemy
to those who oppose my family.

1524
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,500
It's understandable,
but not justifiable.

1525
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,739
That's the role I play.

1526
01:02:45,739 --> 01:02:47,600
Hello, I'm actor On Ju Wan,

1527
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,469
playing Baek Jun Ki
on The Penthouse.

1528
01:02:50,469 --> 01:02:52,710
Ki Joon introduced me to the role,

1529
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,839
asking me if I'd like to meet
the writer, Kim Soon Ok.

1530
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:56,680
When we first met,

1531
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,719
the writer told me she'd like
me to play a hero-like role.

1532
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:04,649
But if I listen to the things
people say about the character,

1533
01:03:04,649 --> 01:03:06,060
he's not a hero.

1534
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,989
I heard he was a hero,
so I thought he'd vanquish evil,

1535
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:11,390
like the Avengers do,

1536
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:14,399
but what the director tells me,

1537
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:17,500
and what the rumors tell me,

1538
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,000
- is that he's a villain.
- He's the worst villain ever.

1539
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,200
It's very confusing.

1540
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,104
One side calls him a villain,
and the other a hero.

1541
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:26,180
If I were to provide more hints
that are more helpful,

1542
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:29,505
he's like a fake that seems real,
and the real that seems fake.

1543
01:03:30,609 --> 01:03:32,474
That means...

1544
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,790
he goes back and forth.

1545
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:38,655
Hello, I'm actress Ahn Yeon Hong,

1546
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,629
who plays Jin Bun Hong
in The Penthouse.

1547
01:03:41,629 --> 01:03:45,325
She's a mysterious figure who
doesn't distinguish good from evil.

1548
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,730
That's how they explained
the character to me.

1549
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,930
(Critical Scene, "Hello, sir.")

1550
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,394
Hello, sir.

1551
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:54,839
Secretary Cho is close with me.

1552
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:57,310
He was definitely
one of my people before.

1553
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:00,609
I think that's why he came
to see me when I left prison.

1554
01:04:00,609 --> 01:04:03,350
How their relationship will develop,
only the writer knows that.

1555
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:05,450
The unique thing about
The Penthouse...

1556
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,045
is that no one knows what's coming.

1557
01:04:07,049 --> 01:04:09,450
It's amazing, and fun,

1558
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:12,120
and also makes you despair.
It makes you feel many things.

1559
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,314
It's my first time doing
a drama in this way.

1560
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,930
But that's how much faith
we have in the writer,

1561
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:20,129
and because we've achieved
good results so far,

1562
01:04:20,129 --> 01:04:22,000
our faith in the writer has grown
even more.

1563
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,164
Now, I'm just making sure
I'm faithful to the script.

1564
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,439
My poor thing.

1565
01:04:27,439 --> 01:04:29,805
Call me Mom from now on.

1566
01:04:30,569 --> 01:04:32,140
Call me mom.

1567
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:34,040
Even I grew curious about it,

1568
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,045
as I was acting out my role.

1569
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:40,080
As far as I know,
Logan was the mastermind,

1570
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,489
but why am I changing so much?

1571
01:04:42,489 --> 01:04:43,819
That's what I started thinking,

1572
01:04:43,819 --> 01:04:47,089
and I wondered if I didn't have
some kind of trauma...

1573
01:04:47,089 --> 01:04:48,529
related to children that have caused
this obsession,

1574
01:04:48,529 --> 01:04:51,930
this twisted motherly love.

1575
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,724
To be honest, I'm very curious
about what will happen.

1576
01:04:55,969 --> 01:04:58,540
Can I go have a smoke first?

1577
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,040
Sure, go ahead.

1578
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:05,334
(Critical Scene,
"Can I go have a smoke first?")

1579
01:05:05,439 --> 01:05:09,204
(An unbelievable coincidence?
Or a secret conspiracy?)

1580
01:05:09,509 --> 01:05:12,419
The way I look at it, I still think
there is no relation...

1581
01:05:12,419 --> 01:05:16,020
between Baek Jun Ki
and the exploding car.

1582
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,520
He got out of the car,
leaving his bag,

1583
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,284
gazes at him once,
and then disappears somewhere.

1584
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:24,385
To be honest,

1585
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:27,960
some people could think
I left the bag in there on purpose,

1586
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,730
but if there was a bomb in it,

1587
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:32,040
why didn't airport security
catch it?

1588
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,239
I don't think I'm the one
who tried to kill Logan.

1589
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:37,469
(Are you sure?)

1590
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:40,080
I can't be sure, with this drama.

1591
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,609
I'm sorry, but I just think
he's not related.

1592
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:46,874
(Which character should we
focus on most in season three?)

1593
01:05:46,879 --> 01:05:48,684
I think...

1594
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,549
Jin Bun Hong.

1595
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:52,060
(Jin Bun Hong)

1596
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,219
I think my role is really fun,

1597
01:05:54,219 --> 01:05:55,660
and I think it's set up for
a plot twist coming up.

1598
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,290
You'll be shocked if you watch.

1599
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:00,060
There's something shocking
that's coming soon.

1600
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,629
Because I'm a character
that's been around...

1601
01:06:01,629 --> 01:06:04,000
since season one,

1602
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,370
I know a lot of people have
expectations while watching.

1603
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,469
I do have a certain number
of confirmed scenes.

1604
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:11,164
I'm sure everyone picked
themselves, right?

1605
01:06:12,609 --> 01:06:14,640
I guess I'll pick myself too.

1606
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,180
Jun Ki is a person...

1607
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,480
who knows Joo Dan Tae's past.

1608
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,520
That's his greatest weapon.

1609
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,189
I also think that Dong Pil...

1610
01:06:26,189 --> 01:06:30,129
will side with good,

1611
01:06:30,129 --> 01:06:31,129
in my opinion.

1612
01:06:31,129 --> 01:06:32,899
I think he'll end up being
a just person.

1613
01:06:32,899 --> 01:06:34,730
(Are you sure?)

1614
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:36,399
I told you I can't be sure.

1615
01:06:36,399 --> 01:06:38,270
I don't even know about
my own character.

1616
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:40,135
How can I know anything
about Dong Pil?

1617
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,569
I just think that might happen.

1618
01:06:42,569 --> 01:06:44,469
Jin Bun Hong...

1619
01:06:44,469 --> 01:06:47,980
I've never seen her in person,
not even on set.

1620
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:49,779
I'm not sure if I can say this,

1621
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:53,045
but as a character,
she doesn't seem totally sane.

1622
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:57,219
The way she speaks
reminds me of the movie, "Misery."

1623
01:06:57,219 --> 01:07:01,255
I wonder if that's the kind
of character she is.

1624
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:06,159
Even when he's just standing around,
he looks so dashing.

1625
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,270
Just looking at him is so nice.

1626
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:11,124
It's so satisfying.

1627
01:07:12,399 --> 01:07:15,095
You should've told me that
in advance.

1628
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:19,505
I'm sure she's also beautiful
and kind.

1629
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:22,710
But to speak only about
her character, 100 percent,

1630
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,710
I'm wondering if...

1631
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:26,980
that might not be the case.

1632
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,414
I said that so carefully, but all of
a sudden, after the interview...

1633
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:32,919
Many of the characters in
The Penthouse...

1634
01:07:32,919 --> 01:07:34,589
are curious about me.

1635
01:07:34,589 --> 01:07:37,989
They seem to think of me
as very mysterious.

1636
01:07:37,989 --> 01:07:39,200
I can't tell what she's like.

1637
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,230
She's truly a mystery.

1638
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,925
Do I seem like a psycho?

1639
01:07:44,299 --> 01:07:46,540
Jun Ki's goal is
to get back what's his.

1640
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:47,839
Will he waver?

1641
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,140
That could be money,

1642
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:51,439
and he might waver
due to the temptation.

1643
01:07:51,439 --> 01:07:53,040
I think that's one point
to watch for.

1644
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,204
Jin Bun Hong...

1645
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,149
doesn't have any ambitions
about the penthouse,

1646
01:07:58,149 --> 01:07:59,850
or about money.

1647
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:02,419
But for Eun Byeol, she has a lot
of strong feelings for her only.

1648
01:08:02,419 --> 01:08:03,819
She's always on Eun Byeol's side.

1649
01:08:03,819 --> 01:08:05,620
I really love Eun Byeol.

1650
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,620
I think of her as my own daughter,

1651
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,960
so if it's for her,
I could make a deal...

1652
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,084
with evil.

1653
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:17,525
(But Eun Byeol already has a mom.)

1654
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,894
We need to compete for Eun Byeol.

1655
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,339
I'd like to meet her soon.

1656
01:08:22,339 --> 01:08:23,969
(Onjuwan1211,
Who am I and where am I?)

1657
01:08:23,969 --> 01:08:25,109
(I hope everyone looks forward
to the first episode on June 4.)

1658
01:08:25,109 --> 01:08:30,345
(What does this social media post
mean?)

1659
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:31,975
I really didn't know who I am.

1660
01:08:33,519 --> 01:08:35,649
I'm playing a villain,

1661
01:08:35,649 --> 01:08:37,215
but also filming scenes
where I smile.

1662
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,984
I'm pretending to be nice too.

1663
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,815
It feels like I'm actually playing
three roles at once.

1664
01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:43,355
It's driving me insane.

1665
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:46,899
What I was talking about is this.

1666
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:49,399
What if I'm not the person...

1667
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:51,870
who knows about Joo Dan Tae
and his past after all?

1668
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:55,034
What if everything is a plan?

1669
01:08:55,069 --> 01:08:56,910
That's how far I got.

1670
01:08:56,910 --> 01:09:00,005
I could be Baek Jun Ki,
but also not.

1671
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:01,479
You know what I mean, right?

1672
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:03,910
You can see how much
this is driving me insane.

1673
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:07,114
As a character,
it's a bit confusing,

1674
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:08,580
so I asked Ki Joon for advice.

1675
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:12,154
I heard some secretive stuff,
which went like this.

1676
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,559
What do you think?

1677
01:09:13,559 --> 01:09:14,859
He said he didn't know.

1678
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:15,889
(Consultation with Ki Joon is over.)

1679
01:09:15,889 --> 01:09:17,090
Even Dan Tae didn't know.

1680
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:19,595
I think Ki Joon just gave up.

1681
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:23,765
I think he's the type to focus
just on the scenes...

1682
01:09:24,099 --> 01:09:26,670
he's in each week.

1683
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:29,809
There are still plotlines
that haven't been resolved,

1684
01:09:29,809 --> 01:09:32,574
embedded in the plot
like time bombs.

1685
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:34,540
When will they explode?

1686
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,479
I'm also looking forward to that,

1687
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:38,309
as I continue to prepare
for my own role.

1688
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:41,414
Right now, everything I said,

1689
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:45,045
and everything the other actors
have said so far...

1690
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:48,120
can go in one ear and out the other.

1691
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,130
That's how chaotic
this drama will be, I think.

1692
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:51,830
That's why you can focus
on what happens,

1693
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:54,229
and deduce and predict things
on your own,

1694
01:09:54,229 --> 01:09:55,700
becoming your own detective.

1695
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,739
I believe that way,

1696
01:09:58,739 --> 01:09:59,895
you'll really enjoy
watching the show.

1697
01:10:00,899 --> 01:10:04,135
Which person do you think
deserves the focus of attention?

1698
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:06,410
I just thought of something...

1699
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,505
- about Jin Bun Hong.
- What is it?

1700
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:10,349
Some people thought this
about the character.

1701
01:10:10,349 --> 01:10:13,645
Eun Byeol is being punished
by meeting Jin Bun Hong.

1702
01:10:13,649 --> 01:10:15,215
And?

1703
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:17,815
- And?
- That's all.

1704
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:19,989
Oh, so it wasn't a question
or a response to the question.

1705
01:10:19,989 --> 01:10:21,059
You were just relaying the news.

1706
01:10:21,059 --> 01:10:23,290
I was just sharing what I'd heard.

1707
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:24,630
What about Yoo Dong Pil?

1708
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:27,260
I've met with Dong Pil...

1709
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,970
from time to time.

1710
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:30,399
- Isn't that a big spoiler?
- Is that meaningful?

1711
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,565
That we met?

1712
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,470
You're all making each other
very anxious.

1713
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,795
Why are you doing that to me?

1714
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,505
I'm not allowed to say that part?

1715
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:40,435
The scariest phrase
for all of The Penthouse is this.

1716
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:41,605
"Is it a spoiler?"

1717
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:43,080
Is it not?

1718
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,410
I'm curious why they met,

1719
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:46,380
and what they did in their meetings.

1720
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:49,189
I saw that scene with Jenny's dad,

1721
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:51,450
and went to film something else
in Yangyang right afterward.

1722
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:54,284
I should've greeted him,
but it was too scary.

1723
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,624
So I couldn't greet him after all.

1724
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,124
Is that it? Was that the news?

1725
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:00,559
(Chuckling)

1726
01:11:00,559 --> 01:11:02,095
Please watch the show to see.

1727
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:04,670
If we're just going to find out
everything by watching the show,

1728
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,099
- what's the point of this special?
- You're right.

1729
01:11:06,099 --> 01:11:09,164
- If we just have to watch the show,
- Why bother talking here?

1730
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,370
Now...

1731
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,370
(The time everyone has been
waiting for)

1732
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,410
it's time.

1733
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:14,580
It's no exaggeration to say...

1734
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,210
our entire show will culminate
in this video.

1735
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,849
- None of you have seen it before?
- No.

1736
01:11:18,849 --> 01:11:20,019
I wonder how it turned out.

1737
01:11:20,019 --> 01:11:22,015
I'll introduce it using
a particularly impressive voice.

1738
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,385
Never before seen!

1739
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:25,284
You sound like Kim Kyung Sik.

1740
01:11:25,349 --> 01:11:26,359
(Giggling)

1741
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:27,855
There is a man right here.

1742
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:29,229
That's true.

1743
01:11:29,229 --> 01:11:30,889
- I'll add more gravity.
- All right.

1744
01:11:30,889 --> 01:11:31,989
Never before seen!

1745
01:11:31,989 --> 01:11:34,660
Here is the trailer...

1746
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,824
for The Penthouse 3.

1747
01:11:37,429 --> 01:11:39,700
(The Penthouse 3)

1748
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,095
It's the prison.

1749
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,710
This place is just like Hera Palace.

1750
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:47,580
There's a penthouse
in this prison too.

1751
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,450
A prison penthouse?

1752
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:50,510
It's my dad.

1753
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,149
Don't you dare touch my food!

1754
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:53,220
I'll break you all.

1755
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,345
Wow.

1756
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,315
- Dad...
- You have to eat to live.

1757
01:11:56,989 --> 01:11:58,484
It's not time to give up yet.

1758
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:01,084
Do what makes you happy.

1759
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,260
Logan is dead.

1760
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:04,984
I don't rely on the judgment
of the law anymore.

1761
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,000
Everything I tell you from now on,

1762
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,970
make sure it never gets back
to Su Ryeon.

1763
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,524
To Su Ryeon?

1764
01:12:12,029 --> 01:12:13,840
- What is it?
- So there's a huge secret.

1765
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,965
Dad.

1766
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,569
That person will reveal
Joo Dan Tae's past.

1767
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:20,975
Eun Byeol's guardian is me.

1768
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:23,675
Get rid of them?

1769
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:26,019
If you don't want
to live like a pig,

1770
01:12:26,019 --> 01:12:28,220
you have to pay for your sins
no matter what.

1771
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:29,385
Why did you do that?

1772
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:32,015
- What was that?
- Yes, just now.

1773
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,090
What is it?

1774
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:37,084
- Get out of here.
- Seok Kyung.

1775
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,454
Why are you insisting on dying?

1776
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,055
I'm going to kill you all.

1777
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,300
We have to make him
remember everything.

1778
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,069
He's a total crazy fool.

1779
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:47,164
- Where is he now?
- You think I don't know?

1780
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:50,565
Do you still think
I'm Shim Su Ryeon?

1781
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:54,380
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1782
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:55,874
- Oh, no.
- If you do anything,

1783
01:12:56,849 --> 01:12:58,080
I'll kill you myself.

1784
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,614
(The Penthouse 3 airs
on June 4, 10 p.m.)

1785
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,045
From now on,

1786
01:13:02,689 --> 01:13:04,489
shall we begin in earnest?

1787
01:13:04,489 --> 01:13:06,755
So that wasn't Shim Su Ryeon?

1788
01:13:07,059 --> 01:13:08,559
I was so shocked when I read that
in the script.

1789
01:13:08,559 --> 01:13:09,989
Oh, that line?

1790
01:13:09,989 --> 01:13:11,229
What was that?

1791
01:13:11,229 --> 01:13:12,395
(Rendered speechless)

1792
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:13,859
I got goosebumps.

1793
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:16,095
- That's going to be so much fun.
- They made it so well.

1794
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:18,529
My heart really felt like it was
squeezing the whole time.

1795
01:13:18,529 --> 01:13:21,840
- I can't wait to find out.
- I can't seem to predict...

1796
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,910
what's going to happen
in the middle.

1797
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:24,970
I'm so curious now. Anyway...

1798
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:27,279
From the time this show will air,
the first episode is in two days.

1799
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:29,250
That's right. June 4, Friday,

1800
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:32,274
is when the first episode of
The Penthouse 3, airs.

1801
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:34,220
- That's right.
- We should all watch it then.

1802
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,349
I'm so nervous.

1803
01:13:35,349 --> 01:13:36,920
I hope everyone watches
the show when it first airs.

1804
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,790
Thank you so much for being with us,

1805
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,389
here on The Penthouse 3 Hidden Room,
The Start of the End.

1806
01:13:41,389 --> 01:13:43,189
Any feelings you'd like to share?

1807
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:45,260
We've been working together
for a whole year now.

1808
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,760
Any regrets we have are just
turned into motivation.

1809
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,870
With the desire to have no regrets.

1810
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:51,170
To give our all.

1811
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:53,500
We hope our hard work pays off
even in season three.

1812
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,700
It's like you're making
a birthday wish...

1813
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,034
before blowing out the candles.

1814
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,410
"Please, I want this
for my birthday and..."

1815
01:13:57,410 --> 01:14:01,010
Please show us a lot of love
for season three.

1816
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,744
(Please show The Penthouse 3
a lot of love!)
